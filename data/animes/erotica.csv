To top it all off, a woman calls the apartment asking for ""Kei-chan,"" and at that, Ranmaru loses it.  Hurt by Kei's unfaithful actions, Ranmaru storms off. He spends the day reminiscing about years of precious memories, deciding to put them behind him for good—and when he is ""picked up"" by a woman on the streets, he comes to terms with reality.

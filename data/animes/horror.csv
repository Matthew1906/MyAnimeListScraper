In one story, a woman is tormented by her past sins; in another, a man visits a chilling art exhibit, where things quickly go awry when he ignores the warnings regarding taking photographs. That is not all, though—an unsuspecting woman hears strange noises from her veranda, but when her boyfriend investigates, he receives the shock of his life; a lady receives a frantic call from her sister, who begs her to come to a phone booth, but when she arrives, she realizes that things are not as they appear; and a man looks for one of his belongings in his little sister's room, only to soon discover that a malevolent presence lives there. The Storyteller is all too eager to share these tales, which will no doubt shock and terrify his audience.  [Written by MAL Rewrite]";;Summer 2019;Mondays at 03:13 (JST);

It is the fifth song in the Bookmark of Demise Project. It can be interpreted as an answer song to the four earlier songs in the project, because it contains events from those songs. Events include A-ya playing hide and seek alone, C-ta's murder of A-ya, D-ne's imitation of B-ko, and A-ya and C-ta's childhood memories. After getting a couple words from each participent in the Demise Game, it opens upon the group play Kokkuri-san to summon the Bookmark of Demise.  (Source: Vocaloid Wiki);;;;;

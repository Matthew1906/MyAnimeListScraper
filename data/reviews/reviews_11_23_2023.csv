0;Lupin III: Ai no Da Capo - Fujiko's Unlucky Days;Psycho_Sanji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Psycho_Sanji;8;Da Capo of Love: Fujiko's Unlucky Days (The Columbus Files) is a nice Lupin special.  It starts with Lupin and Fujiko up to their usual shenanigans, until they are bombarded by explosions and things get wild. The story here is that Fujiko has amnesia, and only she knows where the treasure is. And of course, getting Fujiko's memory back is Lupin's top priority.  Lupin is pretty serious a lot of the time in this one, because Fujiko is who he cares about the most. It's always nice to see that kind of emotion from the world's greatest thief. There's plenty of great comedy from the man as well of course. He has a great villain to comedically own here too, the green jacketed laughing madman, Nazaroff.  Jigen and Goemon both get some good stuff here, Goemon is hilariously eccentric in this one. Lupin and Jigen's usual tag-team is put on the backburner in cases like this one though, when a woman needs Lupin's help. Inspector Zenigata pops up from time to time, and while he's used sparingly he does get some good laughs.  The main story does get a little shaky by the end though, involving mad scientists and a crazy world domination plot.  Yuji Ohno gives this a very smooth jazz soundtrack of course, with the appropriate intensity added when needed. The original voice acting from these veterans is great as well. And some fun trivia, Nabeshin of Excel Saga fame directed this special.  All in all, this is a good Lupin adventure, with some nice attention given to Lupin and Fujiko's always interesting relationship. Check this one out.;Recommended

KEEPING THIS HERE FOR AN ARCHIVE] Watched the Columbus files. Kind of a meh movie. I liked the more serious moments lupin had and the usual goemon jigen stupidity. The gimmick of the movie is literally just the cliche main girl character has amnesia and jusy so happens to have seen something important right before losing her memory (COUGH COUGH detective Conan movie Captured in her eyes COUGGGHH) the movies exclusive character/story was also kinda dumb as usual with lupin movies but she was way more girlboss than most others I’ve seen so she gets a plus there This lupin movie gets a very straight cut 7/10.

0;Lupin III: Ai no Da Capo - Fujiko's Unlucky Days;sdde;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sdde;4;"Now I believe I am allowed to say I am a fan of the Lupin III franchise. I love the characters, the comedy, the unrealistic gadgets, the fight sequences, the music, and on occasion the villains.  However, in this particular special left a sour taste in my mouth.The question is; why?  It's hard to think of how they achieved this with the main cast of the show, since I love watching all four of them, but in this only Lupin is used correctly and he can't save it no matter how hard he tries. Seriously, he tries so hard to save something in this special.  *SPOILERS* The opening scene is reassuring enough with a classic game of wit and tease between Lupin and his dear Fujiko-chan after just stealing 'an entire Swiss bank', boggles the mind I know. Obviously there's 1 item Fujiko was after and this is the title mentioned 'Columbus file', which is the only document locating the mystical 'Columbus Egg'. This is where things start to head down hill, literally.  A five second countdown might as well appear on screen the instant Lupin sets his eye on the file, and his hill top mansion is promptly blown to bits. Events transpire which destroy the file, leaving Fujiko (whom apparantly memorised it in the 2 minutes she had it) both as the bad guys' one and only target and missing. Yeah, that's new, but wait it gets even more original! She reappears in the special's leading original charater, Rosaria's, house with amnesia! Oh boy.  Now you know why Fujiko is not Fujiko during this escapade, but lets move away from spoilers and onto the other characters:  Jiigen; the fastest gunslinger in the world, often capable of shooting numerous enemies before they've even reached for their holsters, and he does nothing. Nothing at all. The only memorable things Jiigen does is to have a joke Yaoi scene with Goemon, and drive the escape vehicle! Jiigen's an awesome character and more than capable of kicking ass without anyone's help, but in this he might as well just stay in the car.  Goemon; the ultimate swordmaster, capable of cutting through pretty much anything...wait I stand corrected, make that, absolutely anything. His abilites are completely overused, including the running gag that he's able to hit broken machinery and get it to run. This complaint is opitmised toward the end where he LITERALLY CUTS A TORNADO! I can believe that Goemon has superhuman sword skills, like cutting rock or even entire builings, but the wind?  Zenigata, easily my favourite character of all Lupin II's cast, a comedic gold mine of dogged determination and bad luck. Is completely underused and as result his normally hilarious attempts to capture Lupin are reduced to idiotic annoyances. Moving swiftly on.  Rosaria, one word: coincidence. Her entire motivation and backstory are centred around the Columbus Egg, and then Fujiko, the only possible key to finding the egg shows up in her house. Otherwise she's fairly consistent, but no-one who will be remembered.  Next, in contrast, is someone you will remember (espcially if you watch the Japan version of One Piece) Nazarov. Intially introduced as a disembodied high pitch scratchy voice with an annoying laugh, he is the special's recurring henchman character. And what design & personaily do they go for?... It's just Lupin in his green jacket. Not kidding either; he looks similar, he's just as much of a jackass, pervert and cross dresser. The only difference to Lupin (other than Lupin's charisma and brains) is he has less experience. Even Zenigata mixes them up at the end. Why can't writers understand that cloning your hero and turning the clone evil doesn't necessarily a good villain make? Overall he's just annoying.  Finally at the Boss. He has no name as I recall, but his evil plans involve a made up energy called 'Orgone Energy', which happens to cure heart disease and cancer, and yet, it also controls tornados and turns people into the Hulk. Anime science, ladies & gentlemen, anime science, and believe me that's not all of it. Back to 'The Boss', his motivations intially seem morale until he's revealed to be the pure evil as all head villains must be, but this plot twist is handled poorly and I was left apathetic when I could tell I was supposed to care.  Now, I've gone on and on about what's wrong with this special. So what's right with it?  One, the music. It's Lupin III on top form with another catchy improvised version of the theme and more often than not good music direction within the special.  Two, Lupin. He's used properly and his actions are easily believable as the his own. However, one character, whether be the lead or not, can't save poor overall writing.  Three, the acting. Not any real bad performances, but Nazarov's voice sounds wrong to me when not coming from a psychopathic clown.  Four, the art. Can't complain here.  That's about all I can think of really, there's the odd good joke, but the charm and comedic grace I associate with Lupin III is absent.  In summary of this boring ass (completely bias) rant. The special is not a chore to watch but also it's not an enjoyment. Lupin III can, has and should do better.  Thanks for reading, sdde";Not Recommended
0;Lupin III: $1 Money Wars;Psycho_Sanji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Psycho_Sanji;8;Missed by a Dollar, from 2000, starts off another fun decade of Lupin in style.  Lupin wants a ring that can lead him to yet another legendary treasure, and so does an evil corporation. Meanwhile, we have a subplot where Lupin tries to help the career of an aspiring jazz singer. And, without giving it away, there's a pretty cool twist later on.  That's the basic outline, but like usual it's all the wackiness that ensues that makes this such a great show. Lupin and partner Jigen have some very snappy dialogue in this one. They talk about their guns as metaphors for women, a lot of great exchanges like that.  Fujiko is fantastic as always, she gets to kill a lot more people with machine guns in this than she often does. In general this one is pretty violent, which is a nice change of pace from some of the more lighthearted specials. Crazy people with guns are out to kill the Lupin gang, and this time around it really does feel urgent.  Inspector Zenigata is great in this, as always he's awesomely hilarious when he gets emotional about Lupin. Goemon is solid as ever, though he doesn't have a particularly stand out role here.  This is the last Lupin feature made with traditional cel animation before they switched to digital I believe, and it has a dark gritty look to it. Very cool soundtrack by Yuji Ohno, a bit more suspenseful sounding than usual here.  All in all, this is some very good Lupin action. If you like Lupin III, you should give this one a watch or two.;Recommended

KEEPING THIS HERE FOR AN ARCHIVE] I think this must be like. The fucking third or fourth movie in this franchise set in New York/America and like honestly??? I love the NYC parts a lot. Probably more than any of the other attempts at capturing the city this franchise has tried. Aside from that this movie was actually pretty fun on its own!! Story dragged after they left NYC, but the last quarter was definitely where things got fun again. The plot (ignoring the main one abt the Hitler brooch lupin wanted to steal bc that was just flat out stupid) was really unique and fun as hell. Lupin fighting with a literal business tycoon bank ceo owner girlboss was not one I expected but a welcome surprise. The dub was fucking hilarious too with the zenigata nonsense.

0;Lupin III x McDonald's CMs;_cjessop19_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_cjessop19_;6;If I were Lupin, I would have ordered a Large Chicken McSpicy meal with a large vanilla thickshake and some extra BBQ sauce.  Perhaps that would take me a minute to order over the speaker, but with the McDonalds app, I can order this on the way to McDonalds, or as most Aussies call it - Maccas, and have it ready for pick-up as I arrive. Such convenience. Much wow. More time to eat. Maybe I should ask Morgan Spurlock if he wants to super size his meal?  There's nothing all that special about this 30 second ad. The animation is standard, the theme song for the series quietly playing in the background is great as always, you have the chemistry between Lupin, Goemon and Jigen. I couldn't ask more for a McDonalds advert.  I'm salivating as I'm writing this. God help me.  6/10.;Recommended
0;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Movie;AnimeObasan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeObasan;7;"A fun romp of a movie that starts has Lupin having fun with extravagant robberies, Fujiko in trouble, and Conan and his gang solving mysteries. This movie had me sit up and take notice three minutes in when it did a mock opening sequence for both Lupin and Conan. It is almost word for word from each show, first with Conan narrating an updated Green Jacket style opening and then Lupin doing the same for Conan's standard opening. It's very clever and will grab any fan of either series happy.  STORY: This movie is a direct sequel to the popular Lupin vs. Conan special from 2012. In case you didn't see it, don't worry, this movie has a summary clip in the closing credits. The series will also make you do a double take a few times as it gives tongue in cheek references to Conan characters and more Lupin references (like the Fujiko series and the Gold of Babylon movie) than Green vs. Red.  CHARACTER: Zenigata is given more lines and more personality in this special, but it seems forced. Still, the differences detracted slightly from the movie. Zenigata also has a very pointed line (I really don't know how to word that without giving it away) that seems like it's there for different types of fans. I'm interested to see how they'll translate it when the movie is dubbed. The more I think about it, maybe Zenigata's personality is changed due to the fact that he has a competent partner (a Conan character) in the movie?  As for other characters! Conan and Jigen play off the relationship they had in the first special, and it works out hilariously well. Because Conan can arguably be meant for a younger audience, Jigen and Goemon are less gritty and Fujiko isn't as sexualized. I got a kick out of the Conan kids and how they all worked with the Lupin gang. I thought that with such a large cast it might feel forced, but it didn't at all.  The only issue was the ""flavor of the week"" characters, whose problems I found myself glossing over heavily. The movie does not make you care about them at all, which I think is the problem: the first special was about Lupin and Conan while this one was about Lupin, Conan, and a third party.  ART: You have to understand that these are two different styles of animation. However, the Lupin franchise has done a great job over the years mixing in other styles with their own.  A problem with mixing styles that are so different is that they don't play well together. For example, every time the Conan characters have a scene where they're shown from the side (profile), I couldn't get over the elongated face, almost like an animal's muzzle, and sharply upturned nose. It's easy to move into that world of animation while watching Conan, but when it mixes with the old, long legged Lupin characters grates on the senses. Lupin's characters are long limbed and gritty detailed. Putting these two in the same scenes together doesn't work fantastically. For instance, one of Conan's characters has big, blue eyes. She's talking to Zenigata who does his bow legged walk out of the room. Then the Conan characters are shown from the side and look almost inhuman. So you're left with a dissonance in which you have to force yourself to believe this is the same anime universe.  SOUND: The usual Lupin and Conan cast sounds great! Only problem (to me) is that in an effort to merge the two, they limit the amount of jazz that Lupin fans might be used to hearing.  ENJOYMENT: Very enjoyable! Lupin and his gang over the years have gotten more family friendly and this definitely falls in that vein. I'd describe it as fluffier than many Disney movies. But hey, you want gritty? Go watch the Fujiko series and Jigen movie...";Recommended
1;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Movie;jangofetts;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jangofetts;8;A befitting sequel to the previous crossover, this movie has everything you'd expect from fans of both series. It's always challenging to bring together a mainly shounen Conan series against a more seinen Lupin III, but the movie makers have got the formula right. The plot and execution make up for a movie full of thrill and fun. The Detective Conan cast provides the perfect comic timing and is well complemented by the action packed Lupin III crew.  While distinct from the prequel, watchers are advised to view it or they might otherwise miss out on certain parts. The sheer number of characters in both series allows little screen time for the side characters, but you will definitely have your fill of the protagonists. I look forward to more crossovers between the two series.;Recommended
0;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Movie;EthanWasHere_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EthanWasHere_;6;WOW! This sounded like a hell of a good idea when I first saw the trailer, but after watching it, I feel that it was executed poorly. The story seemed very bland, like your usually detective story but without a good big plot twist, though the music was on point as usual and for the first time in a long while I was blown away by how good some of the voice acting was in some of the scenes, for example the viewing tower scene blew me a way. Though I have one odd knit pick and it is the title of the movie, I feel like it should be called Detective Conan vs Lupin lll as Lupin doesn't appear in very many scenes where as Conan is in most scenes. Also for the fact that Conan is trying to capture Lupin lll whilst Lupin lll kinda doesn't give two hoots about Conan for most of the movie.;Mixed Feelings
1;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Movie;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;5;"This movie has no payoff whatsoever.  I was a Detective Conan fan very briefly a long time ago. Lost interest in the anime. So the VS Detective Conan title was never a selling point for me.  The plot revolves around some super-star. But by the end of the movie you wonder why him and his subplot was even in the movie. A guy trying to steal a macguffin to save his country. This plot reaches a dead end. And a plot involving a sapphire, a plot that essentially gets tossed out to sea.  Fugiko also has a revenge subplot. She gears up with rocket launchers and all sorts of weapons. She has called all of her friends for help. The movie makes it seem like it will be essentially like a ""world war"". Aaaaaaaaaaaand nothing comes of it...There is nothing. Its just setup, after setup, but no payoff.  Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie should have just been a 30 minute Detective Conan episode that Lupin shows up in.  I think Conan fans might enjoy it but not Lupin fans.  For a fun Lupin crossover movie with an actual payoff see Lupin vs Cat's Eyes.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan;dbaranyi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dbaranyi;10;"I just watched the ""Lupin III vs Detective Conan"" special and it was a lot of fun. The writers pulled off the story much better than I expected and all the characters were thoroughly integrated while the various scenes and actions all captured the respective spirits of the two franchises. Even the differences in character designs were well integrated yet all of the characters retained their traditional appearances. To be fair, the story was much more a Conan mystery than a Lupin adventure, but considering that ""Meitantei Conan"" is the series that is still on the air regularly and maintains high ratings, that shouldn't be too surprising.  The overall story was quite convoluted with what appeared at first to be divergent plot lines, but everything came together well thanks to some nicely developed surprises. There was lots of humor in the story, particularly from the Lupin gang, but the Conan gang had some of their usual high jinks too. Since this was a later broadcast than the usual Conan timeslot there was a bit more fan service and more mature remarks, including a reference to Ran's youthful but never-the-less quite ample ""proportions"". But as expected, Fujiko got to show her ""charms"" quite extensively, and as usual Lupin got to drool but not touch.  One of the things that I really liked about the special was that Kogoro got to show some competence. I always feel that it is unfortunate that Kogoro's character is depicted as being so incompetent in the TV series when the overall story line indicates that he isn't an idiot, but only acts like one because of circumstance.  Fans of Lupin III will no doubt enjoy hearing all of the old gang of voice actors at it again, however, everyone's age is coming through pretty strongly in their voices. But Conan fans shouldn't feel too smug, because the voice actors in that series are getting along in years too.  All that aside, the point of a collaboration like this is to let the fans of both series have fun and enjoy a smart, fast paced and intelligently done piece of entertainment. And this special did all of that well. My only regret is that we didn't get to see Fujiko turn her charm on for Detective Takagi - I really wanted to see Takagi explain that to Satou!";Recommended
1;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan;Psycho_Sanji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Psycho_Sanji;8;Lupin III vs Detective Conan is a very cool TV special.  This crossover between the two long running series is done quite well. There's a story involving a princess in danger, who looks just like Ran. Conan is on the case, and meanwhile Lupin wants to take a crown, which he attempted to steal long ago. This involves a nice flashback to Lupin wearing his classic green jacket, so we get both red and green action in this.  The plot is a Detective Conan style murder mystery, and the Lupin gang is added to the mix, bringing their brand of fun. It's a fairly complex plot, but it's goes down smooth.  Fujiko kicks ass in this one, she's on the run with the princess, showing her how to have a good time and protecting her. Very cool, fun stuff.  Jigen is enlisted as a bodyguard and ends up working with Conan, and there are some very hilarious scenes with these two. Lots of snappy dialogue.  Lupin and Conan, they're both doing their thing, they have some action scenes, some fun dialogue moments, and are in fine form here. They have some memorable interactions, very fun stuff.  The other regulars like Goemon, Zenigata, and Kogoro all have some fun moments too, mostly just a good gag here and there. The two casts gelled very well together.  The animation is smooth, and it's pretty interesting how we have two very different kinds of character designs used for Conan and Lupin characters. It could blend together better, but it's still fun to see. The soundtrack is also done by Lupin's usual Yuji Ohno and also the Conan guy, and it's a fun mix of energetic tunes and smooth jazz.  All in all, if you're a fan of Lupin or Conan I'd say you'll enjoy this. It's a fun, very good anime adventure. Check it out.;Recommended
2;Lupin III vs. Detective Conan;Riiakuma;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Riiakuma;10;Love Lupin III? Love Conan? Well this is the perfect movie for you. It combines both elements of Conan and Lupin into one and gives both characters an equal amount of screen time. To be honest I haven’t watched a lot of Conan yet but this did give me a lot more insight into the characters and I understood the film with limited knowledge.  Story 10! Lupin III vs Detective Conan had me laughing so many times. There were scenes were Lupin and Detective Conan had to collaborate and there was plenty of banter between the two. It was really interesting how they incorporated to complete opposites into one film. Lupin, a thief who steals everything vs the good detective working together. It’s definitely a pretty cool storyline and was well done to combine both elements of each anime.  Art 9 ish Well. I’m not one to complain it would be so hard to create a new art style to compliment both Conan and Lupin. Both maintained their own artstyle within the anime. The Conan characters did stick out often due to how the art style is more exaggerated in features like bigger eyes, bigger head ect. It was pretty amazing to see a character like Jigen standing next to someone as small as Conan. It was definitely a big difference haha. They did a good work maintaining those little things and I can understand it would have been hard. So it’s a 9  Sound 10 What can I say? I’m a fan of the Lupin theme. But overall the soundtrack is really nice. Definitely going to give it a listen later  Character 9 I mean. These two series are extremely popular in Japan. They are definitely well made characters to begin with. They definitely didn’t fit all the traits of the usual Lupin and gang and Goemon got very little screen time. But they still did well to maintain Lupin and Jigen’s characters really well so I was happy with that. They definitely gave just as much attention to Conan and his gang. We got to see Ran but not so much what her father is like so I guess it’s just they had to focus on specific characters or else it would just go totally off track. They definitely did well but I do wish Goemon got some more screen time.  Overall it’s really good! There are a few flaws (and I’m one to be quiet generous to both these series) I enjoyed this film. I probably will give it a rewatch. I have a thing for film crossovers so it was such a thrill to see this one.;Recommended

Awesome and so is this movie. Also, this is my 45 review... Do you remember the days, when Conan did not know who Lupin the 3rd is and vice versa?? Ah the good old days, :D As you already understood this movie contain the first encounters of Conan and Lupin as well as his team, Jigen, Sensei, Fujiko... The story is really serious and extraordinary takes us to a fictional country where our little Sherlock Holmes solves a case. Did I mention, Ran has a Doppelgänger? :D This movie has a nice combination of the classic Art of Lupin Franchise and the design of Detective Conan Anime Movies. This Combination really made this movie one of a kind and really enjoyable, as well as seeing what great of team the character, that in usual circumstances would never cooperate, work together just perfectly in Sync. As a result, Fujiko and Conan has a moment, but Shhh do not tell Lupin... I really recommend watching this movie, although there are some aspects, that is easy to predict right from the beginning, nonetheless, the movie keeps you from blinking you want to watch it till the End.;Recommended
0;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;Boltz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Boltz;8;Excellent cross-over! If you love one or the other series (or even both), you'll love this movie! The characters are all there with their humor and crazy action and they work very well together. Lupin dominates a bit with exposition, but we get some heartfelt and long awaited lore extensions with the Cats. The action scenes are wonderfully directed and if you have a 5.1 surround system, the mayhem combined with jazzy music will blow your head off!  Yes, the 3DCG is bad, but it's not that jarring, at least not most of the time. The characters look weird from some angles, but good for the most part. Cat's suits could have been better too, they looked a bit uninspiring. Not necessarily their staple leotards, but Fujiko did look like a bomb, so I don't see a reason to go more modest with the Cats lol.;Recommended
1;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;8;I personally didnt care for the design of Lupin. However i found this cross-over to be very fun. Really showcasing the skills of Lupin but also of Cat's Eye aswell. I havent seen Cat's Eyes since i was a child. So my knowledge of that anime is limited.  The movie has a predictable twist. But a touching and satisfying ending. Lupin truly is the gentleman thief with a heart of gold. It was cool to see the clumsy Toshio Utsumi team up with the skillful and determined Zenigata. Was fun to see them work together. And the Cat's sisters looked sexy in their outfits 🍑;Recommended
2;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;Mohammed_Shawqi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mohammed_Shawqi;8;Interesting production The use of CG animation was interesting, but not very well done. The characters look fine, albeit I was hoping for more shading. Although the animation in general of objects and effects (e.g explosions) were quite ok, the characters animation definitely needed improvement as they looked like robots in some cases. Story wise I enjoyed it albeit the flow of the story was quite expected. Music was good and added value to the production.  I would very much like to see more lupin and cats eye collaborative productions in the future, perhaps even with city hunter? It would be nice if it was more of a movie series every year and then, which I found is needed for such 70s/80s anime to be revived and definitely would be successful due to its market base in Japan and Europe.;Recommended
0;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;jonunderw00d;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jonunderw00d;6;"Before I present my brief review, I have to state clearly that I am only familiar with and mainly concerned with Cat's Eye in this movie, and so most of my review will reflect that. I'll leave the critical review of Lupin III to other reviewers.  Let's start with the most obvious stuff. The CGI is HORRIBLE. It is painful to watch the whole movie at normal speed. For an anime that relies on a whole lot of fast action and motion, the CGI should be handled with utmost care, if CGI was even appropriate at all in the first place. That has not occurred. It is as if you're watching a typical stop claymotion at twice the speed. The only way I personally could enjoy this CGI product is if the movie was sped up at twice (2.0x) the original speed.  Then, the character design of the Cat's Eye trio is so foreign that I could barely recognize them if there was no ""Cat's Eye"" in the movie title. The CGI only made it worse. They look like barbie dolls swinging around Beverly Hills in a typical Totally Spies episode, and even one of those episodes has better animation than the Cat's Eye trio does in this movie. In addition, the 2019 City Hunter movie had short but brief cameo featuring the titular trio in an almost identical fashion but with modern animation. There, they looked better in all possible ways one could imagine a Cat's Eye anime in our present day.  The story itself is not exceptional. It is a typical heist action movie with a small grain of mystical element of treasure hunting sprinkled in. It's not terrible in any way, but it's nothing to write home about either. The only concern I have is that the overall (and I emphasize ""overall"") role of Cat's Eye in this movie has been reduced to nothing but mere stepping stones for Lupin III and gang to shine. Until the very end of the movie, Cat's Eye had everything handed down to them on a silver platter. If you're a Lupin III fan, you may rejoice at Lupin's and his gang's overwhelming appearance, but for one who thinks fondly of Cat's Eye after having finished the whole anime just a few weeks ago, it is rather disappointing to see Cat's Eye constantly overshadowed everywhere they got into action.  I would say that I still enjoyed the movie the first time I watched it, but as the movie concluded, the bitter epiphany began to sink in, especially with regards to Cat's Eye and the trio's involvement in this movie.  If you're looking forward to watching this movie, then try to banish all negative thoughts of CGI anime that might be swirling in your head right now. Oh, and don't expect too much of Cat's Eye in this movie. Do that, and you might just enjoy this movie like any other.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;quickring15;https://myanimelist.net/profile/quickring15;4;"I truly think the creators of ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"" wanted people to like this movie. Combining two classic franchises known for beloved characters, memorable music, and fun action sounds like a love letter for the ages. Unfortunately, no amount of goodwill could have saved it from atrocious animation that brings the entire production down, and a story that deserves it. Whether you're a lover of Lupin or an admirer of Cat's Eye, you have nothing to gain from this -- and an hour and thirty one minutes to lose.  -Story and Characters- Combining these master thieves in one movie is a comfortable fit, but the story that brings them together is shamefully mediocre. The smart writing from previous Lupin outings is unfortunately missing from this by-the-numbers story, leaving it planted in with the worst of the franchise OVAs. Knowing anything about these characters will immediately expose exactly how the plot will go, and the ""vs."" in the title is a paper-thin attempt at conflict that gets thrown in the trash before the halfway mark. When you're making a story like ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"", it's a must to earn the crossover -- to something that celebrates the union of two iconic franchises. Instead, I have never seen a more dumbed-down, one-note version of these characters and their pathetic attempt at a plot. It's a disappointment.  -Art and Sound- Clearly, the animation does not look good in ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"". The models are stiff, action is clunky, and there is a sense of lifelessness that permeates the whole picture. Action figures and statues have more expression than these character models, and honestly that's the worst part. Even in the worst movies, the Lupin gang have always been expressive and filled with personality, but even the actors seem dragged down by their on-screen counterparts. All these actors are veterans of the Japanese voice-over industry, some having played their character for decades, but were chained to animation that sank them like a weight. It's a shame, because the character designs themselves are sharp and fun, and Yuji Ohno's music should be enjoyed on its own without this disaster of a project.  Had ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"" been a traditional 2D animation on par with some of Lupin's recent projects or CG on the level of ""Lupin III The First"" maybe something could be salvaged from this Lupin letdown. As is, this is an embarrassing tribute to the franchises it's trying to celebrate. In the 50 years of Lupin, and 40 of Cat's Eye, this entry should be wiped from history.";Not Recommended
0;Lupin III 3DCG;LovelyTekki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyTekki;8;Honestly, there's not much for story or character because this short is just 2 minutes long. However, it gives us an interesting look into what could have been. As a long-time fan of Lupin III, I admit I hadn't really thought about what a CGI adaptation would be like apart from the various video games about Lupin, but this short beautifully adapts the designs of the characters into 3D.  They look just like they always have without looking uncanny and weird. The animators were selective about what to make more realistic looking, such as Fujiko's hair.  There is no dialogue in this short, just the Lupin III theme, but it tells it's very short, simplistic story without any words. We just follow Lupin for another heist and an action-packed car chase that the series is known for.  The only real bad thing about this short is that it never got made into something else. I would have loved to see a Lupin III movie in this style. It would have been especially interesting to see how the animation team would have adapted some of Lupin's sillier expressions into 3D.;Recommended
0;Lupin III (2015): Italian Game;Heatvault14;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Heatvault14;5;"This is a complicated special to review. Despite giving it a 5 this film is more like a 7 or 8 however it is completely dragged down by one crucial thing. 70mins of the film's 90 minute runtime is comprised of 3 ""Lupin III (2015)"" episodes played entirely in their full. This means that only 20 minutes are actually comprised of new story and animation. And of what is new, most of it is not particularly good and mostly functions to loosely tie the plot of the three episodes together. So the only purpose this film serves is if you haven't already seen the 2015 series and can't be bothered to watch it, which is an incredibly small number of people. If you have already seen the 2015 series, don't bother with this special. And if you haven't, just watch the 2015 series.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lupin III (2015): Italian Game;animeXcaso;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animeXcaso;4;"We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made. It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don't worry, there's still some of it"".  So, what went wrong? The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki's film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie. Yes, they took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time. The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they're completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie.  The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced.  I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching.  In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it. But if you're looking for a fresh tv special I don't recommand it.";Not Recommended

One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like.  The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don't know yet. And, the opening is too long.  Speaking of the character development girl, I don't feel like she actually learned anything because her development was rushed and it felt empty.  The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless.  I don't suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general.";Not Recommended
2;Lupin III (2015): Italian Game;garyborken;https://myanimelist.net/profile/garyborken;4;"What even is this special? Over 70% of the run time is abridged version of the first half of Part 4 aka ""Lupin III (2015)"" Thus the actual original content lack any time to develop and is rushed near the end.  And I have to say, by this point when you say ""Count Cagliostro"" in a Lupin III story, nobody is gonna realize you are referencing the original Arsene Lupin story, everyone's gonna assume you are talking about the one from ""Castle of Cagliostro"", it's already a bad choice and the special also didn't do a job stating that case.  With so little actual run time, how are there even any mystery to the supposed mysterious villain, since this Special is supposed to happen in between Part 4?  There's really not much watching value to this, even though there are some good parts, for one, the train chase scene is pretty good, so much so I'd rather it's its own 20 min or so episode.

0;Lupin III (2015);ChubbyGoat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChubbyGoat;10;Honestly I have never seen any of the previous Lupin the thirds, but I can tell you this anime is absolutely stunning. Something I looked forward to every week, when it was airing.  Story: 9 The anime jumps from its one episode driven story to its overarching italian dream story. I enjoyed every single solo episode, thrilling, exciting, and overall masterpieces for style and the audacity Lupin brings to the table. When Lupin wasn't present, the characters still shined with their own unique personalities. Each episode had a small storyline or mystery to solve, and Lupin pretty much owned the stage every episode he was in. The dream story was rather confusing, and takes away from the other episodes, but it still allowed Lupin to shine through with his character so it only brought the score down to a 9.  Art: 10 The womens' hair, oh my god, the colors are amazing. The animation was smooth. Every character had their own distinct art and distinct identity with the art.  Sound: 10 Everything was on point. The soundtrack was classy and reminiscent of Italy. This 4th blue jacket nailed it.  Character: 10 Although sometimes the characters were bound to a certain emotion. Jigen with fear/nervousness, Goemon for his honor, etc... Those emotions were done spectacularly and when they had episodes centered around them. And Lupin himself brought the whole show together, his entire aura was great for the series as a whole.  Enjoyment: 10 You will be laughing or thinking deeply every moment. I loved probably every second of the anime, and sometimes the clever plot twists made you smile at the end of the day.  Overall: 10 Even if you have not watched the previous 100+ Lupin episodes, this Italian arc is a masterpiece on its own.;Recommended
1;Lupin III (2015);Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;Lupin is like a goldmine of potential when you’re fanatic of adventure. Taking place in the country of Italy with a diverse cultural background, the series invites anyone who is interested in a journey filled with daring risks. I’d like to see this series not just as a revisit of the franchise but also a show that recreates adventure as a whole. Lupin III (also known as Lupin the Third) is a series that is easily recommendable for anyone but those who is interested in adventure will be in for a big treat.  It’s truly like a miracle. The show takes place in the refreshing country of Italy and San Marino. Behind the beautiful mountainous landscapes lies a deeply cultured world ready to be explored. The main protagonist is the titular character, Lupin. Anyone who is familiar with the franchise will recognize him easily although Lupin now has a blue coat to make him look him even more fabulous. Known for his mischievous and lascivious personality, viewers will easily be able to see some of his intentions throughout the show. Of course, there are others that joins him on his adventures such Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, and the new girl Rebecca. While some of these characters will be like a walk down memory lane, Rebecca is a new character that is a tricky pony to get used to.  The first episode establishes a bizarre relationship as Lupin and Rebecca is bounded by marriage. This may come as a bit peculiar as we hardly know anything about Rebecca. Until of course, we learn some of her true intentions. From there, we can dive into Lupin III like an episodic adventure. The structure of the show chronicles Lupin’s life style as he attempts to make daring getaways with his usual thieving habits, attempts to woo Fujiko, or otherwise occasionally helping out others. The show also establishes Lupin as a very crafty individual. What makes him fun to watch is that even though he is a mastermind of innovative stealth tactics, he sometimes lets his own personal agendas and weakness (such as women) get in the way of his goals. This often translates into a twisty scenario that gets much more complicated than it should be. But hey, that’s just the nature of Lupin and what makes him such a fun character to watch.  Despite Lupin’s thieving habits, he is a humble person and does not tolerate injustice. During his adventures, we see that he seeks to punish violent criminals or individuals who truly wishes to inflict harm to society. This makes him somewhat more of a hero but most people in the world sees him as the reputable #1 thief. His relationship with others has a wide range of diversity. The most complicated may be Fujiko as Lupin often finds himself trying to woo her yet she puts him into undesirable circumstances. On the other hand, we got Daisuke Jigen, a man who is loyal to Lupin. Unlike Fujiko, he helps Lupin and often times when he needs it the most. The two shares a bonding relationship while on the road and his skills of driving is invaluable to their missions. Goemen is also an interesting character with his silent presence yet packs a deadly arsenal of techniques with his sword.  Obviously, a show about a thief also has people hunting for them. The most significant character is Zenigata. His obsession to capture Lupin is very entertaining as the two are sometimes locked in a cat-and-mouse game. Think of it like Tom and Jerry but with a lot of more twists. The adventurous structure of the show sometimes pits them together in unlikely circumstances as well that really shows their relationship. I have to admit though, Rebecca is a character that I find hard to adapt with at first. Most people are probably more familiar with Fujiko so introducing Rebecca is somewhat of a risk. Plus, she has a spoiled personality and often hard to please. As time went on, I find more appreciation for Rebecca especially in the later episodes when we see a deeper side of her character. In a way, she is also like Fujiko with her crafty mind and ability to manipulate events in her favor.  A frequent question for fans is whether you can watch this show without any experience of the predecessors. It’s sort of a two-way sort of scenario. On one hand, you can watch it to enjoy this series as a standalone with the Italian adventures. Most episodes are standalone and easy to understand even with some of the background storytelling. On the other hand, you’ll probably get a better experience if you understand the characters better from the previous series. Honestly though, this show can sometimes be so entertaining that you’ll often forget about the story. It’s just that damn fun.  In terms of technical visuals, the show may seem lackluster at first. Don’t let it fool you. The show isn’t designed to look like a Makoto Shinkai-level type of blockbuster. Rather, it retains the classic feel and that’s what Lupin is about. It’s stylistic and very well done. Plus, the characters are designed in ways that feels nostalgic. They still retain what fans may be used to such as Fujiko’s seductive fashion, Goemon’s trademark samurai clothes, or Zenigata’s professionalism. The background and design of Italy is also filled with culture that really gives the adventurous feel. It’s spellbinding just seeing some of the architectural designs that almost makes you feel like you’re there yourself. Add that with the neat action and this show really is something to take home.  Did I mention classic already in this review? Let me mention it again then. The soundtrack is classic. No, not the type of classic like it’s remixed. Rather, it’s refreshing with how this show is done. From the theme songs to the jazz-beat music, this show can easily be put on repeat every episode with the music. Character voice mannerism is also stellar that matches with their performances. I’d often find myself laughing at the humor just because of Lupin’s role and his voice matches perfectly as a thief. That same goes for Fujiko, a woman that defines what manipulation is all about.  The waiting is definitely worth it. Even though the original series debuted many years ago, Lupin III still reminds us why adventure can be so much fun. From the thrilling action to the marvelous character performances, it’s a show that anyone can easily dive into. Rebecca can be a character that some may find irritating at first. However, I’d give it more time as she does get a decent amount of characterization later. While on the way, you’ll see just how bizarre Lupin’s adventure can really get in a world like no other.;Recommended
2;Lupin III (2015);Romi_1432;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Romi_1432;10;Well, where do we start off? Let me just write as much as I can about this gorgeous series. Just before I begin rambling about why this anime is absolutely amazing, I would like to state that I may be a bit bias as this is one of my, if not, favourite anime series.  First of all, comes the story. Its plot being led by Lupin and his team is very unique. It focuses on one main arch, in this case, it'll be Italy. Between each episode is a completely different, new, unique story, while also being linked to the main arch. Furthermore, the mystery and thrill of what and how Lupin finds and steals the treasure is amazingly entertaining and always makes you come back for more.  Second, comes the art style. There isn't much to say about the art style because it's unquestionably beautiful. While being crisp and pleasurable, it mildly keeps the old style that blends perfectly to the genre of the anime, being an adventure, treasure and a bunch more.  To add on, the sound fits perfectly to the 'tone' of the anime. Being a thief anime with the hint of mystery fits consummately with the classical music and beats.  The characterisation in this masterpiece is 'sui generis', meaning unique and individual. To begin with, the members of Lupin gang are all unique in the sense that their attitudes, goal, personality, abilities are highly distinctive. Not only that, but other characters like Rebecca or Mr. Nix are very different and each character has their own backstory with ups and downs.  Overall I will have to give this anime 10/10! Easy score. It's really intriguing to watch and exciting to watch. If you're a mystery and adventure fanatic like me then this anime is a jackpot for you.;Recommended
3;Lupin III (2015);Riiakuma;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Riiakuma;10;Honestly Lupin III is a classic! The storyline and characters are really something. Lupin is a master thief but also a gentleman at heart. The storyline is clever and the endings are always unexpected each episode. Many anime have used Lupin as inspiration, heck Scooby Doo spent ages using Lupin III as inspiration. Lupin III pretty much has all my boxes ticked. Loveable main characters, loveable opposing characters and storylines that will take unexpected turns. Lupin is a huge and important anime in Japan and it should get much more attention outside the homeland. It’s like going back in time and seeing the history of where many anime bloomed after this. Even though this is the 2015 Lupin, it still as the classy style and feel to it.  Honestly just give this show a try. It grows on you and you’ll love all the characters and their unique personalities.;Recommended
4;Lupin III (2015);Daddy-O;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daddy-O;7;"""The Birth of the Cool"" may have occurred with Miles Davis, but in the realm of anime and manga we owe it to Monkey Punch and his bizarre tales of Lupin the Third for laying the foundation of ""Cool.""  I don’t know what it is about recent Lupin III specials and shows, but there’s a strange tendency for the writers to attempt a complex, philosophical plot that feels very out of place with the classic cast of characters that make up the Lupin III franchise. Thinking about it, even decades ago we had plots like this, many specials attempting to delve into the supernatural or sci-fi along with philosophical dialogue. As much as I enjoyed The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, it is extremely guilty of this in the later episodes and it really just feels uncomfortable. That all said, Lupin III is inherently a stupid-fun show and when you don’t try to take the writing seriously you’ll be just fine.  Lupin III Part 4 is full of hit-or-miss episodes. I have to say that the character Rebecca usually contributes to an episode being one of the misses. Another thing about the majority of Lupin III specials and the recent shows; there’s an apparent need from the writers to add a main character that literally no Lupin fan gives a shit about. Usually it’s handled fairly well, like the weird cop kid in The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. He’s a secondary character that doesn’t do any harm to any episodes. However, in Part 4, episodes based almost entirely around this new character Rebecca end up being completely skippable and I happened to fast-forward through a few scenes here and there that I just couldn’t keep watching. I enjoyed her in the finale episode at-least with the “subtle” references to Castle of Cagliostro, but otherwise the show would have benefitted from her being written out early on.  Fortunately, writers still know how to handle the main cast of characters that we all know and love. The episodes that hit are those beautiful heist episodes with the classic setup of Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon going through life-and-death situations to steal some great artifact or defeat some whacky villain while Fujiko shows up at the end to swipe the reward right from Lupin’s grasp. During all this, Zenigata is doing his best to capture the gang or often teaming up with them to capture the “antagonist of the week.” It’s the system that every Lupin fan has to adore, as it is what the entirety of the early Lupin III TV shows consist of.  Overall, this addition to the Lupin III franchise is decent. It’s not nearly as good as The Woman Called Fujiko Mine but it always makes me happy to see the franchise still going strong. This is a show that’s more than forty years old, and Lupin the Third and his gang are still as lovable as ever.";Recommended
5;Lupin III (2015);Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;7;"TL;DR – As good as any entry point into the sprawling Lupin franchise, the fourth TV series should appeal to old fans & new audiences alike. It's not without flaws, but is a lot of fun.  Few characters from what some consider the golden period of children's TV anime (1960s – 1980s) have maintained a presence in pop-culture like Lupin III. Despite this being the first full TV series in over thirty years, a steady stream of films, specials, crossovers & marketing tie-ins have helped keep the world's greatest master thief in the popular conscience.  But while many may know of Lupin & his gang, this latest season likely represents the first opportunity for many, including this reviewer, to see them in action. Seemingly aware of this, this forth series sets out to juggle the potentially conflicting objectives of appealing to a new generation of potential Lupin fans, while giving older fans a reason to watch. Fortunately, it for the most part pulls it off.  The first episode opens to the surprise of many, including Lupins companions Fujiko, Jigen & Goeman, with Lupin's sudden marriage to Rebecca Rossellini, a beautiful but bratty heiress & socialite in San Marino. Of course, the wedding is not what it seems, but the episode is a great (re)introduction to Lupin III, with a fun jewel heist & culminating with detective Zenigata pursuing Lupin over rooftops with all the kinetic, gravity defying energy one could hope for.  It also begins the main story of the series, as Lupin et al find themselves caught up in the mystery surrounding the “Dream of Italy.” The new characters introduced for this series, Rebecca & MI:6 agent Nix, seem fine additions alongside Lupin III's regular characters. Nix is certainly the weaker character, underutilised as well as seemingly being gifted with new, unexplained powers whenever the plot needs it. Rebecca is clearly the newcomer that the writers were most interested in. A spoilt brat who manages not to be as annoying as that character type often is, she soon reveals herself to be a thrill seeker for whom Lupin represents the ultimate prize. For a man who loves all women too much to be tied to just one, that represents a challenge. Their relationship seems to have been seized on as a chance to explore a dynamic that couldn't be done between Lupin & his old flame Fujiko.  As to the “Dream of Italy” itself, in truth it's a bit of a mess. The idea behind it seems to be to take Lupin's quote comparing great thieves to great artists & have him face off against the world's greatest artist in a battle of wits. It certainly has some creative ideas, with a couple of surreal dream episodes, & Lupin & Rebecca make for a fun duo. But by the time Lupin et al are trying to save the world from the clone of a certain historical figure made by MI:6 after they stole the dream research of oh no I've gone cross-eyed.  Luckily, the “Dream of Italy” is easier to watch than to understand the point of & anyway only makes up about half of the episodes of the series. The rest are standalone stories that either focus in more detail on a couple of the characters, or heists that wouldn't fit the tone of the main story. These are arguably the best part of the series, particularly those that focus on or have cameos by older characters. Old Lupin III fans may get the most out of them, but new viewers should enjoy the chance to get to know the characters better & see them in more varied situations. All of the main VA's have voiced their characters previously, so none sound uncomfortable or unsuited to their roles, though for various reasons Kiyoshi Kobayashi (Jigen) is the only one to have been in the last TV series.  It's a little disappointing that the production of this latest series is as uneven as it is. The character designs are nice, though none of the new characters have quite the immediate recognisability of Monkey Punch's original creations. Still, at least they mostly kept the look of the older art style. That might seem like something obvious, but after the horrible mix of bishoenen & beak nosed men in the recent Young Black Jack anime, I wouldn't be surprised if someone on the production committee suggested “modernising” the look of Lupin. The background art is the stand out part of the production, with outdoor scenes in particular looking gorgeous.  The animation quality, though, is mixed. The first episode is great & there are plenty of sequences peppered throughout that look good & are fun to watch. Of particular note is that, while CGI cars are present, the many chases between Lupin & Zenigata all look hand drawn, & much better for it. But on the other hand, especially in the mid-season, quality takes a notable downgrade, though it picks up for the final few episodes. The first episode is, perhaps unfortunately, also the one that best combines Lupin III's characters, setting & style into one package.  Like the art, it's also nice that they kept the music in the style of the old series'. Indeed unlike, for example, the frankly unpleasant version of the Cutie Honey theme song in 2004's Re: Cutie Honey, this series take on the Lupin III theme song stands up well. The OST also has a jazzy vibe that reminds one of classic heist & crime films. For the end credits, rather than just shoving in any old pop song that's looking for a chart boost, or have one of the female VA's do a character song, they went for a sultry jazz number by long time enka singer Sayuri Ishihawa. It all adds up to make each episode that bit more fun to watch.  Sadly, it seems that despite the name recognition, the forth series of Lupin III has been mostly passed over by anime fans. While I can't speak for existing Lupin fans, who may well not find anything that they haven't got from Lupin's many previous appearances, as a newcomer this newest series seemed as easily accessible & enjoyable entry point as one could hope for. Just as the series began with Lupin's gang coming together, the final episode ends with them fading off screen, one at a time, as they once again part ways till their next heist. I'll be looking forward to it.";Recommended
6;Lupin III (2015);whiteflame55;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whiteflame55;8;Overall, I just enjoyed this series a great deal. Not every episode was a banger, but it had more hits than misses. Would have liked to get more episodes focused on Goemon, but at least we got one with a solid look into his background. Nix could have used more development as well. Still, there's a lot to love about the additions to this series. Rebecca is a real spitfire and it's a shame to hear that her role in the story largely stops at this point, especially given the dynamic between her and Fujiko made things interesting. Having MI6 as a central player in the events of the series made for some pretty intense moments, and their distinction from Zenigata introduced additional complexity that livened up the series. The supernatural elements were occasionally convoluted, but in the series proper, they functioned as more intrigue and I think that's where they worked their greatest magic. And Da Vinci's role in this story was a lot of fun to watch. Dude always kept everyone guessing.  But this series wouldn't be Lupin if it didn't thrive on its central cast, and this most definitely did. Zenigata is consistently a pleasure to watch and got several great moments to shine, Lupin makes for an exciting protagonist to watch, and his relationships, particularly with Jigen and Fujiko, are particularly investing. It's not the deepest series, but it's not trying to be, and there's still a lot to dig into as the series goes on. I think this did exceptionally well balancing humor and drama, particularly in a couple of very strong episodes. And it looked gorgeous throughout, with some great animation and fight scenes that were absolutely marvelous.;Recommended
7;Lupin III (2015);Arcaderonin16;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arcaderonin16;10;This anime is a great start for people wanting to get into the Lupin franchise. Lupin the third is a big franchise that has had many iterations since the 1970s. Since I recently finished the lupin franchise I will say I started with the newest or latest lupin being this one. The story is fun and unique. It is about lupin and his gang who steal priceless jewels, treasure, and artifacts. All while avoiding capture by the police. Lupin makes up interesting plans on how to steal specific targets. I watched the english dub for this one.The episodes each have their own unique charm. Some episodes they help out movie stars, soccer players, a teacher and other things too. The soundtrack for the dub was the same music used for the Italian dub. The english dub music is so smooth, chill, relaxing, and fits the atmosphere more so than the Japanese soundtrack for lupin part 4. Lupin part 4 explores new characters and a new love interest that added great dialogue and character development for a reboot of lupin. Lupin brushes with the British MI6.The action is amazing and smooth. The comedy is very good and adds to the characters. The art is enchanting and makes you get absorbed into the art that it gets mesmerizing. Each episode is different and explores different instances. It has a continuous plot that continues throughout the series through some episodes. Many episodes will make you relate in some way with some of the characters. The villains are well thought of and are a breath of fresh air.Not all of the episodes involve Lupin stealing. Some episodes Lupin is the hero or sometimes we get to see what the characters are doing when not doing their job or profession. It is a breath of fresh and will not feel tiresome since you get to explore the characters lives and the beautiful country of Italy. Try this anime out if you like comedy, action, great jazzy cool music, beautiful art, interesting characters, like episodes that involve many themes, and love shipping.It will leave you wanting more and want to explore different instances and side quests apart from the main story. If you like exploration of different moments like helping a soccer player, interacting with a movie star then you will like this.;Recommended
8;Lupin III (2015);Ketamigo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ketamigo;10;"This rendition of Lupin III is the quintessential version of Lupin; its fresh faced, awe inspiring and nostalgic at the same damn time.  It's a perfect version of everything that has come before it, and it's a perfect way for the newcomer to get into the world of Lupin and Co.  At the risk of committing high-treason, I'd say that this is the best Lupin III EVER. Not since ""The Count of Cagliostro"" has Lupin looked, sounded, and flowed so masterfully.  The choice of soundtrack here is as perfect as Cowboy Bebop; it's epic, sly and sexy, and totally purposeful, and never ventures into the area of vapid, horrible j-pop or pop-cultural diarrhea like most modern anime. The intro alone is absolutely hype in the best way possible.  The artwork is both vintage and modern, keeping its hand-drawn appeal while the slick, smooth CGI never rears its ugly head long enough to be noticed. It's direction is that of a sleek heist film- think ""Oceans 11""- mixed with hilarity of ""The blues brothers."" If you noticed that both my references were western, its because Lupin has a distinctly western vibe and attitude, as it always has.  The story line is episodic enough to where you can jump in at almost any point and still enjoy the adventure, but has enough continuity to keep you wanting to watch the gang get into trouble all throughout the beautifully rendered Italian hillsides, cities, and towns.  In total, its a series of sheer brilliance and style, and a total love letter to the franchise as a whole. It's a unique gem amidst an ocean of cliche and pointless anime, and it should be held on a pedestal for all the world to see, and say, ""Yes, I watch Anime, and yes, it is a high art.""";Recommended
9;Lupin III (2015);Euphemius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Euphemius;8;"I'm italian and I'm a lifelong fan of Lupin. It was broadcasted in early afternoon, right after lunch, when I was a kid, and I used to watch it after I came home from school. Like many italian kids of my generation, I grew up with Dragon Ball, the Simpsons and Lupin III. So when Amazon Prime put this on, I was glad I could finally see it. And I had great fun, sure, but I have also some issue.  The italian adventure of Lupin III and his friends starts with a new entry in the team, a girl named Rebecca that marries (sort of) the king of thieves and wants to become one herself. But it won't be so easy, and they will also end up in a series of conspiracies involving MI6, italian history and all sorts of treasures to plunder.  The arts are gorgeous. A thing that never failed to amaze me was the incredible attention to details that the artists of the series had for every single panel. Not only that, but also the colors and the animations were incredible. It was also beautiful to see a lot of hand-drawn animation and not the overaboundance of CGI that we commonly see nowadays. I have nothing against the use of CGI, mind you, it's just that I prefer traditional animations. I find them more ""authentic"", if you get me.  Despite having a plot, the season is mostly made of standalone episodes, with many focusing on single characters of the team. However, I have to say that even these are mostly Lupin-centric, with Goemon, Jigen and Fujiko having not a lot time to shine. Despite this, some episodes are really well made, like the one about the haunted castle. Zenigata is still the best character, having even an episode that is pure bromance. The main villain, whose identity I will not write here, is however one the main flaws of the series. Because he is, well, an historical character who is well known for having done pretty good things in his life, and here he becomes some kind of a super-fascist. Something that made me feel uneasy.  The other thing that I really disliked is the way they used Italy. Aside from showing Rome, Milan and some other monument, most of the series doesn't really use Italy well. Why Lupin never tried, for example, to steal something from the world famous Uffizi Museum in Florence? Why cities like Turin or Naples (aside from a copycat Napoli Football Club appearing) are never mentioned, no less the place of a heist? San Marino is used much better, with the architecture of the city and its monuments being a main point for the plot of the entire series. There are even two episodes that are set in France and Japan, probably because they had no more ideas about how to set episodes in the Beautiful Country.  But aside from that, I can't say I didn't have fun. Aside from an episode or two (especially the one with the zombies in Venice), most of the series was incredibly satisfying to watch. So, it's definitely recommended.";Recommended

The story is alright but I feel it doesn't hold me enough to really gain my attention. Like the stuff they do is interesting and everything, but idk I just feel like it isn't able to keep me like maybe they don't build up the stuff enough or something. I just feel the story is pretty meh, not good, not bad. Art is fine I'm personally not a huge fan of how it looks but it's acceptable I'm not really bothered by it, the sound is fine not much to really say about that. The characters are pretty decent I feel they are all pretty distinct and likable in their own ways I like how they all have their different roles to play, but I will say that none of the characters really wow me like they are good just kinda good and not above that. In terms of overall quality, id says this show is like a 6 just because I think the story is good enough to be around there and the characters are pretty decent so I really don't feel bad about saying this. In my personally liking this show id give it like a 5, like I said I like the story and characters well enough but there was just nothing here that really made me love this show it was just kinda average for me.;Mixed Feelings
0;Lupin III (2015);Inuyoujo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Inuyoujo;3;"To open up, this is very different from any other Lupin thing you'll see. I mean that in more bad ways, than good.  They turned Lupin into a know it all that never messes up and can save everyone. There's an unneeded love story with the overblown side character, that doesn't even get that much explained development. She gets some development but there's too much of her that's let in absurdity at the end for it to make sense. She didn't really get any better but it's like she acted like some of the stuff was ok.  Lupin out-shined the other characters, for the most part. Everything about what he was doing got more detail than what the other characters where doing. Jigen and Goemon got there own spots. Jigen's was cool, relevant, what you would expect from Jigen. Goemon's was about a girl, and it was weird but ok. You know Goemon falling in love with every women he meets.  Fujiko is the unfortunate case where her spot couldn't be about how cool and skilled she is. It was about how reckless and haphazard she is. She's cool sometimes, but most of the time she only gets away with stuff because she didn't die. It was about Lupin, and how ""in-love"" they are, even though Fujiko and Lupin's relationship isn't even like that outside of words. We've been looking at these people for a love enough time to know they aren't in love with each other, but they really tried to force that non-existence bond down our throats in this one. They clearly have bond, but it's not that and it shouldn't have to be.  Can't forget those homophobic undertones in a few spots. No one has more homophobic undertones surrounding them than post 80s Fujiko. They still do that ""bond between men and women"" stuff, which is not only homophobic but can also be considered transphobic. There's also no gay/ trans characters. What's the point of redoing a series to be modern when your storytelling and character designing to still stuck in the heterocentric 70s?  And, I got sick of Italy. In a series, I expect the group to travel, get into all kinds of messes, and all that jolly goodness I've had up until now. This story had narrow plots for very un-narrow characters. With Lupin outshining everyone it wasn't about the team being together, either. I didn't get anything I usually watch Lupin for. I like Lupin goofying up and being in danger. I like it when the others have to save Lupin. I love it when the other characters shine and show off! I love it when character development women ACTUALLY gets character development! I love random travel and adventures! This was a huge disappointment for me!  The only character that didn't disappoint me was Zenigata! He actually surprised me a lot! He hasn't changed at all and I love that they didn't ruin him! I enjoyed going into Zeni's feelings about Lupin and getting to know him as a great cook!  This series also had villains and ended on a central villain that was weird. The central villain in a Lupin series was some boring, lazy storytelling. They tried really hard to make it good, but it only took Lupin the defeat it, with no help from the others, which was also boring.  At the end, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. Not just for the homophobic undertones, but lackluster character usage and boring storytelling, with characters that are suppose to be WAY MORE exciting and fast paced.";Not Recommended
1;Lupin III (2015);ojmendez;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ojmendez;3;What starts off as a promising first episode with Lupin getting married to a Italian heiress Rebecca Rossellini.  Ends up being a really lackluster series. The second and third episodes are so boring! After that the episodes are good to average but they never reach the potential of being great or Excellent. The plots are uninspired. I got tired that there was always a twist in the episodes. The show thinks it's clever but it's not. When I got to the last half of the show I just stop caring and want to finish the show. The tone is too serious there's barely any humor. It's like they were influenced by the serious tone from The Woman called Fujiko Mine. But even the Fujiko Mine series had it's moments of humor. There's barely any action and when there is action It's done lazy. Other then some stand out moments in the fighting animation with Nix. The Villain doesn't become the villain until the last two episodes  There's nothing exciting about part 4. It's a dull part for the franchise. For a franchise that's is known for its goofy gags, violence and adult themes this is so tame. After watching This I don't see any Lupin series passing part 4.;Not Recommended
0;Lupin III;FOXHOUNDER1014;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FOXHOUNDER1014;9;"Like most fans of Lupin III, my first experience with the titular thief was with Hayao Miyazaki’s debut film “The Castle of Cagliostro.” It was simply a masterpiece with great action scenes, likeable characters, a heartwarming story, and excellent pacing. I consider Cagliostro to be one of the finest adventure films (animated or live-action) ever created and stands on my personal list of top movies. Anxious for more, I looked into the series and was amazed at how deep and spreading the franchise’s roots were. Lupin III is perhaps the most well-known and popular anime character of all time in Japan. There have been various manga series, three television shows, one live-action movie, five animated films, various other animations, and yearly television specials that remain popular with the Japanese masses. Unfortunately, Lupin never really got firm foothold of international markets. While the likes of Goku and Pikachu are known worldwide, our green (or red or pink) jacketed thief still struggles to gain popularity outside of Japan to this very day. Despite this, Lupin III still manages to have a small, but loyal cult following. For those of you that don’t about Lupin, here’s a little backstory.  The origins of Lupin III can be traced back to the early 20th century works of French writer, Maurice Leblanc. Essentially opposite of detective Sherlock Holmes, Leblanc created a gentlemen thief named Arsène Lupin. Like his title suggests, Lupin was thief, but a gentlemen in nature. He would always “politely” leave notes to the police indicating where and when he would steal something, but would always escape their grasp. His goal was really not to steal, but to live life on a dangerous edge and to savor every moment of the chase. Old Arsène enjoyed considerable popularity in his days and has a long-running franchise to him as well. Fast forward all the way to 1967. Professional manga artist Kazuhiko Katō was “discovered” buy a magazine company who was interested in his work. He was hired, and his boss at the time suggested the pen name “Monkey Punch.” The origins of that name aren’t exactly clear, but some speculate that it came from the ape-like look of some of Katō’s characters. Nevertheless, he wasn’t too fond of the name but chose it anyways since he was only attached to a three month project. The project? A comedic manga series that parodied Arsène Lupin’s many exploits. It starred the grandson of the thief with him and his gang going on many adventures throughout the series. The art was rugged and abstract, the humor was vulgar, and it was a huge hit.  Following the success of the manga, Lupin III was soon picked up for anime form in 1969 by TMS Entertainment and Toho. Virtually unknown director Masaaki Ōsumi was hired to craft a short pilot film that introduced Lupin and his gang. The pilot was highly controversial at the time to say the least. The realistic violence and adult themes simply didn’t fly well with the companies, so the project never saw distribution. Two versions were produced: a 16:9 CinemaScope version intended for theatrical release and a 4:3 version meant for television. Despite the failure of the pilot, Lupin III was still picked up for a 26 episode television series. On October 24, 1971, anime history was made.  For the first time ever, here was an anime series intended for adults and not just kids. Some episodes were loose adaptions of certain manga chapters, but most were original stories. Like the pilot film before it, the show had realistic looking guns and vehicles, violence, and darker plotlines. It seemed, though, that the Japanese animation industry wasn’t ready for such material. Initially, Masaaki Ōsumi directed the first few episodes. They were dark and gritty, with mature themes and sensibilities. Because of this, the show failed to gather the ratings it needed and Ōsumi was fired because he refused to change the tone. This is when Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata joined the show. You heard right, THAT Miyazaki and Takahata. Two of the most revered Japanese anime directors who brought us masterworks like Spirited Away and Grave of the Fireflies got their start on this show. When they did, everything changed. Now Lupin III was given more humor and the episodes noticeably became more family friendly. The show can be divided into three parts. The first eight or so episodes by Ōsumi are serious in tone. Sure there’s the occasional dry humor, but there’s gun fights and fan service shots aplenty here (though it could probably be considered as quite tame by today’s standards). The next section is the transition period. Here we see Lupin III slowly change from the dark nature and into more lightheartedness. By the time we reach the final portion, the show is now comedic and full of laughs, almost the polar opposite of how the show started out. The episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata are what the set the standard for the franchise to this very day, with the exception of the adult-themed Mystery of Mamo movie and recent Fujiko Mine series. This show as a whole never really had a set path or direction. Since this is the first ever show for the franchise, it feels very experimental at times and has many changes in tone and quality. Despite these changes, the ratings remained poor and the show was cancelled after only 23 episodes.  The basic premise is that master thief Lupin III (now sporting a green jacket unlike the red of his manga counterpart) is always trying to steal; whether its money, jewels, or treasure. I think that his character would best be described if you took the coolness of James Bond, the adventurous nature of Indiana Jones, and the niceness of Tintin; and put it all together. Lupin will always try to steal things, but he’s never without honor. Along the way, he’ll help anyone in need, won’t kill without reason, and he’s fiercely loyal to his friends. Speaking of which, Lupin is joined by a colorful cast of characters that represent his gang. There’s Daisuke Jigen, Lupin’s most trusted ally who’s a quick split-second gunman and Fujiko Mine, a seductive women whom Lupin is infatuated with. Because of this, he’s easily tricked or swindled by her. Early on in the series, he’s joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, descendant of the legendary Japanese samurai who actually existed in real history. Goemon has a blade that can cut just about anything, and seems to want to help Lupin just as much as he wants to kill him. The gang is constantly chased by Tokyo Metropolitan Police Inspector Koichi Zenigata, supposedly the descendant of fictional detective Zenigata Heiji. His only goal in life is to capture Lupin. He always fails, but that’s perhaps for the best. Throughout the series, Zenigata has actually captured Lupin on occasion; but quickly realizes that he has no other purpose in life. Later on in the franchise, it’s clear that Lupin and Zenigata both respect each other even if they’re constantly at odds. The ideas are always fresh and exciting, with little repetition between episodes. It really amazes that, even after 45 years, this series is still going with new ideas.  I haven’t even talked about the excellent voice actors yet. Lupin is played by Yasuo Yamada, a veteran seiyuu who voiced him for the rest of his life before his unfortunate death in 1995. Yamada brings out the perfect traits in Lupin. He’s cocky, suave, hard-boiled, classy, and even emotional all at the same time. Make no mistake, Yamada is the definitive voice of the character and no one else could have brought Lupin to life besides him. Yes, there have been other actors in the role of Lupin and they all do a fine job, but Yamada will be the one who’ll always be the most famous and well known. The tough and gruff Jigen is portrayed by Kiyoshi Kobayashi, historically known for playing the character in every single Lupin related animation with the exception of the 1987 OVA, “The Fuma Conspiracy,” where the entire cast was briefly replaced. It’s really impressive that this guy still voices him after all these years and he shows no signs of slowing down. Death Note fans might recognize Kobayashi as the voice of Watari. Fujiko’s seiyuu is Yukiko Nikaido, a talented actress who plays the femme fatale as a crafty and cunning woman who knows how to get what she wants. She would later be replaced by the more well-known Eiko Masuyama who has an equally impressive track record like Kobayashi. Masuyama, however, retired from the role in 2010. The no-nonsense samurai of few words, Goemon is voiced by Chikao Ōtsuka who some may know from One Piece and Dragon Ball. He is the father of Akio Ōtsuka of Metal Gear fame. Last but not least, we have Gorō Naya who plays Zenigata. Honestly, Zenigata’s over-the-top and hilarious performances are a joy to watch. He gives off all the right emotions and feelings that this character evokes. Unfortunately, Naya died only very recently (as of this writing), at the age of 83. Both Yamada and Naya will be sorely missed, but their legacy left behind will never be forgotten.  I’ve talked about the characters, but what of the animation? At first glance, Lupin III seems primitive in its art style. But you know what? I like this kind of look. For the time, this was the highest quality animation available for television. Although it certainly shows its age, colors are still vibrant and sharp with the simplistic backgrounds nice as well. Characters move fluidly enough and action scenes play out nicely, but it’s obvious that some cheap tricks are used here and there. It doesn’t have the same thin cartoonish look as the second series, nor the gorgeous animation of Cagliostro, but I’m sure that most people will be satisfied with what they see. The audio side of things is more of a mixed bag. The main theme is a simplistic repetition of “Lupin the Third” sung in various tones. It may be basic, but just like the Batman theme, it’s pretty damn catchy. The ending theme is a more melancholic and bittersweet Japanese vocal song. These were all sung by Charlie Kosei, who does a pretty good job singing in both Japanese and English with excellent pronunciation. Although Kosei hasn’t been doing much recently, he contributed a song to the popular PlayStation 2 game Katamari Damacy. Within the series, there’s also background music by Takeo Yamashita. The themes are pretty basic to say the least, and there’s really not anything special, but it does the job when it needs too. For an amazing Lupin III soundtrack, check out the work of Yuji Ohno. He composed excellent jazz themes from the second series onward, and his addictive Lupin III main theme is still playing in my head even now.  Exactly where can you get this series? If you live in Japan, it’s readily available on DVD and Blu-ray. Recently, though, North American anime distribution company Discotek Media released the entire series on Region 1 DVD for the very first time ever. This set boasts a brand new high quality video transfer, extensive liner notes on each episode, essays, song lyrics, a complete vehicle list, a complete weapons list, commentary on key episodes by Lupin fans, and even both versions of the original pilot film. It’s the ultimate release for any Lupin fan and I highly recommend you purchase this amazing set. Overall though, is Lupin III worth your time? I’d say without a doubt, yes. Not only is this an important and historical anime, it’s simply a fun show to watch. I’d even go as far to call this the “Cowboy Bebop” of the 1970s generation. The influence that this show had on the exploits of our Bebop crew is immediately noticeable. In fact, Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Watanabe has even gone on record to say that he was heavily inspired by this series, particularly with Ōsumi’s work. So there, you have it. An essential anime series that’s action-packed, entertaining, and full of great characters. It may be rough around the edges, as well as uneven in quality; but I guarantee you that you’ll have damn good time watching this series the whole way through. Check it out.";Recommended
1;Lupin III;Psycho_Sanji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Psycho_Sanji;10;The one that started it all.  This is a legendary anime series about some instant classic characters, the Lupin gang. This is amazingly ahead of it's time, being the first anime starring criminals, the first gritty comparatively more realistic anime with guns and such. Not just for anime, it's ahead of it's time in general.  Most importantly, it's still a joy to watch nearly 40 years later. Lupin is the cool, laid back antihero. This laid back style, helped by the very cool soundtrack, is still influential today in titles like Cowboy Bebop. Lupin has other sides to him too of course, he has an ego, and he'll laugh like a maniac and take on any challenge. And of course, he gets pretty excited when there are ladies around, especially Fujiko.  The supporting characters are great here. You have Jigen, Lupin's partner and best friend. He's very cool himself, a smooth criminal, but he's also the voice of reason, a more mature criminal. Then you have Fujiko, the classic femme fatale cat burglar, she is Lupin's love interest, and often his rival. Then there's Goemon, the renegade samurai with a strong moral code, who can cut anything. And of course, Inspector Zenigata, who tirelessly dedicates his life to capturing Lupin.  Lupin is episodic, featuring 23 self contained stories. Although there is one plot that takes two episodes early on, with Goemon out to defeat Lupin. One episode Lupin is in prison, another time him and the gang have explosive watches put on that they can't take off. These are all great stories.  An interesting thing about this series is that it has two different feels to it, depending on who is directing. Masaaki Osumi directs episodes 1-7, 9, and 12. These are the more dark and gritty episodes, and sometimes have a melancholy feel. These episodes are amazing, giving us the depth that the Lupin characters are built on.  The founders of Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, direct episodes 8, 10-11, and 13-23. These episodes are also superb, with a more fun and upbeat feel, closer to what Lupin is known for today. You can tell Miyazaki is involved when Lupin starts saving cute damsels in a gentlemanly heroic way.  All in all, Lupin III is a classic series, which is still going strong today with movie specials. I recommend checking this out, it's must see anime.;Recommended
2;Lupin III;Redward;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Redward;8;Its the one that started it all. Sure, the manga is where Lupin was truly born, but in terms of beginning a legacy, the first television series can take a good chunk of the glory. While its impossible to review this without comparisons and/or contrasts to the second and third series, Lupin III has done enough to give itself its own limelight.  On its own, Lupin III lays down a solid effort. There is action, intrigue, and betrayal...all of which would become staples of the Lupin franchise. The characters that will go on to become some of the most famous in anime history are established here. And while the animation is undoubtedly telling of its' age, the standard for long, lanky legs and hairy hands is set. With all the good foundation that Lupin III sets for the franchise, there is, thankfully, one aspect that did not carry over...the music. The combination of hippy j-rock and the repetition of Lupins' name does not make for a good soundtrack.  Another trait that fails to carry over is the dark and dirty side of Lupin. Fans of the second series and later specials are familiar with family-friendly Lupin, but Lupin III allows for a much more serious, James Bond-type espionage story. During the course of the series, Lupin and the gang commit and encounter murder, violence against women, and even rape.  As a stand alone series, I'd give this a 7 out of 10. But Lupin III isn't a stand alone series. It, while having its own identity and place within the Lupin Franchise, does so much to establish Lupin and the gang as a powerhouse in the anime world. For any Lupin fan that wants too see how it all got started, I highly recommend this. For any old school anime fan, this is straight up your alley, so what have you been waiting for?  And for everyone else, if you can find it, watch it. Bear with the hippy j-rock and enjoy a fun, exciting series that'll introduce you to the fun world of Lupin the Third.;Recommended
3;Lupin III;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;8;"Overview:  Red jacket? Green jacket? Who gives a shit?! Ok, now that I am done quoting Happy Gilmore, I will review what is without a doubt one of the most famous and beloved anime of all time...in Japan... and pretty much nowhere else.  Background info:  Lupin the 3rd started way back in the early 1970s and was created by the legendary mangaka known only as ""monkey punch"". Yep, that's really what he calls himself. Lupin was created as a spoof/ homage of the character Arsene Lupin, who was a gentlemen spy in a series of French novels that were popular in the late 1800s and ran alongside the Sherlock Holmes stories. Along with spoofing low brow adventure novels from 1800s France, Lupin also takes a lot of inspiration from James Bond and the spy movies and novels that were extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s. In his adventures, Lupin is joined by the femme fatale Fujiko, badass samurai Goemon, and awesome sharp shooter Jigen. Lupin has crazy adventures that mix slapstick comedy with awesome action and some of the first ""fanservice"" in anime history.  Lupin in Japan vs. outside Japan:  Lupin was a HUGE hit in Japan, and to this day recieves reboot after reboot. A new live action movie was created just this year and will be followed by sequels. However, for some reason Lupin has never been a very big deal overseas. Perhaps this is because the West was already saturated with slapstick comedy and James Bond parodies like ""Get Smart"", which would have aired around the same time that Lupin first came out.  Story and characters: 8/10  The story and characters are so well known and beloved in Japan that even if you have never seen Lupin, you have probably seen it parodied or homaged dozens of times in other anime. For example, the red coat worn by the character Nabeshin in Excel Saga is an homage to Lupin, as are the character designs from Cowboy Bebop. Spike is based on Lupin, Jet = Jigen, Faye =Fujiko and Vicious = Goemon. The plot works because it is simple and usually doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters have great chemistry and each brings something to the mix.  Music: 9/10  Lupin was probably the first anime ever to have a truly KICKASS opening theme song. This was back in 1971 and no other animated show had an opening that mixed jazz, a smooth singer, and an awesome melody and beat like this one. The entire soundtrack is very jazz oriented, which started a huge trend in anime that continues to this day 40 years later!  Art: 7/10  The art really scares away some viewers because it has a very unique style. I would compare it to One Piece, but I actually think even the original Lupin from 1971 has better character art than One Piece. An interesting fact is that one of the key animators for the original Lupin was Hayao Miyazaki, who later became the main animator for one of the early Lupin movies.  Overall: 8/10  If you want to watch an anime that has stood the test of time and been HUGELY influential on the genre as a whole, then Lupin is an absolute must! It currently has a low rating on MAL of around 7, but don't let that dissuade you. Some people simply don't appreciate anything that is older than they are and don't care about influence, history, or enduring quality. I feel sorry for those people, because they miss out on a LOT of great stuff. If you don't want to watch the original series, at LEAST watch the 1979 movie Castle of Cagliostro. It is generally considered the the high water point of all things Lupin.";Recommended
4;Lupin III;Riiakuma;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Riiakuma;10;Watching this anime in 2020 made me think that I would find this really outdated or difficult watching because of how I am used to modern anime style and high quality. Despite this anime being made in the 70s it’s an absolute stunner even now. Of course there are lags and sometimes delay in animation when a character speaks but I always remember how limited in technology and how difficult it would be to create a smooth animation at that time so I really don’t think too harshly of those small errors.  Lupin the third part 1 is definitely a must watch. It’s comedic and entertaining story keeps anyone on their feet and some episodes really stick to you. I definitely could see how close Jigen and Lupin are and it’s a friendship that can’t be broken so easily. I really love the episodes when you see the two being goofy. Lupin III is just one of those anime’s that grows onto you like an old friend and you just reminisce on it. I definitely will go for a rewatch and would recommend it to pretty much anyone. Although I was so late in the game to start this series, I’m grateful I did.  Definitely a hidden gem that got buried amongst time and age. I have watched the 2019 Lupin III but it didn’t get as much hype as many other anime. I hope this gem once again sparkles as it once did in the 70s;Recommended
5;Lupin III;Area51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Area51;7;"Lupin the Third came into the realm of animation nearly a decade after the release of Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy anime. Lupin III is known as a classic to anyone who understands the history of the anime scene in Japan. This age of animation was a time when children grew up with the adventures of immoral ne’er-do-wells shooting off Walthers, a time when intelligent dogs with speech impediments were best friends with stoners, a time when sailors ate spinach to beat up kidnappers; It was an age when children wanted to grow up to be great heroes. Unfortunately the days of courageous, green-jacketed thieves like Lupin have been replaced with an era of black-haired trench-coated teenagers and mentally-troubled orphans. 60’s children, you are sorely missed.  Lupin III is the episodic adventures of the infamous thief, Arsene Lupin the Third, dressed in his iconic green jacket and yellow tie, accompanied by his cohorts. Daisuke Jigen, Lupin’s right-hand-man, is a cynical sharpshooter loyal only to his partner. Goemon Ishikawa is a samurai of incredible talent, wielding a blade that would easily slice steel. Fujiko Mine is Lupin’s love-interest, ally, and greatest enemy all in one. Together they face the determination of red-faced Inspector Zenigata, a man of the law who has dedicated his life to imprisoning Lupin the Third. The characters are what one would expect from a well-loved cartoon of the 70’s: each one distinct in their personality and instantly recognizable.  Lupin III is a clearly sexist show, having begun in the beginning of the 1970’s. Fujiko represents the mindset towards women at the time: traitorous and unpredictable. At the end of most episodes, Lupin’s latest trophy is immediately stolen by Fujiko. The classic conclusion to a Lupin III episode is Lupin crying out Fujiko’s name in frustration as she drives or flies off into the distance.  The animation style is also what one would expect of the time period. To us folk from the modern west, it seems to basically be the equivalent of an old episode of Scooby Doo: plain-faced characters with lanky bodies against noticeably hand-drawn backgrounds. To watch such a show today, it is certainly not without a feeling of nostalgia. The musical themes of Lupin III are especially memorable, what with the amusing English lyrics of the ending song and the catchy tunes of the openings.  Lupin the Third is an all-around entertaining anime and the bearer of one of the most iconic characters in anime history. There is little value to be had with the show, the lack of morality is obvious, but I suppose it could be said that the message to be gained from Lupin the Third’s adventures would be similar to a quote by the lovely Oscar Wilde, “Life is too important to be taken seriously.”  Story: 6/10 Character: 7/10 Art: 5/10 Sound: 6/10 Enjoyment: 9/10 Overall: 7/10   VIA (Value in Anime) – Classic Division Written single-handedly by Moros_Fate.

6;Lupin III;vytah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vytah;9;"Rather than reviewing this series as a prelude to the whole franchise (like reviewers before), I'd prefer to review the series and just the series.  Lupin III is a master thief, a unsuccessful womaniser, a mad genius capable of stealing anything and escaping from anywhere, companied by his gang, and chased by Zenigata like Bugs Bunny by Elmer Fudd.  In overall, very enjoyable comedy series.  STORY: 8/10 There's no overall spanning story, each episode can by watched separately. After first three episodes, which have a weird feel, next twenty are typical thievish things. Lupin either tries to steal something, tries to escape from jail, or tries to escape from people who are after his life. To achieve this, he makes a plan involving disguise, misdirection, violence, explosives and a lot of awesomeness. Yes, violence - this anime is not for kids, thankfully, so it doesn't turn into a kiddy cartoon show. Coz kids shouldn't watch series where the main character is, well, a thief. The episodes can be from lighthearted to dark and violent, but they're all funny (well, the third ep was the most serious one). If you wish, you can skip first 3 eps, I think they're not Lupinish enough.  ART: 7/10 Well, it was the seventies, so the art is not great, but it has its cartoonish feel. For the first glance, it looks nowhere like modern Japanese animation. Despite its drawbacks, the art suits the show.  SOUND: 9/10 Apart from the OP for the first few episodes (""Lupin Lupin Lupin the third"" all over), we get lot of awesome music. The music can be compared to music in European animation. On the other hand, dubbing quality and sound effects suffer from being from the 70s, so they can be considered one of the weak points of the series. But all classic things are like this, ain't they?  CHARACTER: 10/10 First, we've got Lupin. A madman, who'd do anything to achieve his goal, but never turns his back on the damsel in distress. Unpredictable, eager to act, with unusually accurate intuition. He's being the main source of humour in the series - you'll never know, what trick he will pull out. Secondly, we've got Fujiko. You never know, on which side is she. Her main hobby is stealing things Lupin has just stolen, but she often gives him a helpful hand. Then, we've got Zenigata. A man with a precise aim in his life: to catch Lupin. And last but not least, Jigen and Goemon. Those two are Lupin's straight men, more rational and less impulsive (but Goemon's honour can be easily offended), masters of gun and katana respectively. Due to series' episodic nature, there's little character development, but the characters are themselves original enough to keep you entertained.  ENJOYMENT: 9/10 First three episodes were kinda weak, but the rest of them were relaxing and funny. Larger amount of Lupin can feel repetitive, so my advise is to limit yourself to 5 episodes per day. Lupin is great to watch, either alone, or simultanously with other, probably serious series (I watched Lupin to cheer myself up while watching NGE and Hellsing, and man it helped a lot.)  OVERALL: 9/10 If you want some comedy, you enjoyed The Olsen Gang, or you want to relax with something less moe-moe-kyun, Lupin is just for you.";Recommended
7;Lupin III;EvocationWizard;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EvocationWizard;7;Grab some Maurice Leblanc’s books, the first James Bond movies, jazzy Ost, Japanese wackiness and you have Lupin III, an anime that sparked an entire franchise and a lot of noir, criminal, and old-fashioned action animes such as Cowboy Bebop. Get your favorite colored jacket and a gun, because we are driving in a Fiat 500 back to the past.  - Story: Part I is episodic, It doesn't develop a solid story through its 23 episodes (Except for the introduction of one of the later members of the gang). Instead, is sporadic, jumping from heist to heist, to adventure to adventure in a weekly format. Today you are stealing a book that belonged to your grandfather and tomorrow you'll possibly attempt a very risky jailbreak. Normally I'm skeptical of episodic series in general, but Lupin knows for the most part how to use this format, as it allows the directors to put the gang into different types of situations without ruining or having to care about a plot line.  -Characters:  Easily one of the best aspects of the Lupin series in general, and Part I is no exception to this rule. You have the four members of the Lupin gang, Lupin, the de facto leader, and the charismatic, suave but comical protagonist. He always gets what he wants (More or less). Jigen, the loyal gunman and sometimes, the voice of reason of the crew. Fujiko, a femme-fatale and Lupin's weakness. And last but not least, Goemon, a stoic samurai that sticks around with the crew, sadly, feels more like an extra rather than a main character in most of Part I. You also have your run-of-the-mill villains and the tireless detective Zenigata, who mostly gets the stick’s short end. These characters are easily recognizable from each other and are quite likable. And just like the story, they're simple but great.  - Art, direction, and the rest:  Lupin III's animations are dated by our standards, but back in 1971, after the dark pages of Japan's history, it was the best that the industry had to offer not only that, but there was love put into them, bonus points for doing the best they could. The amount of attention to detail put into guns, vehicles and some extra stuff is pretty good. The characters’ designs are wacky, and cartoonish and remind me of something straight out of those underground comics, I also like the contrast of the character designs with the more realistic approach to backgrounds and weapons. The sound and music are the best part of the technical section, the OST is very jazzy and offers a nice variation of tunes, the anime even has three openings with the same animation but with different songs. I'm not an expert regarding sound effects, so I'm going to say that they add a lot to the light-hearted and wacky feel of the anime.  - Let's wrap this up:  Lupin III Part I despite how simple it is very enjoyable anime. It has a lot of charm that old animes have, it also shows a lot of creativity that the media lacks, and if you manage to adapt to its rough presentation, you're in for a good time. It is also a great starting point to get into the Lupin franchise. Giving a rating to an anime is complicated if you want to do it seriously, but Part I gets a well-deserved 7/10 and a high spot on my favorites for all the reasons that I stated in my review and many more.;Recommended

9;Lupin III;asei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/asei;8;"I started to watch Lupin III in search of an answer, how this franchise can be so old and vast. Why people still watch it. I expected Lupin to be some kind of anti-Bond. He is a lover, adventurer, a gentleman and a thief. Of course, I got what I expected. I liked a bit more serious tone, more mature, as much seinen as show potentially could be. And yet, despite everything above first 5 or so episodes were pretty boring.  When the director changed the story changed as well. The show got to be more family-friendly, with less and less erotic connotations, less serious and more comedic. My opinion is ambivalent on this. At some point, I felt that it turned to be a kids show as if I watch a cartoon for 5-year-olds. But I have to say I started to enjoy the show more since the middle of the season. The show benefited by changes.  Another aspect that added to the feeling of kids show is the art style. Obviously anime 40 years ago did not have the same character designs as it has now. If I did not know it is Japanese, from the first glance I would think it is a Western show. Also, the quality dropped from the first couple of episodes till the last ones. If at the beginning the backgrounds were marvellous, in the end, they were meh, nothing special.  There are some nice tunes and the first OP is superb. But why at the second one they sing ""Rupá-Rupá"", regarding Lupin, if the seyus easily pronounce his sirname as ""Lupá"", as it would sound in French...  Characters are great. My personal favourite is Fujiko. She is sexy, and smart and savvy. Great design and mischievous personality. Perfect female thief. Others are great too. Jigen is an amazing friend, never betrayed Lupin.  I moderately enjoyed the show. Every episode I found something I liked and something I disliked. I understand why there is a fanbase over this show and why there are still sequels produced as TV shows and movies.  Overall it is fun to watch. I have to admit though, even with a more mature beginning, seinen as the main audience and rating PG-13 I still think it is more suitable for a younger audience. Cartoons made by Tex Avery also have a lot of jokes revolving around sex and erotics, but I watched it as a kid, and will show to my children. Same goes to Lupin III.";Recommended
10;Lupin III;serowenczak;https://myanimelist.net/profile/serowenczak;9;One of the few original anime that are still as good now as they were back then. If you are a person that likes mystery anime and enjoys perverted quirky humor than this is the anime for you. I encourage everyone to watch it, it's very lighthearted and doesn't take any serious commitment. For the most part each episode is independent of the others and can be watched in any order. There isn't any deep story or heavy themes it's just a fun action and mystery anime with hilarious situations and witty dialogue.;Recommended
11;Lupin III;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;8;"This is where things began for the famous Lupin III franchise starting from here all the way to the franchise's most recent adaptation, The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, over the span of 40 years. It also has some notoriety to it with the differences in series direction, story setup and presentation thanks to the very concept of the series. Lupin III was one of the very first TV anime titles geared for an older audience, which is most certainly shown with the title's focus on a criminal in the form of international thief Lupin, scenes of violence that showed characters killed onscreen, sexual innuendo and content compliments of Lupin's perversion and Fujiko's seductive charm and a gritty look into the criminal underworld that Lupin and his group are regularly involved with. The show's concept was ahead for its time, but was also a bit controversial as many anime titles of the early 1970s were still rather wholesome in content, traditionally focused on the ""good guys"" as protagonists and geared for younger audiences. This backlash, combined with low TV ratings at the time of the show's airing in earlier episodes, led to a change in directors which led future iconic directors Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki to take the reigns of directing the series to make the series more comical, tone down the violence and sexual content of earlier episodes and make Lupin and his crew more sympathetic. Even with the changes, the show still suffered from low ratings and was cancelled after 23 episodes. It wasn't until airing reruns of the series later in the decade that led to the show finally gaining popularity and having later TV show, movie, OVA and TV special adaptations to come along with it.  Taking all this in mind, you will certainly see some clear differences in how the two halves of this first Lupin III TV anime series perceive itself. Much of the first half to the anime is following the manga adaptation's setup rather faithfully with Lupin and his crew being willing to kill off those in the way of their capers and Fujiko not afraid to use her body to dupe Lupin and others into getting what she wants. When the second half of the series comes along under Takahata and Miyazaki's direction, you will notice how it takes after the elements that many Western fans would be familiar with from Lupin in Castle of Cagliostro as Lupin's gang only steal from those who can take the loss and very likely a part of the criminal underworld, they don't kill anyone in their capers except as a last resort, will take the time to dispatch criminals who commit worst crimes than they have, Fujiko doesn't resort to her seductive charm to rob others and Lupin isn't as perverted in his womanizing.  The show's storylines are mostly episodic as they mostly consist of Lupin and his gang planning out and executing some sort of theft and/or crossing paths with Zenigata and/or whichever criminal/ wealthy person they cross paths with. There are some relevant plot details that this series takes to exploring during Lupin's capers such as how Goemon meets with and joins Lupin's gang, the unique relationship between Fujiko and Lupin and Lupin's family roots. While many episodes are self-contained with their plot and follow a standard formula in how their plots are laid out, there is enough diversity in the types of capers that Lupin's gang are involved with which keeps this first TV anime from getting stale. While the series is known for possessing quite a bit of slapstick and ""toon forcing"" at points with its comedy being prevalent, it was still quite entertaining and engaging to see the chemistry between members of Lupin's gang, Zenigata and whichever criminals are found within an episode and many episodes are still grounded in following the capers of Lupin. This doesn't necessarily mean all the plots to Lupin were perfect as some resorted to a sci-fi or fantasy element (time traveler, girl whose life force was connected to flowers) that were a bit too out there compared to other episodes in the series.  Being a 40-plus year old anime series, don't expect much in the visual department for Lupin III as the animation style is quite outdated, simple in its details and there are quite a bit of animation shortcuts and errors to notice. The music mostly consists of carefree and energetic musical pieces and songs from the early 70s that do well enough to get you latched on the antics and actions of the characters in this series.  If you are a Lupin III that has seen later parts of the franchise, this first series is a definite recommendation to allow one to know how things got started in the 40-plus year anime saga of the titular thief's long-running and popular franchise.";Recommended
12;Lupin III;garthol;https://myanimelist.net/profile/garthol;7;Lupin the Third: Part 1 is an absolutely charming and educational anime that all people interested in the history of anime or of a huge Japanese franchise should absolutely watch. It holds up very well in certain parts, but its awkward mix of maturity and childishness is overall a mixed bag that depends on your personal tastes.  As many others have mentioned, this is not only the first official Lupin release, but also the least consistent. It starts out as a gritty and dark crime drama focusing on womanizer thief Lupin the Third and his sharpshooter partner Daisuke Jigen, but slowly progresses into a fun and friendly crime-based comedy that seems to work more like an animated sitcom than the thriller it, at first, set out to be. This is apparently due to network ratings, which showed the first run of Lupin on TV as unfavorable at its worst, and resulted in director Osumi Masaki being given joint directorial duties with (now, well-known names) Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. Through the talents of Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin found success as a family-friendly comedy focusing on the hijinks of the Lupin Gang, rather than any violent drama Masaki had in mind. (From what I understand the original manga was also quite dark. Take that as you will.)  This show, as a result, is completely subjective. Will you prefer the hard-boiled beginning, with genuine murder and chaos? Or the goofy and hectic second half, with slapstick and complete ignorance of physics? Personally, I liked aspects of both. At its best, Lupin Sansei Part 1 is enthralling and creative, putting unique spins on spy/crime thriller tropes using its animated medium and various visual and aural talents. There are some absolutely epic moments from the lead, with his crafty gunslinging and escape artistry hidden behind a facade of a humorous and fun-loving gentleman. The comedy hits most of the time, too! Watching Lupin mess with the codgy old Zenigata is a treat in its own right.  The age shows, though. The animation is pretty terrible by today’s standards, though holding true to its roots as an “adult-marketed” cartoon, the guns and cars look absolutely marvelous and, at their best, photo-realistic. Facial features are immediately recognizable and charming. The real drawbacks are in the backdrops and any background characters. They’re more outlines of what should be there than actual backgrounds.  The music, while repetitive, with constant chants of “Rupan the Third!” and “Walther P38,” (Lupin’s trademark gun which he doesn’t use very much) can pump you up or bring sweet closure to a comedic moment depending on the situation. I’d say it’s used very well.  I would have to argue that the staying power of the Lupin III series comes from the character designs and personalities. Over these 23 episodes, with no previous knowledge of the series, I fell in love with Lupin’s heartfelt smile and shining eyes, Jigen’s cranky, but sage advice, with a trigger finger to match, and Fujiko’s demure but malicious tendency to betray everyone. Zenigata’s hard-working demeanor and childish frustration was equally endearing. (As much as Goemon is a well-known mainstay, he isn’t in many of these episodes. Ah well.) The voice cast is phenomenal as well, and most reprised their roles for later seasons.  Is it excellent? No. Is it boring at times, and repetitive? Yeah, sure. Is it a good time for casual viewing? Absolutely. Lots of corny, physics-defying moments, obvious reveals, cheesy one-liners, and great characters adds up to a lovely time machine from 1971 Japan, and I absolutely adored every minute of it! 7/10.;Recommended

The only critiscism i have is I wish there were more two part episodes so that they could build a little more suspense. The episode where lupin stays in prison for a whole year is truly a wonderful piece of art, and it really is great for the character development of one of the best Anime/Manga characters ever designed. I give it a 9 because it's basically impossible for an Anime to get a 10 in my view.;Recommended
14;Lupin III;BowlingJD;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BowlingJD;8;This is the first animated series with the amazing third generation thief, Lupin with his gang of buds Goemon the samurai and Jigen the marksman. Also, one can't forget about the mystery cunning and sexy woman that is Fujiko Mine whom Lupin is totally weak in the knees for. Lupin III is episodic in every sense, and if James Bond was a thief, he would be Lupin. This is a fantastic show with each episode keeping your interest in the crew, and when will Inspector Zenigata (whom has devoted his entire life to catching Lupin) finally put the cuffs on Lupin. Each character is totally lovable and once you watch a few episodes you will quickly realize how this show even stands up today. The art style stands the test of time, music is wonderful, and really pushes the boundaries of the time in which it came out. If you are an old-school anime fan and need something to watch from the 70's that isn't a super robot, look no further than the womanizing thief himself.;Recommended
15;Lupin III;ojmendez;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ojmendez;7;Last year in my review for Lupin the third Plot Film. I gave my backstory with the franchise & mentioned that I had regain my interested in the franchise's titular character. I have seen Castle of Caglioastro and the three OVAs directed by Takeshi Koike of Redline fame. So far have enjoyed what's I've seen. I wanted to watch the first Lupin the third series.  The first thing I notice is how James Bond influence the anime is in it's earlier episodes with it's villains, traps, Femme fatal & adult themes. It has a serious tone with silly moments sprinkled thru out. Which I frequently enjoyed. As the anime goes on it starts to shift it's tone to a more comedic goofy tone dropping the serious tone. Which I was a little disappointed about. The Episodes for me started off really strong in the beginning being new to the series, getting to know these characters. But I wanna say at Episode 10 the episodes become a hit or a miss. They are either Great (Which I would consider to be one of my favorite episodes) Good or Average. It all depends on the plot of the episode. But I will tell you this all the episodes have entertaining moments.  I do have a couple of negatives one would be how they drop a story line with one of the main character cause the shift of the tone of the show and The villains not being that smart. There a few villains that have out match lupin and his gang.  The Characters  I pretty much like them all. You get to know the characters persona really quick  I always thought Lupin was cool in the other movies that I've seen but watching him in his own series makes the character more interesting. Seeing how he thinks & acts, his likes and dislikes. Other then just jumping into the movies Blindly. Lupin is more psychotic in the earlier episodes. There's a episode with Inspector Zengata that gives a insight on the Zengata and Lupin relationship. It shows you the purpose of the Zengata Character. Which I thought was interesting.  Jigen and Goemon these two characters are pretty one dimension even tho I really like Jigen whenever cracks a joke. Goemon is a character I can't get into so far. He doesn't fit the rest of the characters in the anime, you have two thieves, a gunslinger a Inspector & a Samurai. He seems out of place.  Fujiko Mine has gotten a slight update from the plot film. She doesn't really do much in the early episodes. She's the Femme fatale, Damsel in Distress, Fan service. Who betrays Lupin a lot. Just to say Fujiko Betraying Lupin & Being the Damsel in distress gets old really quick. Before she is given more to do. The Lupin / Fujiko Rivalry trying to one up each other Stealing Valuables is really fun! I love this! For her first official incarnation she's rather cute then hot LMAO. It's gonna be interesting seeing her character design evolve thru the decades.  The first opening theme at first I didn't like. I thought it was repetitive but after a while it grew on me really fast just for them to modify the opening with narration introducing you the characters. Out of the three opening themes the third one has to be my favorite due to it having a little Spanish flavor  You can see some of the influence The anime has had in Takeshi Koike's Redline with the Anime's first opening Lupin running from a hail of bullets. The sequence in Redline introduction Lynchman & Johnny boy has a little sequence that's really similar to the opening. In the first episode of the anime in the race that Lupin has entered the announcer announces one of the racers is driving a Maclaren Which made me think of Sonoshee Maclaren from Redline even tho it could be a mare coincidence.  In conclusion The first Lupin the Third anime series is worth a watching for people who want to get into the franchise to get to know the characters at only 23 episodes.;Recommended
16;Lupin III;AnimeObasan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeObasan;8;"I started with Lupin back when it was run late night on Adult Swim. I was iffy about it based on the strange animation style. And I wasn't too crazy that the show seemed to be just about a thief and an inept detective. But this first series that started it all is worth watching as a fan of the Lupin franchise.  STORY: An inept detective? Well, I suppose that depends on the director or writer. In quite a bit of the first Lupin series Zenigata is a VERY good investigator who just happens to be dealing with someone who is even better. There's an episode where Zenigata captures Lupin and keeps a watchful eye on him for years, only for Lupin to get his revenge as he's going to the gallows. It really made me go, ""wow!"" Both Lupin and Zenigata were very well developed so early on.  CHARACTERS: This first series is worth a watch as it introduces you to Lupin the Third, a world renowned thief, his partner Jigen, Fujiko, Zenigata, and we first meet Goemon. How they meet is a great story. What kills me about the series though is how non-canon it can be. There's an episode where Fujiko is playing Goemon's girlfriend, then a later episode where she is in a very mild disguise (like hair dye and that's it) and auditioning to be one of his students. But he doesn't notice? I think that's both a great thing and a very frustrating thing about the Lupin franchise...you should take the series like someone is telling you a story...and can't quite remember all the details. All the characters' will remain the same, but their history will change quite a bit.  ART: While the art is out there, it fits with the manga. I think the style of this series was better than some of the later Lupin specials put out in that two-tone style from the 90s.  SOUND: Well, I'm partial to the English dub that began in the second tv series, but the voice actors were always great and the music as well. Who can forget the two main Lupin openings, one which is still prevalent in every single Lupin special?  ENJOYMENT: I think Lupin is an anime staple. Watch it.";Recommended
0;Lupin III;cloudflowe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cloudflowe;6;"Lupin III changed the market for anime by introducing a cast of adult characters with adult stories and problems, attempting to breathe maturity into a medium whose initial visionary created in the shadow of the legendary Walt Disney.  The show narrates the escapades of the titular phantom thief, his right hand man Jigen, and his lady friend Fujiko. Heist, capers, and kidnappings abound as the gang seeks out their latest thrill.  Part 1 of this watershed franchise is where Lupin first leapt onto broadcast television. Its sound design and animation unfortunately reflect the times more than the capability of its staff, but with older productions from anime’s very infancy a certain unrefinement is to be expected by the viewer. Part 1’s production does the job: it conveys its narrative with enough audiovisual engagement to weave a story. Those searching for eye-melting sakuga sequences or emotionally evocative soundtracks should turn their attention elsewhere.  What Part 1 DOES offer is an admittedly delightful romp of elementary crime capers that earnestly presents its cast and situations in a charmingly campy manner. Its best episodes play the tried and true archetypes of Arsene Lupin III, Jigen Daisuke, and Fujiko Mine to their fullest, making for brief 20 minute stints of amusing jokes, goofy interactions, and ridiculous action. The primitive production actually worked in service of my connection with the Lupin gang during these moments; ridiculous tunes and bright, simple colors elevate the unfolding mayhem on screen.  Lupin III can be delightful for a few afternoons of chuckles and relaxation.  Even as I viewed it through the simple unpresumptuous lens the production aspires to, a “sort of funny anime where entertaining things happen to lovable characters,” Lupin III Pt 1 fell short of being the perfect crime in one critical area: consistency.  Even excusing the different ideas brought by its various directors, Part 1 possesses no sense of itself or its cast, with various elements changing or even disappearing across episodes. Nothing flows, as if the staff did not know what sort of characters the Lupin gang should be or what sort of stories the gang could tell.  Lupin III Pt 1 suffered from acute growing pangs. By later Lupins, a majority of its issues with consistency were sorted out and the resulting packages feel much more cohesive. Part 1is a different beast entirely: it regularly messes with its world’s internal logic, switches up its tone, and perhaps most offensively juggles the personalities of its cast. Lupin’s a good thief, Jigen’s a “cool gunman,” Fujiko is ambiguous, and samurai Ishikawa Goemon is a hardass. Those are the only constants across the 26 episode runtime. The relationships between the characters, how they play off each other to execute gags, and their own desires seem liquid for no artistic purpose. As a note, my own tolerance for Lupin III’s lack of vision as to what it wanted to be might be lower than most.  Aside from that, Lupin III’s first anime outing is an enjoyable ride. The production gave birth not only to a new demographic for the at the time infantile medium of anime, but also served as the premiere anime endeavor for legendary names Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki. As a project in isolation it fails to deliver truly excellent entertainment in virtually any regard, but it deserves an audience for its amusing antics and deserves respect for its ambitious legacy to a medium that lacked identity, even if its own identity search runs parallel to early anime’s adolescence.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lupin III;chubbierpenguin7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chubbierpenguin7;6;Given the success that Takahata and Miyazaki would achieve following their work on this series, it seems a bit superfluous to heap praise on them for their work here, but there is such a massive uptick in quality in the show the moment that they take over that it just has to be mentioned. The first few episodes of this first green jacket series are borderline unwatchable. The plots are incoherent, there is nothing intelligent or even interesting about the way Lupin and his cohorts behave, and Fujiko is nothing more than a sexy monster who serves no purpose other than to titillate viewers and to openly and obviously betray Lupin for God knows what reason. I know Monkey Punch would disagree with me, but the second half of this series is exactly what Lupin should be, and I loved every minute of it. As frustrating as the earlier episodes were, the latter ones made me that much more excited to watch future series and revisit the delight that is The Castle of Cagliostro.;Mixed Feelings

The story while alittle simple is very enjoyable and surprised me, the art style is super clean that allows for very fluid and crisp animation.

2;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);WdaCdaShdaDid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WdaCdaShdaDid;9;A gorgeous, adorable, sweet, fun film.  The story is heart-wrenching and funny. Perhaps the only issues it has is that things are kept overly vague for the entire story. You can imply what the mysterious organization does, but it's probably not a full picture, and the story doesn't attempt to clear things up, giving the audience obscure hints and teases like they have more to show without making good on the promise. I guess it helps build up this sense that Hei is rightfully conflicted, and the characters demonstrate through actions rather than overarching dogma which is the side to choose, but it still leaves you wondering what the organization is. Maybe this is supposed to lead to another film or another animated series or more graphic novels, and I support that idea. It just has the downside of making this feel less like a complete story and more like an unfulfilling prequel.  The characters are wonderful. Hei is adorable, and the art style for the humans is quite cute, too. The character designs themselves are excellent. The fluidity of the animation is just... a joy to watch. Whether it's Hei running and jumping or transformation sequences or combat, it's just great to watch.  The music was great. It was kind of Ghibli vibes for the most part when it wasn't focusing in on small character moments - a lot of greenery and landscapes and emotional build. During the character parts I didn't notice the score as much. There is a notable shift in music for the climax during a particular fight scene that I greatly enjoyed.

Dub has stuff lost in translation too but not as bad. • Eng dub has an all-Asian cast, yay for effort?  【Recommended watching order】 episodes 1–13 (not as interesting but 5 minutes each!) → movie → the rest of web series (ep. 37–40 is the BOMB) & webtoon  【TL;DR】 • derivative in spirit, original in execution • appears simple, but meticulously thought out — **withstood rewatches like magic** (btw it's neither serectly anti- or pro-government, some people need to stop categorizing art into either disguised protest or propaganda.) (it's also not championing colonialism or justifying urbanization that sacrifices environment, pay attention to the actual movie please??? environmental terrorism is two words and the emphasis is on the second.)  【spoiler-free review】 The director MTJJ has always been smooth incorporating references. He does it in a wholesome way without making people feel that he is uninspired or appropriating, because • the plot actually makes sense, and none of it is unnecessary • despite the Ghibli influence, there are brave, creative choices in art direction, such as minimal shadows on characters, and trading design complexity for dynamic action, cuteness and practicality — against the possibility that people will dismiss it as Flash cartoon (they did) • in every wallpaper-worthy 'still', every sweeping or miniscule movement, every minor character in the background, the team's attention to detail fills the screen. It has so much love. Every nuance is calculated to make it feel organic and thus actually not stand out. Which is why it is **so easy to watch and at the same time the most rewatchable thing ever**. It's so natural yet has hidden SO MUCH lore and easter eggs. You can tell there are backstories and justification for why each character acts a certain way.  Back to its resemblance to other stuff — it's so fun spotting other movies in it, and they're not restricted to ACG only, which is better than what would feel like exclusive circle jerk. Don't get me wrong though, you don't need to know anything to enjoy it. The main series other reviews mention has very little to do with it.  Action scenes are noticeably better than the web series (before ep. 29, that is), which is already known for that aspect. I'll never tire of looking at them frame by frame. Since everyone is commending the action, it's worth mentioning my favourites are all slow scenes. Camerawork is extraordinary throughout, including slice-of-life moments where people tend to neglect the 'camera'. I especially like how it pans from nighttime streets to inside the 'domain' (yes they cheaped out on 3D models in that scene due to time restraints). The sparingly used silence worked to great effect.  Story is where it marks the greatest leap for Chinese animations. White Snake, Big Fish, Ne Zha, Monkey King: Hero Is Back... all have fatal flaws in their story. They stack clichés and at the same time choke on itself when trying to be special. All Saints Street, produced by the same studio that made LoH, is unfortunately also a mixed bag (maybe because the story was written by someone else?). But in LoH, tropes are used effectively — which is inconspicuously. The story is classic, but MTJJ has such a grasp on storytelling and pacing that it works. The movie takes you along for the ride. You connect with characters and feel what they feel. MTJJ said in an interview he wanted the tone to match Hei's mood so he insisted making the first part duller, even though it would (and it did!) drive away impatient audience. I think it's genius, although it didn't occur to me while I was watching because it just flowed. Everything everyone does is logical and everyone is respectfully smart. Very few things stood out that threw me back to reality. It's such a tight story, only 101 minutes and characters are all established. Twists, motives, all fleshed out, through very efficient use of dialogue, movement, even camerawork: it often shifts camera to indicate where a character focuses his eyes. If you want proof, all side characters have been noticed, to the point where almost all of them have gotten a fan base, including one that has only appeared for 5 seconds in full. If that is not successful worldbuilding, I don't know what is. The hint of lore is strong in this one. My only gripe is it has a few dialogues that feed me information and the purpose is too obvious, e.g. when Wu Xian's friends each express their views, and when the flower girl makes her welcome speech. I was immediately aware why they're there and started thinking in movie-producing perspective, instead of ""this is my world and these are people I'm talking to"".  To me the most surprising aspect is the voice-over. Many of the voice actors are familiar names and I think they've never been this good (yes, even the legendary Shan Xin). I wouldn't say every line is perfect but none is cringy bad.  This movie is the definition of an all-rounder. Not the most original thing ever, but it just has so few slip-ups. Even the jokes are all good: funny, timed well, universal and tasteful, something even comedies — anime or not — very rarely pull off.  **This movie.. it feels like home.**  After the first viewing, I thought it was incredibly strong but the story felt too familiar to go beyond an 8. But I kept going back to it, each time noticing more details and being moved just the same. Then I realized how sincere it is and how rare it is to have a conflict-themed movie full of likeable characters. And it's so pure. There is no love plot, no bromance. Despite being a small studio, they resisted these shortcuts and focused on a world and a story they wanted. Not a single second is wasted. No unnecessary monologuing before action. No narrated exposition. No dumbass looking down on enemies. In the end, it is story, what I thought was the weakest card, that got me addicted. It is proof creators shouldn't be afraid of subjects that have been done to death – A better expression would be tried and true. If you love your characters, the audience would too.";Recommended
4;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);Gadric_Gadwin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gadric_Gadwin;10;Home and what makes a home is the central theme of this movie. It's in the subtext in every scene, with the intro, with the character motivations, and even with the central and subplots. The action and the worldbuilding are nice, but this movie's true heart is in understanding that.  There are many details that are easy to overlook. The plot won't dumb itself down by shining a spotlight on things that will be important later, such as character motivations or powers that are more important than the watcher might think at first. Because of this, there are probably lots of people who weren't paying attention who will be confused by the ending.  I personally love the attention to detail and leaving certain things to be revealed when you think back on them later. coincidences and random things aren't always as random as they might seem...    People like to have morals in their stories, and I am happy the moral I found was wholesome. I took away that the moral is home isn't just a location, but a people. Two characters in this film lost their home, but they deal with it in very different ways. Whether they attempt to bring their home back by restoring the place it was or to make a new home by being with the ones that make a home worth cherishing.;Recommended
5;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);JimmyDoe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JimmyDoe;9;"It would not be to much of a stretch to call this an Chinese attempt at a Studio Ghibli style animated story. All the little notes that one attributes to Ghibli are there. The vague, yet familiar story; the grandiose reveals of scenery; relatable yet other worldly characters; and a musical score that's both supportive of the art and at the same time having an immense presence of its own.  The studio made masterful work of color, and the absence of, to dictate the mood of certain scenes. Similarly, sound and silence is used to great effect with some scenes being all the more impactful thanks to the feeling of one holding their breath before releasing a thunderous finale. I never really had a complaint during slow points in the movie. There weren't really too many but there was more than enough to take in during them so that it never felt like it dragged on. The action scenes were fluid although at points the screen can get a bit cluttered. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it does lend a certain gravitas to that point of the story.  As I said before, Studio Ghibli has always made their main characters vague enough so that almost anyone can relate to them. This movie achieves the same thing by really limiting backstory and making the motivations of the characters simple enough so that you could connect to them quite easily. Besides the mains, almost all the characters that were introduced were at least somewhat interesting. The most recent comparison I could make would be some of the supporting characters in Spirited Away where there were a number of characters that had very little screen time but were quite important to the story. Think Lin, the Radish Spirit, and the Old River Spirit. They had maybe a few minutes during the movie, and in some cases no dialogue, but there was a reason they were there and if you took them out, the story would feel different.  The overall story will seem familiar to pretty much anyone. The concept of balance and cohabitation appear frequently in main stream media in things like X-Men, Princess Mononoke, various Pokemon Movies, etc... This doesn't detract from the way this particular story is told though and if anything, because it feels so familiar, it makes the movie easier to digest without having to throw in too much background.  All in all, you get nice story told in a beautiful manner bundled into a quick hour and a half. Definitely make some time for this movie.";Recommended
6;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);Kleckskind;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kleckskind;10;"What a Masterpiece - thats all there is to say!  I realley enjoyed every single moment.  Somewhere I overheard ""it might be the chinese version of a ghibli film"" an I think thats quiet fitting, looking at the artstyle - especially the backgrounds. But the story unfolds so many marvelous-animated action scenes and tips of humor witch makes that film about nature, spirits and encounters with humans unbelievable charming in addtion. The major plot questions (miyazaki alike) whether nature and humans can coexists and in witch way. The little endearing protagonist has to find his own answer, stuck between differnt parties packed with intersting charakters, despite their partly short screentime. As a fan of studio ghibli films I loved it none the less because of its fuzzy warm feeling that made me smiling all day long.

7;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);Khashishi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Khashishi;7;It's basically X-men, except mutants are replaced by spirits and Magneto is a good guy. Some people compare this to a Ghibli film but I think it's much closer to a Marvel film in style and plot. This is action-driven and takes an unambiguous moral stance to a tricky issue. It's good, but feels a little childish. The resolution is a bit cheesy, but that's what you get with a superhero flick.  The animation is clean and fluid, with nice backgrounds. The character style is cartoonish and unlike anime. But it looks really good. The music is fairly forgettable though.  They throw in a few jokes here and there, and it's funny. There are some endearing bits, but overall it doesn't evoke very deep emotions by movie standards. That's probably my biggest issue--it doesn't hit hard enough to be one of the greats.;Recommended

Not only that, but it is also my first 10 star rating out of all the hundreds of anime's I have watched! That's how good this movie is!  If you ever find the series, I highly recommend watching this one first because the series follows directly after despite their airing dates.  Why do I recommend this? Story and the growth and development of the characters. It's touching! I won't spoil but I want to mention that I cried like there was no tomorrow when watched it for the first time. (So if you're someone who cries easily, prepare some tissues...) The relationship between our two main characters, xiao hei and wu xian is so funny, cute, and sweet! This is clearly depicted throughout the majority of the movie, typically beginning with a horrible encounter but slowly through their journey, they start to enjoy each other's company and have begun to care for one another when faced with adversity. I don't think there is anything lacking at all with this anime. The animation is simple yet extremely fluid. Even an amateur can draw these characters with no problem! I love its simplicity so I feel it's very rare to come across anime's like this which feels very cartoony making it so unique unlike other anime's at first glance.  Of course, I feel like it's a ""masterpiece"", which is a rare thing even for me. I'm extremely strict when it comes to ratings so you cannot go wrong with this movie!

9;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);ZoxsRoxs;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZoxsRoxs;9;Eye catching animation paired up with lots of action scenes leaves just enough space to flesh out the main characters.  The story follows a cat/spirit named Hei as he is thrown in a conflict between 2 factions of spirits and humans.  At first the main plot might seems like nothing special, but the line between good guys and bad guys quickly gets blurry as both side have fairly convincing motivation for their goals.  The main characters might seem overpowered at first while actually being fairly evenly matched against each other.  If you like fight scenes then you can not miss this one.;Recommended
0;Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji (Movie);cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;4;"Quick Thoughts: Much like the main series, the main appeal I got of this movie was its art and animation. Between its more well-defined characters, rich backgrounds, and smooth animation, it's a very noticeable improvement visually. That's about it though, the story hardly made sense to me. It's supposedly a prequel to the web-series, but I had a hard time this movie is even related.  Story: I think the story was supposed to show us how Xiaohei gets over his hate of humans. It starts with him displaced from his home in the forest by humans, and shortly after he meets another group of spirits with similar circumstances. He's then kidnapped a powerful human who works with larger group of spirits who are attempting to maintain a peaceful balance between humans and spirits. The rest the seems to going for some heartwarming story about mentor-student relationship between Xiaohei and this human with Xiaohei gaining a better understanding of both humans and his spirit powers. It was hard to it view it that way though since Xiaohei had no real choice in the matter. The human literally kidnapped him; any attempt to get away was thwarted or impossible altogether due to his transportation method. The last 15 minutes or so made no sense to me either. It felt like they just were making stuff up along the way to ensure a happy ending for Xiaohei.  Art: As mentioned before, I really did enjoy this movie visually. They took nice, simplistic style of the main series and turned it up a notch. The colors were vibrant, character designs much improved, and all of the fight scenes were explosive and exciting.  Sound: I thought they did a good job with the sound effects. which is something that usually doesn't stand out to me. Voice acting was bit flat at times, but serviceable overall. Don't remember any of the music standing out.  Characters: It was nice to see more personality out of Xiaohei, who was pretty one-dimensional in the web-series. None of the other characters really stood out to me.  Enjoyment: I watched the web-series beforehand thinking context would be helpful, but I think it actually took away from my enjoyment of the movie. I spent a lot time wondering how they were even related to each other. The movie went in-depth about many spirit related mechanics that were hardly present in the main series, and they ended up bending their own rules towards the end of the movie anyway.";Not Recommended
0;Lunn wa Kaze no Naka;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;"This film features and explores multiple complex themes including bullying, obsession, escapism and depression.  The story is about a boy. The boy seems to have difficulties at discerning the reality around him due to his psychological issues. The boy is walking home from school when he finds an attractive young girl and that is where the story starts.  The story is portrayed from a warped perspective as the perspective features the MCs own perspective combined with the reality surrounding him. This creates a conflict between the boys point of interest and the visual representation of that interest. This conflict is explored in a brilliant way throughout this film. Portrayal of this interest and conflict throughout the story can be observed through the interactions that the MC has with other characters that are present in the perceived reality compared to the MCs own perspective.  The multilayered perspective of the storytelling is featured in the art as well the reality around the MC is obscured visually in bits and his own perspective in highlighted throughout the film. The design also enhances the conflict between the interest of the MC and the perceived reality. Overall the visual atmosphere and presence of the film in think is representative of the message and story of the film and reinforces the multilayered setting that is present. It also enables us to be able to experience the duality that can be found in the philosophy of the MC.  Sound design is another part of the series that flows well with the duality and multilayered setting of the film, the perceived effects and characters sound is amplified compared to the more muffled design of the surrounding effects and sound design. This creates a sort of fever dream like atmosphere that is present throughout the series and is supported by the visual department of the film as well. Overall the experience whrn it comes to audio is representing the character really well.  Now probably the most interesting part of the film, the characters. The film focuses on one character, the boy who is the MC of the film, and his philosophy compared to the perceived reality surrounding him and his character. That alone would provide a interesting character but the way his philosophy is portrayed throughout the film and how its portrayal and his struggle relates to the perceived reality is the part that I'm most impressed with. His struggle consists of depression and escaping the perceived reality through his obsession. Through this predicament he creates another ""false"" setting for himself where he draws himself in a more ideal setting. Choosing to live in that setting instead of the perceived reality surrounding him. His interactions and denial of the perceived reality are presented in superb manner through his interactions with the characters residing in the perceived reality. His struggle coming to accept his delusion and confronting the perceived reality with the safety net of his own setting is portrayed in a interesting way. Another interesting factor is the relationship that he has with his dad. The visual representation of his dad is always obscured in the film which suggests that he doesn't accept his dad as a part of his setting. His dad belongs to the perceived reality. He knows this and puts on a facade to deceive himself creating an interesting internal conflict within himself. You can see his struggle with this conflict and how it eats away him.  Overall the film portrays the psychological mental issues with heavy themes in a brilliant manner so I'd recommend it if you're interested in good internal struggle and exploration of themes such as obsession, bullying, escapism and depression. It is rare to come across a such in depth exploration of these themes combined with a visual atmosphere and multilayered setting such as this one.";Recommended
0;Lunn wa Kaze no Naka;theolderaynati;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theolderaynati;3;"Lunn Flies into the wind is quite the story. The concept of a boy falling in love with a girl on a coffee poster is one I've never heard of before, and most likely neither have you. But if you're here then this must mean something about the story interests you (or you're just wasting time looking for something to add to your watchlist because why not).  Story (with some spoilers) - 3/10  Alright, so basically there's this boy (I forgot his name) who hates everything, school, his existence, guys who bully him, make fun of him... and all that other good stuff. One day after school while going back home, the boy passes through an alley with a bunch of posters on the wall. A certain poster catches his eye, with this beautiful girl on it, when it was basically just meant to be an advertisement for coffee, nothing more. The girl on the poster has the ability to talk, but could not live longer if she stays in that place and on the wall. That alley is very dirty and wet, so the paper will slowly get weaker and weaker until its no more. She also will lose her beauty (color of the picture) and fade away from the water, if she stays there any longer. The boy then takes the poster home and all the way to his bedroom wall to spend more time with girl in the picture. He then announces he has a girlfriend to his father while having lunch. A few days later, he takes the poster to school, and bullies find out about the poster by breaking into his locker. He then safely retrieves the poster from them, and goes back home all beaten up. The boy promises the girl would never get hurt again, but things lead to other things, and he then suddenly wants to commit suicide. The poster thankfully talks him out of it, by explaining that she is just a picture, and therefore she must be a picture of someone, so he should go meet that someone in real life. The boy then retrieves his will to live, and his goal in life was to find that girl and be with her. For over a year he searched for her, and finally manages to find the woman in the picture, but she's just an old woman at that time, married to the artist who created the coffee advertisement poster. The boy then storms back to his room in a fit of rage, realizing he technically just wasted a year of his life, and throws the poster under his bed. Time passes, and he eventually forgets about the girl on the poster - he had moved on with his life, (a smooth one if I may add). One day, he accidentally stumbles across the poster and hangs it up on his bedroom wall like old times. The doorbell suddenly rings and he meets a girl who looks exactly like the girl on the poster. The girl then explains she's the daughter of the woman on the poster, and she mysteriously looks almost identical to her. The boy had invited her to his room by then, and the poster suggests to be hidden because it would be weird if the girl saw her mother on a random boys' wall. The poster then flies into the wind since the boy placed her in a spot were she'd be susceptible to being sucked out. The boy and daughter then appear together on the balcony looking at the poster fly away, and they then basically became a thing from that moment.   My thoughts in short:  Even with a story as intriguing and weird as this, I knew from the moment the boy met the poster, things won't be taking off in a good direction. I thought to myself how could this possibly become any more interesting than that? You just met a talking poster. In the end I was right, the story had lost it's ""sparkle"" and was all basically downhill from there. The story started to drag, and I by then had lost interest near the end. The main character isn't likeable at all, and the animation was fine I guess. The ending had somewhat of a cozy feeling to it, but honestly I couldn't care less about the boy anymore at that point. This was not emotional at all, and considering it's supposed to at least make us feel some sort of way but failed at doing so, I was disappointed. Would not recommend Lunn wa Kaze no Naka ""Lunn Flies into the Wind"" to anyone. Don't have high hopes for this. It sadly won't deliver.";Not Recommended

Sure, it might not be something to spank your monkey to, but it will certainly choke some naughty laughs out of your chicken. ""Bok... bok... bokcock!""  Although the story of Lunatic Night is epic, don't try to follow it. Because it will only make your head spin. No. Just kidding. There is no story. But it is epic, and it will make your head spin. It starts with a very cliche mundane plot then throws you into ""epicness"" while flashing you with some ecchi scenes and slaps you across the face with parodies. World Wars, pyramids, lost civilizations, biblical references, floating castles, cat girls, Amazon women, fighting mecha robots with shooting vaginas. Yes. It's just that type of hentai. Insane, silly, hilarious, and nonsensical. But watch it with your doors locked because it is explicit with in-your-face sexual connotations that you just can't ignore.  With a mish-mash of slap-stick characters, Lunatic Nights tends to throw the viewers off. At the center is your average Joe protagonist, a blonde haired high school student who reads manga. Through the introduction of his friend (or foe) He is suddenly surrounded by a harem of females: cat girl, traditional Japanese maiden, and a tomboy with wings, all of them with unexpected transformations. They suddenly embark on a journey to either rule or destroy the world. Then you have your antagonist who is ambiguously portrayed as either friend or foe. His face is always hidden behind a smiling mask and his motives, unclear. He has his own harem as well. The two factions battle each other with silliness as different worlds collided and chaos reigns. In additions to the two opposing factions, there are a number of side characters who make brief appearances who are just as crazy and hilarious.  Even with so much hilarity, art and animation is one of its short-comings. The 3 episode OVA was made in the late nineties, so you'll have to forgives its simplicity. As you can expect, there are not a lot of details that went into the private areas, the animation is not smooth, and there are a lot of abnormalities in the art. So it really doesn't make it that much greater even if it is uncensored. But that is okay, because it is a comedy first, hentai second.  Character voicing was rather good. Each character was befitting of its voice. The music wasn't anything memorable. The sounds and FX are dated and sometimes rather odd and off cue, but that just adds to the humor that is Lunatic Nights.  Overall, if your looking for some naughty cheap laughs, then watch Lunatic Nights. It'll have you going ""WTF?!"" in a humorous way. I certainly found it hilarious.";Recommended

Extremely happy how it came out.  Story - I previously read and left the only review for Luger Code 1951's with the assumption it was getting a fully series adaptation. I was extremely disspointed to learn it was getting a one episode ona release, which is why I'm giving an 8. Otherwise, the story sticks pretty straight forward to the , with little things here and there that aren't that big of a deal. More of a bit of a rant/pleading at the bottom.  Art - I think the art was pretty good and straight forward with it's animation. Studio Deen apparently has some trouble with its quality of animation and I saw a little bit why, mainly because a few scenes looked a little out of whack, but nothing terrible. Great on the eyes and enjoyable.  Soubd - This sounded amazing honestly. No intro or outro, but there was a credit's scene that had some amazing music playing. The ona was just beautiful on my ears and everything sounded great with the show.  Character - God I can't empasize how well the characters are, espexially Yonaga, the wolf girl that the entire ""plot"" is centered around. I loved her character in the and I think she's even better in the ona. She was pretty serious toned in the , and that translated over well. They also gave her a few scenes of slight cominc relief that eased tension. She aslo had a couple scenes when she blushed, and god damn it was so cute. Love her so much, defintely a new top tier character. Every other character was played extremely well compared to the .  Enjoyment - Now this is obviously the most biased category because I just happen to enjoy this genre. I also love cutesy type moments, which Luger Code had a few of. This is something that just appealed to me extremely well.  Honestly, I feel this series would get so much feedback and praise if it got a whole season. There's so much you can do with the storyline and I think it would make an amazing action/romance/adventure genre. For the love of god please someone make this a full length series. Yonaga is one of my favorite characters from Fall 2016 so far, and I don't know if that'll change anytime soon. I'm so happy I was able to watch this, and I hope other people can see the enjoyment I saw in it.  If you like cute and amazing wolf girls, Yonaga is the one for you my friend.";Recommended
0;Luger Code 1951;deathkira95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/deathkira95;5;"I honestly expected this to be a full length series, but evidently, it's just an ONA. Which makes me wonder why the overall quality of the animation and art is so sub par. And then I remembered it's Studio Deen.  The story is based on a 3 chapter manga and shouldn't be expected to provide too many answers. The world building was sub par, leaving me with a rather vague idea of what's going on in the world. There's an opinion that the story is supposed to be about military, but I really didn't feel that that was the main focus of the story. The main character had almost no connection with the military other than being hired. The female lead is a wolf girl. I'm not really sure what the author was really gunning for with this.  In the end, all I got out of it was a interesting idea for ""humanity's next enemy"" and some rather poorly animated action scenes.  The studio that made this, Studio Deen, is renown for rather poor animation quality. Most notably, Studio Deen picking up Log Horizon and taking it through the gutter. There were a lot of art problems and animation problems that really shouldn't be there for a one off ONA like this.  All in all, it's rather disappointing that there isn't anymore to the story, but at the same time, fortunate that Studio Deen doesn't get to mess up the experience some more.

1;Luger Code 1951;juniornff;https://myanimelist.net/profile/juniornff;5;"English: IF YOU WILL READ THIS BY SITTING THAT YOU SEE LUGER CODE 1951  Where to begin? To say that the special was interesting, for me a special, OVA or ONA has to invite me to look for its original source (anime / manga), but since its manga has only 3 chapters, I feel that, in order to make me want to look for more , I feel that he is showing me all that the series can offer me.  Putting that aside, and taking as the only material to analyze the special, there I have to say that I liked, although the plot of the werewolves is already refined, they put something that gives a particular tone to the whole show, which Yes, one of the things that affected me a little was the personality of the protagonists, I feel that more than contributing to the series, its only purpose is to introduce them as homo couple, since 1. the voice of the Testa sounds very feminine to me, 2 That someone (male) calls sempai to another does not inspire confidence, and more that lives him whining, (eye, not that I despise him at all, I appreciate his great determination in his convictions). Also, I get tired of that ""damn blood"" ""special race"" and things like that, but it's already my thing.  I feel that even being a chapter, the series could offer more, and if this adapting well the manga, because their bases are weak, in conclusion, is a series that only fills a space that may have been more than it was.   Español: SI VAS A LEER ESTO DA POR SENTADO QUE VISTE LUGER CODE 1951  Por donde comenzar? Decir que el especial fue interesante, para mi un especial, OVA o ONA tiene que invitarme a buscar de su fuente original (anime/manga), pero ya que su manga tiene solo 3 capítulos, siento que, en ver de hacerme querer buscar mas, siento que me esta mostrando todo lo que puede ofrecerme la serie.  Poniendo eso de lado, y tomando como único material a analizar el especial, ahí he de decir que me gusto, aunque la trama de los hombres lobo ya esta refrita, lo ponen algo que le da un tono particular a todo el show, lo que si, una de las cosas que me afectaron un poco fue la personalidad de los protagonistas, siento que mas que aportar a la serie, su único propósito es meterlos de pareja homo, ya que 1. la voz del Testa me suena muy femenina, 2. que alguien (varón) llame sempai a otro no me inspira confianza, y mas que le vive lloriqueando, (ojo, no es que lo desprecie del todo, aprecio su gran determinación en sus convicciones). También, ya me canso de eso de ""sangre maldita"" ""raza especial"" y cosas así, pero ya es cosa mía.  Siento que aun siendo un capitulo, la serie podría ofrecerme más, y si esta adaptando bien el manga, pues sus bases están débiles, en conclusión, es una serie que solo llena un espacio, que pudo haber sido mas de lo que fue.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Smithy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Smithy;9;"The &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; OVA is made up of several short stories or chapters. A coherent plot or over spanning arc is hence not present, but this is not uncommon for &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; and the different short stories ensure the OVA will have something enjoyable for everyone. From a slice of life story, to a full blown comedy or parody story to a heart warming tale, the OVA touches upon all of the types that were featured in the series.  Being all about Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa and Miyuki, it's a bit of a shame the other characters were featured less. Yutaka, Minami, Patricia and Tamura only appear in the first story, Misao, Ayano and Nanako sensei appear briefly in the other tales. But this is normal given the time restraints.  Typical for &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; are the many references and parodies on current or older anime, as well as otaku and game culture. Some hilarious examples are Patricia's ぜつぼうした(zetsubou shita), Nanako sensei's rare item Pizza shield, Kagami's cosplay as Vocaloid's Hatsune Miku,...  The first story was centred around Minami's dog Jerry and how he encounters everyone throughout his day. A nice slice of life tale to start the OVA with it also held some great laughs. It was followed by a story showing Konata and Nanako-sensei playing an mmorpg together with Kagami and Tsukasa, told in game which lent itself to some 3D CG visuals and funny mmorpg humour. A dream sequence story brought us Konata dressed in &ldquo;The Melancholy Of Suzumiya Haruhi&rdquo; Yuki's sorceress outfit taking Kagami who was transformed into Volcaloid's Hatsune Miku's outfit -complete with leek- out on an evening filled with magic. Next was a volleyball match with the Hiiragi sisters on opposing teams which turned out to be a more heart warming story, one couldn't help but root for Tsukasa. Then followed a school camp tale told by Miyuki to her mother about how she and her friends erred from the correct path while heading to their camp and ended up wandering around the forest until late at night. The closing scenes were a more psychedelic dreamlike scene which did not appeal to me that much alas as I understood little of the humour in it.  The ending credits feature a live action clip of Akira Kogami's seiyuu Ai Nonaka and Minoru Shiraishi, which I found enjoyable a lot funnier than the live action closing scenes featured in the series. It was uncanny how at times Ai Nonaka's performance and facial expressions were so spot on, one would almost think the Akira persona is based on her. Minoru Shiraishi as always is a hoot, that guy is so silly!   Like all of Kyoto Animation's productions, the animation was good, but not especially better than the series itself as the typical and somewhat more simple visual style of &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; does not lend itself to the same visual feats as other series Kyoto Animation has animated are treated to. The subdued color palette and character appearances reinforce this impression. However they did use the OVA to experiment more with different animation types and scene effects for &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo;, as is apparent in the psychedelic dream scene or the mmorpg in game scenes.  The soundtrack was good and featured tunes from the television series, however the series' opening track &ldquo;Motteke! Sailor fuku&rdquo; was omitted entirely.   The &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; OVA was terrific, full of laughs and a must for &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; fans, it has the exact same atmosphere as the series so it doesn't feel particularly special but you will feel as if watching the next episode, which is fine with me as the &ldquo;Lucky Star&rdquo; series was awesome.";Recommended
1;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Uushie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Uushie;9;The Lucky Star OVA was very well done. It brings fans back to the series of lucky star and includes all the characters that you have gotten to know and love... excluding a few characters... Lucky Star generally never has a real story to it but the small episodes in it seemed to flow very nicely. Since there really is no true story, I had to rate the story as a 7/10. To people who are unfamiliar with Lucky Star, watching the OVA might make you confused because you don't know what is going on. However, if you watched the series then the OVA should make perfect sense to you. All the stories were fairly good but near the end, with the pet store, it was funny but it could have been better. Personally it was not my cup of tea but it still had its moments.  The art is very well done as usual. The characters seem to look the same and the art style had not changed since the series. It is pleasent to look at and it doesn't have extremely and unnecessary shiny characters. The 2nd story in the OVA is very well done as that is what many MMOs look like.  Sound: The sound was the same, nothing really special changed from the series to the OVA. One can expect the same quality as they did in the series.  Characters: It is very nice to see most of the characters again. It is even better to still see them with their original personalities. Kagami is still her usual self and Konata is still a crazy otaku.  Enjoyment: You can expect that this OVA is done just as well as the series. If you didn't like the series, you will not enjoy the OVA. If you did like the series, you might think the OVA is a bit of a disapointment. However, it is still worth the 45 minutes to watch.;Recommended
2;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;ukonkivi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ukonkivi;8;Well the thing about this review is it's directly compared to the other series, favorably or unfavorably. And after just writing a Lucky Star review, I thought it was only right that I write a Lucky Star OVA review. In fact, I only got up the energy to write a Lucky Star review to the community.  So, now that I've filled out the preface, it's time to get to the individual qualities of the short movie. Or actually, just medium as an OVA.  1. Story Well how does one comment on one story, that's slice of life episodic comedy? Well, you rate it on being an episodic, slice of life comedy. This one doesn't quite pace as the other one did. And has quite a bit of cool down and then short spurts of comedy. It's not so chatty and eventful as the main series.  In this way it does make it feel a bit more like a movie. But at the same time, it doesn't do what it does quite well as it did with the main series. You expect more out of it than you get. It moves slow and uneventful, and ends before you know it. Well at least in it's favor, it ends long before you want it to end.  2. Art It's the same great artwork as before. And there's no change at all. So there's really nothing to say about this. It's the iconic moe art style we know and love Lucky Star for.  Ten out of ten.  3. Sound Well you know...I didn't even notice the sound too much this time around. It doesn't have that memorable opening song that I remember. And it all seemed sort of quiet. Too quiet at times. It didn't really have to have all the music though.  And the character voices were as cute as ever.  4. Character I think I have to commend them for spending the time they did on characters like Patricia Martin. But overall, it felt like when it was supposed to be a party, that it was an empty party. I think this part...this...OVA..was lacking in some of the character charm and development that Lucky Star often had. In the case with everything with this OVA, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good.  5. Enjoyment Even if an OVA isn't as good, it's a Lucky Star OVA. Meaning we'll love it. Seriously, how long were we starved for this? Too long. I went through every second of this thinking how I couldn't believe I was getting to watch more Lucky Star and fearful of every minute I drew closer to the end. It might have not been jam packed with the same about of fun as the main series, but it was still a lot of fun and well worth the watch.  6. Overall Overall, it was what the number 8 says. It was very good. And well worth the watch and very much needed, beyond needed. It was almost cruel how long we had to wait. But it wasn't every thing Lucky Star was. I think a person is better off watching Lucky Star the series first, and then watching this because they're still absolutely starved like I was for more. It may not be one hundred percent as good as the original, but it's still got the magic. I don't want anyone to think and to get the impression that because it doesn't shine just as hard as Lucky Star the TV series that it's not every bit a good and enjoyable anime. It's a quality watch and I recommend it to anyone.;Recommended
3;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Amikke;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Amikke;10;This is overkill. This one episode is probably one of the most hilarious anime episodes I've watched so far. It's like a one really big point to whole Lucky Star series. There are jokes about: Azumanga Daioh, Bakemonogatari, of course Haruhi, Hatsune Miku, and many more. I was laughing my ass off for quite a while watching it. This is why I gave it 10/10, better score than Lucky Star itself.;Recommended
4;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Fantasiaanzu1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fantasiaanzu1;9;Lucky Star was a very good series, and this OVA just continues the madness. It's not very funny to start with, with only one or two jokes, but as it moves on to the random story lines, it gets funnier. I think that this is a must watch for any enthusiasts of the Lucky Star anime. It continued the 'Legendary Girl A' gag and helped develop things between Kagami and her sister. The only thing I found disappointing was the lack of Haruhi references, but that is trivial compared to Konata's 'Heaven has abandoned us' scene. All in all, Lucky Star OVA is a anime I highly recommend!;Recommended
5;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;XxCyberPunKyxX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/XxCyberPunKyxX;8;"Ahh the Lucky Star OVA. While it didn't fully capture the spirit of the anime series, it's still great that we are fortunate to even see the clan again after the anime was finish, so I can't really complain too much. The only saving grace *for me at lease* was that Konata was funnier and otaku as ever and I liked Tsukasa more in the movie then in the anime series because she was ""cuter"" I didn't like that the Lucky Channal was live action it was not funny almost unwatchable and it was much shorter then I expected to be only around 43 minutes long";Recommended

7;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;YuiHirasawa-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YuiHirasawa-;9;This will probably be the shortest review I will ever write.  As I said in my review for the Lucky Star series, KyoAni constantly references and criticizes the anime genre as a whole. Significantly, it also references and criticizes consumers of anime, including those watching the series. This OVA goes exactly one step further, exploring what would happen if the viewers’ volition filters back into the anime. What would happen if the fandom – and its associated theories, frustrations, and obsessions – become part of the show itself? Well, you get this OVA, which in Lucky Star fashion follows the same plotless, trope-filled, single-sided characterization that the main series is known for.  For better or worse, you absolutely do need to have seen the main series before seeing this, as this OVA interacts differently with those who are familiar with its characters and style. Watched the series? Yes, you need to watch this too.;Recommended
8;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;robert788;https://myanimelist.net/profile/robert788;10;The OVA set is a 45-minute segment of short stories that attribute themselves to the characters. They follow the same premise of fun that the main series follows. I will not ruin this segment by explaining the short stories.  Art is the same as before which is perfect.  Sound is also the same as before but at the end uses live-action which has been seen already but the Lucky Channel live-action in this format has not.  Characters don't develop anymore as this is not what the segment is about.  Enjoyment is as before which is perfect to which it is a hilarious set. Make sure to google the meaning of the censored phrase that Kagami says.  Overall it is definitely worth a watch and lifted my spirits having just completed the main series.;Recommended
9;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Tris_Otaking;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tris_Otaking;9;"(Originally written for Anilist)  Warning: this review was made for people that already watched the Lucky Star anime ill probably do a review of that too  Its safe to say that Lucky Star is now considered an anime classic of the late 2000s, along side series like Gurren Laggan, Death Note, Haruhi, Higurashi, Black Lagoon, Code Geass ect... but I don't hear that much people talking about its OVA special, realeased a year after the show concluded (on a very high note in my honest opinion).  Its now commonplace for an anime to have an OVA special episode, either as a Blu-Ray exclusive or as a bundle with one of the volumes of the show's manga, but this a much different beast, as this was, again, made a year after the end of the show and was realeased on its own; also, this OVA does something that the show didn't do at all: it is an experimental Lucky Star Anthology!  In order to review this proprely, we got to look at each short stories (theres six of them in total) and see their strenghts and weaknesses, ready? lets go!  Story n°1: Cherry This story serves as our opening and our only story with the secondary main characters (Yukata, Minami, Hiyori and Patricia), but mostly on Minami and her dog, Cherry. Most of the segment is the secondary characters interacting with the girls.  While this short is cute and all, its end is what forshadow the more bizarre shorts later on, as its heavily implied that (SPOILER) Cherry dies, a twist that feels really dark for what we had seen earlier in the short (SPOILER)  overall quality: 7/10 cute but the ending does kinda arrives out of nowhere Story n°2: MMORPG This story, if canon to the tv series, should take place during episode 16, its been mentioned a lot of times that Konata and her teacher Nanako plays the same MMORPG game, but we never saw what does the game look like, this short basically answers that question and finally answer that question that, well not a lot of people asked, but the effort made to make the MMORPG look as real as possible is admirable and shows how talented the staff is.  the only bad point is that its by far the weakest short in terms of comedy, but theres still a few good jokes here and there. 8/10  Story n°3: Tsundere-lla If theres one short that would be considered to be a fan favorite, its most definitely that one. this is straight up Cinderella parody and basically thats all you need to know, I recommand to check that one for yourselves, its hilarious and the funniest short of the OVA.  9,5/10  Story 4: Volleyball Tsukasa wasn't one of the deepest characters in the show, lets all be honest here, she is really most of the time the air head cutie we all know and love, but this short attemps at giving her a bit more personallity.  We discover a Tsukasa angry about being the shadow of her sister Kagami, and tries to proove to everyone that she matters just as much as her sister, on a match of volleyball against her. I remember not enjoying this short as much as the other ones back in my first watch, but i did talk with friends online saying it was their favorites, not only its one of the more normal stories of the OVA, but the given depth of Tsukasa really makes the character even more likeable than before. 8/10 not really my cup of tea, but its just as interesting as the other shorts.  Story 5: Camping Being lost in the woods with yours friends can be quite scary, well thats happened to Konata and Co in this short, however, this short tells the story narrated by Miyuki's point of view (even if a lot of the quote are actually Haruhi references).  I know a lot of people who thinks that Miyuki is ""boring"" and ""uninteresting"", mostly because she is the ""seeminly perfect"" type character of the show, but Ive always liked her, in both ways mind you, and here, Miyuki serves as a great narrator to a story that would have been boring otherwise, plus those camping uniform are just adorable 8,5//10  Story 6: ??? I think at this point, the director went crazy and just made a 3 minutes horror sequence that just so happens to have the four main girls, like Tsundere-lla, I cannot describe you what the actual hell is happening without spoiling the experience, just know that theres a Sgt Frog cameo. 9/10  Soooo... that was a hell of a ride, this OVA is overall amazing, its just the ultimate testament to how well this characters are: if they can put them in any situation and doing great work with it like they did here, then those characters are truely not just moeblob throwaway characters, don't y'all think?  I was going to give it the same rating as the show, a 9,3/10, but its experimental nature is so charming to me I'll give it an extra 0,1, a must watch for Lucky Star fans!";Recommended
0;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;lovelyphantom;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lovelyphantom;6;For an OVA that is suppose to be for Lucky Star... it wasn't very good.  The ova consists of a couple of mini-episodes that were suppose to be for the amusement of fans. Where was that amusement, might I ask.  The first story that began had more to do with the dog than with the characters themselves. Basically, it was more of the dog sleeping, with a few glimpses and actions from the characters. Not the best to start out with. Shortly after, we have an RPG game.. and though it is nice to see some 3-D type action.. it was rather annoying that all they did was talk, and repeat in battle sequences. 'sighs' Really I was starting to loose my interest.  Finally, we get something entertaining in the 3rd mini-episode. The Cinderella type story, with Konata as the fairy god mother, or should I say god witch. Here is where I can see why some fans would want to watch the OVA for. It was very amusing to see Konata up to her silly but cool and layed back type antics. The wrestling (though I am not a fan) was rather interesting, especially seeing as it took the form of the ball in the story. The ending was also hilarious too. Then we have the Vollyball game.. not as good as the Cinderella type story, but almost... Sisters against each other, along with two other friends (yes.. Konata included). I must say it was fun to watch them go at one another in attempt to be each other, and with an interesting outcome.. 'chuckles' So amusing.  Then there was some strange man trying to sell Konata's RPG character some items... and then it skipped to the camping story. And when my enjoyment rouse... it fell. The group is lost within the woods, thanks to Konata, and trying to find their way to the camp grounds. All they really did was walk around and talk.. which was pretty boring half the time. I think the only enjoyment I got was watching Konata proclaim they were going to die... Finally we have the sensei's house which was very short and... very confusing. I think that is the only word I have for that.. that it was very confusing, and yet ridiculous to the point it forced a laugh out of you.  And then the ending.. well.. the ending I just ended up hitting my skip button.. that was just.. They were... Okay there are no words to phrase how utterly stupid then ending was. 'chuckles'  My rating for the story a five.  The animation in Lucky Star, like always it was very good, but it is different this time comparing it with the RPG 3-D effects. Something about seeing the characters in 3-D sort of rubbed me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong, it is nice to see them come to life in 3-D instead of remaining in 2-D, but I just.. I don't know. I think it had something to do with the gaming effects... Something about them could of used a bit more something. So the art work is seven.  The sound.. I didn't like the ending song.. Nope.. did not. I did love the voices, seeing as they nailed the characters personality dead on. But it was brought down a peg by the gaming effects... Seriously, something is missing...  Okay, boredom sort of brings your view of the characters down a couple of notches so do not be mad at me. The characters were good.. they brought a nice ingrediants to the min-shows, even if the show was boring...'twitch' They were kept well in character in my opinion. I don't have much to say other than that.. and Konata was most certainly amusing in her witch costume.  My enjoyment is a four. Simple as that.. I didn't really find my enjoyment rising in this. It fell a great deal with the first two mini-shows, but rouse by the 3rd and 4rth shows, but dropped again shortly after. Really, it wasn't very good as I had hoped. 'sighs' It did give me a good laugh now and again, so it deserves a four for descent. In other words it wasn't all bad.  Overall, I think it was a pretty fair OVA, considering that it gave us fans something more from the series, and showed what they would look like in a more 3-D type nature. It also provided a nice sense of humor, and show a good deal of care for ones pet.. Yeah, it may have been boring, but it wasn't all that bad. I think a six is a fair overall rating for it.;Mixed Feelings

0;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;Micsupreeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Micsupreeme;4;Unfortunately, This extended OVA didn't really bring about anything new, the whole production felt a bit chaotic, i feel.  Obviously, as a fan of the original series, i was looking forward to seeing our beloved characters in a feature length title. To an extent, this OVA delivered as well... The art, sound, and character interactions were on par with the main show. Particularly at the start, i was able to enjoy once again the comedic, casual, SoL genius that i remember a while back.  My favorite part has got to be the game visualizations, it really was an awesome idea to factor these in. The overall inclusion of gaming culture really blended in well with the characters, and in my mind exposed a common, yet often untold plight in real life about gamers.  So for the most part, i did enjoy the show, mostly this was limited to the immediate term though. As, unfortunately, there was no prominent main story here, and this is where the review starts to go downhill... Upon watching this, i couldn't shake the feeling that it all seemed quite chaotically put together, it seemed to be more of a montage of episode ideas that for some reason were never included, than a feature length production. On top of this, it was also quite disappointing that there were no additions, or alternate insights into the world of Lucky Star. Thus meaning that already, I've forgotten a lot of what happens.  Ultimately, i wouldn't recommend this as a film, because it lacks plot, and isn't particularly memorable. If however you go in, in preparation just to experience more of Lucky Star's charm, i'm sure you'll enjoy being reunited with the characters.;Not Recommended
1;Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation;isumi-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/isumi-chan;4;Lucky Star OVA The Story was a 5. There was no main story really. Again on my lucky star TV review the story had no specialty. But I kinda enjoyed it but to be honest I had seen better. The Art was a 7. I quite enjoyed the character design. To be honest the background art was poor. There was nothing great about it. It just let me down really. The Sound was a 3. The same OST plays over and over and over again. It gets really annoying. The Voice Acting was fair but not the best. The Character's was a 6. I liked Konata's personality. She reminded me of myself always doing homework reading manga and watching anime! Enjoyment was a 4. I do not regret watching this OVA but on some levels I was hoping it would be better than the TV series. But They were about the same. Overall it was a 4. I don't like giving anime a super low score like 1. But if I kind of enjoyed this anime I think it should deserve a 4. Check out this anime if you like being random. Boys I don't recommend boys to watch this its more of a girls anime. SO go check this out if your interested.;Not Recommended
0;Lucky☆Star;FireBallsDJ;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FireBallsDJ;10;"""This is so BORING!"" is what most of you will say if you watch it. I'll admit, that is what I thought at first, and I stopped watching on the first episode when they were talking about which side is the head of a ""chocolate cornet bread""... But after a while, I gave it another try, and this time, I watched patiently and watched through the entire first episode. I was still not impressed, and still bored. I moved on to the next episode, and as you can tell by my over-all rating of a 10, I loved the rest. Now here is why: The story, is non-existent (as I will put no emphasis on story in this review). But that was one of the main reasons I loved it. There was no tension, no fighting, no drama, no heart-breaks. Just pure comedy. Comedy? Well, there's nothing that will make you roll over. But, there are countless moments where it makes you smile, many times even chuckles if you get the jokes. The comedy works in this anime by having the characters go through moments where you go like, ""OH I feel you!"", ""I totally know what you mean!, or ""Ah so glad I am not the only one who does that!"". That's why it's really funny in a way, making this the most accurate ""slice of life"" I have ever viewed. The English dub for this anime is pretty amazing (for once), the voice actor for Konata, the main character, does a wonderful job of bring her to life. The characters are all likable, but Konata is one of the best characters I have seen, and she manages to do all that without geass powers or sword skills, too. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will leave it up to you to find out more about why I find Konata so great. Also, it's a huge plus if you are exposed to Japanese culture (real life), because many of the jokes is about the daily life there and you will only get the jokes if you have experienced it (there aren't that many, so don't worry). To sum it up, Lucky Star is about the daily life of the girls, there won't be any conflicts like there are in many slice of life anime, this anime is very peaceful, and you can relate to many of the characters. Give it a try! Watch a few clips of it! Type in ""Funny Lucky Star Moments"" on Youtube and see for yourself! If you like it, WATCH IT. Don't marathon it, in fact, watch an episode after a long day, or better yet, watch it to calm your nerves after something like Code Geass/Death Note. Thank you";Recommended
1;Lucky☆Star;DaBigD;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DaBigD;10;"Erm...So i have now re-watched it for second time...This is my first time doing something like that. Raki ☆ Suta!  Story: Most common mistake people make is that they say Lucky Star doesn't have a story. It has! ""The daily lives of 4 high school girls."" Understood? Good. Can't say much here, because of the randomness of ""slice of life"" genre. Still, I like how the story progress, except for the first few episodes which people usually don't understand what the series is about - which is director's fault. *shrugs* He got fired after the first four episodes anyway. If you think this story is bad, wait 'till you see Mars of Destruction. 8/10  Art: Yeah, I know that the art is nothing compared to KyoAni's usual productions, but is far better than them in one aspect, cuteness. Anyone who have watched the series can tell that how cute Konata is. Most of the scenes aren't really detailed, you usually see the upper parts of the characters, but that doesn't change how well cuteness goes with Miyuki's 'ultimade moe-ness', Konata's children-like personality and Tsukasa's 'little sister-ish' figure. BTW, background is detailed, proof (was) here, now destroyed with the absence of BBCodes. 8/10  Sound: This one varies a lot, depending on how many animes you've seen. The OP is catchy, and goes with the cuteness of the anime. The different endings were a good addition to anime, but if you haven't heard the songs before, you may think that a single ending theme would be better. And for the second part of the EDs, Shiraishi Minoru does awesome job. You still may not know some of the songs sung by him, but just watching him is entertaining too. I love how KyoAni toys with their own songs. The sound effects and OST isn't really obvious, but I can say that how it goes with the flow and is ""cute"" really enhances the dialogues. Especially when Kona-chan is about to start saying a funny comment about Kagami, the way music stops right before it and you can guess it coming. 8/10  Characters: Probably you can't learn their personalities in just one episode, but as the time goes on, you learn more and more about their personality. Even in the second half of the anime where they introduce new characters, no character gets more screentime than another. If they do, well, KyoAni is sure to make a joke about them! They are so unique and easy to remember. OK, not really unique (Kagami as you typical tsundere and Miyuki as you typical moe) but they are unique in their own ways. No wait! According to Shiraishi, Kagami isn't tsundere! Oh well, I don't care about what he thinks. Kagami is tsundere. 9/10  Enjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? Great jokes, mainly based Suzumiya Haruhi and everyday problems of the world and Japan. Again, if you haven't watched Haruhi yet, you won't be able to get even the half of the jokes. That said, if you have watched it, you'll probably love the jokes. Azumanga Daioh is pretty much the same as Lucky Star, both having jokes based on pure randomness. School Rumble is more romance oriented, but still on par with them. If I had to pick one of them, it'd definitely be Lucky Star. 10/10  Overall: This series is a definitely a must-see for someone who has some anime knowledge and interested in slice of life/comedy genre. Lucky Star is a win or lose situation. Either you hate it, or you love it. If you like it, it will probably certainly be one of your favourite animes. If you don't like the slice of life/comedy genre and don't have fun finding all those references, I suggest that you don't watch it. Be sure to watch Haruhi beforehand, if you are going to watch Lucky Star. 10/10";Recommended
2;Lucky☆Star;Faust721;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Faust721;8;"What happens when you combine my favorite genre (Slice of Life) with my favorite studio (Kyoto Animation)? You get Lucky Star.  Story: Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank.  But I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of it is tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at. This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.  Another aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.  Art/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni's best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.  Sound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it.  Music - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the &quot;different&quot; ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast.  Character: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can't help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.  Enjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)  Overall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.";Recommended
3;Lucky☆Star;reb3llist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reb3llist;9;"I've gotta hand it to you Lucky Star haters, you cease to amaze me. No, I'm not some illogical retard who loves Twilight or crap like that, I'm pretty much one who has logic, in all seriousness I love logic. When you see me posting illogical stuff and me not admitting it, then I was either a) trolling or b) being drunk (I tend to lose myself when it's really late or really early in the morning but not drink beer drunk).  I wanted to write this review because I was just overwhelmed seeing people who hate Lucky Star just because of their whorish fans. I know some of your friends keep bitching to you how epic win Lucky Star is and that you MUST, NO MATTER WHAT MUST like Lucky Star but hey I won't force you, I'm just here to tell you,""NOT ALL LUCKY STAR FANS ARE RETARDS, HENCE STOP STEREOTYPING US."" That's all.  Now I won't go in the real scoring method (other than for the review itself) of discussing stuff one-by-one but rather, I'll try to argue with the haters' views, call this review some kind of liaison for those of you haven't watched and those who have, loving it or hating it, I assure you I won't get biased.  Now let's get to the most criticized part that I think is getting RIDICULOUS amounts of criticism: THE PLOT. Alright, how many slice-of-life anime shows have no plot? Seriously, a criticism you come up with IT HAS NO STORY LAWL! I'm not trying to offend you, not at all (and I swear I'm not being sarcastic) but that's ridiculous. I've seen lots of anime shows with no plot and I still liked it. Plot or no plot, it's EXECUTION that matters. A game with excellent plot but poor gameplay would probably result in the gamer only finishing it once and not ever again just because of the plot (considering that the gamer likes storylines that is) but a game with poor plot but excellent gameplay would be re-played numerous times like what I do with Devil May Cry 3.  Honestly, if this were not a haters-vs-lovers review I'm making, I would rate the plot as -/10 because it's almost non-existent (aside from daily lives) and usually I won't even judge the plot of animes which don't have any solid plot in the first place. What the hell is useful in judging something that's not there? Shows can concentrate on many points: some concentrate on action (hence, art and maybe storyline), some can go on plot stuff (hence, THE PLOT) and some can go for humour (hence, execution) or even slice of life (which is usually based on how well you can relate to it). If you fail to get the premise of my words in this paragraph, you fail it and I'll say to you,""Go away, you're not worth reading this thing.""  It's simple logic really. But to be fair, since these types of Anime (about daily lives of people) are usually just that (aside from some Animes like Honey & Clover which explores far deeper into their lives, making even more sub-plots) I'll give it a 6.5/10 in the review, rounded off to 7. They should have some kind of decimal rating stuff here =_=  Also, since it's similar to a sitcom where you start off here and end at the same place you started, some may dislike it but I don't really mind. I just feel that instant liking to the characters.  Then the art, yeah people have different opinions. I can't say much. It's really love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing so I won't criticize either side for their respective views on this, although I realize that it's purposely acting cute and aiming to be highly-loli-like for teh lulz, some people just won't take this crap >_>  I like the moe and cute art so I give it an 8 here. Yeah call me biased and loli, I won't care when illogical people call on me for no reason at all.  The sounds, ALSO love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the OP song and ED stuff that were sing by Minoru Shiraishi (especially ep 13, 17 and 22) and the soundtrack sounds quite nice. It fits in with the flow and the atmosphere, which is hands-down relaxing. It's a no-brainer that there won't be any epic soundtracks coming from here. I also like the soft OP that was transitioned into an instrumental at Ep 24. If you'd like to compare this anime's OST to, say.. being fair in the slice-of-life genre, Honey & Clover, after some consideration, is comparing a more variety-rich soundtrack in melancholy and whacky pieces (H&C) with a more cheerful and light-toned soundtrack suited for a happy life (LS). I give it an 8. It's excellent at its very best which I more or less expected with its soothing soft music and some great ones. I'd actually recommend you getting this if it weren't for those 10+ BGM CD's that you'd have to get to get them all. Troublesome really, most soundtracks are in 1 CD but this is different =_= feels like they're cashing in or something. With Minoru Shiraishi and the different Character songs, I give this probably 8.4 after more exploration. I couldn't give this an 8.5 or else I'll be rounding off to a 9.  I recommend the whole BGM soundtrack to be honest and maybe 100% nai nai nai on Kagami's Character song. Maybe it's just my taste but I honestly think it's one of the better than most other songs there. Again, people's tastes differ in art so nothing to talk abou here.  The seiyuu wasn't all that bad but with so many people having lots of different preferences I can't criticize this point much. Like people say, different people have different opinions, or as one of the anime title say,""10 people, 10 colours"" which means different people, different minds. I'd like to give the seiyuu a 8 though, seems like the main cast's voice fits too perfects and I feel I sense laziness from some departments but then it's not really annoying or really for the comedy (e.g, most of the extras sound exactly the same).  Onto the characters, I can see how people can dislike Tsukasa, Miyuki and the other side characters but it kinda strikes me how people seem to think that we love Konata simply because she's loli + otaku thus loli otaku thus INSTA-WIN! Or some sort. I, for one, simply love Konata because I actually am like her. I love to procrastinate (but it's slowly going away :D), I love games to death (up to the point that I don't sleep for 31 hours), I love anime too. The similarities make me relate to her in so many ways and being a younger brother, it was interesting to see how she felt being like an older sister, maybe I've never really seen that in my brother before.  Not sure how people hate Konata. Probably they hate her just because other Lucky Star fans who are whores (there are people like these the same way there are Twitards [Twilight Retards]) keep persisting and bitching that she's the best character in the world. Whatever, if you're a hater, here's an advice: they're idiots, don't listen to them. AT ALL.  Kagami is your typical tsundere but less of the slapstick tsuntsun or stuff like Louise or Taiga who are world-famous tsundere champs. Honestly I find her character great. She's the responsible type, hell if I will, she's Tohsaka Rin a la Lucky Star. She just socializes more with these friends than Tohsaka Rin from FSN does and honestly Kagami teases people less than what Tohsaka does and is more open than she is (sadly, if you don't know her, then you could ask around, she's like a common house-hold name in Anime these days >_>). One of her main attractive features is probably her looks, her hairstyle and her behaviour + chemistry with Konata.  Tsukasa, Kagami's younger sister is your typical moe, shy, cutesy-cute character who's the pinnacle of air-heads in Lucky Star. Yeah I can still see how people hate her. Air-heads like these are sometimes boring characters and honestly, I never truly loved her the way I loved Kagami and Konata so yeah.  Miyuki though, I can get why people dislike her, again. She's the glasses girl - silent, not too out-going, caring, helpful, wears glasses, is clumsy - and the usual smart type. Over-used stereotype, I know so I won't be bashing either side for loving or hating it although so far I think I've only criticized a hater. Tell me where I'm wrong and I'd love to ask you some stuff and for you to ask me some stuff so I can see why people hate this so much.  I believe people hated ep 1 - 4 because their director was changed after ep 4 and it got a whole lot better in my opinion so I invite everyone who's just started on the series or have not started the series to watch till like episode 6 to 8 and after that episode I won't force you to watch anymore if you still dislike it since it's either a) it's not your thing or b) it's not your thing. I'm not some whore who won't take the fact that people can dislike what I love.  Then the conversations, although shallow, I can relate too. I've wondered about many things that even this anime has covered and I love this feeling. I've also talked with some people about stuff Konata and co. have too. Also different situations like opening a bag of chips for someone, blocking the straw opening so that the water sticks there and acting all immature and pointing to how cool it is (actually I went as far as going to my science teacher to ask about this, but that was lots of years ago), how I pull an all-nighter right before a test, etc and etc.  The humour is also dependent on how your humour goes. If you're into the references and the soft humour stuff then Lucky Star is great but honestly, I find this series as a whole not that incredibly funny or Hayate no Gotoku!-like in anyway. It's pretty unfair comparing them in my opinion but hey it's MY opinion so who gives a shit right? It isn't YOURS so I'm not bashing YOUR opinion unless you have a crooked and baseless opinion which I've seen from the Anti-Lucky Star club who I'd love to discuss with why they hate the series WITHOUT flaming or anything of the sort. I've seen in their thread, some people posting that the show has no plot (explained), sucky art, sound and characters (explained) and their friends keep whoring on them and say it's the best show and if you don't like it = u fail. Well I'm here to tell you, just like a motivator like Adam Khoo or Tucker Max or some sort of motivator guy, say ""NO U!"" to THEM!  I've got a friend who doesn't like the types of genre I like but I don't go around her and keep choking her to death yelling,""WATCH THIS OR I'LL KILL YOUR KITTENS AND HAUNT UR CHILDREN!!!!!"" or shit like that, honestly, if you have friends like that, then you should consider first, if your friends are SMART people or IDIOTS, which I think majority are. If they can't even get people have different opinions (autism aside), then they are complete fuck-ups, idiots, failure to logic, immature, etc etc etc etc etc.  Never listen to what other people like those say. Honestly, I actually follow some hypes (e.g Shakugan no Shana, Lucky Star, Zero no Tsukaima) my friends give me but after that I rely on MY OWN opinion, not theirs and my opinions are made from a base and that base is solid. Rarely is the base of my opinions a crooked one and if it is I'll freely admit it or if I'm feeling like an asshole, I'll change ID and register a new user (heheh :P that was like years ago though).  Overall, I really enjoyed the series and I don't care what YOU think. If you find this review helpful, then thank you very much, if you don't, then I don't blame you and I won't be cursing your name a million times, it's up to you. God I don't get why people care so much what other people think sometimes. You've got opinions, I've got mine and sometimes people just have crooked opinions and that's why I wrote this.  I really don't find the point in criticizing an Anime that has no plot as a shallow anime that has no plot as if pointing out that those white lab rats don't have tails compared to normal rats which have tails thus the lab rat is a bad rat and thus we must burn in into the haet-oven.  So, whatever the hype, don't trust it for this anime or you may get utterly disappointed. I followed the hype and I got what I wanted (well after ep 1 I was disappointed but things got better afterwards). If you hate it and you don't want to be convinced, then I don't care. If you hate it and want some discussions on why it's so damn popular, please do talk with me on the forums or any other place. If you love it, then so do I! Yeah all in all I give this anime a 9/10 for me but in general, for all of you, it's probably a 7.8 on average  Although in my opinion Honey & Clover runs deeper, into the more confused melancholy adolescent and that people may call 'pathetic' and 'emo' and 'self-loathing' (irks me that they never ever felt down THAT much before in their lives, guess people have it luckier) and maybe even philosophical stuff, Lucky Star does not go that far and does not fail to deliver simple everyday things or zanier things but still make it interesting.  To haters: simply put, any slice-of-life anime does not depend on plot. They depend on their characters and how much you can relate to them. OP does not matter, ED does not matter, what matters is how much you can relate to them and don't let any fangirls get the better of you and make you hate it. I've always been trolled with Naruto by my friends but I shrug it off, who cares really? Honestly, my point is if you can't relate to it, then you won't like it. That's my view of what slice-of-life animes really should be like. Why do I love t? I truly love the Konata and Kagami's personalitie and chemistry. I can relate to Konata and Kagami the most too. I don't express myself that well and yet I'm very much a Konata without the-- oh wait maybe I do act lazy. Really, to be honest, if you watch it from episode 6 and skip 1 - 5 you probably won't be lost anyway. P.S I AM NO LOLICON - I don't love them for their loliness thank you very much. Who ever said we love loli anyway >_>  Side note: I love Shiraishi Medley and Orewa suremono :D";Recommended
4;Lucky☆Star;Dmodwc;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dmodwc;10;Story: There isn't really a main story, the series revolves around the daily life of 4 high school girls. This series is based on a Japanese 4-panel comic strip, and as comic strips go, the contents can be just about any topics that come to mind. Though there's no main story (people gets judgmental about this), people overlook the fact it is BECAUSE there's no main story, there's no restrictions to what the series can talk about.  Art: The art style from the anime were pretty much the same as from the manga. There wasn't any inconsistencies and the animation was relatively smooth the entire time. The characters/backgrounds were drawn the way they are because...again...this series is derived from a 4-panel comic strip.  Sound: The BGM blends with the episodes very well. The opening song always got me pumped up to watch the episodes no matter what kind of mood I was in at the moment. The ending songs were all taken from somewhere else and sung by the voice actors, and most of them were absolutely hilarious (especially Hare Hare Yukai sung by Shiraishi Minoru along with the 2 player fighting game training mode simulator).  Characters: What's done so well about the character development is that you learn about the characters the same way you learn about someone in real life, from their casual conversations in school. Even though this is a comedy, there are some dramatic scenes here and there showing some of the character's life at home. There's also a wide variety of characters (who're normal and aren't golden haired, KI blasting, walking slabs of muscles) for the viewer to relate to.  Enjoyment: I really like how this is a show that you can just pick up and enjoy without knowing the contents of the previous episodes. There are also many references, so many that a normal person (who doesn't watch much anime or play games) wouldn't be able to understand more than half of it.  Overall: The thing about Lucky Star is that not everyone's going to like it. This show is aimed towards regular anime watchers/gamers. Those who are not anime watchers will be confused at the references, older people may think it's plotless insanity, and younger people may not understand the jokes.  With that said, if you're an anime watcher (if you're taking time to read this I'd bet you are), this show will be an absolute blast. This anime is the KING of referencing, and with each episodes being a synthesis of small events, you'll never guess what could happen next.  **Brief Warning** The first few episodes of the series may seem boring at first, but they're for introducing the 4 main characters. No matter what you may think, keep watching, give it a chance. By episode 10 or so, you will not regret sticking with this series.;Recommended
5;Lucky☆Star;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;9;"5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Hysterically Funny  I don&rsquo;t think I watched anything like Lucky Star before. I know people say it&rsquo;s a bit over hyped, or that it&rsquo;s nothing compared to Azumanga Daioh or Pani Poni Dash! but there is something to Lucky Star. That&rsquo;s why a lot of people, including me, like it. Let me enumerate on why I like it.  I like the story. Sure there isn&rsquo;t much of a definite storyline, but that&rsquo;s what makes it easy to understand. Besides, it&rsquo;s a slice of life anime of four regular high school girls (well, maybe Konata&rsquo;s a little different) so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect anything out of the ordinary. Even if it is like that, it still manages to entertain me and crack me up, and doing that with such little material is a hard task.  I would say Lucky Star is very otaku oriented, as it makes fun of anime and otaku clich&eacute;s. Other than that, it makes use of a lot of spoofs and parodies to create comedy, which is a strength depending on how you look at it. It&rsquo;s a strength because it&rsquo;s great for full fledged otaku viewers, but it&rsquo;s a weakness if casual anime fans fans (those who don&rsquo;t watch anime on a regular basis, I suppose) try to watch it. They probably won&rsquo;t get the spoofs. Sure they can do some research on it, but I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t be as funny that way.  The characters are a huge part of the comedy, because they themselves are clich&eacute;s. Tsukasa is a moe character, while Miyuki is a meganekko. Kagami is a little tsundere, and of course, legendary girl A herself, Konata Izumi, is the rabid otaku. Out of all the girls, Konata has to be my favorite. I guess it&rsquo;s because I see myself in her. I guess there&rsquo;s a little Konata in every otaku out there. The extended cast is also hilarious, like Minoru Shiraishi and Akira of the Lucky Channel segment, as well as the characters&rsquo; relatives and their classmates.  Speaking of Minoru Shiraishi, I have to say that Lucky Star did wonders for his career. I think he&rsquo;s more famous than before, and he&rsquo;s not even a main character. As for the other VAs, it&rsquo;s definitely a great cast. Two of my favorite VAs, Aya Hirano (Konata, of course) and Tomokazu Seki (Meito Anisawa) are in it, so that&rsquo;s one reason for me to be happy. Even the one episode extras are awesome Tomokazu Sugita and Daisuke Ono made cameo appearances for Lucky Star. You also gotta love Fumihiko Tachiki, who played all the random old woman characters throughout the series.  Now to discuss another popular rant. People are let down by the art style of Lucky Star, because it&rsquo;s so different from other KyoAni series (Kanon 2006, Air, etc). I see this as a positive. The characters are cuter that way, and being different is a good thing. Visually, Kanon 2006 and Air look great, but the character designs are a bit commonplace and standard. Lucky Star gives a breath of fresh air, that&rsquo;s what I like to think. The characters, colors, backgrounds &ndash; everything. Everything (visually) about Lucky Star is cute, another strength of Lucky Star.  The music is also otaku oriented. For the first half, most of the songs are themes from actual anime. Aya Hirano&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Cha-la Head Cha-la&rdquo; has to be one of my favorites from Lucky Star. I also like Minoru Shiraishi&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Hare Hare Yukai&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motteke! Serafuku&rdquo;  To end this review, I think Lucky Star is a great anime. It certainly has its merits, and I understand why a lot of people like it. However, I understand that it&rsquo;s not perfect, and that it cannot please everybody.";Recommended
6;Lucky☆Star;Master10K;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Master10K;9;"Lucky Star is a Slice of Life, Comedy with no real plot; it just focuses on the daily lives of 4 school girls. It mainly pays attention to Konata Izumi, a very athelic girl who could be really smart, but she spends most of her time on anime, manga and playing games.  This great anime began with the slowest of starts that can easily turn anyone off, except of die-hard fans of anything produced by &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot;, but after the first couple of lackluster episodes this anime becomes really enjoyable to watch. It's then when you really notice the differences in the characters' personalities and the way they interact. Lucky Star can be classed as a &quot;Satire&quot; because most of the time the characters mock various social issues that a lot of us viewers can relate to, &quot;like trying to find enough time for your anime and games&quot;. It's this that brings about hilarious parody moments however people who are new to the world of anime/manga/drama CD/games will feel left out, from not understanding the jokes. At least the &quot;Lucky Channel&quot; at the end of each episode is funny no matter what, with the hilarious duo that never seems to get along.  The style of animation in Lucky Star is very different from the stunning realism of &quot;Kyoto Animation's&quot; usual works, as Lucky Star adopts a very cartoony look. Nonetheless it works well bringing forth the weirdness of the character's personalities. The music on the other hand is basically non-existent and it's only the odd opening theme and various insert songs that can help redeem this factor.  Overall Lucky Star turned out to be a pretty enjoyable otaku fest but this anime is obviously not for everyone. Even though it's able to turn a simple topic into a hilarious episode full of parodies, each episode may be fun for someone yet not for someone else. I gave Lucky Star a high rating because I've seen many anime and can understand most of the jokes, so if you want the same experience then either watch many anime before starting this one or not bother watching it at all. ^_^";Recommended
7;Lucky☆Star;Ibelucas;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ibelucas;9;"Wow. All I can say is, wow. I never, ever thought an anime with this much moe and no solid storyline would leave this kind of lasting impression on me. Lucky Star takes slice of life to a whole new level, possibly beyond any I've ever seen before.  I had actually not heard of this, and a good friend recommended it. Reading the description and synopsis, I thought it would be one of those anime that would cheer you up when you're having a bad day; the result? It was so much more. The premise of the storyline may not seem like much, but this anime left me so satisfied, I made sure I wasn't physically glowing with satiation.  What made this so great was the combination of everyday characters with a comedic aspect and twist that led you from joke to joke flawlessly. The various pop-culture references mixed with completely different personalities from a variety of characters led to total and absolute hilarity. Though I'm not THAT much of an otaku myself, I managed to catch the gist of the jokes and had a humorous chuckle. I'm sure others with more experience with anime would fall in love with this show immediately.  The strong suit here was the characters. I give all the credit for this show's success and popularity to the characters. If you watch sitcoms (American ones, anyway) they are inundated with silly drama and pointless, circular storylines that everyone knows NEVER, EVER HAPPENS! Literally sit down, and watch an episode of a sitcom; how many times do those scenes happen in your life? Yea, never. This anime instead takes the point of view of actual high school girls and their thoughts and interactions; and they do so perfectly, from the start. They tend to long for a relationship and never seem to attract boys; isn't this more reflective of real life? Aren't we always WAITING for that special someone, rather than flirting and dating 24/7? This anime does more liberty to the average high schooler than I ever could have predicted.  Besides the character development, overall the art was pleasant. It appealed to the eyes without paying too much attention to detail. Although the storyline was a bit repetitive at times, the jokes never strayed too far from reality, and it did progress over time. The characters' interactions kept me entertained, far more than it should have.....  Ah, well, that's enough gushing for a day. I love curling up in a blanket and watching anime, and this show was perfect for such an occasion. It left me more satisfied than a piece of cake, yet was pleasantly sweet and savory all the same. I thoroughly enjoyed everything this show has to offer, and you should too! Watch it; but be aware: it's otaku land from here on out!";Recommended
8;Lucky☆Star;Jello;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jello;10;I first heard of Lucky Star just randomly wandering the net. And Like I normally do. I added it to my plan to watch list. At first, I thought it was a little boring, But I gradually got used to the concept of their daily life from school to sleep.  There wasn't a major story line. Just different things that could actually happen in real life. The four girls were all friends and had different interests. The show started different the most shows I've seen. They talk about food, homework, boys, music, hobbies. Just about everything an average group of High School girls would talk about. Even though they all had different hobbies, they got along. The art was just fantastic! I loved the animation, and the movements that everyone made. How everything looked so real! The sound was also great. The background music, like it's supposed to, helped make the mood of the conversation. Say that they were asking Miyuki a question, The background music would make the atmosphere actually seem a bit confusing, because Miyuki knew so much, that she always confused Tsukasa. The Characters were lovely. They all had their own attitudes, and their own looks. There wasn't anything that I was able to see that made the characters look the same except for the characters that were blood related. Then they looked a bit like each other, but still had their own distinct look. I enjoyed the show just because it cheered me up. The random conversations, and the interests that they had. Even a few of the jokes that the creator put in the show were quite amusing. Overall. I loved everything about the show. If I was able to change it, I wouldn't change one thing. I thought that it was absolutely wonderful.;Recommended
9;Lucky☆Star;NinjaKirby1322;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NinjaKirby1322;9;"T: Hey, there...Ah, I see girls in school uniforms again. Another Slice of Life anime, I take it? NK: Oh, hey, Takame. You'd be correct. T: Which one is it this time. Hold on a sec. I recognize the art. It's...Lucky Star, right? NK: You are correct. T: I thought your sister said to avoid it like the plague. NK: Bah, I decided to watch it anyway. Good thing I did.  T: I take it you like the series, then. NK: Very much so. I'd even go as far as to place it in my top 10, if not my top 5. T: Wow. You're getting a bit crowded in your top 10, aren't you? NK: Unfortunately.  T: So, Slice of Life. Basically, take real life, add a twist and proceed, right? NK: Mostly. T: So, what's the twist in this one, then? NK: Hmm...I think the most it does outside of real life is parody video games and anime. That's about it. T: No child skipping an abnormal amount of grades? No student who turns out to be god? No transfer student having to remember his past while juggling a bunch of girls who are tied to that past? NK: Nope, though the anime you're thinking of in that last comment is referenced twice in the series, and the second one you brought up is referenced in every other episode, it seems. T: That seems a bit...plain... NK: It is. Though I think it's part of the reason I like it. T: How come? NK: Well, the characters are easier to relate to, as are the situations. It's basically two years of high school crammed in to 24 episodes.  T: Well, you do always like to mention characters first. How are they in Lucky Star? Do they develop in drastic ways? NK: I wouldn't really call it developing. More like we just find out more about them in each episode. The series really focuses on Konata and Kagami, though Tsukasa does see a fair share of screen time thanks to her sister, and Miyuki is talked about a lot. T: So, it's kind of like how you learn more about your friends as you see them more often. NK: Right.  T: Interesting. So, who's your favorite? I'm going to guess Konata, since she's supposed to be the otaku. NK: Supposed to be? She is an otaku, and it seems like she's proud of the title. Oh, and you're wrong. She is not my favorite. T: Really? I couldn't imagine Kagami being it, either. Oh, dear...it's Tsukasa, isn't it? NK: How'd you guess? T: The big eyes, the ribbon in the hair. She sort of stands out as the cute one. NK: Yeah, she's my favorite character. She's a bit of an airhead, so I think that's part of it.  T: I swear...anyway, you said ""high school"", right? NK: I sure did. T: They look a lot younger than that. NK: Tricked me at first, too. It's a bit strange, I'll grant you that, but I actually found it really interesting to make the characters look younger than they were. T: It makes it harder to take the series seriously that way. NK: I didn't know you were supposed to take the series seriously.  T: Good point. How about the music? I noticed it was a bit bland when I came in. NK: That pretty much describes half of the background music. The music they play during conversations isn't really supposed to grab your attention. They save the good music for Konata's video games and the really funny scenes. T: You have the soundtrack, I take it. NK: Well, about half of the BGM collection...yes.  T: Anyway, I think I'm going to head out. Oh, almost forgot. Language? NK: Japanese, for me. That's what I first watched it in. The English isn't bad, but I'm just used to the Japanese. T: You think others would like it? NK: If you understand otaku culture, it's easy to figure out what's going on. There are enough different characters that almost any person watching the series can attach to someone. The only reason someone wouldn't like it is because there's really not a lot going on. It's pretty low key for an anime.";Recommended
10;Lucky☆Star;Jaye19;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jaye19;9;Had a stressful day? Watched any minf*cking anime lately and wanna cool off? Or you just wanna take a good chuckle and forget your problems? Lucky ☆ Star can do that!  Lucky Star is one of the most unique animes I've seen my whole life. The art is plain and simple, there is no definite storyline, there is really no action, there are just some high school girls talking about their everyday life but that's the good part. This is a slice of life anime that I've never seen before. The characters are just plain examples of moe and without you knowing you're loving them already, without you knowing it you're probably laughing already and without you knowing you've already forgotten your problems... already!  Story: 8~ Some of you may drop the show at its 1st episode because all you see and hear are some high school girls talking about their problems, issues or just random talk that rarely happens in anime, it's similar to a sitcom instead of a straightforward plot you usually see in a typical show. You probably won't be interested in some of them but unlike those American sitcoms, stuff that they talk about in Lucky Star happens in real life! Like have you ever thought of an amusing idea and decide to write it but when you're gonna write it already you suddenly forget it? Have you ever got so tired studying that you wanted to take break by playing a game but you end up having a longer break than actually studying? But what if you can't relate to it? Don't give up! Since Lucky Star is a parody, is has various anime and pop-culture reference I'm sure you might recognize. But I'm gonna be honest, I didn't understand some jokes because I ain't no hardcore otaku :P There are still lots of funny and hilarious scenes that I'm pretty sure you will not be able to contain your laughter.  Art: 9~ Honestly, when I was looking at some images and gif's of Lucky Star I was thinking, wth is this? Are the artists too lazy to draw better? But in the end the art is actually one of the main things that made me come to love this show. If you have noticed, they mostly show just the upper half of the characters body. The static backgrounds are pretty plain as well as the scenery and the characters don't really go in detail. But I'm pretty sure the first adjective you could use to describe them is, cute. You don't really need detailed art for this anime, simply because, this is a parody. You need the viewers to concentrate on what the characters are saying and doing rather than being amazed by how detailed the characters look. I also believed that they were drawn that way because it was suppose to be a joke. Since this was a parody after all. I mean the parts where they show some reference to other animes, the characters there looked well drawn. For example, there was a scene where they show Haruhi, she was drawn so well that it made me think is something wrong with the file I download and they inserted some Haruhi scene? I gotta say they were animated well ^^ Especially the OP, the characters dancing were just so cuute... HNGGGGGGG.  Sound: 9~ I immediately got captivated by the moe at the OP. The cute characters dancing fit so well with the lively and adorable music made by Aya Hirano and co. The background music also fit well while conversations are on-going and doesn't overpower the voices. There are also some parts where they sing some songs from different animes and even sing some popular Japan music (most of the singing is done by Shiraishi, you'll come to know him in the latter episodes. He's an epic guy I'll tell you).  Character: 10~ Ah, the characters. I want to start off with the blue-haired otaku, Konata. She's one of those people who play video games and read manga all day rather than studying. She crams last minute, she leaves her books at school since she doesn't study at home and surprisingly she's athletic. I see myself in her in many different ways. You might get annoyed by her or come to love her. Up next are the twin sisters Kagami and Tsukasa. Konata views Kagami as a tsundere since she has a ponytail. Kagami takes studying more seriously than her sister and Konata. She also has 2 other friends but I wont go into them in detail. Her sister Tsukasa is probably her complete opposite. She's lazy, forgetful, likes to sleep in, pretty much your regular airhead. Another airhead but a smart one is Miyuki. As I quote from Konata, she's a walking example of moe. She probably has the biggest chest in the show. There toooons of characters that will show up as the anime progresses and I could say they are all well defined. Just a special mention character, Shiraishi, Minoru. The live one not the animated one (but the animated character is pretty awesome as well ^^). That guy is just epic in so many ways. A big portion of my laughs come from this guy. He'll show up at the latter episodes of the show singin' some parodies of songs. I just cannot express how epic he is.  Enjoyment: 9~ I obviously enjoyed this show quite a lot. From the OP to the next episode preview, I never got bored. I haven't seen a single episode that was painful to watch and this show just brightens my day. But I rated this 9 because there were really just some jokes that I couldn't relate with because I still don't know much about the anime world D:  Overall: 9~ This show is a must watch for everyone. You may hate it, like it or come to love it. This is not a cup of tea for everyone because there are some people who judge the whole anime by its first impression but I gotta say you should stick a little more and I'm certain you'll come to like this show more and more :)  *This is my first review for a TV anime btw*;Recommended
11;Lucky☆Star;LazyKakashi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LazyKakashi;10;"In my time watching anime, I have not watched any (so far) quite like Lucky Star. It's simple yet amusing approach to comedy is very addicting, and it covers a large range of topics. Basically it focuses on the life of average japanese high-school girls. After that, hilarity ensues.  From the beginning I wasn't too interested in it, I thought it was dull and boring. But I gave it a chance. And I'm pretty effing happy I gave it that chance, becase I found myself short of breath from laughing. There are so many referances to anime and manga, mostly, but it also parodies things that relate to everyone in everyday life.  As for the direction and art style, it fits perfectly with the storie's premise. Cute and sometimes wacky *I can't beleive I just said &quot;wacky&quot;* the expressions on the characters faces are priceless, and are sometimes better than the reason the made those expressions. Without giving too much away, I will say that when the art style gets &quot;serious&quot;, it's often the funniest part of the show.  The music is slightly Animal Crossing-esq, with a casual yet appealing sound, that really sets the mood. The voices (In the japanese VO) are very well done, matching each character almost perfectly. As for the characters themselves, they are the best part of Lucky Star! Each character has their own personality, and each one is drawn out to a stereotypical point. For example: Kagami is one of the main characters, and is often ill-temperd and down to earth, so it shows on her very often, to the dismay of Konata especially.  I loved this anime, and the only thing that can match the overall enjoyment of this in my opinion is Cowboy Bebop. It's a very different anime from what I'm used to, i.e; Dragonball, Hunter X Hunter, ect., but it's different in an amazing way.";Recommended
12;Lucky☆Star;yoannarouge;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yoannarouge;10;Lucky Star is a fun story to watch, if you are an anime lover all throughout your life then konata is your character because you can see yourself in her, buying all those dvds and mangas and everything related to anime and of course sing all those opening and ending songs of your fave tv shows. I also love her friends like kagami who constantly arguing with her about everything but in the end being friends shows that no matter what you are they will accept you whole heartedly, and the typical twin sister tsukasa who always have her clumsy moments that makes you want to think if she really is the other twin sister. and then there's miyuki kind of a marimite type of girl who is intelligent and elegant but there is a twist in her character that you wont find in marimite.  All in all this story will never get you bored, and even though scenes jump into another, you dont want to miss any of it because even though how small it is, it can make you laugh.;Recommended
13;Lucky☆Star;fluffyindrag;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fluffyindrag;9;"I, as many people have, stumbled upon Lucky Star quite randomly. I was a bit leery, thinking it would be some annoying chibi show for kids but upon watching, I was delightfully shocked!  The main character, Konata, is SO like I was in high school that after 10 minutes of watching I just had to pause so I could laugh at myself. And all the inside jokes... pure hilarity! The humor ranges from gamer jokes, anime references, and voice actors in unusual (or very usual) situations to family relationships (as one of 3 sisters I KNOW just what it's like), random conversations with friends, and all the drama of heading off to college.  Funny as the show is, it truly has a heart and a good basis in life. I have actually had many of the events in the anime happen to me, as I'm sure a good few of the other fans have as well. Something as commonplace as forgetting a textbook takes on a new face, and I can't help but remember some of my desperate antics trying to scrape by on test scores.  Beyond that all the little details slipped in make the series all the more interesting and unusual for those who know what to look for... things like the beloved &quot;Anime Director&quot;'s overzealous attempts to squeeze out the next purchase... does that voice sound a bit familiar? Also, and more obviously, there is Konata's fixation on a certain other anime... another casting coincidence? I think not.  Anyway, this is a must-see for anyone who's ever called themselves an otaku (or been accused of it), or for someone looking for a really relaxing and fun show minus the nailbiting for the next installment!";Recommended
14;Lucky☆Star;ryuu_zer0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ryuu_zer0;10;"Look up comedy in the dictionary. If it doesn’t say “Lucky Star” there then you should write it in. Very funny and incredibly smart Lucky Star pokes fun at the most ordinary things in life, and does it brilliantly.  Even though this series is a few years old, I only recently saw this on the top anime page of MAL. I was quite astounded to find that this was #130, when (judging by the anime above it) in my opinion it deserves to be much higher. And it was then that I saw the divided reviews, some giving it ridiculously low scores. So, despite it being somewhat futile, I decided to write a review on it.  I have given Lucky Star marks based on the categories of storyline, art etc only because I had to. To be honest, I think it is impossible to review Lucky Star in such a general way. This is the kind of anime that comes along very rarely, one that attempts to innovate and stand out from the crowd. The best way to define the genre would be “pure slice of life”, abrupt and somewhat in-your-face, and I think this is what unnerves some people and prevents them from opening up to the series. It bombards you with jokes and various comedic references almost in passing. Hence, a lot of people fail to comprehend punch lines and complain about the lack of storyline. Unfortunately they’re completely missing the point.  This story is about the very ordinary lives of a very ordinary group of schoolgirls. The style is exactly like a person reflecting upon a yesterday and laughing to himself as he remembers all the amusing things that happened. He omits the boring parts and various unrelated conversations he had during his very ordinary day and focuses only on the funny or strange bits. The fact that, like an ordinary person’s life, it has no over-arching storyline is the whole point of the show. Why did I give it 10 for story then? Basically because I believe it does what it sets out to do brilliantly, and should be rewarded for it.  After watching a few episodes you tend to settle into the rhythm of the show and appreciate it much more. The jokes themselves are hilarious, making fun of both the extremely ordinary as well as the bizarre. Countless references to other popular anime and otaku culture also provide a source of genuine laughs. A few heart-warming moments are also there to balance it up nicely. Once you get into it the enjoyment factor is definitely a maximum, but this isn’t a show you can rush through. The best way to watch it is a couple of episodes at a time, complimenting each with slices of your own life. In fact, after watching I find it hard to go through a day without a potential Lucky Star reference.  The art is also top-notch. Going for more of a semi-chibi style, it does a great job in complimenting the light-heartedness of the show. The backgrounds are exactly that; 2d backdrops that are there to add a bit of depth to the art but nothing more. However, this works well to compliment the simple art style and the focus on dialogue. As well as the catchy opening theme, the hilarious and unique endings, the background music also aids the light-hearted atmosphere. The characters are definitely the show’s biggest strength. Each character plays a role in reflecting on another side of life, from the outright ridiculous otaku Konata to the calm, somewhat introverted Minami. Varied and original, they really inject an energy into the anime that really makes you want to keep watching. Add to that the talented voice actors, many of whom also did the popular The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and loads of ironic Haruhi references and you’ve got a very funny mix. (I definitely recommend watching Haruhi before Lucky Star so you can get these jokes.)  There is no question the Lucky Star is quirky and unique, and is shunned by some viewers because of this. I am of the opposite opinion, however. This is a show that dares to be different, and should be celebrated as a very successful experiment by Kyoto Animation. Truly one of the greatest comedy anime ever made.";Recommended
15;Lucky☆Star;wouterrr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/wouterrr;8;First of all, I won't write a long review for Lucky Star, simply because there are enough other reviews to read too.  I think of this anime as a nice and an enjoyable serie. Most of all, I think of it as an unique storie. Why? Because there is no storie.  Most animes wihout a storie are boring, and still they managed to get Lucky Star interesting, almost each episode worth watching.  The characters I gave a 10, something I almost never give. This is because each charactar has his or her own personality which you can like or hate. They can have conversations everyone has made already. I don't know the exact reason for liking this anime so much, maybe the recognation?  Durings the series, there are added some other characters as well. Unforunatly, they all aren't as brilliant as the main-characters. But still they too have they're own personalities you can like or hate, so if you don't like the main-characters, there are still plenty of others.  Conclusion: This is an outstanding anime, and from the one hand i regret there is (still) no second season. From the other hand, an other season would be useless. They all went to an other school, so you will miss some of the main characters. This was a great anime, but it will have to stick with just this one season.;Recommended
16;Lucky☆Star;ChibiNihon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChibiNihon;8;"Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank.  But I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of it is tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at. This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.  Another aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.  Art/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni's best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.  Sound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it.  Music - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the ""different"" ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast.  Character: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can't help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.  Enjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)  Overall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.";Recommended
17;Lucky☆Star;NV2301;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NV2301;7;"An eccentric show with high production values  Lucky Star is considered the holy grail for many hardcore Otaku people and it really is - which also makes it a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; show. Being an avid enthusiast at best, I could appreciate how Lucky Star nails the intended market, while disliking the morals behind such a show.   Story: 7/10 In short, this is a gag-comedy show with a (rather twisted) school life genre.  The show follows the life of a dysfunctional otaku, Konata and her rather unplausible school life. It is amazing how the producers managed to put the most mundane of conversations onto the screen but it somehow works. While the flow is hard to get for some (including myself), some subjects hit home for me such as the UFO catcher.  What really brings this show to life is the very good interaction between the characters during the mundane conversations. It is also amusing to see a show for otakus ridiculing otakus, which brings a sense of sanity exactly where needed.   Art: 7/10 A perfect example of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). How much simpler does the art get? With the advances in CGI, recent shows (especially KyoAni) have seen increased use of colours, shadings and usage of detail - the hair in AIR is a prime example. Lucky Star is so amazingly and ridiculously simple that it is this simplicity which has made the art so catchy and unique.  While I have mixed feelings at the loli-esque art (they look 12, not 17), it does accomplish its intended mission very well.  The animation is as smooth and fluid as ever.   Sound: 6/10 This is a relatively simple, slow show where sound is not the most important thing, unlike Macross. The BGM is as simple as the art and does the job.  The OP theme, as much as I dislike it is possibly the best track in the &quot;Drum Master&quot; game and has a good following among the die-hards.   Character: 8/10 This is where the show shines. Konata's family brings enjoyment (I can ridicule them to oblivion), and Kagami brings some balance and sanity into the show. So much that for much of the show, my thoughts were in-line with Kagami whenever Konata went on her antics. Konata and Kagami really are an excellent combination and some say opposites attract?  The supporting cast contained variety yet had a smooth flow so was good to watch.   Enjoyment: 7/10 The abundance of &quot;What the...&quot; moments, following Konata's train of thought gave enough entertainment, as well as her interaction with Kagami. I also found the quirks of every character amusing. While it was entertaining, I did not die from laughter however.  Again, I'm sure the show hits the intended market right on the spot.   Overall: 7/10 A &quot;good&quot; show which I found good fun out of and is unique. If you're the kind of person who likes music which sounds like a CD skipping, except a hundred times faster, then you will love this show!";Recommended
18;Lucky☆Star;Tekky99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tekky99;8;Length: 24 episodes Original Airdates: 4/07 - 9/07 Demographic: Seinen Genres: Comedy, Satire, Slice-of-life  Plot Synopsis Portrays the lives of several school girls attending a Japanese high school with a very loose humor tone. The main heroine is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club, and her grades remain low. Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games, and she is not interested in much else.  Personal Opinion So I had heard of Lucky Star for quite a while actually. I just wasn't sure what I should expect. I mean it didn't have anything extravagent, i mean some anime references here and there. And then i saw the OP. And my life would never be the same. So if i were to ask for a plot, i would say that there isn't any. Lucky Star is the anime equivalent of a sitcom. Each episode has multiple short situations that leads to some witty comment or reference.  Now knowing me, plot-development is a MAJOR aspect of my reviews. So a show that doesn't have a plot will have a hard time to get a good review from me. However... Not only did Lucky Star managed to garner a good review from me, but it also turned me into a hopless fanboy. At this moment i'm trying to learn the Lucky Star dance  8/10 This is a series made of pure WIN  Similar to... - The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Same voice actors and there are plenty of Haruhi references in Lucky Star. It's a running gag  - Minami-Ke Haven't reviewed Minami, but from what i've seen of it, it's quite similar to Lucky Star, as in sitcom like anime;Recommended
19;Lucky☆Star;tomislol;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tomislol;9;"A few years back whenever i browse through random forums, whether it be on games or just about anything really, i would sometimes see people use this very interesting signature, a signature of the opening sequence dance of Lucky Star. But at that time i had no clue what lucky star was or did I really watch that much anime to know anything about it. I just had the impression that it was just a bunch of cute girls dancing. Then a few years later when i got into watching anime i was looking through MAL and i came across Lucky Star and i instantly was reminded of that opening dance sequence that i would see in those forum user's signatures. So i was all like HEY I REMEMBER THIS! So i decided to give it a shot. But before i even began to start watching it, I would approach a friend of mine and seek his opinion on the anime. During that time i just started to watch anime so i was not sure what was good or not and my friend told me that it was really boring and he only watched a total of 5 minutes of it then he decided to drop it. So for a while i decided not to watch it. Later on after watching more anime so i start to get a sense of what i like, i decided to try this anime knowing that my friend hates it.  AND I AM REALLY FUCKING GLAD I DECIDED TO WATCH IT.  I've always assumed that i would like what ever my friend likes since that seemed to be the case when i started out watching anime. But i have gained my independence in this. Basically i watch what i want. lol.  ANYHOW enough back story. REVIEW TIME!  STORY: 9 Even though this anime supposedly has no freaking story, i find that to be the beauty of it. Just how the hell can an anime where there is no story be good? Well it is possible. The so called ""Story"" revolves around these 4 girls that just live their lives in high school. At first you might say ""What the hell? that sounds stupid"" but it is actually really really interesting , to me at least. Lucky Star is one of those shows that you either don't like or you love it. And i for one, loved it. Even though it's just about cute girls doing cute things living their lives, there are actually a few touching moments in this anime.  ART: 9 KYOTO ANIMATION 'NUFF SAID!!    Haha I am totally a fan boy of kyoani, but this type of animation is what kyoani is known for. The type of animation in Lucky Star is incredibly simple AND IT WORKS!  I totally love the moe moe ness in this anime. This is probably the biggest selling point of the anime. THE EFFING MOE! But there are a lot of other enjoyable things about this other than its moe tastic animation.  At episode 10 we are introduced to the Anime Tenchou, and holy crap they really put a lot of effort into the animation. Once you watch it you would understand what i mean.  SOUND: 9 The music in this anime is great. I am particularly quite fond of the track ""FUN FUN FUN DAYO"" which i plan to learn it on the piano so i can have my own FUN FUN FUN.  I also really liked the ending karaoke segment. It is very amusing to see the character's seiyuu's sing other songs. Konata's (Hirano Aya) version of Cha la head cha la is just freaking hilarious.  Character: 10 THIS IS WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT LUCKY STAR!!!!  Izumi Konata: This chick is f*cking funny. She is athletic yet hates it, she is really short and is an otaku. She lives with her dad which is okay with her playing Eroge's (PORN GAMES!) And to top it all she is so god damn moe.  Hiiragi Tsukasa: I have always compared these twins with the twins in Clannad. I mean seriously, they look the Effing same. EXCEPT i do not hate the short hair one this time around. God i really dislike Ryou Fujibayashi. ANYHOW...... Tsukasa is totally the cute but stupid kind of person. Kind of like Konata but she's more normal like.  Hiiragi Kagami: MAN OH MAN. SHe is an awesome f*cking character. She is just like her alter ego Fujibayashi Kyou from Clannad, which is also my favorite chick from Clannad. She is the typical tsundere girl that tsukkomi's every single chance she gets. She is aggressive one of the bunch and seeing her when she's not is just absolutely great.  (Just a random note, i really don't know why i prefer these typical tsundere girls in most of the animes with a lot to choose from, maybe i just like aggressive chicks with purple hair, cough* cough* Sasasegawa Sasami from Little Busters cough* cough*)   Takara Myuki: Although Mal states her as a main character i see her more as a support character. The amount of screen time that she gets compared to the other three is small. Probably like 50%. Her character is the that of a really intellectual high class like ojou sama that isn't a total bitch. She reminds me of Mugi-chan from K-On. same type of aura. It would be awesome if she got a lot more screen time.  Enjoyment and overall: 9 I really enjoyed this anime. It is something i can keep on rewatching as much I want and not get bored of it. It is not one of those anime's where it is the best watching it the first time around, no. It is one of those anime's that you just sit back and relax and just enjoy the awesome nothingness that brings you a smile to your face. This is purely my perspective of this though. There is that phrase of ""maybe this isn't your cup of tea"" Well i don't really drink tea but i bet if this was turned into tea i would gladly say it is indeed my cup of tea. So if you like a story revolved around nothing and just like seeing a bunch of cute girls and a bunch of parodies than i am sure you would enjoy this anime. If not, well I can't do anything about it.  ~Til Next time, Tomislol";Recommended
0;Lucky☆Star;ukiuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ukiuki;5;"I found this anime very difficult to get through. The comedy wasnt exactly funny, and the jokes and puns were more like &quot;oh, i relate/understand that, is my life also considered sad?&quot;  using the rating breakdown, let me explain to you why I didnt find this anime particularly wonderful.  STORY: there was almost no storyline. Sure 4 girls are trying to get through high school. but that sums up every other anime out there, about kids at school. What this anime lacked was drive. Plot is one of the elements which create the drive, but there was none. Im giving the story a 5 just for the sake of the somewhat cleverly placed jokes. As well, many of the elements got tiring and old, such as Lucky Channel, which is a talkshow hosted at the end of each episode. The live action scenes at the end of the latter episodes also got extremely annoying and exploited.  ART: nothing spectacular. I understand that for this kind of show, beautiful art isnt exactly the most neccessary thing. However, a lot of the time, there was no background.  SOUND: sadly, there was hardly any background music. But the sole reason that I rated the sound so much higher than the other qualities is because the OP was just so amazing and addictive. Sadly, the energy and excitement of the OP could not be reflected into the show.  CHARACTER: The characters presented are all very different, and their interactions with each other are very amusing to watch. I would have liked if there was at least some character development, or at least some insight into the characters. Often, characters also give an anime series the drive it needs to go on, but there was nothing about the characters that made you want to know more about them.  ENJOYMENT: I must say that the enjoyment factor, for me, especially, was quite low compared to many other people. This show was extremely hyped, and many many people were saying how amazing it was, and how funny it was. When I watched, I was extremely dissapointed. I even sat the series through to the end to see if I was missing something, or if the &quot;amazingness&quot; came later on. it didnt.  Most of the anime I enjoy watching has some substance, and there are factors like plot and characters that make me want to keep watching it. Lucky Star didnt cut it.  If you also prefer animes with more substance, themes, plot, and character, I do not recommend Lucky Star.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lucky☆Star;cutepiku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cutepiku;6;Lucky * Star is about highschool girls and.. ummm, well, that's about it. It basically revolves around the lives of four girls (later on, more people are given some time) and the random conversations they have.  Story This series is not incredibly plot filled. Actually, there really is none. It's not even really character driven. This anime, however, doesn't need much of a story. It still works out in a cute way. However, the rating IS for story, and in all fairness, there really was none. I think this is a fair, if not quite high rating for what was presented.  Animation The best animation is definitly in the opening sequence. Everything flows nicely in it, and it throws money around to give a flawless performance. Once you get to the actual show, however, there is basically no movement what so ever, save the talking.  The art style isn't top notch. It is kept with the original 4-koma's style, but I still think they could have coloured it a bit better. Maybe make the girls atleast look more their age.  Sound I did really like that opening song. Quite catchy. The in-show music was also fairly well done, aside from the fact that I didn't really notice it. The music just kind of melted into the background. That's the only reason why it's not higher on my rating. It was good, but nothing to write home about.  Character This was my biggest issue. The series had INCREDIBLY 2-dimensional characters. They did not develope, they did not change. We did no see any different sides to them. The closest to this was with Konata, and... whatever her name is. The older of the twins.  This may have been alright, because this would seriously screw up the nature of the anime, but because of the 2-D element to them, I couldn't really connect to any of them. Except maybe Konata. I'm a big nerd too.  Enjoyment While I did have a few giggles, I did not either really like this series, or really dislike it. I can see why people like it, but I don't understand the overwhelming popularity. I was told it was funny, but it wasn't a comedy. It was slice-of-life. I was told it was meaningful. That was a load of bull. I watched the series with no expectations, and I ended it with none. I don't see myself rewatching this anytime soon.  Overall / My Comments / My Feelings I know people will be angry, but it wasn't an overall amazing show. It has no story, the art was pretty boring, the sound disappeared, and the characters were 2-D. The only thing this series had that I liked was the otaku jokes. Other than that, I couldn't relate. Highschool isn't like this for me. Not at all. And I don't know people who are so stereotypical. I was a little disappointed, I think.  I can't say anything but, sorry fans. I just couldn't get myself hooked. I atleast pulled through all the episodes, but it was becoming a little draining towards the end. I had no real drive to finish it...;Mixed Feelings
2;Lucky☆Star;MedliSage;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MedliSage;6;"Lucky Star  Story (6/10) The story here was by far the hardest thing for me to rate. Being a comedy/slice-of-life type of thing, Lucky Star has no real &quot;plot-line&quot; or story. You could skip 5 episodes and still understand what was going on. However, the day-to-day goings and doings of the 4 main characters was done decently, and the variety of what they did was okay, so therefore I gave it a 6, which is fair/decent.  One thing I have to say though: After episode 10-ish or so, things were really getting boring. Sure, what they did was different, but the jokes had the same principle, and it was just all so boring and repetitive. Especially the stupid Lucky Channel. God, I skipped over that so many times. Because it was boring and... oh god. I can't even bring myself to go on. But since there isn't all that much plot, I can't sit here and elaborate on it forever, so moving on...  Art (8/10) Though I don't like Kyoto Animation all that much, the good thing about them is the animation that they do is very good (though I personally don't like the style all that much). Everything flowed nicely and there was never a time where I thought &quot;Wow, they're running low on their budget&quot; or &quot;Wow, they got really lazy with that scene.&quot; But I'll be honest and say I really did not like the art style. The characters are supposed to be 17/18 and they looked like they were 10. Some people may call it cute and chibi but I call it ugly and stupid.  Sound (7/10) Another good thing about Lucky Star is the sound quality. Most notably the great job done by the seiyuu. Kudos to them for doing an excellent job. Other than that, the sound was nothing more and nothing less than decent. The BGM was fitting and non-annoying, the opening was cutesy and funny, but nothing special. The various endings were occasionally humorous but not a lot.  Character (6/10) Since Lucky Star is a comedy, serious character development isn't exactly on its agenda. The characters were varied to some extent -- we have the various archetypes to fill, the tsundere, the moe blob, the smart/clumsy one, and the... otaku? However, this is as deep as the character gets. Saying you can relate to Konata because you also like anime/manga is like saying you can also relate to Miyuki because she is a high school student. There is no depth or development and the &quot;variety&quot; of characters only go as far as stereotypical archtypes that you can find in almost any other anime.   Final Thoughts Since the &quot;enjoyment&quot; part of the review is just a personal opinion, I don't let it affect my score. But needless to say, I did not enjoy Lucky Star. I can safely say I did not laugh once while watching this. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because despite Konata being a shallow character, I liked her for many reasons and it was almost some fun to watch her go about her daily otaku lifestyle among normal-ish friends. But a comedy without humor is like a cow with no spots. If you want to go laugh, watch Azumanga Daioh instead, a comedy with much more humor that you can't help but smile at. Lucky Star tried to bring us a cute and relaxing slice-of-life comedy and an otaku we can all relate to, but in my opinion it utterly failed.";Mixed Feelings
3;Lucky☆Star;StinkyIkari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/StinkyIkari;6;I'm just going to come out and say this. Lucky Star was boring. It was a show about a group of girls that sit around and talk about stuff. It's supposed to be funny and cute. They wrote it so you could relate with the characters. It addresses everyday issues. That is the entire idea of it.  I couldn't get behind it. I have a different sense of humor and because of that not much of what they said was funny. And without laughs, what do you have? An incredibly boring show! Plus it didn't help that they tried to make Konata into a nerd's fantasy girl. It really just pissed me off.  But, with all that being said, it wasn't a horrible show. I disliked it, but I'm sure the general population would like it. And they do. It's exactly like Azumanga Daioh. Watch it if you want to laugh.;Mixed Feelings
4;Lucky☆Star;DownShift;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DownShift;6;OH HA LUCKY!! Yea, I had to. Oh well. Too bad that was one of the few things that I enjoyed about this one =P  Story: 3 Ok, of course there isnt a story in this anime... it's Lucky Star for fark sakes. Well.. the story has a definite edge over Haruhi imo, follow Konata as she goes to school. Watch Konata eat a chocolate thing. HEY LOOK, Konata is playing games, lets watch. It's well put together for the most part, the story doesn't always completely go off on different tangents, but it really isn't all that interesting at the same time.  Art: 10 As expected from the same studio that brought us Haruhi, great visuals and very nice moods set by the animations. Not much else to say other than I enjoyed the art very thoroughly.  Sound: 8 I enjoyed the soundtrack. It was a nice, cutesy pop-ish type of vibe, which I normally don't go for, but it sorta stuck here. The opening theme got annoying after awhile though.  Character: 4 For the most part, the character development was severely lacking, although one character that really shows some promise would be Kagami, very interesting personality shifts along the series, overall the most interesting character. The most entertaining character being Minoru Shiraishi (don't quote me on that spelling). But the rest were very linear, nothing really changed, it was the same thing in a different episode. Only slight differences.  Enjoyment: 6 Well, there are a few instances in this anime where you just enjoy sitting through. Mostly the EXTREMELY abundant anime references. Haruhi references were VERY annoying, however. It's a slice of life type anime, there's no way you can't enjoy it a LITTLE bit.  Overall: 6 Generally, Lucky Star is an OK experience, one thing I wouldn't be able to do is go back and watch it all at once. Much too uneventful. This series really shouldn't have been 24 episodes.  Sorry Otakus. No 10 from me =P;Mixed Feelings
5;Lucky☆Star;xm0123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xm0123;6;"Lucky Star is a 4-panel manga series by Kagami Yoshimizu that began publishing in 2004, and is still being published today. In 2007, Kyoto Animation, hot off the success of Haruhi, made an anime adaptation. I watched it. I also sampled the manga version. It was . . . okay, I guess. But let's elaborate on the anime some more, shall we?  Story: In present-day Japan, a number of girls in high school live out their lives studying, making jokes about Gundam, being eccentric, making fun of cliches in fiction, and . . . that's about it, really. The four main girls are Konata Izumi, a self-proclaimed otaku (though fortunately one more functional than every real-life otaku I've met), Kagami Hiiragi, a no-nonsense ""Tsundere"", Tsukasa Hiiragi, Kagami's moeblob twin-sister, and Miyuki Takara, a really smart moeblob. There are many more characters than this, but they're the main focus.  Because this is based off a 4-panel series, many plot threads, if you can call them that, often end abruptly, with little-to-no resolution. Some of the jokes from the manga don't translate as well into anime format. The show never veers into anything truly dark in terms of plot. It's mostly jokes and weird observations. Essentially, it's like Azumanga Daioh, but with characters with wild hair colors. And after the series and OVA sequel ends, there's no resolution of any sort.  However, every episode also ends with a segment called ""Lucky Channel"", which features different characters and actually has an ongoing (and pretty funny) story. Sadly, these segments aren't that long. Yeah, Lucky Star is not something you watch for enlightenment. 3/10.  Art: I'm gonna be honest; I don't like the artwork of Lucky Star. The character designs are meant to be cute, but most of them don't look cute, just childish. The coloring is often garish, and Miyuki's hair is so bright, it nearly blinded me on a few occasions.  With that said, the animation is somewhat fluid for a tv series. So it's not a complete disaster on the visual front, but this show obviously does not focus on visuals. 5/10.  Sound: The theme song is infamous. Some hate it, some love it. I find it . . . okay. The ending themes are renditions of earlier anime ending themes, most of which I didn't recognize. They're alright. The background music is just there, doesn't really add anything.  I saw this in English, as well as bits in Japanese on random Youtube channels. Weirdly enough, Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I have ever heard. Its voice-acting is even better than most American cartoon shows I've seen! I'm not kidding! Look at this old quote of mine from tvtropes.org:  ""Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I've ever heard. Every character sounds exactly how I would picture their voices to be. None of the voices are annoying nor awkward sounding. They also match the lip flaps pretty closely, too. Wendee Lee especially displays great range in Konata's voice. It's impossible for me to watch the show in Japanese now; the dub is that good.""  I still stand by that today. Also, Kari Wahlgren's version of Kagami blows her Japanese counterpart completely out of the water. Anyone who does English dubs of Japanese productions, be they industry professionals or fandubbers, watch Lucky Star and take notes; THIS is how you do an English dub. And you wonder why I worship every Bandai dub out there that's not Code Geass. 7/10.  Characterization: For all of its faults, some of the characters are quite likable and amusing. Konata is silly, yet charming. Kagami's bewilderment is amusing. Many side characters, such as Konata's dad and Anime Tenchou are funny. The best characters, however, are the Lucky Channels stars Akira Kogami and Minoru Shiraishi.  However, there's not a lot of depth to Lucky Star's cast. Also, several of its female characters are moe archetypes (or moeblobs) that don't really do much. Well, Konata's cousin Yutaka is adorable, but none of the others strike me as cute, just shallow. (Well, Tsukasa has a couple of funny moments.) And even the characters I do like don't have much to their characterizations. Look, Konata's comparing something to a game/anime again! Kagami is frustrated with someone's antics again! Tsukasa is clueless about something again! The characters aren't annoying, but I can only rate them slightly above-average. 6/10.  Enjoyment: I will say this, there's usually only one funny moment per episode of Lucky Star outside of Lucky Channel, but that one moment is usually laugh-out-loud hilarious. Also, most of Lucky Channel is flat out hilarious. The English dub really helps with my enjoyment.  But for a show focused only on comedy, it's not one of the better examples of anime comedy I've seen. Haruhi Suzumiya was funnier, and also served an interesting sci-fi plot. Soul Eater is way funnier, and also has cool action scenes and characters. Welcome to the NHK was funnier, and deeper and more dramatic. Sgt Frog and Gintama are both more centered on comedy, and also funnier.  With that said, I do like the anime version of Lucky Star more than the anime version of Azumanga Daioh. And believe me when I say I've seen a lot worse than Lucky Star out there, too. However, LS is, at best, only slightly rising above mediocrity. 6/10.  I do like the manga version of Lucky Star more, but only slightly. (I would probably give that a 7 out of 10, despite the lack of Lucky Channel in that.) I don't want to say LS is overrated. Yeah, it's not as good as I hoped it would be, but I've been let down by other animes a lot more. At least I was able to finish LS. It's not a classic, but if you're bored enough, you might want to check it out. Just mind the bright colors.";Mixed Feelings
6;Lucky☆Star;DirtyMidnighter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DirtyMidnighter;6;Coming off the heels of the heartstring tugging K-On!! and the absurdly funny Azumanga Daioh, I found Lucky Star a bit flat. Of the three shows, Lucky Star is by far the most self-aware. It knows exactly what it is and who it is trying to appeal to, and upon achieving that, seeks to do no more. While all of these moe-centric shows are murderously slow and ultimately go practically nowhere as far as plot is concerned, they are redeemed by their breezily entertaining demeanor once you settle into them. Moments of true comedic brilliance shine through every once in a while and even moments of genuine depth are displayed. Lucky Star just doesn't have as many of these moments as its competition. Konata, the main character, is the one unique aspect of the show, essentially a female personification of the otaku lifestyle that many viewers will identify with. Her insights and quips about the obsessive and bizarre nature of Otaku culture are by far, the show's best moments- and the most absurd. A certain re-occurring plot theme involving Konata and a group of impassioned manga shop clerks, who idealize her as the otaku's dream girl, are particularly funny because they seem to be in on the show's joke. The gleefully bizarre, Vocaloid referencing OVA conclusion is also a highlight. The big problem is that the rest of the time, when the show is in typical schoolgirl moe-show mode, it's just kinda boring. The banter between the four main girls is less nuanced than K-On!!'s and far less abstract than Azumanga Daioh's weirder moments. It's just cookie cutter characters exchanging mundane dialogue about nothing in particular. Look no further than the first episode's 15 minute pastry conversation for an example of the general pacing of the show. Lucky Star takes it's look from the 4-panel manga by the same name. The characters are ultra-chibi to the point of being a bit on the overly-simplified side. Their faces don't really emote much. Where as K-On!!'s characters displayed a surprising amount of depth in their subtle facial animations, the same care wasn't taken by KyoAni on this series. I suppose it falls in line with the fact that these characters just don't have the same degree of believability or human attraction. Lucky Star may have waned in popularity since K-On!! seemingly took it's place as the epitome of moe anime. Despite a decreased distance between the viewer, the main character essentially serving as a bridge, Lucky Star ultimately shys away from ever taking itself seriously enough to be little more the most derivative thing that moe can be- a sly parody of the schoolgirl tropes aware of it's exploitative nature.;Mixed Feelings
7;Lucky☆Star;Aquaisking;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aquaisking;6;I have too be fairly honest Konata made the entire series watchable, I don't think I would have watched it without her. I think this series got popular quickly because of that reason, but it's worth a watch it's not the greatest comedy out there, but there are some pretty funny moments.  It started off great, but the ending was a disappointment too me. Overall, it's watchable for a first time, but for me I don't think I'd re watch it much at all. The series was funny, and that's what kept it enjoyable.;Mixed Feelings
8;Lucky☆Star;noisuchun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/noisuchun;6;"I remember I started this anime back in my first year of high school, and after the first half of the series, I was all right with it. I enjoyed it. Other people call it boring, and I can definitely see why; then again, slice-of-life isn't for everyone. Back then I always enjoyed Lucky Star's constant references to anime and otaku tendencies because it was something that I could relate to and snicker at. I remember that I would play Lucky Star while folding the laundry or cleaning my room, kinda like how someone plays a podcast while doing busy work.  ...However, that was a few years ago, and today I decided to finally finish up the rest of Lucky Star. One thing, I guess it looked better when I was younger. In my opinion, I think Lucky Star would have fared better as a 14 or 20 episode series because by the 17th episode, I was getting bored with the tiny bits of situational humor. I loved it when the story threw in a few personal bits of the characters' lives and feelings (I won't cite any because spoilers), and really, I wish that there was more of that towards the end of the series.  It's still a series that I would turn to when I need something to listen to while I do chores, but it isn't something that I would sit down for a watch. If you like cute girls constantly talking about nothing but daily life humor, then this is a good anime for you. I just wished this show could have taken a more personal approach like they did in a few bits of a few episodes.";Mixed Feelings
9;Lucky☆Star;Notshane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Notshane;5;"Wow, this is pretty painful to write.  For those of you familiar with me, you have probably seen that I enjoy a lot of comedies, even if they were not as well written or clever as the more popular ones. I certainly felt the same way about Lucky Star for a long time, but ever since I begun re-watching it recently, I am starting to see now that I have no idea why I loved this anime so much back in the day.  That is to say, I only modestly enjoy it now. Due to having a bias for random comedies and the Slice of Life genre, I can not really give this anime a score lower than neutral and that may mean you should read another review for something more stern. However, my opinion for this anime changed changed as recently as, well, today. I was re-watching it carefree, enjoying the humor it had to offer and felt a little nostalgic, given Lucky Star is among the first anime that started my renaissance to the medium, as well as solidifying my interest in the Comedy and Slice of Life genres. And for that, I will always be grateful for it.  But now, having seen most of the reviews that this anime has from non-bias fans, my view towards Lucky Star has changed drastically. I had still considered it a high point in the industry, given it did come around 2007 with a bunch of other hits, but now the humor suddenly feels the way everyone says it does; that being boring, uninspired and generic. Indeed, I do love the two genres I mentioned a mere paragraph ago, but that bias can only extend so far when something suddenly feels off after someone guides you the right direction. And since I am of that rare breed of reviewers that looks at both the positive and negative sides of an anime, I will do just that right now. As usual, beginning with the side that has the least to talk about.  I still enjoy the fun nature of the girls, some of the things they talk about and the soundtrack is fitting of their conversations. I like how the animation can look pretty fluid at times to make a situation seem more natural, something that I applauded K-On for doing a lot.  Will not really go on too long about the negatives here since you have read a lot of the other reviews already, but I will just say that the comedy feels like it aged poorly. Relying on everyday life and reference humor will result in any work feeling outdated if given enough time, and Lucky Star is now over a decade old, but was still pretty fresh back when I first saw it. The characters are definitely lifeless if you look at the anime from an objective standpoint. But again, I find myself still kind of enjoying their antics every now and then, simply because of my aforesaid bias. Heh, guess you would call my side a subjective standpoint then. Maybe you should just read one of the more stern reviews, cause I am not even sure if I am even helping your cause anymore.  For real, though, Lucky Star is an anime that I would not go so far as to say you should avoid it. But, it is also not something I am going to say you should jump all over immediately. If you really want to see the bare bones of a Comedy and Slice of Life, then Lucky Star will certainly fulfill that interest. It doesn't get more simple than it and its offerings will neither overwhelm you or feel lackluster if you are a recent anime watcher.  One last thing I will note is that I feel offended that most reviews I have seen of Lucky Star, this website or not, call a lot of people idiots, lolicons, weeaboos (you can't really say that last one if you watch anime yourself) or all of the above for enjoying Lucky Star. Let me tell you right now that you should ignore any review on any website that insults you like that, provided you are a fan of Lucky Star; because you are still allowed to freely enjoy any anime of your liking and you should not change your tastes because of someone else. They belong to you and you alone. If you watch something they watch and you think it is bad, then you are obviously not one of them.  Go enjoy Lucky Star if it is your favorite anime. If everyone still judges you for that, well, at least you're watching something you personally enjoy and that is all that should matter. And I will just say that my opinion is among the most unpopular of any website, considering I still hate SHnY to this day, but have surprisingly come across other anime worse than it over the years. So, lots of people give me mean looks, but I just brush them off. And if you are new to Lucky Star, well, I guess it is up to you. Do you want to explore your tastes or follow the cool crowd? The choice is up to you! I would recommend the former of those two since it certainly helped me, well, watch anime at all.";Mixed Feelings
10;Lucky☆Star;CzeroC;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CzeroC;6;"There was a time that I used to think of ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows as nothing but cups of water with neither taste nor substance to keep things standing out or original. However, Lucky Star is probably the first anime that hit me enough to ~~make~~ force me to have a different view. And you know what, it's not that bad to set myself loose once a while.  When I first got into the show, episode 1, to be more specific, I must say it was downright awful and empty that I almost drop the damn show, no kidding. I mean, why would you waste eight precious minutes of your life for a scene with girls discussing how to eat food...properly. Gosh, I still remember that one as if it was yesterday. However, my instinct was right, as I kept watching, I found myself engulfed in a rather strange phenomenon that refused to let go of me.  One of the main problems people often find with Lucky Star is probably its lack of effective humor. While I am in no position to judge anything, I'd like to say that when it comes to such personal taste matter, as humor, drama, philosophy, etc. you can't expect one anime to be able to satisfy all the need. Think about it, what this person ""A"" thinks is funny can't guarantee that I or YOU would feel the same way. It's all subjective, so yeah, Lucky Star might have had this one as its ""supposedly"" flaw, I don't see any problem with that, and in fact, I did find some of the references in this anime funny and well, nicely executed.  On a side note, the thing that bugs me the most during my watching is perhaps the ""Lucky Channel"" at the end of almost every episode. I think of it as nothing but ""filler"" to lengthen the duration of the show. Although I don't hold any grudge against that section of Lucky Star, I just can't seem to find any of it enjoyable or funny.  Plot-wise, we all must know that Slice of Life anime has no definition of ""plot"", but that doesn't mean they would all be boring and pointless without one. Lucky Star simply depicts the very typical daily activities of the girls, nothing more, nothing left. This anime can also be treated as a ""healing"" product, not for something so complicated or powerful to inflict some impact on the viewers. That said, I do think that some parts of this anime were sort of repetitive, thus giving me mixed feelings about the ride as a whole.  That is not to say this anime has nothing special in terms of progression. Though I can't explain why but there were some moments in Lucky Star that I find very ""genuine"", it's like the characters are literally doing our everyday life activity. Kyoto Animation sure did a good job of executing those comfy moments, I'd dare say there wasn't a wasted scene in the process of making the anime. To me, that is one of the strongest points of Lucky Star for it doesn't cling onto one joke too long (well, except that 8-minute food talk but whatever) but would instead swap place with the next one as soon as possible, just so if you don't find this scene funny then yeah, maybe the next one would work.  As for the character, this is by far the best thing that Lucky Star has to offer, just my 2cent that is. The cast is relatively small in the beginning, just 4 ordinary ""moe"" girls with nothing stands out. As more episodes count, more join the fun and thus making it more ""colorful"" in many ways. However, this can indeed be a double-edged sword as it resulted in some of the cast being ""left behind"".  To me, the girls in Lucky Star play their part well as the popular demand, by doing what they do best: cute things. Lame as it may sound, I can't deny that I got hooked several times just by staring at them doing these absolutely casual things. On top of that, there was that one particular being that constantly popped up on my radar, which is Kagami, the short-tempered, twin-tail sister-like character, and this is also, in my opinion, the best character of the show.  At first glance I didn't pay attention to her much, I thought she was just another generic Tsundere that would keep going on my nerves just like many others, but in the end, Lucky Star once again surprised me with this little ""moe"" thing. This is also from this anime that I finally got to know (and feel) what moe truly is. Mere words can't simply describe how weird this feeling is whenever I see her (definitely not love though), but well, I guess this is why there are so many people succumbed to these kinds of shows.  Enough with the rambling, from my observation, Kagami isn't just some cliche character that would remain the same till the rest of the show, but instead, has developments. It may sound stupid, but when I think about it, it's not really something to be made fun of. Though the development isn't that grandiose, mind-blowing, or dramatic like many other great shows, I still find it commendable and noteworthy for an anime like Lucky Star. It proves that through little things we can slowly change to be something else without even being aware of it, this is also one of the special things about Lucky Star.  Animation-wise, Lucky Star has a rather odd art style, to say the least. However, I got used to it after a few episodes and eventually grow to like it. The direction is quite brilliant, as mentioned above, they won't keep you stuck inside a single joke for a long time, it's like a train to visit many different places in a park that will at least make you feel not ""condensed"". The character design is, as expected, seemingly sparkling and kinda irritating if you're not familiar with these kinds of shows. Still, I think it's quite remarkable for Kyoto Animation to make me enjoy the girl's design before I even knew it. It just simply happened that way, I couldn't even tell why but you get the idea, moe sure is a dangerous thing.  Lastly, an anime cannot be completed without sound, and Lucky Star sure did a great job in this aspect. The opening is probably the highlight of the show. Admittedly, I didn't like it, no, I must say I hated it in the beginning. It was too cheesy with the annoying voice of the characters that made me skip a few times. Nonetheless, strangely enough, when I got tired of skipping I decided to just let it slide and enjoy whatever it got, and the result after a few episodes later was astonishing, I fell in love with the opening without question.  The voice acting sure is interesting, I usually do not enjoy the typical ""cute"" voice of the girls since it can easily get on my nerves, but I guess Lucky Star is an exception. The background music is also well-distributed, there were moments that I instantly laughed when the music started playing since they fit the mood so well. The Endings are not really to my taste but well at least I can say it's not boring watching people doing weird things behind the scene.  Unexpectedly, an anime that I had little interest in outwardly turned out to be something very entertaining and unforgettable. Though there flaws that could not be overlooked due to my nitpicking nature, I think if you're someone who's really into slice-of-life then this anime is a must-watch. For those who seek ""healing"" anime, give this one a try, at least 2 episodes like I did before deciding to drop. And well, if you're the type who only enjoy action, drama, especially those who strictly seek humor then I don't think this is the right place for you.";Mixed Feelings
11;Lucky☆Star;Monjoex;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Monjoex;6;"~Story~ 6/10 Lucky Star is a series that has a loose storyline, but does not deviate from the big picture. After viewing a few episodes, it follows more like that of Azumanga Daioh and Ichigo Mashimaro. This is a slice of life story that is realistic, and is full of skits all around. Some viewers may scrunch their eyebrows at the questions the main characters ask, and the discussions that follow, and there are some punchlines that may be dubious to comprehend, but it does not affect the story overall. The story plot, which is weak, is strengthened with the characters, who reflect different personalities and persuasions. It's a good balance.  ~Art~ 9/10 The motions of the characters are fluid, and it just feels like the animation is clean from the get go. The details might need to be a bit more improvement, but it's not as much an issue because it holds its own. Some of the scenes, like Tsukasa in the ocean during the beach vacation, or Kagami's tears after confessing to Konata about her weight gain, are indeed detailed, and are done tastefully well. The OP of the show even has some computer animations, too. The art, the direction, and the way Kyoto Animation did this series reflects their work of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and its formula can be adjusted for any series that they work on. The art matches the emotions, the storylines, and the thoughts. Altogether, in spite of a need for a little more detail, it is another solid KyoAni effort. If I could give it an 8.5, I would, but a 9 should be close enough.  ~Sound~ 6/10 Lucky Star has a rather nifty way of promoting silliness and ingenuity in one using their opening theme. ""Motteke! Sailor Fuku"" is a very upbeat and catchy song reminiscent of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya's ending song ""Hare hare Yukai "" in which it also sports a wacky dance number. On the Other hand, the long list of ending songs is just too much and the only recurring theme is they are being played while the characters are singing in a karaoke bar!  ~Character~ 6/10 Konata Izumi, the main protagonist, has a fetish for chocolate cornets, as well as a number of anime and manga shows that are also popular. Not surprisingly, she is an avid follower of Haruhi Suzumiya (the seiyuu of both characters is Aya Hirano), and you also have plenty of other anime and manga references. And in spite all her bubblyness, and the catlike smile she loves to sport, she has skeletons in the closet, too: her mother died when she was young. She is a ""Jill of all trades,"" the renaissance girl, and the otaku, all in one. Kagami Hiiragi is the tsundere-type of girl in this series, and a popular girl in her class. Aesthetically, she is an interesting person to pay attention to, more so than her sister Tsukasa, although there are attributes that make her unique. Miyuki Takara is your meganekko in the show, and after Konata talks with her about what her weaknesses are, she sees her in the moekko mold. The supporting characters have their unique quirks: Yui Narumi, Konata's cousin, and her teacher, Nanako Kuroi, are akin to Yukari Tanizaki and Minamo Kurosawa in AzuDai. Akira Kogami and Minoru Shiraishi, who both host the Lucky-Channel portion of the show, are a boke-tsukkomi duo. Some other well known characters outside of Lucky Star even cameo in the series, like Sergeant Frog. I feel it may take away from the story, but these guest stars add another dimension to this sitcom of a series. Lucky Star can also be thought of as a sitcom in a way, a situational comedy with punchlines at every twist and turn.  ~Enjoyment~ 8/10 This show make me smile, laugh, and bored. If you like SOL genre, I recommend you to watch this.";Mixed Feelings
12;Lucky☆Star;AgentBishop;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AgentBishop;5;if i can't finish it, it's not that great right? around episode 15 it became impossible to finish this anime without skipping a lot  the main problem is that there is no overall plot, every episode is about casual things that happen in our life like missing a bus, so after a while it becomes repetitive and this anime is just SOOO nice! nothing slightly edgy which made it harder to enjoy the show to the fullest, even one edgy joke would have done the trick!  the dynamic between the characters doesn't change, there is no moment of closeness, Kagami says something and Konata roasts her by mumbling and Kagami yell WHAT DID YOU SAY?? or YOU ARE WORSE HERE. Tsukasa remains a goofball, says nothing worth listening too and Miyuki just got forgotten, i don't remember her having any role in the second half of the show, the most memorable thing about her is her rotten tooth!  and ofc Akira and Minoru, it was funny the first 3 episode but it became annoying after that  there are random moments featuring characters who talk like dragon ball but have different style (close to jojo's style), that was just cringe  i understand they put a lot of effort into this show but if i couldn't finish it it means it's not that good, right? so yeah this Wraps this up;Mixed Feelings
13;Lucky☆Star;pink-skyfox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pink-skyfox;5;Personally I found this anime boring, but not because I dislike slice of lifes , in fact it is my favourite genre. No, I think Lucky star is boring to me because I am not part of the audience it was meant for. You see, a lot of the 'comedy' in this comedy anime relies on the viewer knowing certain things about life in Japan and otaku culture and relating to what the characters are saying, but I'm from The West and only started watching anime when the pandemic hit, so a lot of the jokes fly straight over my head. without the comedy aspect this show gets boring really fast. I only completed it because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  There's even a couple of things that kind of annoy me about this anime. For example: the way they keep saying that Kagemi loves to snack and is always eating, and the others (Konata) tease her about gaining weight, yet she looks just as paper-thin as the rest of them, in fact all the girls have the exact same body type just with differing heights and busts, and the jokes just don't really land for me because of that. Besides, mocking people for their weight is really outdated and unfunny. See also: the way the flat girls keep comparing their boobs every fucking time they see Miyuki, or any even slightly busty character. They clearly love that joke, because I swear it shows up in nearly every episode, and it gets real old real fast. Especially because the 'big' boobs they're so jealous of are like, C cups at best. If you wanted to mock that anime trope do it properly, jeez.  I do enjoy the art style overall, because I love cute things and by god this style is the most Kawaii Moe Moe Chibi thing ever. That's about the only thing I really did like about this show though.;Mixed Feelings
14;Lucky☆Star;TraparDensity;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TraparDensity;6;"Many people say that lucky star is the ""sienfeld"" of anime. But the difference between the two is: sienfeld is actually funny.  Now before you rage, hear me out....  Sure lucky star is a show about nothing and is a compilation of funny skits and such. The only thing is that, i did not find the show that funny. Or as hilarious as people make it to be. Yes there were a few parts where i laughed but besides that nada. This is perhaps my fault for i was not really used to these kinds of shows. So a year later, i watched it and with much more knowledge on anime. I obtained almost the same result. It's very easy to make me laugh but this show does not click for me.  On the brighter side the art and the sound fits well with the setting of the show, the opening is uplifting and catchy. Also it was interesting at times to follow the lives of the characters. Which brings me to my next point, the characters are actually not bad and it is extremely intriguing to follow the lives of these high school students.  Overall, the show is alright but really it was not my thing. I didn't find it that funny. But it still has some redeeming qualities.";Mixed Feelings
15;Lucky☆Star;Bofthree;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bofthree;5;"TL;DR version: Lucky☆Star is the anime equivalent of a white noise machine.  Long version: I've put off Lucky Star for a very long time. Honestly speaking, my younger teenage self in the late 2000's would have bashed the crap out of this series and probably rate it a 2 or something, but we're not asking what younger me thinks. Younger me is a dumbass after all.  Present me in his mid to late 20's somewhat enjoyed LS. The thing about Lucky Star is that it's not supposed to be over-the-top entertaining (in the main show anyways, as opposed to Lucky Channel, but we'll get to that later). Lucky Star is very mellow in atmosphere, even the background music is consistent, simple and kept at the minimum to maintain that mellow feeling. There are no major conflicts or fantastical point in a plot. Only about 2 episodes out of 24 does it show a serious tone. It's not necessarily something you binge watch (although I did, but whatever). The layout of each episode can vary, but once again, for approximately three quarters of the show, it's very tranquil and relaxing in nature. So if you're more about adrenaline fueled excitement and burst out laughing, or full on cry or rage, this show isn't for you.  Most of the characters aren't as expressive and entertaining as you might think, contrary to how the opening song has portrayed them. A lot of their conversations revolve around mundane activities, situations and objects. In a way, it makes you, the audience, feel like you are the third wheel amongst a group of friends. You listen to their complaints or thoughts, but don't really input your own, making some episodes extremely hard and boring to watch (most notably, episode 1 and their ""food talk""). At least, that's the way it is for me. The characters barely have much personality. Besides Izumi and a few others, all of the characters are really bland. I was disappointed that new side characters gets introduced RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the series. Sadly, they're a bit more interesting than the main girls we are used to seeing (with the exception of Izumi of course). Izumi unfortunately has the responsibility of pulling the main show together with her geeky personality, but when you have the slightly more interesting of the bland bunch trying to make the show entertaining, you're gonna have a bad time. I like Izumi, but even she isn't that amazing as a character.  Its humor heavily uses references, some of it VERY obscure unless you're well-versed in said reference. The core of their humor is how the topic relates to the audience. LS is too reliant on the audience's understanding of the characters' plight, which doesn't make good entertainment and causes the delivery to be quite weak, although a few did catch me by surprise and I actually laughed. A joke won't unfold itself without a good delivery. However, giving credit where it's due, it's actually quite original in a sense as well. I did enjoy the few running gags that they've installed, like how the nameless side characters all have the same distinctive voice of a middle aged man or an old woman, no matter their actual age. I've also enjoyed how they handle the ending songs and the use of live action. Half of the time they're hits or misses.  Finally, Lucky Channel. The Lucky Channel segments have their ups and downs. It's the complete opposite in atmosphere and the characters are, in my opinion, overly expressive and the transition from Lucky Star to Lucky Channel just ruins the flow of the show. First Lucky Star puts me in a relaxed state, then immediately slaps me with the ostentatious Akira of Lucky Channel is just a terrible transition between scenes. If Lucky Channel was somehow made into a separate side story, then I would be fine with. The only thing I like about Lucky Channel was the interaction between the anchors and their development, but even that can only be tolerated for a certain amount of episodes before you grow tired of it.  All in all, Lucky☆Star is pretty average. It's a 6 at best and a 3 at worst.";Mixed Feelings
16;Lucky☆Star;Fear_the_Reefer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fear_the_Reefer;6;"Once upon a time, there were two young women who couldn’t be more different. Despite the fact that they were both teenagers going to the same high school in Saitama prefecture, Japan, almost nothing about them was similar. Konata Izumi, a petit bluenette with the attitude of a slacker, and Kagami Hiiragi, a responsible honor student with little tolerance for nonsense. One of them comes from a single parent home, the other from a large and closely knit family. One of them devotes her entire life to distractions with little time set aside for academics, the other devotes her entire life to academics with little time set aside for distractions. One of them is rooted in the present, the other one keeping a healthy eye on the future. Ordinarily, two people as drastically different as these two would go their whole lives without crossing paths, but against all odds, Konata became close friends with Kagami’s little sister, having daringly saved her life from a foreigner who was trying to ask her for directions to a thrashable car. And thus, these two individuals who should have never met, met.  Yeah, yeah, I know that’s a reference for a different show, but I’m never going to review that show, so I figured I’d use it here. Anyway, the fact that Tsukasa and Konata are in a different class than Kagami leads to the latter being drawn into the former’s world, avoiding what could have otherwise been a major power struggle. She already knew her younger sister Tsukasa, the soft spoken, clumsy and air-headed girl who often depends on her slightly older twin to get by, and while these three make up a troublesome trio all their own, a fourth girl joins their group... The smart, well-mannered and mature(in more ways than one) Miyuki Takara, who Konata and Tsukasa like to bring their cultural questions to. Together, these four unique high schoolers form a friendship that will last them a lifetime, as they share their joys, their frustrations, their lives and their dreams with one another... Or just constantly mess with each other and ask inane questions about candy. Honestly, it could go either way. But maybe, just maybe, they can band together to answer one important question; How DO you eat a chocolate coronet?  I’ve talked about Kyoto Animation quite a few times before, but if you’re worried about me saying the same things I said before, don’t be. I know they have a consistent style, and while it’s evolved over the years, most titles they release do look more or less like they could exist in the same universe. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and while one of them is the far more popular Nichijou, the first departure they made from featuring relatively normal human anatomy was Lucky Star, which is quite possibly one of the most extreme examples of anime where absurdly large “Moe blob” heads are stacked on top of smaller bodies. Well, you know, if you don’t count chibi shows. In any case, the fact that it’s so different from their usual output is probably due to the fact that they chose to produce it as a supplement to their previous smash hit, Haruhi Suzumiya. The two titles are mainly related through fanhood, as Haqruhi suzumiya is a popular series in the Lucky Star universe, and one of the main characters(Konata) is obsessed with it. Sgt. Frog is also big in it, but hey, they took what they could get.  In any case, when I talk about low budget anime using it’s money wisely to look just as good as a more expensive show, you’d have a hard time finding a better example than Lucky Star. It may be one of the black sheep of the Kyo-Ani family due to it’s somewhat cartoony style, but that translates incredibly well to budget-cutting techniques. Background characters are usually frozen and covered in blue paint-bucket filling as they loiter in the background, a move that would feel cheap and lame in any show with characters who are too weak to distract you from them, so it’s worth noting that for at least three-fourths of the time, you’ll barely notice them. The dialogue heavy nature of the series also gives the animators a perfect excuse to hold on a key frame while the characters talk to each other. There are a lot of high school anime that do this, and I can see where it might wear on the patience of most viewers, most examples of this are anime that are inconsistent, suffer from occasional quality drops, and feature movement scenes that look out of place among the rest of the material.  What separates Lucky Star from this lot? Well, the money that they animators saved with their budget saving techniques is put to exquisite use. Every single movement in this series, at least from featured characters, employs just enough movement to capture and portray the mood, intent and gravity of the shot that it’s in, no more, no less. Because of this, every single movement, from huge reaction shots to the smallest wave, features the exact same level of fluidity, unless of course the style has to change for the sake of a parody sequence, such as the “Legendary Girl A” material. Rather than waste their time and resources on weird angles and filters to keep you amused during long bouts of talking, Kyo-Ani decided to cut the bullshit and make the dialogue quirky and entertaining enough so that the slow, heavily conservative animation wouldn’t bother you... To mixed results, i’m afraid to say, but we’ll get to that later. I’d also like to say that whenever they do execute a parody from another series, the animation style they switch to is normally fairly accurate. The moefication of the characters may be a sticking point for some, but I think it was handled rather well.  As it happens, this is one of the rare anime that I’ve seen in their entirety in both languages, and for the most part, I can say that Bang Zoom managed to represent the original Japanese acting faithfully. Wendee Lee is a bit of a departure from Aya Hirano’s Konata, mainly because... As I mentioned in my Haruhi review... She doesn’t have quite the range of Aya-chan. Thankfully, she does much better with this character than she did with Haruhi, employing a sort of rolling rasp to imitate Konata’s gruff, good-humored delivery. This unfortunately doesn’t always work, such as when she sounds excited or needs to raise her voice, at which points she sounds so much like Haruhi that it’s honestly distracting. Still, the rasp is different from Aya’s performance, but it suits the character just as well. Karen Strassman, on the other hand, is spot on with her version of Aya Endo’s character, Miyuki Takara. It’s not identical, but it’s a very close ringer for the polite, aristocratic-sounding character.  Michelle Ruff is something of a chameleon(in a good way), and can play a wide roange of characters, so it might be a shock to your system if you hear her in bleach or Haruhi, and then see her listed in the credits under Tsukasa, the younger Hiiragi twin, a space cadet with an overly soft, shy sounding voice. She doesn’t sound as child-like as Kaori Fukuhara did, which is probably for the better, because her dialogue mainly alternates between innocent musings and woe-is-me whining, and it would have sounded annoying in English had Ruff not aged it up a bit. Out of all the main cast, however, Kari Wahlgren probably had the hardest job with Kagami, a tsundere-type of character whose vocal patterns and inflections don’t really exist stateside. Not only that, but Kagami is probably the most nuanced and complicated character in the cast, and while Emiri Kato was amazing in her native language, Kari knocks it out of the park by playing it down to earth, but with a more snarky, confident edge.  Rebecca Forstadt gets a heart-warming cameo that I won’t dare spoil, Bridget Hoffman is hilarious as Miyuki’s dependent mother, and Kate Higgins plays a quirky teacher that Luci Christian would be proud of. Hynden Walch is unrecognizeable as Konata’s cousin, and among her friends, Michelle ruff puts her talents to work playing double duty, the prolific Philese Sampler plays a small role, and Patericia Ja Lee... Well, she’s probably the only sour note in the group, keeping her performance as close to the Japanese as possible, when she really... Really... Shouldn’t have. But my favorite has to be Stephanie Sheh in the role of Akira Kogami, one of the two hosts of the episode ending segment Lucky Channel, and while I’ve preached the gospel about her character range before, she puts it on full display here, playing a character who’s sugar and spice personified. She flip-flops between a sweet, happy-go-lucky idol and a crude, bitter behind the scenes personality who, despite being 14, has seen it all and won’t take any shit from anybody. I personally recommend the dub, but you can’t go wrong with either choice.  There’s a certain brand of comedy anime... Which I believe was popularized by Azumanga Daioh... That takes the slice of life concept and moves it into the confines of a Japanese high school, so the viewer can observe the daily lives of a group of friends as they interact and develop both as individuals and as a group. Not only does this brand bank on the childhood nostalgia of older viewers, but it also leans heavily on the strong personalities of it’s characters to deliver jokes, humorous situations, and the occasional heartfelt moment. This brand gets criticized for being plotless, but is that really fair? Is a plot really necessary for a comedy, or can it stand on it’s own just by being funny? It’s true that most American TV, both animated and live action, is devoid of overarching plots, as they’re most often carried by strong writing and strong characters, but they still have individual episode plots. For more than a quarter of it’s run, Lucky Star doesn’t even have that. So, are the characters and comedy strong enough to overcome this disadvantage, like they were in Azumanga Daioh?  I’ll admit, the show doesn’t get off to a great start. It’s never been made clear why Yutaka Yamamoto was fired as series director after the first four episodes... Especially since he was the person who created the viral dance sequences that made the ending theme of Haruhi and the opening theme of Lucky Star so explosive... But rumors and speculation have been made that it was his approach to the series was far too close to the manga, adapting the small, four panel comics one after another, leaving little room for interesting stories and forward momentum. Personally, I didn’t entirely mind these episodes, as long as Kagami and/or Konata were on screen. The four main characters have a very strong dynamic made up of several smaller connections and interactions, such as Konata perving over Miyuki’s moe potential, Kagami and Tsukasa being polar opposites, Tsukasa and Miyuki... You know what? No. Those two alone just don’t amount to anything noteworthy. They need the other two characters to function.  Right in the early stages of the series, Lucky Star goes out of it’s way to show what happens when Tsukasa and Miyuki are left to their own devices, having a conversation so banal and fraught with unutilized set-ups that Kagami, sick in bed for a surprisingly unrelated reason, is begging one of them to just reach the punchline already. They need Konata to exploit their quirks, or Kagami to call them out, or it’s ultimately like leaving jokes on the table. That’s not to say Konata and Kagami don’t need the other two... They’re fairly versatile characters, and different interactions can bring that out in them... And Tsukasa can be fairly funny on her own, what with her constant airheaded mistakes... But the series is at it’s absolute best when Konata and Kagami are working off of each other. There’s a reason I based my plot synopsis off of their differences, and it’s not JUST the fact that I had to think of a gimmick just to give this show a plot synopsis in the first place. Out of the four supposed main characters, those two carry the series.  In most of their interactions, those two are the dominant forces... Konata making references and shocking people with her weird reactions, Kagami making sarcastic remarks and brutally biting observations... And it’s rare for anyone else to dominate them in an interaction, but they meet their matches in each other. The bickering that takes place between them is easily one of the highlights of the series, as you can’t always tell who’s going to come out on top of each encounter, most of which just end in stalemates. While Miyuki is probably the weakest of the four, they still come together to form the foundation of the series. Actually, they’re more of a trunk, as the comedic strength of Lucky Star feels like something of a tree. Together, they’re strong, sturdy, and have a great dynamic based on the chemistry that they have with one another. The reason I’m comparing them to a tree is that, when you talk about the rest of the cast, it does start to create a weakening effect, just like how a tree becomes more difficult to climb the higher up it spreads.  When the cast starts branching out, we get a group of supporting characters for the main cast to work off of outside of each other. Miyuki gets some support from her mother, an entitled slob who appears to take advantage of her brainy and responsible daughter in some cases, which is really when she’s at her best. Kagami and Tsukasa have their family for support, including their mother AND father(Both of whom are alive... weird, right?) as well as their four older sisters, their conflict with whom helps to develop their characters as well as highlight the special bond that they, the twins, have with one another. Konata, and I don’t think her bevy of fans realize this, has THREE characters supporting mainly her, including her pervy father to explain her upbringing, her cousin in law enforcement to highlight the illegal sorts of activities that her upbringing has led her to, and the homeroom teacher, who attempts to drag her kicking and screaming back to reality when she tries to escape to a game. She gets her shots in on all three of them, but it still goes to show just how dependent she is on the rest of the cast.  The branches of the support characters are strong enough to do just that, but they become significantly weaker when you move to the next group, the underclassmen, a group of younger characters who start to appear in the second half of the series, when even the comedy between the main four is strting to get tired and predictable. Unfortunately, these characters aren’t strong enough to hold a story for very long, with only one of them... Konata’s cousin, Yutaka... Being even slightly above one-dimensional. This group of friends is more stereotype than people, which is sad, because the characters on the lower branches do, to their credit, feel like fleshed out and complex characters, at least to a point. Yutaka’s friends, however, are direct archetypes, and Yu herself doesn’t even DO anything with her quirk, being the sickly girl. Her friends include the pervy mangaka, the ignorant foreigner, the boyish breast-envy girl... And that’s it, and the story seems to give them far more credit than screentime, as they play a major role in the ending. Also appearing at the ending climax are friends from Kagami’s class, poised not as branches but as sub-branches that aren’t strong enough to hold a freaking apple.  So in terms of characters, the comedy does get weaker as the show goes on, but that won’t matter if they grow and move through important events and situations, right? Well, yes, there are a few. There are a few moments that take the cast out of their comfort zone to explore them in new ways. In a later episode, with the main four taking a field trip together, contains a bunch of great moments in it, like Tsukasa being attacked by deer, Kagami getting a love letter, and Konata cheering her up afterwards. The episode soon after, where Konata’s family gets a secret visit, is surprisingly poignant. Some of the best episodes include the beach episode, the Comiket episode, the Christmas episode, Konata’s birthday... Episodes where something noteworthy actually happens, instead of just a chain of jokes and gags, and that’s setting a pretty low bar. There’s no point in getting invested in any of the characters, because unlike Azumanga Daioh, they have no arcs, and their futures beyond high school are left completely unresolved. Yeah, there are some enjoyable moments, and good jokes here and there, But I was never bored watching it... Even if I am in the minority.  I am part of a very specific demographic that this show caters to... I was an otaku in the mid-2000s. That’s it. That’s why I can enjoy it, while most new visitors can’t. find it anything but boring. People who enjoy it the most are the ones who watched it when it came out, or in the few years immediately following, but if you came into it after 2010, it probably comes off as one of the most dated anime you’ve ever seen. That’s not to say you won’t find the characters interesting, the casual tone relaxing, or element of friendship welcoming, but you’re watching anime that was created to be a reflection of it’s time, in it’s time, and a lot of what it chose to represent isn’t relevant today, unfortunately meaning that it hasn’t aged well. It relied on gimmicks and otaku pandering rather than story-telling and real emotion, and that fact along with it’s moe design kept it from having any chance of being as timeless as that other slice of life show I keep bringing up. It gets a lot better after episode 4, but it just doesn’t stand the test of time.  Lucky Star was originally available from Bandai Entertainment, and the DVD sets from then are still available online in both individual, limited edition and complete collection formats, although the DVDs that were produced by Funimation after they rescued the series are far more affordable. The OVA is available on DVD, but it’s also included in the Funimation release, and I think you already know how much I love it. It’s the same series, but with much more fluid and well written stories. The original manga is available stateside from Viz Media. Beyond that, there are a ton of light novels, mangas and games that are NOT available stateside.  Calling Lucky Star an acquired taste is probably being a bit too generous... It’s one of the most esoteric series I’ve ever seen, as it seems deliberately designed to appeal to a small demographic, which I happen to be a part of, and even I think the series is overrated. It’s appeal is small, but it’s still precious to the people in it’s demographic, and I still enjoy it as well, even at it’s worst moments. I love the main cast, and there’s a lot about them that I find relatable. Does that mean I’d recommend it to a high number of people? No, but if you know someone who was an anime fan during the previous decade, or if you know someone who plays a lot of online games, or if you just know someone who has a mischievous sense of humor, this might be a good title to suggest to them. To anyone else, tread with caution, because the phrase ‘culturally impenetrable’ doesn’t even begin to describe it. It’s worth checking out, but if you’re not into it by the fifth episode, try out Azumanga Daioh or Nichijou instead. Otherwise, this adorkable title has just enough going for it to make up for it’s weaknesses. I give Lucky Star a 6/10.";Mixed Feelings
17;Lucky☆Star;Awoo4U;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Awoo4U;6;Story  To be fair, Lucky Star doesn't have a story. It is a slice of life anime with extremely loose narrative cohesion. If you are looking for a compelling narrative, you will not find one here. The series can be described as a random commentary on otaku culture in the mid 2000s. If anything, it is a great time capsule of anime in the year 2007. It is like Seinfeld because it is about nothing, but Seinfeld had excellent characters, humor, and observations and this show is definitely not on the same level.  Art  The animation is great and the art style is interesting.  Sound  The opening is one of the most obnoxious anime openings I ever seen. Not much else of note.  Character  Konata really pulls her weight, she is easily the most crucial character. The purple hair twins are pretty much secondary to her.The pink hair girl doesnt do much despite being a main character. There are a lot of unmemorable characters as well.  Enjoyment  Some episodes are real boring and might make you drop the series. There are not a lot of laugh out moments either. At best, the series can be described as amusing. I did find myself feeling nostalgic about my early highschool years and this series is a great time capsule of 2007. If you want an anime that doesn't require you to think playing in the backround, then this one is a good fit as that was how I watched the series  Overall  Hard to recommend this series. If you are not aware of the state of anime around the 2000s, the references might fly right over your head. The narrative is not cohesive either, so if episodic series are not your liking, this is definitely not a good one.;Mixed Feelings
18;Lucky☆Star;starshinesMonet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/starshinesMonet;7;I really liked the upbeat OP but the content felt very stream-of-consciousness ala Japanese humour.  It was pretty funny at times. I especially liked the karaoke scenes and references to other animes. In many ways it reminds me of a funnier, cuter Pop Team Epic. If you enjoy either of these things you will probably enjoy this anime.  There is no story or plot to speak of but the art style was fun, bright, and loud. The characters are really cute but did not have enough development for me to become invested in them.  For me, I need more of a story and more growth to enjoy myself but I can see the appeal of this if you are looking for something fun, cute, and relaxing.;Mixed Feelings
19;Lucky☆Star;Wenis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wenis;5;"Lucky Star is an older anime and fairly well known. It was suggested to me by many people so, I thought 'why the hell not.' I gave it a try, and I was greatly disappointed. Before you give up on this review, let me explain myself. What seemed to be a comedic, lovable and enjoyable anime, turned into a boring, and at times annoying one.  Story: The story of Lucky Star was plain, and far too boring for my taste. A couple high school girls going about their lives, talking about boring subjects, boring. There was nothing exciting that happened. I wasn't expecting some hardcore plot twists, with action and lots of drama. Though it would have been nice to maybe have a fight or two between friends, a misunderstood character that comes off as the bad character or, maybe a little romantic spark to spice up the plot.  What was supposed to be the comedic actions of Izuki being a hardcore gamer and otaku, bringing her friends into her world, grew old pretty quick. Izumi constantly copying her friend's homework, no lazy to do her own became irritating. The story was basically a long, drawn out plot that could have ended with 12 episodes and would have been the same. It lacked excitement; while watching this I did not laugh or even chuckle.  Characters: I have to give Lucky Star one plus, the friendship between all the girls was sweet. They got along well and helped each other no matter what. Although the characters as individuals didn't stand out, they just faded into the background. You have the Hiiragi twins, who are the polar opposite of each other. Kagami is your typical, serious high school student that gets good grades. She pretends not to care, though secretly she does, nothing else worth mentioning. Tsukasa, is basically just a dumb air-head, but she's nice and friendly, so everyone likes her. Then you get the rich, popular girl Takara who was barely there. Then you get the Character who had the most personality, Izumi, bratty, annoying and lazy. For some reason, people liked her. To sum it up, the Characters really aren't anything to spare a second glance at.  Art and sound: The opening to this anime was honestly one of the catchiest I have heard. The art was okay, cute and colorful, but nothing really special about it.  This anime was just too plain for me, nothing exciting happened, nothing to look forward to. Although, this shouldn't stop you from watching it and seeing for yourself. These are all my personal opinions.  Hoped you enjoyed this review, sorry if they're any mistakes and such.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lucky☆Star;immortalrite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/immortalrite;2;"There is nothing in entertainment worse than bad comedy.  Bad drama, horror, romance, or action at least has the possibility of being amusing, if only for purely ironical purposes, and watching something which is intended to be serious completely fail can be surprisingly fun (see MST3K). However, watching something try to be funny and fail is hardly ever amusing in the slightest, and amounts, for me at least, to the epitome of nauseating boredom. In the anime world, Lucky Star is perhaps the best (and at the very least the most popular) example of bad comedy ever made.  Now, it is more or less universally agreed upon amongst Lucky Star's detractors that the show is, quite simply, ""unfunny."" At the same time however, it is not always explained in detail why or how it is unfunny. But before delving into the specifics, I will freely admit from the outset that comedy is probably the most subjective and difficult of all genres (I myself have some bizarre comedic tastes) to review. Nevertheless, I believe Lucky Star merits special attention, along with a special place in Hell, for how unprecedentedly unfunny it is. This is also why I chose it for my inaugural anime review.  Basically, the ""humor"" of Lucky Star is derived from two sources: 1) Discussions about everyday life experience (e.g. food, homework, clothes), and 2) References (either verbal or visual) to other anime franchises and various anime-related tropes. As for the first, Lucky Star makes the awful mistake of assuming that simply because something is true or commonly experienced, it is funny. Thus the episodes are crammed with inane, excruciatingly detailed conversational gems like  Person 1: ""You know how when it's cold outside, you want to stay inside for longer?"" Person 2: ""Haha yeah, I've totally been there!""  or  Person 1: ""You know how when you have a lot of stuff to do, you clean your room instead?"" Person 2: ""Haha yeah, I've done that before!""  You get the idea. The whole ""funny because it's true"" thing in my experience only works if it is comingled with an adequate amount of absurdity or exaggeration (for an example, see Mike Judge's films). Lucky Star, on the other hand, aims for pure realism in all its dullness. With this ""comedic"" logic, they may as well assume that simply because I have eaten food before, I will think that watching people eat food is funny; furthermore, I will think that people talking about eating food is also funny. What makes this method even more ridiculous for Lucky Star is the fact that one must be rather extensively versed in Japanese culture to even ""get"" a lot of these ""jokes,"" let alone find them funny.  As for the anime references, this is where the annoyance factor truly rears its ugly head. Typically, an outside reference to another anime is funny because it is unexpected and well-timed. Lucky Star on the other hand, crams in as many references as it possibly can, many of which are to other works from Kyoto Animation. As one might imagine, this not only gets incredibly dull, but also unbearably irritating as the show progresses. By far the most frequent and most facepalm-inducing are the references to the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Granted, this trick was somewhat amusing the first time, but by the end of the series, the Haruhi references become so frequent, so bland, and so obvious that I literally began slamming my head into my desk. Thus like the reference to ""everyday life,"" the references to anime make the assumption that just because we have seen the shows referenced, that we will find the references funny. Are we really supposed to pat ourselves on the back and quietly snicker to ourselves for being ""in the know""? It seems like the real reason for all these anime references is a) a clever form of product-placement and b) riding on the success of vastly superior franchises (Full Metal Panic, Haruhi Suzumiya, the Key-game shows). The only reference that actually made me chuckle a bit (and not immediately roll my eyes or want to punch my computer screen) was the part in episode 13 where one of the shop employees uses his ""Geass"" on Konata to get her to buy a DVD, only to find that she is three yen short.  Now typically, in order to use reference-parodies like this successfully, one ought to find a way to integrate them in a creative and subtle way, and there are many examples of this in anime alone. Lucky Star, on the other hand, particularly when parodying well-known anime tropes, squanders its comedic potential by feeling the need to tell you exactly what they are parodying. Therefore, whenever Miyuki trips or turns off the light by accident, or Yutaka mentions that she is frail and ""sick all the time,"" we are sure to have Konata not far off to immediately comment how incredibly ""moe"" she is. Ha. Ha. Ha. There is a similar delivery style with ""tsundere,"" ""fanservice,"" and other related terms and cliches. Watching this is like listening to someone tell a joke only to quickly explain the punchline before the audience even has a chance to laugh.  Aesthetically, there is not terribly much to say other than I find it amazing that even here Lucky Star manages to add yet another layer of annoyance. The characters were clearly designed to resemble the (equally unfunny) manga as closely as possible, and the result is not pleasing. The foreground and background art is lackluster and totally generic, not to mention the core girls all look waaaay too young (and not just in a typical ""moe"" way) for being in high school. Such failure in this department is all the more surprising knowing that this show was produced by Kyoto Animation, a studio which, among other things, is particularly well known for its beautiful and groundbreaking visual styling. In Lucky Star, there is no such evidence whatsoever that this is the same company who did Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Air, or Kanon. I suspect the real reason Kyoto took this project on was because of potential legal issues surrounding the ludicrous amounts of references to their other works. Other than that, the music consists of bland, forgettable five-note pieces typical for this kind of show. Except worse.  Setting aside for a moment what Lucky Star has brings up the important issue of what it does not have. In fact, one of Lucky Star's most subtle and yet most serious detriments is the almost complete absence of visual humor of any kind (the stock anime-facial-expressions aside). The show is quite simply a bunch of talking heads, and as something in the medium of animation, Lucky Star feels incredibly out of place; 99% of the show consist of dialogue and dialogue only. Suffice it to say, this show was a complete and unfortunate waste of Kyoto's talent.  All in all, my biggest problem with Lucky Star, and the reason why I have been compelled to write this review, is that it basically gives slice of life comedy a bad name--something which is all the more compounded by its rabid popularity. It is not at all unlikely that someone who has never seen a slice of life show will first see Lucky Star and then assume that the entire genre is of similar quality. After all, comments like ""nothing happens"" and ""there's no plot"" are fairly common amongst complaints from Lucky Star haters. Unfortunately, I believe people may be missing out on a lot of great, funny, clever slice of life shows ""where there's no plot"" (Fumoffu, Azumanga Daioh, Minami-ke) if Lucky Star does indeed manage to taint them so severely. It is interesting to note that Lucky Star is perhaps most often mentioned along with the classic Azumanga Daioh, and the comparison is not at all unmerited: both shows are based off of a four-panel manga about a group of quirky high school girls and their antics. However, once the stylistic similarities are brushed aside, you are left with two anime which could not be more diametrically opposed. That is, whereas Azumanga Daioh represents the pinnacle of comedy done right, Lucky Star represent the pinnacle of comedy done wrong; whereas Azumanga Daioh uses ""random conversations about food"" in a broader, situational context to give them humorous contrast, Lucky Star takes this device to a ridiculous extreme--it makes an entire show out of it to the expense of nearly everything else. The difference between Azumanga's Osaka and Lucky Star's Konata is that the former is one character amongst many, whereas the latter is only an otaku-pandering, watered-down Osaka amongst many other watered-down Osaka's, without any significant personality contrast. In Lucky Star, there is no one to sarcastically say ""wow, you have a really vivid imagination..."" but rather the one-note ""joke"" of ""randomness"" continues on into senseless oblivion. If Azumanga Daioh is a bright beacon of joyful, energetic laughter, Lucky Star is a dark pit of disparaging, cynical boredom (if you'll excuse the melodramatic language). It basically takes the slice of life genre but does not fill it with any real content, leaving naught but an empty husk.  In conclusion, if you want a creative, genuine, funny slice-of-life comedy and not simply a long otaku in-joke set on repeat, avoid Lucky Star like the plague.";Not Recommended
1;Lucky☆Star;MoWriter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MoWriter;2;"When I first looked into Lucky Star, I thought I was going to be impressed. People in the anime club I help run wanted to watch this series so bad and it ended up in 4th place, so we weren't able to show it this semester. Still, I wanted to know what the appeal of Lucky Star was. The chibi art made the anime look unique and interesting, and I thought that I couldn't go wrong with an anime series that was so popular. This is where ""looks can be deceiving"" really comes into play.  Despite the cute art, which got annoying very quickly, Lucky Star really fell on its face form the get-go. The story had nothing to offer. Basically, you spend twenty-four episodes watching a group of high school girls run around, talk to each other, make jokes, and dance. I have completely summarized the entire series for you in that last sentence, and I'm not kidding. Each episode was a repeat as the last, except for character problems and issues, and after every episode I said, ""Alright, it still has to get better from here,"" and it never did. The only thing that ever improved was the Lucky Channel, but that was because I didn't have to hear Akira's annoying squeaking in the last three or so episodes.  I know that the story is suppose to be based around a comedic high school cast, but to be honest, the comedy was terrible. In order to get most of the jokes, one would have to know a lot in video games, anime, and Japanese puns. Now, I don't know a lot of video games or Japanese puns, so those jokes failed, and the anime jokes that I did get surfaced once in a while, and that type of comedy was absolutely terrible. I think I snickered maybe once or twice during the entire series. Yes, the entire series.  Along with Lucky Star's terrible story and comedy choice, I found myself hating most of the characters. The only half-way decent characters were shown in the last half of the anime, and those characters really weren't anything special. Most of the weren't dynamic, lacking originality, and went along with the same thing over and over again. When those sparks of originality were shown, they were quickly covered by the same old, bland things that happened through out the entire series. A great example comes from Konata, the main girl with blue hair and green eyes. She runs around every episode, talks about food, anime, video games, and how she was late or tired because she stayed up all night playing video games. Kagami, one of the lavender haired twins, is exactly the same way - smart, angered easily, and is very poor at house chores. Miyuki, the pink haired girl with glasses, is klutsy, ""moe"", intelligent, and formal with her speech. I could go on and on, but I don't think it's needed.  With the characters, art, and story quickly falling apart, I turned to something I thought would work - the music. I learned quickly, however, that the music was only a little better than everything else. Some of the songs sounded like they were recorded on a cellphone and then placed into the show. It wasn't that the quality was bad, but rather than the music used was very bland, unoriginal, and lacked dynamic, not that the story had any of those or anything. The music fit the series alright, but by itself, the music would just be a waste of space on whatever drive you would be listening to it on. Even the opening theme was annoying.  So, with all of these things said, I'm surprised that I made it to the last episode. Now, it's safe to say that just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that others won't. Obviously, the MAL rating for Lucky Star fights any point that I've made against the series. However, I will not be recommending Lucky Star to any of my friends. Ever. In fact, I will tell them to avoid it, and to be fair in my fight, I don't think it deserves the popularity it has. Sure it's cute, but that's about it.";Not Recommended
2;Lucky☆Star;Yukariki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yukariki;3;"I may be considered as a Lucky Star hater. The previous sentence is for people who click the ""Not Helpful"" button just because they disagree with the review instead of how well constructed the review is; I do not wish to waste their precious time as inhumane and insensitive beings to destroy other people's lives as reviewers. Even if I do talk about the good aspects of the work that I enjoyed, I expect about 10 of 1,500 people to find this review helpful so Lucky Star fans, make me proud. To everyone else considering this show and reading reviews because of how well-constructed they are, I implore you to continue reading.  I am a big fan of slice-of-life shows. It is a genre that plays with the mundaneness of life and family; there is very little concrete story and shows tend to be driven either by comedy, moe, or relationship dynamics. Lucky Star is not a slice-of-life show, but a show that panders to otakus with a considerable amount of fanservice and random anime references that makes Family Guy cry in his bed and call for mommy. I do not wish to call such works terrible just because they do that; Pani Poni Dash does this as well and it's way funner to watch even if you don't get all the references because it feels like a sitcom. Lucky Star is not a sitcom.  The show itself is inconsistent. Episode 1 is infamous because it is plain boring. In the Studio Shaft anime, Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei, the characters criticized episode 1's coronet scene for just being plain boring. Episode 1 is almost unwatchable. It makes FLCL's quotable line, ""Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary."", feel so true with the anime medium. People who plan to watch this show should note the actual work only starts at about episode 2.  Other episodes involve the ""cute girls doing cute things"" mantra. I'm pretty cool with this -- as I said, I'm a big fan of slice-of-life works --; however, the main character cast is almost a letdown from the beginning.  Konata, played by Aya Hirano, references to Haruhi and other famous shows from the past. If you know Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star and Initial D, then you are in luck. Most people don't; however, this show can still be watched without knowing the references. It's just that you'll be missing 80% of the show's ""appeal"", unlike Pani Poni Dash's which only amounts about 40%.  Kagami is a tsundere who plays the straight man role. Tsukasa is moe and clumsy. Miyuki is moe and smart because she has glasses. If we judge them by character models, I think they're all pretty cute. As characters, they are terrible, bland, and boring. They don't offer a lot of interesting dynamics and they just feel flat as characters. Miyuki is one of the worst flat characters, changing very little throughout the show.  Other episodes fared better with the addition of supporting characters. I enjoyed the supporting characters more than the main cast. Konata's dad, Izumi, is a perverted man who enjoys taking pictures of little girls and often asks his daughter to find the flag to get into the h-scene in eroges. Anime Tenchou is one of the most memorable characters and his over-the-top antics leave something to desire in the show itself. Akira Kogami's and Minoru Shiraishi's dynamics are just fun to look at; I look forward to their Lucky Channel segment a lot.  There is an episode that I remember being actually good. It's about Konata's mother. To me, that's actually pretty good slice-of-life drama. Why the show doesn't follow this formula of success and go into moe pandering confuses me.  While I am negative about the characters, the modeling as I said are great. The puni plush style is gorgeous and the backgrounds, as expected from KyoAni, are beautiful and photorealistic. If I view this as an art piece, it might get a B+ from me.  The OP is one of those catchy atrocious tunes; the lyrics make little sense at all. Animation in the OP is pretty dynamic and wacky, unlike the show itself. I'm more of a ""meh"" when it comes to the OP.  To call the show polarizing is an understatement; it's either a show that you love or hate. I am clearly at the ""hate"" part, but I see some good aspects of the work. However, there are too many problems that causes me to dislike and hate the work. I admit that this work is influential, but for the wrong reasons. People should not just watch for the work's influence, but whether they enjoyed it or not. That's how you rate and review a work.";Not Recommended
3;Lucky☆Star;TsukineHime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TsukineHime;3;My review.. I'm not really trying to say you shouldnt watch this anime, some people like it, some people don't. But on my opinion i think this anime is as boring asd you can get. The sound is ok really cute and funny, that i can't complain, but the art.. some people say its cute and simple, i say its way too simple and not that cute to be honest, i've seen much cutter characters such as chibis and so. The storyline.. I really think thats the worst part in it, i firsts started seeing this anime because it was kinda cute, i was told that Konata was exactly like me, so i went to see it, very amusing at first, but as it goes on.. it turns to be a REAL drag.. Its basicly always the same, school, home, shoping, konata bein all about videogames, anime and manga, kagami arguing with konata, tsukasa stating the obvious with konata and miyuki being the smart girl there. Its basicly nothing new, always the same in each episode, and to be honest, the anim aint really that funny.. It rarely makes me laugh, and its not that i have no sense of humor or that i never did those experiences! I do have sence of humor and i had most of those experiences. But seriously i don't see whats funny about it, but that my opinion anyways, of course we all dont share the same opinion and i respect otherts opinions. But this is how i see things, and i reall. i dont think this anime is worth the ranking it has..  Even a friend of mine that loves cute animes and such, like Shugo chara and Suzumiya Haruhi, she started seeing lucky star and enjoyed it, but has she went on she just said: Man you were right.. ._. that anime is cute and all but its making me so bored, ill see it later when i have the guts ^^'  One more person saying the same as i.  I think the only good aspects about the anime are the sound and the characters, like you all say, gotta love Konata X)  Anyways this is just my opinion!

4;Lucky☆Star;dirtbag8;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dirtbag8;4;I gave this anime a 4/10 not because it was bad, but simply not my kind.  This anime was recommended by my fren, TBH when I told him I want to have a comedy series after failing to find one which suits me.   The first episode did'nt get my attention but I continued on as I see high ratings from site and also since it was recommended by fren.  I only start to enjoy a little more on episode 6 but it is only episode 6. Other episodes remains the same style. Frankly Im really bored throughout the series but pushed myself to end this just so I can give least bias review. My first review in MAL.  The opening of Lucky star was good but the closing was the worse kind I ever saw. The ending song featured only to listen the song the anime's girl characters were singing. This remains the same till epi 14. Now the director or producer appears to entertain for their crap ending song. It is still lame however.  There is no story and was light and simple (different topic on every epi). In addition, its very short as there is a narrator speaking session at about the 18th minute. This session is also quite boring.  If you are one of the people easily find humor in 'slice of life' comedy and can enjoy text/talk type anime. This is for you.  All in all, this is my honest opinion and review. I did not mean to anger anyone and I request respect for it.  Thx;Not Recommended
5;Lucky☆Star;flarfmuffin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/flarfmuffin;3;"When I used to hear about illiterate students graduating from school, I often wondered how that was possible. But after encountering some of Lucky Star's more pesky ultimata, I now realize that not only is it possible for people to graduate without having learned fundamental skills such as reading and writing, but that it's possible for these same people to believe that Lucky Star has the linguistic prowess to produce a masterwork of meritorious literature. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course of this letter but the conclusion's general outline is that when I first became aware of Lucky Star's covert invasion into our thought processes, all I could think was how Lucky Star does not merely pit race against race, religion against religion, and country against country. It does so consciously, deliberately, willfully, and methodically. There's only one proper consideration here: the harm that'll be caused if Lucky Star is allowed to develop a Pavlovian reflex in us, to make us afraid to deal stiffly with pathological anarchists who interfere with the most important principles of democracy. All else is abstract, simple-minded, intellectual hooey. You shouldn't let Lucky Star intimidate you. You shouldn't let it push you around. We're the ones who are right, not Lucky Star.  I plan to make plans and carry them out. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that I wonder if Lucky Star really believes the things it says. It knows they're not true, doesn't it? Whatever the answer, we must show Lucky Star that we are not powerless pedestrians on the asphalt of life. We must show it that we can urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that if its attendants get their way, society as we know it will cease to exist. Maybe then Lucky Star will realize that it takes things out of context, twists them around, and then neglects to provide decent referencing so the reader can check up on it. Lucky Star also ignores all of the evidence that doesn't support (or in many cases directly contradicts) its position.  Lucky Star wants me to stop trying to oppose evil wherever it rears its passive-aggressive, negligent head. Instead, it'd rather I suffer endless humiliation. Sorry, but I don't accept defeat that easily. If I am correctly informed, we will need to use diverse skills and tactics if we are to drag Lucky Star in front of a tribunal and try it for its crimes against humanity. In any case, it is not interested in what is true and what is false or in what is good and what is evil. In fact, those distinctions have no meaning to it whatsoever. The only thing that has any meaning to Lucky Star is defeatism. Why? In other words, what demons possessed Lucky Star to redefine unbridled self-indulgence as a virtue, as the ultimate test of personal freedom? Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to solve that mystery. Heck, you probably don't even need Scooby Doo. Neverthess, let me remind you that we must cross-examine Lucky Star's disorganized scribblings. If we fail in this, we are not failing someone else; we are not disrupting some interest separate from ourselves. Rather, it is we who suffer when we neglect to observe that I act based on what I think is right, not who I think is right. That's why I try always to make a cause célèbre out of exposing Lucky Star's schemes for what they really are. It's also why I say that its cause is not glorious. It is not wonderful. It is not good.  If Lucky Star's duplicitous campaigns became more widespread, it would spell the ruination of this country. Lucky Star plans to craft propaganda that justifies breaking down our communities. What can you do about that? Start by reading about how Lucky Star broadens its appeal by seeking influence and adherents in the colonialism movement. Become informed about the deceit, lies, and propaganda surrounding its promotion of sectarianism. Tell everyone you know that Lucky Star looks down upon the rest of us. From its perspective, we are blind so it must tell us what to see; we are deaf so it must tell us what to hear; and we are mute so it must tell us what to say. Such views may fool devious junkies, but I profess that if Lucky Star's attempts to capitalize on our needs and vulnerabilities have spurred us to embark on a new path towards change, then Lucky Star may have accomplished a useful thing.  I don't know if Lucky Star is consciously and purposely evil or merely pharisaical. I do know, however, that it's easy for armchair philosophers to theorize about it and about hypothetical solutions to our Lucky Star problem. It's an entirely more difficult matter, however, when one considers that it says that those of us who oppose it would rather run than fight. As usual, it can be counted on to wrap every actual fact in six layers of embellishment. The truth is that what really sticks in my craw is seeing Lucky Star seek vengeance on those unrepentant souls who persist in challenging its maneuvers. (Note the heroic restraint stopping me from saying that as commonly encountered, feebleminded, shameless fiends lack any of the qualities that mark the civilized person, like courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, and confidence.) Lucky Star insists that it is better that a hundred thousand people should perish than that it should be even slightly inconvenienced. That lie is a transparent and strained effort to keep us from noticing that my position is that violence, mayhem, and insanity are the inevitable consequences of its ideals. Lucky Star, in contrast, argues that ebola, AIDS, mad-cow disease, and the hantavirus were intentionally bioengineered by obtuse Philistines for the purpose of population reduction. This disagreement merely scratches the surface of the ideological chasm festering between me and Lucky Star. The only rational way to bridge this chasm is for it to admit that it is always trying to change the way we work. This annoys me because Lucky Star's previous changes have always been for the worse. I'm positive that its new changes will be even more naive because Lucky Star wants to make incorrect leaps of logic. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis. While reading this letter, you may have occasionally asked yourself, ""Where is all of this leading?"" and, ""What is the point exactly?"" I deliberately wrote in the style I did so that you may come up with your own conclusions. Therefore, I leave you with only the following: Lucky Star loves Trotskyism more than life itself.";Not Recommended
6;Lucky☆Star;LeCrowe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LeCrowe;1;The Plot- What plot? This series is a slice of life moe blob where the four main characters just talk about normal everyday stuff (For example: How to eat a chocolate cornett.) I wish there was a 0 rating for story, but I'll give it a three, only because of the many references.  The Art- The art is colorful. That's it. 7/10  The Sound- The background music is just that, background music. The op drove me insane with it's all over the place, over complicated, and colorful themes like I'm watching an american kids show. 4/10  Enjoyment- The main show didn't entertain me at all. I would put a 1/10 if it wasn't for LUCKY CHANNEL which was the whole highlight and the funniest part of the show. The female character in Lucky Channel turns from another moe blob into one of the most hilarious personalities in the show, turning into a know it all with 99 problems and her acting ain't one. 8/10  Overall- Lucky Channel:9/10 Lucky Star:1/10 They should make Lucky Channel its own anime. As for Lucky star, I wish it gets buried into the endless grave of terrible anime along with School Days, Boku no Pico, and MM!  Oh, wait. Did I skip characters? Aw, too bad. :);Not Recommended

10;Lucky☆Star;Marifrit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marifrit;3;"Lucky Star is a very popular anime. Its one of the shows that almost everyone who watches a good amount of anime has probably at least heard of the show. Whenever i saw people talking about the show on the internet they talked about how cute all the characters and how they could relate themselves to Konata the main character. But the number one thing I heard was how the show apparently was about ""nothing."" A show about nothing is quite a weird thing to say. Normally the most important thing about any piece of entertainment that is not music is the plot. So after hearing this much I decided to watch the first episode of ""Lucky Star.""  So of course the first thing i saw was the shows opening theme. Full of choreographed dancing done by girls that looked like they were in middle school and full of energy it was quite a sight to behold. But then came the actual show. The first 10 minutes of the show was spent by a couple of girls talking about how to eat food. It was extraordinarily boring. Thats when i realized this show was actually about nothing very literally. So i finished the episode and began to forget about the show.  One day i start talking to my friend about anime and i bring up ""Lucky Star."" He then says how much he liked the show and how i should give it another chance . So I did and I watched all 24 episodes.  The main character is Konata. She is your classic modern tomboy type character. She was an obsession with manga , video games , and anime. She considers her self an otaku. She dislikes things like school work and normal books. She at first was somewhat interesting but she became repetitive and annoying. She like all the characters of this anime did not change at all throughout the entire show. Her sole purpose was to be relatable to all the male watchers and reference anime frequently.  Next we have the purple haired twins Kagami and Tsukasa. Tsukasa is an airhead and overall boring character. And Kagami is smart and reliable for example Konata and Tsukasa constantly copy homework from her.  The main problem with the characters are how static they are. They are always very predictable. Sometimes they were able to create good humor but often anything funny was repeated constantly till it became annoying.  The art style was not my taste at all. It was very colorful but it often lacked detail. This especially could be seen by the background characters who were often just black silhouettes.   One of the best things about this show was the quality of the English dub. All of the voices for the main characters sounded very fitting for each character. But most of the music was bland and forgettable. Some of the ending themes had songs from other anime which was alright.  One of the biggest problems was the shows attempt at comedy. I have seen a good amount of anime and played lots of video games so i get most of the references. But these little references did not add much comedy. The show just failed to make me laugh. I think I laughed about 5 times throughout the whole 24 episodes. For a comedy without a plot this is a huge problem since im not laughing nor enjoying a good story the show seemed very pointless.  The only people i can recommend this show to are the people who are addicted to shows full of moe and just want to watch a group of girls acting like girls.";Not Recommended
11;Lucky☆Star;JizzAllOverMe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JizzAllOverMe;1;"In the year 2007 A.D., a fire was fermenting in the Kyoto Animation studio. Crisp off the accomplishment of Haruhi Suzumiya and possessing a scent like farts and ramen-scented personal stench, the staff of KyoAni built up a sharp intend to additionally drain endless wads of cashmoney from disgraceful washouts and pedophiles on the two sides of the pacific: take a prevalent 4 board comic arrangement ready with the components that made Suzumiya a monetary achievement (pandering to close in weeaboos with lolicon activity figure accumulations and terabytes of hentai) and transform it into a similarly shocking anime arrangement. Subsequent to spending indefatigable hours handcrafting just the stalest jokes, the blandest craftsmanship, and the most mindnumbingly exhausting contents in Japanese TV history, Yushiro Takemoto opened his rear-end and took a gigantic poo onto a close-by Tokyo walkway. Millions ogled at the greatness of his defecation: extents this extraordinary hadn't been seen since U2 discharged the waterboarding-like torturefest that was ""The means by which to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb"" in 2004. When Norwegian researchers had been given appropriate time to mass, perform tests on, and take pictures with said crap, Takemoto was advised he expected to give it a name. He picked Lucky Star.  Much like those muffle electric stun pens you offered out to your companions as a trick in the fourth grade, Lucky Star deceives you into watching it under the appearance that it's a ""satire"", however in actuality it's to a lesser extent a chuckle fest and a greater amount of an activity in sadomasochism. Part of the way through the main scene I was persuaded that watching this must be the rage of a vindictive God, purpose on rebuffing me for my past slips and disappointments. By scene 2 I had been diminished to a vegetable, as the show had actually sucked all the vitality from me. By scene 9 this condition ended up perpetual, as I had transformed my once-stunning lounge into a no man's land and my once perfect clothing into a net for getting the looseness of the bowels that leaked from my petrified butt nugget. By scene 16 I had sufficiently accumulated vitality to endeavor suicide. After a short recuperation spell in the doctor's facility, I was put on antidepressants and bear sedatives, and sometime I advised my advisor that I expected to overcome my evil presences unequivocally and complete this arrangement. He endorsed, however just on one condition: that I watch it with him present in the room. I endeavored to talk sense into him, yet he demanded that ""he's seen a great deal of things in his time, alot of them a considerable measure more regrettable than anything a Japanese animation could toss at him.""  He later shot himself in a Staples parking area.  To say it evidently, Lucky Star is the direct opposite of diversion. There is not all that much, shrewd, clever, or remotely intriguing about the show. Weeaboo faggots will frantically attempt to persuade you that this arrangement is a comedic perfect work of art and a zenith of aesthetic accomplishment, however as the initial five minutes plainly build up, this couldn't possibly be more off-base. Fortunate Star is just progressive in how much it's ready to exhaust anybody that isn't a slobbering fuckstick with social uneasiness issue - you will really feel that this anime rose above existence to convey you a universe-breaking kick in the nuts, except if you discover Meet The Spartans type reference jokes amusing and clearly pre-pubescent anime young ladies hot, in which case you will love this show like the screwing failure you are. Many have contrasted this show with Seinfeld in light of the fact that the two offer an ""appear about-nothing"" way to deal with account narrating, however this is the place every single intelligent examination end. Seinfeld is a momentous TV arrangement about the funny adventures of a gathering of huge butt faces in New York. Fortunate Star is a show about the different non-episodes in the lives of a bundle of ""this-is-the thing that weeaboos-wish-young ladies were-like"" high schoolers that have dull-as-screw discussions, fit flawlessly inside buzzword prime examples while never advancing, and make a considerable measure of recoil commendable popular culture references.  In any case, unadulterated crappiness alone isn't sufficient to impel this anime to the absolute lowest grade status it's as of now at. What truly gets me about Lucky Star is exactly how much the ""FEED ME MORE MONEY"" state of mind of Kyoto Animation spills into the real creation. Each time I persevere through an agonizingly exhausting talk about some consistently life theme, another unfunny Lucky Channel drama, the clarification and, thus, ruination of what generally would've been an acceptable joke, or some reference to Haruhi/[insert computer game or potentially anime here] it takes me back to the real expected motivation behind this arrangement. The characters, circumstances, and jokes are altogether deliberately written to connect with close in goof balls who burn through the greater part of their lives watching anime, playing computer games, and posting on web message sheets. It's the hollowest anime I've ever watched; it callously and noxiously claims to individuals who are excessively regrettable, making it impossible to understand that they're being pandered to for money - in the event that you paid cash to perceive any piece of this show and AREN'T one of these individuals, you will leave the experience feeling like somebody shot you in the knees and continued to take your home, vehicle, personality, and spouse. It's an anime intended to be viewed among anime club gatherings rounded with individuals who compel out dry hurls of giggling so they can feel like they fit in with everybody around them, and on projector screens at anime traditions topped with oddities dressed off as creatures and Sailor Moon characters. This show was not made out of enthusiasm, or a general love for the medium, or a real conviction that the show would be clever, it was made to misuse the most minimized shared variable of anime fans for a fast buck. It's taking cash from individuals who don't have a clue about any better, it leaves a terrible preference for your mouth and removes any regard you might've had for anybody associated with making the arrangement.  Fortunate Star's specialty is sickeningly sweet moe-waste. For a studio that is unmistakably centered more around activity than story, the dimension of unremarkableness appeared here is unsuitable. At any rate when I watched that shitheap Haruhi Suzumiya I could compliment angles where unmistakably an exertion was made to create a quality item - here, we have a prime case of the new-age, gathering style craftsmanship that is tormenting current anime. With our tremendous favorable circumstances in innovation, one would believe that the apparently boundless conceivable outcomes would start amazing outcomes, and keeping in mind that we have seen looks of that (i.e. 2009's Summer Wars), the vast majority of what has won in the business has been streamlined, cleaned, and callous.  I do need to give the anime props in the sound division, in any case. The OP is presumably the most captivating piece of the whole show, as each time you hear it you will be siphoned for what must be where the arrangement begins to get. Despite the fact that it never does, I can't blame the OP for giving us trust. The different EDs run the gauntlet as far as quality, yet by and large they're a decent split far from the mouth breathing elements that are the genuine show. Concerning the voice on-screen characters, they all came and turned out good exhibitions, giving the show somewhere around one endurable quality in the middle of credits. This is one of only a handful couple of anime that I viewed subbed in any case, so I have no clue if the American VAs are any great.  The way that individuals say they can identify with characters on this show is alarming. They truly sum to little moeballs loaded down with each conceivable secondary school young lady antique the scholars could uncover, and never create past that point. Konata, in any case, isn't just that, yet something a whole lot more terrible. While whatever remains of the characters try to engage the area of the anime advertise that grovels over clear charm, Konata is an intriguing take a gander at how far a movement studio will go to press cash out of otaku fucks. She was made exclusively so weeaboos would have somebody on the cast they could relate to, and keeping tuned in to Kyoto Animation's feeling of their watchers, she's agonizingly one-dimensional. Her pastimes incorporate computer games, anime, and being a bitch. That is it. Lamentably, very little else can be said in regards to whatever is left of their characters either. Miyuki is the acumen of the gathering, but at the same time she's moe. Tsukasa is the timid one, but on the other hand she's moe. Kagami is the searing tsundere, but on the other hand she's moe. In any event, when you give a one line portrayal of Seinfeld's characters, you're forgetting a considerable measure of character data. They may not so much change as time advances, yet you unquestionably take in significantly more about them. In Lucky Star, one line portrayals characterize our characters for the whole show. There's more character improvement on a scene of Cops than there is here.  As I achieved the finish of the last scene, I swung to my specialist who was, at that present minute, wailing into my shoulder because of sheer, free weariness. His red eyes gazed toward me and as I looked down at him with a blend of pity and regret, I could see his lips faintly murmur out ""spare me"". As the young ladies equipped their cheerleading execution of the opening melody, I could see his last hint of something to look forward to, of confidence in humankind, disappear from him and buoy towards the pit.  He figured he could spare me.  I decline to trust that Kyoto Animation could, as they viewed over the arrangement for the last time before authoritatively discharging it, say with finish genuineness that this arrangement was worthy for open utilization as well as authentically pleasant. It's conceivable to savor a show's disagreeableness in case you're ready to regard the truthfulness of the general population that made it. It's the reason I adore motion pictures like The Room and Batman and Robin, and it's the reason I consider Mars Destruction has the right to be indicated daily on HBO. Notwithstanding, when something this terrible is in reality only a merciless joke to the detriment of a cluster of weeaboo faggots, the untruthfulness, all things considered, pollutes what could've quite recently been a regular awful show and transforms it into something dastardly and unlikeable. I don't think otaku understand that this show isn't really commending the things they neede";Not Recommended

Well here we go... Story:1- Well to be quite honest, there is no actual story. From what I could gather, girls who look like they are 7(who are actually 18) talk in ear piercing voices about things that are insignificant. That's it. Art:7- I'll admit lucky star has a unique art style which actually looks good. It's unique and colourful as all hell. Sound:5- the theme is annoyingly catchy and some of the background music is good. But the voice actors were probably some of the worst I've ever seen.(I watched the dub...I regret that) Characters:2- the characters in lucky star were not good in the slightest. All of them just a big collection of stereotypes in a school. Whilst all sounding like there in their 50s... Enjoyment:3- I felt myself being bored by the awful voices talking about food......FOR 24 FU**ING MINUTES!!! Next episode, girl likes games. Oh boy what hilarity is gonna ensue here? Nothing happens.

It has some really funny or relatable parts and some rather on-point social commentary, but it's extremely bloated with pop culture references, lots of Haruhi promos, and a somewhat uncomfortable amount of jokes about the girls'... let's say, physical maturity. I did generally enjoy the characters, though that's probably partly because they're very reminiscent of the main four in K-ON!, which is an anime I absolutely adore everything about.  The show didn't do a very good job getting me invested in the characters, perhaps because of its lack of overarching plot. You might enjoy this show if you like simple humor and satirical jokes about other media, which I have a feeling is why it's so popular among Western audiences.

There's 2 jokes in Lucky star, saying something ""relatable"" and making a reference to something better, like Haruhi Suzumiya. The first kind of """"joke"""" is just a character saying ""hey, doesn't it bother you that X thing is a certain way"" and another one saying ""oh yeah, that happens"" or some shit like that. The others is just making a reference to something better and expecting you to go ""haha so funny, i recognize that"" like a fucking idiot.

Lucky Star essentially is just a show about a group of high school friends that make fun of anime tropes, high school and really specific Japanese foods, and Japanese things in a snarky way. Some of the jokes land and are pretty funny. Most of them don't and it makes the show seem more like a commentary about the anime industry as a whole as opposed to a show worth watching on its own without watching other anime. Also, if you need to have watched other shows to understand a bunch of the jokes, unless you do something like Clerks did when they made reference to Star Wars with the Death Star,, give a quick explanation for people who might not have seen it and then proceed to make a really solid point about government contractors and relate it to real-life, just attempting to parody it, and then making reference to what you are parodying reminds me of those terrible comedy movies like Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and Vampires Suck.

0;Luck & Logic;StevyleSteve;https://myanimelist.net/profile/StevyleSteve;7;"Luck and logic to me, is one of those series that knows what it wants to be, in that it is not supposed to be all that groundbreaking in any sense. Its a nice small show that is heavily cliched, with entertaining action and extremely easy to follow plot/story... SPEAKING OF...!  Story (7) There's not much to go on about here. Good guys defend the city from bad guys that come through these gates from hell or something like that, sprinkle all of this with personal dramatic character plots (each character gets an episode) and top it off with the biggest bad they have to fight at the end. Like i said, easy to grasp.  Art(6) The art in general is standard fair, though there is quite a heavy use of 3D for the action scenes of which some might find jarring, it is kind of strange seeing the characters so still in 2D and then very kind rubbery ragdoll movement with 3D. There are some 2D scenes where you can see that the animators screwed up, like one scene at the end of episode 3 i think, it looked like the game was having server issues, but then i realized that this wasn't a game, it was an anime. The character designs were nice, all of the transformations were pretty neat which nicely fitted each of there personalities. Some of the action scenes can seem rather lazy though, with the typical ""character performs attack shot"" and then switches to ""character getting hit shot"".  Sound(8) Personally, I quite like the BGM, I might even hunt it down somewhere soon. Its mostly the action scene BGM I like with its sci-fi orchestralish sound. I really like the OP too, it kept me from skipping it every episode, The ED however is not to my taste.  Character(6) The characters are not very interesting, they are very cliched and i will list the main team of them here. Yoshichika tsurugi - The main character of the series and... well... thats it... he IS a main character. uses a shield as his weapon (tank). Tamaki Yurine - The intelligent leader type girl, uses a controlled ribbon thing and a wand as a weapon and also heals (healer) Chloe Maxwell - The energetic arrogant girl, uses a flaming broadsword and often charges into battle without second thought (DPS) Mana Asuha - The quiet mysterious girl with a troubled past, uses guns, mainly a sniper, and also sneaks around by turning invisible n stealthy n stuff. (support/ranger) The characters are all teamed up with goddesses that combine with them to transform, but these goddesses are the most disappointing characters in this series since there nearly completely shoved aside and we learn next to nothing about them. I'd say i wouldn't even notice if they were removed from the series altogether.  Enjoyment(8) For what it is, I really enjoyed this series, it was something i could sit down and watch without getting so invested that it would consume my life. Its a cliched ""save the world show"" and it knows well. As a finished series, i would recommend this to anyone who's got nothing else to do and just wants a quick anime fix rather than re-watching a presumably better series.";Recommended
1;Luck & Logic;KiramekiSparkle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KiramekiSparkle;7;"This is an anime used to advertise a card game, or so I hear. As an ad for a card game, I feel like this anime falls flat. As a piece of entertainment, I say it was good. Yes, there were some parts where I was tempted to drop the anime, but Luck & Logic is not as bad as people like to say it is. It's still sub-par, but its not that below the average.  It was hard for me to get interested in the story. It essentially uses the ""retired badass comes out of retirement"" plot. It appears our protagonist mentally crippled himself in a past exploit that we will never hear about ever again. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for this retired badass story. It just feels like a let down. Potential gone.  Story: 4/10  Art wise, I'm no experienced critic in this aspect, so as long as it doesn't look like what OreTwi's TV animation looked like, then I'm generally lenient (don't get me wrong OreTwi is great in my opinion, but the animation was bad before they corrected it).  Holographic bits an pieces looked cool, but some fight sequences looked a bit different from the normal animation. This threw me off a few times, especially in the later half of the anime.  Art: 6/10  Sound. No expert on this either, but I thought it was great. The soundtrack is composed by Tatsuya Kato (I believe he did Shokugeki no Souma too). From experience, his work is usually something worth listening to. I liked it.  Sound: 8/10  For the characters, Yoshichika (MC), I feel is an exaggeration of the ""cookie cutter"" main character. Retired badass, check. Mysterious girl shows up offering a contract, check. Goes into first battle and begins to take command, check. Quick to jump to conclusions, check. I love his hair though.  Olga is another character I find memorable enough to mention. He starts off looking like this sinister anti-villain/villain type character that everyone avoids mentioning. MC decides to pry then it is revealed that Olga just has a severe case of chuunibyou. The only thing he seems to be good for is his predictions, which are nearly always accurate. What I like him for is that he gets serves as the straight man to our crazy cast at times. Also, he gets massive development during the last arc. Good character in an average anime.  Other characters are, like the MC, very ""cookie cutter"" style. Mysterious veteran squad leader. Formal, power by merit girl who gets shown up by MC in second episode. The ""Don't worry, Bros I got this"" character. Silent sniper. Immortal immaturity. The cute and cuddly girl. Other than MC and Olga, the characters seem to be very common fare, aside from the MC's family(fairly minor characters generally used for comedy).  Characters: 6/10 (because Olga carried this category)  Overall, this anime is a fairly good. Your millage may vary though, due to the abusurd amount of stock/static characters, and fluctuation of plot. There is a harem anime joke in the middle of the anime that really caught my attention though. I like those types of jokes quite a bit, sadly that's the most memorable part of the third quarter of Luck & Logic.  Enjoyment: 6/10  My thoughts. Again. It's not as bad as an anime could be. Scarred Rider Zechs was worse (Just the name of a random anime I dropped). Luck & Logic isn't unwatchable, per se.

While the story, or I should say the concept, isn't that bad. It's more about how it's presented. We're told about the relationships between humans and gods, but we get nothing out of that aside from what we see with our characters. I would've liked to see more of it, but that never happened. Also, for a series that's supposed to be about fighting monsters, a good portion of the series doesn't have it, and instead show our characters doing clichéd things we'd see in a slice-of-life story.  Characters are about as bland as they can get. They have their one characteristic and stick with that until the very end. Our main protagonist doesn't really feel like one. He apparently has some past, which was only ever brought up in the first episode. It could've been nice to maybe see what that was like. Although our characters are with each other all the time, there's honestly no chemistry with any.  There isn't much to say about the animation besides it's average. Action sequences use CG models for the characters, which didn't stand out and blended with everything else. The only thing I sort of liked was the characters' ""battle outfits"".  I would not recommend this series to anyone. This is one of those shows that did nothing for me, and got nothing out of it. Characters are bland and unforgettable, and the universe isn't fleshed out enough for me to care about the laws of it. I could end with another pun, but I;m having a ""card"" time doing so (because there's a card game based on this, you see).";Mixed Feelings
1;Luck & Logic;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;6;"LA doesn't even know if this show follows it's own logic!.  The anime follows a routine ""monster or Foreigner of the Week"" as Yoshichika warms up to the group of Girls and Goddess helping them although you can also say that Yoshichika pretty much solves the other cast members backstory or problems and he does for the most part, it's actually more of a Saturday Morning cartoon on how they deal with all this, talking about friendship to not outright killing the Foreigners instead taking them into captivity once the their episode is done and over with.  With this ""logic"", you can tell LA's favorite character isn't Yoshichika...he's kinda the ""omnipotent fixerupper"" and that kinda gets annoying at times, no LA's favourite character would have to have been the pair Tamaki Yurine voiced by ''Risa Taneda'' and Venus voiced by ''Nao Touyama'' as the anime developed her accidentally more than Yoshichika.  The anime really doesn't change it's format of ""Foreigner of the Week"" until episode 8 where the ""Big Bad"" appears and he outs to be a sympathetic villain in which LA actually agrees with to a certain point.  The plot twists are kinda predictable concerning what we're dealing with here but still the plot twists actually make this series better by the long run (as in by Episode 8).  In terms of animation by Doga Kobo, the character designs are decent enough and although there are 3D CGI when battle scenes occurs, it's consistent unlike another anime video game adaptation this season like ''Divine Gate''.  Luck & Logic does bring up some plot holes to some of the plotlines at times concerning the characters and their motivations at times like with Yoshichika and Tamaki's argument as why would ALCA demote Tamaki who was team leader to put a newbie like Yoshichika as leader other than trying to bring up Tamaki's backstory?...like that doesn't make any sense.  Once episode 8 occurs, the subtle hints at the Big Bad comes and actually brings us an actual threat to care about the Big Bad's plan at hand and becomes rather more intriguing to watch. You just first need to slog through the ""Foreigner of the Week"" episodes just to get to it.  The ending did wrap everything from this season and although it was a bit of anti-climax, but nonetheless it was ok, but not ""great"", it was actually more cliched on it's execution.  Luck & Logic has some logical errors concerning the plot and characters at times, however it's not outright horrible, LA sees it as charming how they are at least concerning the characters to a degree and what the main cast Logicalists are actually doing is influencing the plot and what with a sympathetic villain makes this anime adaptation of a trading card game actually competent even if it has the generic ""main protagonist fixes everything"".  Luck & Logic...you got a few screws loose, but thankfully you get those screws back by the end of and not completely succumbed to the video game adaptation curse.";Mixed Feelings
2;Luck & Logic;EvanLoh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EvanLoh;5;(Spoiler-free) (Shorter ver. far down below) This anime is boring. It's average. It's an anime that could be easily forgotten. It's cliched. It's nothing original. Watch this if you want to watch an anime while thinking of what anime to watch for the next few weeks. Even for me who doesn't mind cliche anime I still find it pretty boring.  The story is boring. I don't even think that this even have a story. Compared to HinaLogi, which is technically a sequel/alternate universe of this anime, it did a better job at SoL than this show here. Most importantly, the last arc is boring. It's what you can see from a lot of action/harem/shounen anime. Nothing is changed and nothing is added. So if you are thinking that this anime might be a character-driven show with interesting characters, read my next point.  The characters in this show is generic and bland. Although their backstories were told to us, but that still didn't change the fact that this is a carbon copy of the characters in other anime similar to this. Most importantly, the main character is boring as hell. His backstory is nothing original. Plus his screentime is so few compared to other female characters.  The BGM is non-existant. It doesn't stand out even in action scenes. The OP theme and sequence is pretty well done and I will give props to it. The ED theme is meh. The voice acting is sub-par.  Art and animation is the only thing I can praise this anime for. It's beautiful, colorful and eye-catching. The character designs, although nothing original, are still pretty well drawn. However, the CG animation during battle scenes is only decently done. The action sequence is still pretty boring.  My enjoyment = 5. I watched this because I need to think of some anime to watch while watching an anime. So I picked this one to watch because of the art and animation and also the OP sequence.  Overall, not recommended.  Pros: 1. Beautiful art 2. Good animation 3. OP sequence and theme suit the series well  Cons: 1. Boring 2. Too Cliche 3. Too serious;Mixed Feelings
3;Luck & Logic;maispower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/maispower;5;this anime is the definition of average. And honestly the only reason I was interested in the first place was because of the dub va for the protagonist.  The plot was nice at first, but I feel like they could have done a lot more with it. Most characters are just bland and not memorable. And the epilogue was... Something. A lot of decisions were made for the story and I didn't like most of them. But I did like the animation itself, it was pretty nice.  In the end it wasn't anything special or so, but definitely not the worst I've seen. If you have literally nothing else to watch, I'd say go for it. But know there are a lot more anime out there that are more worth your time.

4;Luck & Logic;lamaraptor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lamaraptor;6;This show literally opens with a scene of all the characters in a classroom explaining to the audience how the magic system works. The whole thing has a very tell don't show approach to exposition so if you missed something you're probably going to end up lost or having to go back and rewatch the part where they explained what the heck is going on. I honestly was so tuned out from the nonsensical story that this was one of those shows where I just wanted to get through to the end of it as quickly as possible to check it off my list and never have to think about it again. It has a slew of characters you'll never be able to tell apart or remember a single thing about because of how unremarkable they each are, a standard self-insert protagonist with no personality, and plot as meandering and pointless as you could expect from a show designed to sell a card game.  At no point during my watch through did I feel like I was having fun, with the one minor exception being that scene where the girl struggles to eat a piece of chicken for like 10 seconds. It was so bizarre and mesmerizing to watch that after seeing a clip of that in isolation on youtube it made me want to watch this entire show. It was a mistake, please don't do what I did. Save yourself the pain of watching this.  6/10;Mixed Feelings
0;Luck & Logic;shadowmellow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shadowmellow;4;"Okay, I don't usually write reviews but this show has personally offended me in a way so I'll just give it a shot.  Luck & Logic is an anime produced to promote a card game made by Bushiroad. Not that you would know that since this anime is not the way to promote anything because it's not interesting in the least.  Story: The basic story is very simple in itself. New Foreigner appears, team shows up and beats them up. Rinse and repeat. The first few episode also sprinkle some character focused episodes for our main girls (the Logicalists not the Goddesses but I get to that later) and in the end there is a big bad Foreigner they have to fight but that's it. Once you get what the hell they're saying then it's really easy to follow and the setting itself is pretty interesting. It's how it's presented where the problem lies.  Starting with the fact that the show doesn't explain a damn thing. Having a first episode not explaining every detail is fine, it's to build suspense and make the viewer want to find out more about the show and characters. But throwing around words like Foreigners and Logic Cards around with literally no explanation doesn't create suspense, it just confuses people. Then you get an exposition dump in the second episode after which you are bound to forget some things unless you binge watch the entire show. And the pacing and structure only go downhill from there.  So to sum up, simple plot, interesting setting that's not set up well and pacing problems. All in all it's not horrible but it's definitely not good. 5 out of 10.  Art: Surprisingly enough it's not bad. The animation is nothing outstanding, no scenes that will blow you out of the water, but it's decent and nothing to sneeze at. The character designs are nice and pretty for the most part and I particularly like the use of 3D animation.  I know a lot of people get upset when they use 3D models in anime but I personally didn't have anything against it, especially when it's for dancing or fighting sequences. The models are nicely made, fit well into the style of the show and the animation itself has enough energy to work well. Say what you will about 3D animation but animating a model to move in a way that feels like there's some real tension and energy in it is hard and I applaud the team for pulling it off so well.  Sure, the fights themselves are not exciting in any way but hey, good animation is good animation and I take what I get. 8 out of 10.  Sound: Again, surprisingly good. The soundtrack fits the story, for whatever it's worth, well and is good enough to stand on it's own. It's a mix of ochestral and electronic tracks that give the show an epic and futuristic flair even if the show itself is not. I even found myself listening to the ending and opening a lot to get myself pumped up and motivated for tasks. 8 out of 10.  Characters: Oh, the characters. So much potential which was wasted.  I personally really like the cast. You got Yukine the hardworking leader, Chloe the hotheaded fighter, Mana the quiet mysterious one, Yukari the clumsy newbie, Veronica the strict commander and Olga who is... well, you will find out eventually. They all sound like cookie cutter anime stereotypes and to be fair, they kind of are, but each of them get decent enough development in their own character focused episode that I forgive them for that. They each get their motivations and back story explained and while there isn't really any character development going on it works well enough for a short series that I allow it.  It all starts to fall apart with our main protagonist Yoshi and how all the other characters relate to him. Or more like revolve around him because that's really all that's happening. Without taking too much away, almost every character focused episode ends with Yoshi swooping in and solving all their problems by doing or saying something inspirational. Which in itself is bad enough but then there's the fact that Yoshi is so boringly bland.  His motivations don't go beyond ""save everyone"", his personality is written inconsistent and he doesn't really do much besides react to situations the way it requires him to. Take any male protagonist from any slice of life or harem show and you would have yourself a more interesting main character than Yoshi. The first episode sets him up okay as a worrywart who wants nothing more than to protect the people around him even at the cost of his own life but by the next episode he is suddenly acting cold and hostile? Maybe it's change of circumstances but he keeps switching between different personality traits so fast I doubt he was written with a clear character in mind.  And the Godesses I said I would get into? God, what's there to get into when they are side lined so hard you wonder if they are even still on the team. Valkyrie probably gets the worst of it, being introduced as Chloe's calm and rational partner to balance out her spunky recklessness and never being allowed to develop beyond that. Venus and Artemis are not much better, one acting as a supporting friend and the other as a mother figure to their partners Yukine and Mana but never allowed to have their own arcs or feelings explored.  The only one who gets to develop at all is Athena and even she gets the short end of the stick. She gets a decent amount of screen time and actually gets to interact with others without her partner but she is still only defined by her kind heart and love for Yoshi. Which is not bad if Yoshi was a good character and their relationship was actually explored but as you can guess it's not.  The high point of the characters is really Olga Breakchild who is by far my favorite character. Without spoiling, he's the only one who doesn't seem to worship the floor Yoshi walks on and actually stands up to him from time to time and it's wonderful. His arc, in contrast to the others, actually gets a set up and decent pay off which doesn't save the show in the character department but at least helps it a bit.  Side characters are given one note personality traits but I found them alright, especially Yoshi's family which were entertaining enough in their own right to actually make me interested in them.  All in all, nice supporting cast, sidelining of supposed main characters, Olga Breakchild and an incredibly bland main protagonist. 4 out of 10.  Enjoyment: Seeing as I had harped on forever about how I dislike the story and the characters, I think it comes to little surprise that I didn't particularly enjoy this anime. And it wasn't for the sake of not trying either, I came into this show not expecting anything amazing but at least something that I could watch in a season where not much interested me but I didn't even get that.  The setting was interesting enough but the way it was written and presented just made it feel dragged out and sluggish. Hell, even the action felt uneccessarily strechted out to the point where it felt boring. How the hell do you make action boring? Luck & Logic managed it somehow and made every episode feel longer than it actually was. Really makes you wonder how a show can be so boring it seems to warp space-time itself.  Besides Olga and some interesting character interactions I really didn't get much enjoyment out of this. And my burning hatred of Yoshi but that's just me. 3 out of 10.  Overall: If you actually managed to read everything to this point I congratulate you. I know I get get pretty long winded about stuff like this and anyone who manages to read through anything I write is a hero in my eyes.  Now, after 15+ paragraphs of me talking about this show, what do I think about it overall? Surprisingly enough, I don't find it horrible? Like, yeah, the story is weak and the characters, mainly Yoshi, are even weaker but overall it's pretty harmless. The music and art are nice and even if the episodes make you feel like your brain's leaking out it's not bad to just sit back and shut off your thoughts for a while and just let a show wash over you.  The main reason why I was so personally offended by the show was probably because I'm a huge fan of Bushiroad, especially their card games. And I know they can make good card game animes! Okay, as far as I can see, they have one good card game anime but that one is pretty darn good. And seeing them make such a bland show just kind of hurts my heart. I don't know how much say they have on the writing and characters but I like to believe they could have done better.  That's not to say that it's a good show. It's still boring and superficial at best. Even considering that this was just made to promote the card game it leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't even explain the card game aspect of it. At best it's a standard show with an interesting setting at worst it's a boring show that doesn't try to step out of it's bounds. 4 out of 10.";Not Recommended

2;Luck & Logic;GimmeDatDonut;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GimmeDatDonut;4;"*This contains a small spoiler, but that has been marked clearly*  Internal logic and believable characters are two of the most important factors for me in any show. It doesn't matter how outlandish or surreal the setting and events might be, as long as the show attempts to provide some reason for these actions, I stay happy. This show attempts nothing of the kind. While some of these gaffes are understandable considering that they are limitations of the show being based on a TCG (trading card game), the vast majority are intolerable. I'll list my personal opinions of the show in order of what I liked most:  Sound: 8/10 The sound quality of this anime is actually quite good. The opening and ending sequences have great tracks that mesh fairly well with the story. I have no complaints about the OST either.  Art: 7/10 The animation is of decent quality, uses a bright palette, and has a moderate use of CG. There's nothing amazing or new about the art, but then again, there was never really a moment when I could complain.  Story: 3/10 This is definitely not an anime you want to watch for the plot. It's mostly structured like a harem anime, with an overperforming male MC surrounded by pretty little things that lather him with attention. There is no overall plot for the story; each episode is based around backstories and character development. While this could have been an interesting approach, it fails because of the horrible quality of said character development.  There are also several elements in the story that make no sense or are never explained properly. For example, they often mention that the bond made during a covenant is permanent, and yet they show us that both Chloe and Tamaki were bonded to different covenanters in the past. What happened to them? Also, even though the ALCA organisation has been fighting invasions for a long time before Yoshi joined this branch, why is there only one Foreigner (Enlil) in the vault from before Yoshi entered the story? In addition, what is the difference between killing and capturing the foreigners? Both actions seem to involve dealing heavy amounts of damage to them. For some reason, slicing them in half using a giant fire sword or blasting holes in them with a magical shotgun separates them from their trancejacked host, but attacking them with a whip kills the foreigner.  <minor spoilers> In the Veronica episode, the Ice Belva that they're fighting against never trancejacked anyone, so how is it able to manifest its powers? Every time a foreigner trancejacks a human, they are suddenly visible on the radar for ALCA to see. So why does Lucifer remian invisible even though he keeps trancejacking humans left, right and center? </minor spoilers>  Characters: 2/10 When you have an anime that is so focused on the character development, you are really hit hard when you realize the complete lack of attention placed on their personalities. To show my point, I'll need to go a little into depth for each character while avoiding spoilers:  1. Yoshichika: The main character, he is another mostly faceless MC that's meant for the audience to relate to. However, his personality is clearly undefined. At times he's extremely self-centered - he stays up all night watching videos of himself fighting monsters, he believes he's too famous to go to school, he ignores introductions with the other girls because he's just too tired. At other times, he's a super-kind goody-two-shoes - he's always quick to apologise when someone criticises him, he believes the foreigners shouldn't be killed. But in situations where a team member is asked to kill a foreigner, he has no complaints.  2. Athena: The female lead and Yoshichika's covenanter, she's also the only goddess who gets any real screen time. Even though she has never met Yoshichika, she has somehow decided he is her soulmate. Apart from her odd love for Yoshichika and weird trust in Lucifer, there is no other defining aspect of her personality.  3. Chloe: The stereotypically ""American"" girl - loud, stubborn, strong, blonde, and very confrontational. Teamed up with Valkyrie, she forms the main attack force of the group. In the beginning she's portrayed as the dumbest of the group, and even fails a quiz of basic questions on the topic of their world. And yet later in the series, she's suddenly a brilliant detective with the deductive powers and resourcefulness of a CSI Miami cop. Additionally, she's always working out and worried about her diet, and yet when asked to cook she makes burgers and mystery junk food. And for some reason, in a show full of Japanese characters, the one American character is the one with the horrible English naming sense.  4. Tamaki: The former leader of the group. She's supposed to be the perfectionist and overachiever, who feels threatened by the perfect MC. At the beginning she berates Yoshi for not immediately attacking a weak monster, but later she suffers from moral dilemmas when she's asked to kill one herself. Paired with Venus, she's normally only good for healing and support. However once she activates her logic drive, her whip suddenly becomes an overpowered one-hit-kill weapon, which makes no sense.  5. Mana: The emo, silent, depressed girl - it is difficult to complain about her without spoiling her backstory. All I'll say is that her backstory makes no sense. Also, her resolution of her problems is one of the most contrived battles I've ever seen.  6. Olga: Literally the only character in the entire show I even liked, and even that was completely destroyed by the convoluted character development in the final arc. For most of the show, he is the only voice of reason - always able to identify flaws in the other characters and point them in the right direction. In addition, his cocksure showy attitude is always shown as hiding his insecurities and failing confidence. He was a truly relatable character; so when all his convictions break down so drastically at the end, I was horrified.  The rest of the characters are all just minor side characters, barely getting any attention or screen time. Artemis, Valkyrie and Venus are pretty much completely ignored aside from their scant interactions with their partners. Veronica and Nemesis are characters I can't understand - they seem to have the greatest firepower among the group, and yet they almost always avoid taking part in battles. I'm not even sure what Yukari's point in the story is.    Finally, one of the worst examples of naming sense I've seen in anime - ALCA, the Another Logic Counter Agency. Which makes me wonder, what happened to the first Logic Counter Agency?  I didn't expect much coming into this anime, and yet it still managed to disappoint. The animation and sound were the only saving grace.";Not Recommended

4;Luck & Logic;Tyrannicswine117;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyrannicswine117;4;Warning possible Spoilers  My time watching anime's has certainly made me find some really amazing ones, but there is that point where I do find some really bad or Godawful ones and this is definitely one of them.  The story is set on the human world of Septpia and they are being invaded by creatures called Majin's so a boy named Yoshichika Tsurugi and his other Logicalist teammates along with their Goddesses are sent in to handle and stop the threat. Now I've seen these type of stories quite a few times and every time they get less and less enjoyable, this was just a great big bore to get through the only interesting thing I got from this show was how their suits worked which was by using a Goddess from the world the Majin's are from with a logic card and combing them with a human that to me sounded pretty interesting, but the rest of the show was just awful I couldn't get excited at all and I mainly either groaned or shouted when something predictable or cliched happened and you know an anime is bad when it calls out it's own cliches. It gladly only 12 episodes, but for 12 episodes it certainly dragged on however despite being a bore fest there were some or one element that kept me going well just about.  The characters are possibly the only reason I didn't quit the show because they were at least half-decent well most of them. The main character Yoshichika is not really a great example of a character and I even watched this in dub and it was surprising to see that he was voiced by Nathan Sharp AKA Natewantstobattle now Nathan's acting wasn't the problem it was Yoshi himself, he was a very bland person and didn't even try to set himself apart from many harem protagonists that I have seen before and funny enough this isn't even a harem so how did the show mess this up. Then there are the 3 main human female characters Chloe, Mana and Tamaki, now each of these girls had their quirk Chloe was actually pretty likeable from her upbeat and active personality, even Mana was likeable too since she was shy and had a bit of a dark backstory, then there is Tamaki she annoyed the hell out of me I just wanted her to shut up whenever she got into an argument with someone luckily that didn't last the whole series and she was pretty much settled down by the final episodes. The Godesse's are actually pretty bland since you don't really get to see them do much other than powering the suits the other's have to use and the names of the Godesse's are Atena, Venus, Valkyrie, Altemis and Nemesis there was really nothing to make these characters stand out apart from their appearances and their slight personality differences so they didn't really do much for me. There is some other supporting characters too like Yukari who felt like the lovable mascot of the team who gets everyone back on their feet and there is also Chief Veronica who is pretty much like every other female chief I have seen in these type of anime's. Finally there is the villains who are Olga Breakchild who is pretty much a douchebag longing to become a proper Logicalist who of course gets the evil bad guy Lucifer as his Logicalist and both of these guys didn't feel menacing they just felt like an irritation really.  Now the artstyle was poor I didn't like the combination of 2D and 3D when there were battle sequences it just didn't fit and the same can be said for the monsters too they just looked awful and some of them looked like they belonged in Pokemon which felt very weird and wrong.  The action was poor and didn't last very long which to be honest is a good thing since the suits abilities didn't feel incredible compared to many other anime's I've seen that use special powers or magic whichever you class this as plus the suit's themselves didn't look that great either, what also really caught me off guard and actually annoyed me in some way was the surprising amount of fanservice in the anime and it made me think why there wasn't an Ecchi tag hell there was a scene with Tamaki and Atena who are fully nude and they even show Tamaki's bare nips now I like my fanservice, but this just felt wrong and uncomfortable, I could also say the same for the transformations it was like the animators wanted to woo the Yuri and Yaoi fans with the way those transformations went.  Overall this was a poor anime and I wouldn't recommend it unless you are that much of a fan of cute girls in mecha like suits then be my guest, but for those casual viewers avoid this.;Not Recommended

At least I wasn't being blinded by 10 year old girls' panties, or scantily clad child bodies every minute. At LEAST there wasn't an episode where all the characters were completely nude for 90% of the 12 minutes...... at least there was some personality to these girls besides the fact that they just want to sleep around to get further in their careers because that's the right way to do things. I felt so grateful that there was some peace and tranquility and I didn't feel that I needed to rinse my eyes out after each episode.  I am happy for Ooizumi and Yagami though. I will give the anime props for at least not causing major drama as usual romances go... but I guess there just simply wasn't time for an actual story in between all those breasts and panties.;Recommended

Yes Love Love is an echhi, but it doesn't deliver that hard driving ecchi feeling. The nudity itself is pretty mediocre (wow I sound like a pervert) and the plot is pretty weak. As for the comedy, I had a hard time differing between what was supposed to be funny and what was supposed to be serious, i.e. those weird perverted torture scenarios. Honestly, I kind of laughed at the crap this guy made up to get back at the girls (he really needs to work on his people skills). As for the ending, I will stress what I say with all ecchis:  ""DON'T COUNT ON A DEFINITE ENDING OR A GOOD ONE, AT LEAST NOT AT THE SAME TIME.""  7/10, hey its an ecchi, I don't expect gold.Plus the eps are hella short";Recommended
0;Love♥Love?;Elydan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Elydan;5;"I'm going to keep this short and clear so it'll become not only my shortest review, but also a review that gets to the point.  This Anime, no matter how I look at it, wasn't enjoyable at all. The animation is so-so, the sounds are so-so, the story sucks and the characters are especially mediocre to poorly done. You see, I don't get how an Anime like this deserves high ratings since it has nothing that really compliments it.  It has a slow build-up, tends to look like fillers, are boring and doesn't get you into it all. The first episode was decent; and it did get me to watch it till the end.  But the more I got to the end.. the worse it got.  I can't recommend this to anyone. However, it seems the other reviewers did like this sort of Anime and gave it quite the high rating. Thus, it seems it is enjoyable to some; maybe you too. But in my opinion; don't watch this. If you want a romance/comedy to follow through; stick to different ones. Because this one, it's not so good.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love♥Love?;Nasty001;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nasty001;5;How should I say this.................Ok so I've just completed viewing this anime whose episodes only run for about 15mins. I'd say that the slice of life it projects is all too common, which the common lesson is that everyone uses someone to gain the advantage. True co'z it really does happen in real life especially in showbiz. Sure the girls already knew that the muchacho (the male lead) is the lead screenwriter thanks to one very curious rumor monger. They started to do their best to seduce or trick the muchacho to give them more prominent roles and as usual some body can't keep her trap shut to which the muchacho finds out about it and muchacho get's furious and get's even, despite of it all, in the end, it has a happy but blunt ending. To which I wonder if the chicas (Female leads) really do have feelings for the muchacho as describe by info? Well, since I did mentioned a happy but blunt ending, because the muchacho get's to write a season 2 of the show and upon hearing it the chicas (female cast) started to swarm the muchacho, the good thing though is that they're bluntly honest and demanding as well.  Art: I'll just give it an 8, don't ask.  Sound: I give an 8 for the ending theme.  And the rest my friends are just mediocre, the characters are your typical fan-service things and for enjoyment, well, definitely not for kids, but if you're a grown up who's just up for some fan-service thing then this is for you. Overall, just your typical fan-service anime. The End.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love♥Love?;LoneAngel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LoneAngel;6;This is an ok anime. Not many jokes in this anime that I would call funny and I am not hard to laugh. I was surprised to see that some people told me that there weer some good ones but I hate those people now and hope they dive feet first into a dark abyss. But anyways this anime has some nudity in it which I like because I am against censorship of things and the story itself is not bad. This is just an older anime and they seem to have a hard time to get me into likeing them. If you are not into older animes then don't watch it, you will be bored. As a love story it goes pretty good (bad engrish I know). Has a goodole cluster firetruck of love pentagions going on and the deception between the characters makes things seem intense. I would say they reveal too much info in the beginning and does not really keep anyone guessing at the end on who the main char is going to choose.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love♥Love?;laketica;https://myanimelist.net/profile/laketica;5;The only good thing about this anime is that each episode is only 15 minutes of... well, really, nothing. No story, no character development, nothing really interesting. Oh, I guess if you like under-aged nudity and basically, self-prostitution of children for the sake of furthering their careers... sure. Go ahead and enjoy.  I feel like every episode was the same: every girl is required to advance upon Ooizumi at least once a day, preferably without clothes and/or by smashing some inappropriate part of their body into his face. I appreciate the fact that he does not usually give into their advances, except for Yagami, and that he is overall, a pretty decent guy... at least in my opinions. Not many guys could hold back in real life if they were in his place.  So, unless you REALLY love ecchi stuff, even the crappy ecchi that has no real story line... don't watch this anime. Sorry Miyano Mamoru, it pains me to say this, but... it really wasn't a good anime at all.;Mixed Feelings
4;Love♥Love?;asdcvvbbd1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/asdcvvbbd1;6;This anime was overall not too amazing. The art wasn't too good but then again it was made 8 years ago so just keep that in mind(but still compared to other anime made from same art isn't too good). I dont usually talk about the sounds but this anime's sound was also not amazing. The story was fairly unique but was also pretty boring the only thing that was better about this anime was that the characters had somewhat different personalities. I can't say much about enjoyment of the anime because i enjoy all animes but if i were to compare to some of my other higher ranked animes i would say i would give it a(6) for enjoyment. Thanks.

0;Love♥Love?;Baddie007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Baddie007;3;Bueno, what can I say about this anime........frankly it was beautiful, I like the romance between Naoto and Natsumi, but unfortunately, this anime was a diactomy where one part dwells on the dark side of romance and the other part was on lighter side of romance. Thought the romance and harem genre are pretty generic, this is probably the only anime that focuses on both the dark and the lighter sides of the two mentioned genre with such particularization on the harem's seduction on the MC. Ok, it was pretty obvious that the members of the harem are trying to seduce their way into the MC's heart, not because of who the MC was but because what the MC is and it so happens that the MC was the show's script writer and for the members of the harem to get more roles is to be more popular in show business. Thought, the romance part of this anime was focus on Naoto and Natsumi it wasn't clear if Natsumi was also among those who was taking advantage of Naoto or does she have feelings for him and frankly if there is something enjoyable about this anime that would be the ecchi that come with this anime's genre.  My ratings for each categories of this anime:  Story and enjoyment: Fair 6.  The anime itself does have a good story as well as a good plot, but It was the execution that was way too off.  Art and sound: Good 7.  Fanservice, me like.......so sue me.  The sound,I simply like this anime's ending theme and believe or not I'm still listening to and I've downloaded every device I have from my smart phone to my laptop.  Overall: Poor 3.  Generally speaking, it was quite a drag that the romance part between the character's I've mentioned was on an uncertainty, The only consolation here were the fanservice that goes around and I much as I hate to say it, that's as good as it get's.;Not Recommended
1;Love♥Love?;mercury1980;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mercury1980;1;"I have long held this review since I began watching anime. Well, now that I have the time to review this garbage, let's do this.  STORY (1):  This anime is part of the Cosprayers trilogy. One was the original anime, 2 was Hit wo Nerae and finally this anime. As you know, I didn't like any of the Cosprayers trilogy. They are boring, terrible and downright insulting to me. This is the anime that was brought to us by Master of Entertainment. Some of you haven't heard of that company, but it's ok. They no longer exist anymore. The reason is because they keep making bad anime and they never improve. Master of Entertainment is my least favourite anime company.  Especially the ""Holocaust"" of anime known as ""Ultimate Girls"". This anime is actually the worst anime I have ever seen. It has everything I hate about anime, alongside with Pupa.  The story is basically a soft-core porn with tons of the most horrendous dialogue. I am just going to say it is basically ""50 shades of Grey"" the anime. All the young girls age 11-17, they want to bang Naoto Oizumi AKA Christian Grey. There is bondage, S&M, torture, blatant fanservice & tons of comedic misunderstandings. I can tell you those comedic misunderstandings are repeated to the point of annoyance. There is no comedic moment. Everything is cringe worthy and eye-rolling.  This anime is considered more melodramatic than Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso & School days combined.  Not to mention there are moments of pauses in dialogue where the character was embarrassed.  ART (1):  The animation looked terrible. The characters are not appealing in the slightest. The fanservice is blantant and obnoxious.  SOUND (1):  The music and the opening and ending songs are horrendous to listen to. Especially, the voice acting, it makes Yuka Fujiwara's (Wonder Momo 2014) voice sound like a great voice actresses. The voice acting was horrendous.  CHARACTER (1):  I am just going to compare some characters to 50 shades of grey.  Naoto Oizumi, another Christian Grey, who is like a sex slave to the young girls. The girls just let Naoto Oizumi prey on the girls while the girls prey on Naoto Oizumi.  Natsumi Yagami is just another Anastasia Steele, who is in love with Naoto Oizumi and she can't do anything without him. She is just another weak female character just like the rest of the girls.  Naoto and Natsumi's relationship are one of the most forced romance I have ever seen.  The rest of the characters are not worth mentioning because they are annoying and obnoxious.  CONCLUSION (1):  I would say that the S&M is the thing that is driving the anime. I am not going to waste my time talking about this anime because I just want to let out my anger towards this anime and the people involved in this anime.  Even if you are an ecchi fan, I would never recommend this anime to anyone. If you want ecchi, watch ToLoveRu or Sekirei.  Love Love? gets a solid 1 out of 10. It might not be the worst anime I have seen. However, this is not an anime you should be watching. This anime is just exploitative and best if avoided.";Not Recommended
2;Love♥Love?;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;2;"Remember Cosprayers, that god awful, jumbled mess of an anime that made no sense?, well how about a meta-view of the show through the lens of the ""making of"" camerman of Cosprayers, no?...well f-  Love♥Love? shows us the directing, casting and screenwriting of the Cosprayers yet this anime takes more of a look at the endless and countlessly rapid-fire of panty and nude shots and a romance because why not?  Naoto Oizumi voiced by Mamoru Miyano is the ""making of"" cameraman of Cosprayers and he's the typical dense main male protagonist who daydreams and fantasizes waaaay too much. The other main cast involves the actresses of Cosprayers and ALL of them are generic and cliche with one note personalities...just like their Cosprayers counterparts!...maybe a bit better but that ain't saying much. Needless to say the main heroine Natsumi Yagami voiced by Miyu Matsuki gets the majority of the screentime because main love interest to the main protagonist to say the least, she's your typical shy girl. Miku Hayasaka voiced by Kiyomi Asai is ALSO another shy but slightly genki girl, Sayaka Imamura voiced by Mayumi Yoshida is the sharp tongued loli character contrasting Miku, Hikaru Jougasaki is ANOTHER shy girl with along with Miku have the least development in the entire anime and finally Youko Jougasaki voiced by Sayaka Ohara and Youko Katsuragi voiced by Sanae Kobayashi as ANOTHER shy girl with along with Miku as having the least screentime in the entire cast and Youko being the headstrong character of the cast. LA didn't have ANY investment in ANY of these characters and it doesn't help that the main male protagonist is a dense perverted moron but even with the plot twist about him, what he does...doesn't help matters about how LA feel about him. The ONLY character LA had an inkling to maybe like was Mitsuki Ikuta voiced by Mamiko Noto and she's hardly in it! and probably working more on her own anime series in Hit wo Nerae! (Ohhh..LA will get to you soon!)  The animation done by Imagin and Studio Live, well because of the anime being mostly nude and panty shots, it IS RELENTLESS. Character designs are really the same from Cosprayers (being the same studio and all) but nonetheless...LA was rather meh about the entire animation, it wasn't the worst but man LA is fine with fanservice but Love♥Love?'s relentless amount of fanservice shoved into your face didn't help ONE LITTLE BIT.  Voice acting was ok, yet slightly annoying with the constant fanservice leading to moaning and screaming especially from Miyu Matsuki, god bless her soul but due to how bland the majority of the character cast are...LA really doens't have much to say besides that the voice cast tried but it's the material but REALLY didn't help, but was hardly the voice actors fault.  Love♥Love? cares more about shoving nude and panty shots on the screen 90% of the time more than trying to focus on it's characters and it's barely there plot and what little plot that it does focus on is typical, cliche and rather annoying harem plotlines we've seen time and again in better harem animes, if Love♥Love? looked more at..ohh LA doesn't know the meta-look at the directing, screenwriting and casting of a godawful REAL-LIFE ANIME, it could have been at least interesting, instead we get a bucketful of panty and nude shots any chance it gets and almost completely ignoring or making it's plot and it's characters even worse altogether. Love♥Love? is bad no it's HORRIBLE, but Cosprayers is STILL worse than this, but that really isn't saying much...";Not Recommended
0;Lovely★Complex;lowell;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lowell;10;"I really, really, really loved LoveCom.  It was cute, insightful, hilarious and endearing. It was my most anticipated episode every week. I always wanted more. I want more now even though I know it's over!  The story is about the tallest girl and the shortest boy in class and their search for love in high school. It turns out they're both kooky, funny and energetic. They're also perfect for each other... too bad they don't see that. The story isn't complicated or new, but it was told so well that it crawled into right into that soft spot in my heart.  The romance is built slowly over time and by the end, you're head over heels for them because the creators did such a great job of laying down the foundation and actually showing you how their feelings grow over time. It's not like a lot of shows where all of a sudden in a haze of fuzzy lighting and rose petals, love magically sprouts out of nowhere. Instead, you see a friendship begin, a moment happens, interest blossoms, awareness grows... the whole nine yards. You really get to know Koizumi and Otani over the course of the show and I was rooting like crazy for them.  The characters are so over the top and out of control that it's hard not to laugh. They exaggerate, make ridiculous faces and they over-react to everything. It's really kind of hammy, but that's part of the fun. And it's refreshing to see a female lead who isn't some stereotype of a dominatrix-in-training or a weak, helpless nitwit. She seems like a real human being with strong points and weak points. She isn't afraid to get ugly and imperfect sometimes and I think it's really great that they made her (and, really, him too) full of all these flaws and not-so-attractive traits... and yet so completely charming and loveable. It makes them really... human. I would say that if you like the relationship (without the music and with a lot more actual focus on romance) of Nodame and Chiaki from Nodame Cantabile, you might like this too because there's a similarity in the way that the relationships go both ways and the strength that each of them brings to the relationship.  The art is great too. First of all, they took the time and effort to change the characters appearances day to day and give them all a sense of their own style, which I really appreciate. It's just really thorough and well-executed. I completely agree with YoshikoHatake, there is something about the style that brings Bokura Ga Ita to mind, even though the tone of the story is completely different (BGI felt a lot more serious and the colors and style reflect that somewhat, I think). Music-wise, it's also nice. I don't normally notice the openings and endings that much (I've always hated credits), but LoveCom's are really good in a perky, energetic kind of way, which suits the show perfectly, and I find myself singing along w/ the karaoke. ;)  Enjoy! =)  P.S. I really haven't seen very many romances that do this good of a job at being funny and sweet and tender and honest. If you have, I'd love suggestions!";Recommended
1;Lovely★Complex;kiriska;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kiriska;8;"Girl meets boy and girl likes boy. But girl is also half a foot taller than boy and thus, epic drama ensues!  S T O R Y - I don't read/watch a lot of shoujo, but from the start, I figured it was a pretty basic plot and as a result, probably a pretty generic story. I was right -- it's a lot of what you would typically expect from shoujo: lots of silly romantic drama, lots of hilarious shenanigans, and the your handful of cute, fluffy moments scattered throughout that always feel like an shot of diabetic sweetness straight to your black, black heart. And it was wonderfully done for the most part. As predictable as the overarching story can be, it was still very engaging and fun to watch. The slice of life approach makes the episode-to-episode drama slightly less obvious, and I really loved that time actually moves throughout the series.  I suppose time progression would logically be more common in slice of life and shoujo series, but since I don't dabble into the genre much, it was very refreshing for me to experience. The series begins as the characters start high school and ends neatly as they graduate. Time moves at a pretty fixed pace, so there's no awkwardness in transitions. I was also really happy to see the beginning, creation, and progression of a relationship -- the series doesn't just end when they get together (I refuse to count that as a spoiler; I mean, c'mon. Did you ever have any doubts?), it keeps going and explores some of their problems and potential future. All in all, it's wrapped up pretty nicely. The story, while fairly generic, is solid, well told, and just silly and fun. The pacing is steady, and though things do feel like they're being dragged along occasionally, the feeling never lasts long. It's a good thing to watch after a shitty day. I'm actually really sad it's over for that very reason.  C H A R A C T E R - Risa Koizumi is a very dramatic girl. It's fun at first; after a while it got a little tiring. But then I came to realize that wait. Girls really ARE like this! They ARE overdramatic and hysterical and crazy and thoroughly ridiculous. After realizing that amazing truth, I didn't mind so much anymore. Risa is just a girl. And that's how they are. Honestly, I can't call her unrealistic in good conscience because everything she does, every over-the-top reaction she has, I can imagine someone I know in real life doing the same. Considering that, I think Risa's actually a pretty damn well done character. She's very sympathetic and easy to relate to, even when she's crying for the fifth time in five episodes. And she grows -- her feelings for Otani evolve and mature a lot throughout the series, and through you're constantly reminded of this progression through three-second flashbacks, it is something that's nice to look back on.  Atsushi Otani is an idiot. It's fun at first; after a while, it gets a little frustrating. But then I came to realize that wait! Boys really ARE like this! They're retarded and stupid and dense and miss all the obvious signs and are super awkward when they do finally get it! Amazing. Once again, I found Otani's depiction to be hilariously accurate on many levels. He does tend to be much less dramatic than Risa, but that's not surprising considering the male stereotype and the fact that his point of view isn't focused on as much until the second half of the series. Though both Risa's and Otani's feelings are undoubtedly romanticized greatly, I found the slower development of Otani's feelings a lot more interesting -- you know what's going to happen, but watching everything unfold is still interesting.  The supporting cast of friends do a great job of contrasting their lovey-dovey relationships with the irregular, often immature, and haphazard relationship of our protagonists. This makes them all noticeably idealized to the point where they're more roles than in-depth characters, but I guess that's all they really needed to be. Seiko and Haruka were fun gimmicks as well. Still, Nobuko was a pretty convincing best friend for Risa, likely because she had the most screentime of the supporting cast.  A R T S T Y L E & A N I M A T I O N - The animation and art jump around a lot in this series, so there's a bit of bad and a bit of good. The opening and end themes had a lot of fun variation to them, though all seemed pretty typical of shoujo, especially in the sense that they played around with the characters' fashion and style a lot. In the episodes themselves, the characters jumped back and forth from a pretty lazy and generic style to a really hilarious caricature style to a super, sparkle-filled, shiny, pretty shoujo style. The first of those three was the most common and got annoying sometimes because there would be strange discrepancies in how certain things (people, buildings, objects) look and I noticed some variations in height differences and proportions, especially for Risa whose lanky shape stands out a lot when the proportions change. The second was really amusing, especially since many of the SD faces are uniquely and hilariously grotesque and the characters don't hesitate to point this out themselves. The final style naturally showed up in all the super romanticized and climatic scenes -- its those scenes they saved their animation budget on, I'm sure -- making everything that much sweeter. It's predictable, but hey, it's gorgeous and cute and it works, dammit.  Another thing I'm sure is pretty common in shoujo, but that I appreciated all the same, was the fact that fashions changed from scene to scene, episode to episode. I loved that characters changed their clothes every day and had a lot of seasonal fashions; they would also be scene shopping occasionally and the clothes they buy would show up later, etc. I also loved that Risa's hair was constantly changing -- sometimes it coincided with her mood and emotions; sometimes it coincided with events or the weather; sometimes it was just different. It's not that big a deal, really, but it makes the characters that much more real and easier to relate to.  Overall, Love★Com's animation is just average, but it's good enough and the style definitely suits the series.  M U S I C - The first time I heard the first opening theme, ""Kimi + Boku = Love?"" by Tegomass, it confirmed all the stereotypical expectations I had for the series. It's upbeat and cheerful-hopeful, the vocalist's voice has an endearing, dorky quality to it, and the even the name of the song is corny as hell. It felt very right. End themes are generally slower, more somber, and more thoughtful compared to opening themes, and the first end theme, also by Tegomass, was no different. It kind of struck me how different the vocalist sounded. It also felt very right, and both songs really grew on me during the first half of the series.  Surprisingly though, the second pair of themes for the series are even better! I absolutely adore how the second opening, ""Hey! Say!"" by Hey!Say! 7 starts. In conjunction with the colorful animation sequence, it suits the series perfectly. It's the kind of music that I imagine Risa and Otani would listen to in addition to Umibouzu, and the lyrics are adorable. The same can be said for the second end theme, ""BON BON,"" also by Hey!Say! 7 -- it's much more upbeat than the first end theme (though still reasonably thoughtful and kind of reminiscent) and once again, just adorable.  Love★Com also surprised me by having a really nice general soundtrack. The theme that played for all of the more depressing scenes was especially pretty and sweet to listen to. For other series of Love★Com's technical quality, I usually don't notice the soundtracks because they're generic and bland, so it's definitely worth noting that the music in this actually stood out. It's one of those soundtracks I wouldn't mind listening to outside of watching the actual series.  V O I C E A C T I N G - If you actually know Japanese or if you are just a gigantic dork, you might notice that pretty much all of the characters in this series speak in a Kansai dialect, which makes sense since the story takes place in Osaka. I found this pretty awesome because while a lot of series will have one or two characters that speak in the dialect, few have the full cast speaking in it. The last time I heard so many ""aho""s instead of ""baka"" was in BECK. It's really interesting and neat to hear because even if you don't understand the language that well or realize that it's a different dialect, if you've seen a lot of subbed anime, you'll be able to pick up on slight changes in pronunciation and vocabulary (the most obvious things that I caught were ""na"" instead of ""ne"" and ""chau"" instead of ""chigau""). For Risa, I also found her pronunciation of ""Otani"" to be occasionally distracting because she stresses the ""o"" a lot more than I would normally expect.  Other than fun dialect stuff, the voices themselves were pretty average. Risa's isn't that memorable, but it works well enough for her role. I was more impressed by Otani's voice because I found that he had a wider range of emotions and a much more recognizable tone overall -- his voice has a really unique inflection when he's upset or surprised, but it's also very charming when he's being serious. Other notable roles: Nakao was surprisingly soft-spoken, which goes great with his character, but was still surprising to hear because few people ever speak that quietly. Seiko's voice was obnoxiously high-pitched, which also went great with his/her character, but it also made me really glad s/he wasn't in too many scenes...  O V E R A L L - Lovely Complex was a much more enjoyable series than I thought it would be, but I'm always happy to see cliches work out. It's very true -- there are no original ideas left, so all there is to do is write good stories. They don't need to be original stories, just good stories, solid stories, fun stories. Lovely Complex fullfills all of above, so even though you know they're going to live happily ever after, you can still enjoy watching it for what it is. As I mentioned earlier, I watched episodes of Love★Com at the end of bad days. They're a shot of sugar and laughs, straight to the vein: adorably effective. Now I need to find another drug.";Recommended
2;Lovely★Complex;DragonsWhip;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DragonsWhip;8;You love love? Then you're going to love this anime!  The story itselves seems very standard at first glance, but it isn't. Risa, the main character, is an girl who is taller than the average girl. She wants an boy that's longer than her, but then something happens. She and Otani, a very short boy from her class, are often being laughed at, because they look and act like an popular comedy duo. Although the fact they're being laughed at and are bickering all the time, their friendships start to grow and Risa even starts to like Otani. From here on the story has a lot of twists and turns, even untill the end, which makes it very interesting!  The art was nice. It has it own style and is different than most of the anime. The characters wear different time of clothing and have an other hairstyle. The art is more focused on the girls than on the boys: the guys aren't really handsome or whatever, not something you see a lot in shoujo! An other visual part are how the emotions are showed. They're typical, but also 'a bit' exaggerated. It doesn't annoy me, instead it makes me laugh! It makes it very funny and that's a part of the power of Lovecom.  The sound was something that perfectly matched the anime. Once you know the translation of it, you're going to love it. When I first heard the OP and EN I didn't enjoyed it that much, but now I'm totally in love with it! Later on the OP and the EN change... I loved them at once!  The characters are just so human! You could have the feeling that you're one of the characters, there's nothing extra-ordinary or something about them, like that they're actually an alien or something. No, the characters are human and that's why you can feel sorry for a person when he or she is crying and sympathize with them. It makes the whole story only more interesting~!  I really, really, really enjoyed this anime. The love, joy, sadness, funny parts, dreams that come true, dreams that scatter, it is all part of it and that's what it made me totally addicted to LoveCom.  Overall it deserves an big 9~! Just watch and see this amusing anime!;Recommended
3;Lovely★Complex;Master10K;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Master10K;9;"Lovely Complex is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romantic, Comedy about an odd couple; tall girl Risa Koizumi and short guy Atsushi Ootani. It is near impossible to sit through this series straight-faced, as it is full of drama and lots of laughs. XD  Video Alternative ^_^  The story proved to be both entertaining and heart-warming at the same time. One thing I personally didn&rsquo;t like about the story and other may have a problem with, was the time-scale. Throughout series, everything seemed to move so fast that it was even skipping from season to season in a single episode. But that is also a great thing as the series would have wasted a lot of time otherwise. The romance part of this Rom/Com was done incredibly well, because it thoroughly went through Risa&rsquo;s constant struggle. There were quite a lot of unexpected developments as well that easily overshadowed all the cliches. Putting the romantic aspect aside, the comedy was great with some hilarious use of slapstick comedy, mostly brought on by the comedy duo (Risa x Atsushi).  With the story completely revolving around Risa and Atsushi, the pair needed to be great for it to be interesting and that is exactly what they were. Not only is it delightful to watch them constantly argue with each other but also the drama and tension between them was portrayed so well that you&rsquo;ll have to be heartless to not feel anything. Well of course there were other characters, but after the first couple episodes they barely played any major part in the story and were there just for jokes or to meddle with the comedy duo.  The style of animation really suits the comical manner of this anime, as it can look incredibly crude half the time to go with the various jokes. But then it can look somewhat striking when it needs to. The music is just a bunch of basic melodies to go with every situation although it does drop in a few really good tunes for the dramatic moments. The OP and ED themes aren&rsquo;t amazing, nonetheless that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t go well with the show.  Overall this is an amazing Rom/Com that is able to mix the Romance and the Comedy so well, so that neither seems overbearing. Even though the relationship was always &ldquo;two steps forward, one step back&rdquo; it never really felt dragged out. The one issue was the excessive amount of flashbacks, which sometimes got really repetitive but it never ruined the overall enjoyable feeling of the series. Even though it is a Shoujo anime, I&rsquo;m a guy who hugely enjoyed this series and it&rsquo;s definitely worth any Rom/Com fan&rsquo;s time.  ^_^";Recommended
4;Lovely★Complex;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;8;"5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Definitely not typical shoujo anime  If you looked for the meaning of &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; in the dictionary (or maybe even Wikipedia), you'd probably see &quot;Lovely Complex&quot; written in its definition. Okay, maybe not, but somebody should put it there!  As much as I love shoujo manga and anime, I do get tired of it sometimes because most shoujo follow the same formula. Such is not the case for Lovely Complex. I think Lovely Complex is the true embodiment of the romantic comedy genre. A love match between a tall girl and a short guy is like the perfect recipe for a romantic comedy. Not only that, it's also heartwarming, but funny at the same time. That is what makes it so refreshing. I don't think I laughed and cried for a shoujo anime as much as I did for Lovely Complex.  The 2 main characters are different from the usual shoujo protagonists as well. You have Koizumi Risa, taller than the average girl, slightly tomboyish and awkward. There's also Otani Atsushi, shorter than the average guy, insecure, and kind. Together they also deviate from the usual shoujo anime/manga couples. When they officially become a couple (not really a spoiler because it's obvious they'll get together XD), it's evident that Risa is more dominant than Otani.  To be honest, I didn't like Lovely Complex right away because I wasn't used to hearing so many characters speak in Osakan accents. The moment I heard one of them speak, I thought to myself &quot;Obviously Osakan&quot;. Not that I have anything against Osakans, but at times, it sounded as if they were speaking in Chinese and couldn't understand what they were saying (I have the habit of translating in my head even while reading the subs). I'm still iffy about the accents, but then I realize that the Osakan accents really work well for Koizumi and Otani's personalities - loud. Very loud.  I like the character designs - Again, not typical shoujo anime/manga designs in which characters are usually bishie-fied. The characters look cute and their clothes are always so trendy. The only typical element you'd find in the character design is the out of proportion bodies, but in a different way. Sometimes Risa does look boyish because she doesn't have a figure, but I guess her look matches her personality. I also like the colors, consisting mostly of yellow-orange tones. The colors made the visuals of Lovely Complex really attractive, cute and current.  I didn't like the first set of OP and ED themes at first, because I thought that kind of music was kind of corny and for older fans. Just when I was starting to like both songs, they replaced the OP and ED themes with Hey! Say! 7 songs (around episode 13), and I'm really glad they did. The latter set of songs is more current and trendy as they should be, because the anime itself is current and trendy. I especially like &quot;BON BON&quot; by Hey! Say! 7, the second ED. I think it's a really sweet and cute song.  I'm glad I picked Lovely Complex when I was looking for a new shoujo anime to watch. It turned out to be one of the best series (in general) I've ever seen, and I strongly recommend it to all anime fans, whether you like shoujo or not.";Recommended
5;Lovely★Complex;LoonyB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LoonyB;10;"A romance-comedy with a Kansai twist.  I was a bit late getting onto the Lovely Complex or LoveCom bandwagon but once on board I was there till the end! LoveCom had me laughing, crying while my heart trided to leap out of my chest. It was well balanced in light and heavy scenarios, high in good anime-nutritions, a must-see for the anime-fan diet! One I devoured in two days! (All 24 eps).  Story: Every manga-ka tries to find their niche market. What do the romance-comedy fans want next? Dramatic pasts with dead characters? Forbidden loves? Deaths? Mahou-shoujo? There are millions of romance-comedy manga and anime out there that are based off cer-ray-zeh ideas however, it does not make them worth while, nor more interesting. However, all my kudos goes to the original Manga-Kas, Nakahara and Aya, for using the simple idea of height complexes and creating one of the worlds best romance-comedies ever! In short, the LoveCom story is simple, sweet but one of the best ideas out there.  Art: The art seems very simple at first glance but it is most effective. Not only does the style translate from the manga perfectly but it amazingly portrays the unique kansai humor that makes up half of LoveCom. It also well portrays the characters types which are so important in this anime about characters who have porblems with themselves. From the adorable Seiko to the tall (but model like) Risa.  Sound: Could've done with some work. Personally I really didn't like the opening and ending themes although they did match the anime perfectly. Also, Seiko's voice was starting to make my ears bleed after five minutes. However, Risa and Otani's voice's were perfect and the background music for those heavy emotional scenes (mostly bad ones) was very effective.  Character: This anime is built on the characters it portrays. The mix of strange and fairly normal teens (plus two teachers and some strange parents) is very effective. Each character bounces off another as they help one and other grow. Ofcourse, LoveCom is about love and complexes, and so every character doesn't go without their own little slice of problems and it's these that fuel the anime along, and these we grow to love.  Enjoyment: I must say, while I tend to greatly enjoy romance of anysort (and the love-love in this anime stopped my heart a few times) the unique Kansai region humor really did me in. Word unique to Kansai (and Osaka) like 'Aho' rahter than 'Baka' made this anime stand out, and the comedy-duo acts, in the style of japanese comedy was something new and amazing to experience, even in animation! It is so difference to western humor (much like how british humor is generally different to american) and it kept me smiling all the way!  Overall, as you may be able to tell (10/10!!) I enjoyed this anime greatly, and so should many others. It reaches many aspects of life; love, self counsiousness, moving on and being true to what you feel. LoveCom is a romance-comedy for all anime fans. What are you waiting for? The All Hashin Kyojin are preforming just for you!";Recommended
6;Lovely★Complex;yakitate9;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yakitate9;9;"Lovely Complex is truly a great series. Every episode, regardless of what is happening, is enjoyable and leaves you wanting to watch the next one.  The storyline isn't anything crazy or off the wall, but it is executed to near perfection and contains a lot of really good plot turns and twists. Complimenting the story, and enhancing it, is a lot of very funny comedy. A good story makes you want more, and in that regard, this does exactly that.  The artwork and animation is good, although at times it can be inconsistent. But what is most important is that the scenes that are made to be remembered, look stunning.  As for the sound, there are some very good background pieces that come up throughout the series. Of the two OP's and two ED's, I really only like the first ones. The OP and ED of the second half of the series were pretty mediocre to me, although they have both grown on me a little bit. The voice acting was what really took the cake; all of the voices were well done, with the voice actors of Otani and Risa really doing an excellent job.  The characters really made this series so good. There is not a single character that I feel doesn't fit into the series, but again, Otani and Risa just steal the show. Their friends also have good characters, but aren't paid as much attention as the two mains.  Overall, this is an incredibly enjoyable anime. You come to live and die with the characters, and really feel what they feel. Lovely Complex has some of the most perfectly executed moments that I have seen, where the stars just seem to align and make a scene that forces your jaw to drop and your heart to pound.";Recommended
7;Lovely★Complex;kytaen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kytaen;7;"Lovely★Complex is centered around our main character and tallest girl in her class, Koizumi Risa, and the shortest boy in the class, Otani Atsushi. The anime explores their relationship, from classmates to friends to maybe even lovers.  The premise of the anime is fantastic. Both our deuteragonists have a case of height complexes (hence the name) and struggle to overcome this. In the beginning, there is a mutual dislike for each other, as Risa and Otani are laughed at because of their reputation as the class' ""comedy duo"". As time progresses, however, Koizumi begins to like Otani, as a friend (and later, a crush), and accepts the fact that he's shorter than her. But to Otani, Risa is just the other half of their comedy duo, and no more than a friend. This unrequited love is what drives the whole story and plot forward.  The plot is simple and predictable, yet the way it was executed made it interesting. There are some times where the plot doesn't flow as well, but all the episodes have use and further move the plot along. There are other times where the plot feels like it's looping, or taking ""one step forward, two steps back"", especially with romantic progression. Overall, a solid plot that does get a nice ending and ties many loose ends. However, the conflicts presented in the show heavily rely on the use of many love triangles, and most of the love rivals do not provide any doubt to the watcher as to whether the main advertised romance might not succeed , something that a well-written love rival should. Love triangles, when properly used, can bring the plot forward, but some of these love triangles did not drive the plot at all. The pace of the plot was in general, pretty fast-paced, but it's not rushed, and it received some slower progression as the plot began to unfold and broaden. The emotions that Love★Com tries to evoke are a hit-and-miss: sometimes it works to an astonishing degree, allowing the watcher to sympathize with the characters, and other times, it may feel a little cumbersome or it has a delayed effect. The plot is probably the main reason why this anime, for me at least, did not have much of an impact on me.  The characters are likable and funny, but the complexity of side characters are what I feel is the most lacking in this anime. Our protagonist, Koizumi Risa, is an exception: she's one of the most developed characters in the show. She is funny, dramatic, sarcastic, sometimes pathetic, determined yet wavered at times, charismatic, and nice. Her kindness, which is mentioned many times by her friends, tends to be overshadowed by her other personality traits, though. Her defining trait is her determination in seeking a relationship with Otani, even with all the obstacles thrown at her and all the times she nearly gave up. However, she loses sight of her goal countless times, to the point that it's hard to classify her as always determined; rather, it's like she has periods of absolute motivation and periods where she loses all hope. We get to see her go through a range of emotions, which is well portrayed in the anime. She can be over-the-top sometimes, dramatically pathetic, and an absolute idiot, but she's relatable, with realistic flaws and virtues, and that's what I think is the selling feature of hers.  Otani is dense, sarcastic, humorous, and idiotic. He has a hard time sorting out his feelings, and doesn't like to talk about them either, therefore his feelings, if any, towards Risa, is definitely more toned-down than that of Risa's toward Otani. He constantly gives Risa hope (referring to their relationship progression) but then snatches that hope away from her, which tires her to no end. As dense and unaware of his actions as he is, many of the lines he has does have a profound effect on Risa. In short, a character with a few interesting quirks, and not at all typical.  However, with so much of our focus on the main characters and their love, the side characters do not receive enough attention. Most of them are two-dimensional characters that rely on one or two traits to define them. They don't have much of an impact on plot, but then again, I guess the point of Love★Com is to mostly display interactions between the deuteragonists, but I would like for more depth in personality for the sides, to promote that yes, the side characters are equally as important as the main characters.  There isn't as much character development in Love★Com, because of the focus on romantic development and friendship development, but for this anime, that is exactly what makes it enjoyable. Of course, I would've liked to see some, but the anime as it is now can do without.  The comedy in this show is spot on and greatly enjoyable. For an anime classified as a comedy, this is exactly what I'd expect: sad or tense moments followed by a comedic one to relieve the tension. Lines are perfectly executed to bring laughter to the one watching. This anime does a wonderful job at playing with the watcher's emotions. Love★Com is guaranteed to make you happier after a bad day.  Now, for the romance. It develops bit by bit, and we clearly see the stages of love here. The romance part of the story is unique and lovely, but it could have been better approached. The side characters tend to bash Otani for not liking Risa, something I find a little unfair. Along with the countless love triangles as the main strain on Risa and Otani's relationship, this degrades the whole complexity of the romance by a fair bit. The romance grows with the few internal conflicts (such as Otani not being able to see Risa as anything but a friend, no matter how hard he tried) and external conflicts, but suffers under the majority of others. In general, a promising romance that, on the whole, is very satisfying and unique, but lacking in a few small areas.  The background music suits the anime well. There are the upbeat and cheerful songs, perfectly tuned in with the anime's overall atmosphere and inner message of hope, and then there's the sad, depressing songs played during disappointing moments. There is a good variety in song themes and it's effective, but the Love★Com OST isn't as noteworthy in particular. The openings and endings of the anime aren't as memorable, with the openings being overly cheerful and peppy and the endings being more thoughtful and slow, but I do admit they also complement the anime. The voice actors are decently matched with their respective characters, especially for the main characters, who have a tendency to be expressive and loud.  The art of the anime is satisfying, but it's not special or exceptional. It works well with the characters, and fit their different personalities. Risa is a character that changes her hairstyle often, showing her personality and sense of style. The characters encompass a broad range of emotions, and the art does nicely in the portrayal of them, whether it's sadness, anger, or just Risa being plain exaggerative. Light colors are often used, nothing too dark, which goes along with the fact that Lovely★Complex is a light-hearted anime, without any terribly dark conflicts or themes.  Overall, Love★Com is definitely worth the consideration, for its entertaining comedy, relatable main characters, and the romance. It's lovely, all right ... just not as complex.

8;Lovely★Complex;Hyduk87;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hyduk87;10;"I initially reviewed this piece after watching it only once, but since then, I have seen the series three times and decided to give this a complete and thorough review. I personally enjoy a systematic review that rates each category and explains why, but this first chunk is going to be just my thoughts on the anime as a whole. If you want to see my ratings for each category and why, continue reading at the bottom to see it (or if you'd just rather see scores for each category, then skip to the bottom after the lines of asterisks).   ****************************************************************   There are times when the telling of a tale becomes more than just a story - it becomes a masterpiece, forever to be treasured and remembered. Everything seems to just work, from the overarching plot-line, down to the background character cast and everything in between, the epic masterpieces move, change and impact in powerful ways. Lovely Complex is an anime that makes its mark as a potential to be one of these phenomenal works.  Immediately, this anime begins by setting up the story; a guy and girl who are both very self-conscious about their heights who desperately reach out for some kind of relationship. It becomes apparent almost immediately, though, that these two are nearly perfect for each other. But, of course, they can't begin to see each other as a candidate for a relationship. So the two decide to cheer each other on and help one another. Within just a few episodes, Koizumi (the girl) begins to develop feelings for Otani. Now beyond that is where the actual excitement and enjoyment of the story come into play. Frequently, you will find yourself laughing (extremely hard at times) at the plethora of jokes, but almost as often finding yourself near tears or frowning at that touching emotional scene. Very few stories have the capability to balance both comedy and drama ON TOP OF a romance plot. But not only does Lovely Complex do just that, it's touching, the comedy is genuinely hysterical and the romance is real. There's none of that ""lucky"" guy who's surrounded by lots of girls who adore him. None of that ""hotter-than-the-sun"" kind of girl who compels some guy to chase after her. What you get here is a realistic presentation of a developing relationship out of a friendship. One that is easy to relate to, fun to watch and cheer on, and will leave you with a lasting impression.  As for the art and sound, they only work to enhance and improve upon the wonders of the story and characters. Tense scenes seem to always have the perfect music playing. Touching scenes have that beautiful, heart-tugging melody playing quietly in the background. Throughout the 24 episodes, a common rag-time kind of theme is played that becomes very catchy and enjoyable - it seems to capture the nature of the characters and their struggles. Art, while being rather unique, is fairly detailed and clearly defines what is being presented. Often times, expressions are exaggerated (quite comically, I might add), and some scenes are taken over by ""floating flowers"" or ""swirling angry purple haze"" effects. While these may be distracting at times, they lend to improve the mood and feeling of each scene they appear. (Think lots of XD expressions going on).  All in all, Lovely Complex is both a touching and hilarious storyline that is definitely worth checking out. After 3 times watching through this show, I still laugh and cry, ending up with a feeling that I don't really get from any other anime I've watched (or re-watch). The ending seems to tie up a perfect package with an even more beautiful bow. Who knows? Perhaps LoveCom will ease its way into your heart as a masterpiece.   *****************************************************************   I rate animes I have seen based upon the categories of Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Personal Enjoyment, each worth 10 points (1 being terrible, 10 being incredible). The overall score is then multiplied by 2 to get a score out of 100.  **STORY** 9.9/10 I give the story a 9.9 out of 10 simply because I can't get enough of it. There never seems to be a filler episode, everything seems both relevant and interesting. The story is both compelling and moving. Comedy, Romance, Slice-of-Life, a bit of Drama. Now, why isn't it a 10/10? Simply because it's a somewhat generic story - girl and guy are friends, would make perfect couple but don't see it that way, one side falls for the other, but other side has reservations. You can probably guess what happens in the end. BUT, there's more to a story than just WHAT it is, there's the HOW it's told that really makes a difference. Which brings me to  **CHARACTERS** 10/10 This category I don't even hesitate to give a perfect score. Every character, from the lovable, dynamic duo of Risa and Otani, down to even the minor characters (Umibozu) and the somewhat detestable/annoying Mimi and Haruka are given such a wonderful personality. They all seem real, you can identify with them, you can love/hate them, cheer them on. Each of the characters are memorable in their own right and will leave some kind of impression on you.  **ART** 9.8/10 As for art, I can't give it a full score just because it didn't blow me away. But, what it did do, is present the story without distracting me, give life and love to each of the characters and clearly convey the mood being set up. I'm personally not one to really care what the anime looks like, as long as it's not... weird... and flows smoothly, doesn't deviate from what it set out to do, and makes changes when change would be expected. (i.e. 3 years go by, from 15-18, I better expect to see some changes in the characters). Thus, I gave it 9.8.  **SOUND** 10/10 Rarely do I ever look for the soundtrack from an anime, but this has become one of them (Cowboy Bebop, Welcome to the NHK some of the others). When the music is so good that you want to listen to it separately, without the scene and other things going on, you know that's a good music soundtrack. But beyond the soundtrack, the noises, the voices, every other sound is clear, crisp and beautiful. In that aspect, the sound is just like the art to me; as long as it's not weird or distracting, it's pretty good. But LoveCom had that amazing soundtrack (Risa's theme is so catchy), a great vocal cast and plenty of authentic sounding noises.  **PERSONAL ENJOYMENT** 10/10 Obviously, if you noticed that I'm effectively giving this anime two reviews, you should know that I would give this category a 10. I have watched this 3 times and I wouldn't mind watching it again in a few months. Just like that movie of which you never seem to tire, LoveCom grows on you and makes you want to see it again and again. This anime has changed me, too, by inspiring me to have an attitude like that of Koizumi or Otani - never give up and fight hard for what you want.  **OVERALL** 99.4/100 If you like any kind of romantic comedy, give this a shot. You'll know if you'll like it after the first episode. XD";Recommended
9;Lovely★Complex;Caleb_Marvell;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Caleb_Marvell;10;"""You idiot! Big or small, as long as you have a ☆☆☆☆ you're a man, right?!""  My initial thoughts when starting this series? ""What am I getting myself into..."" Those words were what ran through my head when I watched the first episode. It was ranked pretty high by the MAL Community, and I decided to give it a try. After the first episode, I couldn't help but press the next episode button... I mean, who wouldn't, right? Anyways, as I started watching the series, I hadn't noticed until around episode 17 that I had just spent 8 hours laughing my head off every episode. Strange, isn't it? We don't realize that we're doing something until we've been doing it for a long time or until someone points it out. What am I getting at here? Lovely☆Complex was probably the highlight of my month. I watched every episode in a matter of hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  For starters, when it comes to good quality storylines, Lovely☆Complex might cross people's minds. True, it may not sound like anything special, but truthfully it is. Usually when it comes to Shoujo animes, the storyline is based around 1 plot, and that would be getting the 2 protagonists together in the end of the series. What makes this unique is that the male protagonists are often taller then the female protagonists. In this case, it's the other way around... by about half a foot. Risa, codename ""Giraffe"", is a whopping 172 cm tall, and Otani, codename ""Midget"", is a mere 156 cm tall. It's abnormal for either of them to be that height, so when people are trying to make romance come out of that situation, it might seem impossible, especially since the two of them are fighting constantly. But overall, the story was really well played to my surprise. There was good comedy, romance, and an overall feel to the anime. I was very happy about that. It's not often where you come across a Shoujo that hasn't copied a story from another shoujo...  2007 isn't that long ago, and for an anime that's over 6 years old, it had a pretty decent art style. I liked how the characters were portrayed, however it seems like everyone in Lovely☆Complex was either really short, or really tall. I don't think there was an average height person in this show... strange, but had good quality overall. One thing I did have a problem though were those creepy-assed faces that mostly came from Risa. It ranged from a chipmunk, to a rabbit, to a god-knows-what. It's hard to like her when her face is so misshapen like that. I still laughed though, at least when I wasn't shielding my eyes.  Excellent cast for Lovely☆Complex. I really liked how they got the voice actress who played Nami in One Piece to voice Risa as well. She did really well in One Piece and transferred that profession into Risa. Then there was Otani. His voice was played by Akira Nagata. Haven't heard of him? Well neither had I until I looked up who voiced Otani. He's had 2 roles, one of them being Lovely☆Complex, so it shocked me to see him with a lack of roles. He voiced Otani so well that I was kind of sad, not being able to hear him again. As for all the other voice actors, they voiced their roles with professionalism and enthusiasm. I applaud that.  I could go on forever about who I liked best and why, but I'll keep the text to a minimum here. I liked Nobu the best, but I'll get to her later. For starters, Giraffe-- er, Risa was really funny, she was pretty when she wasn't cosplaying as a beaver, and she had an overall likable personality. Otani-- er, Midget-- wait, yeah, Otani seemed really dense, and when I mean dense, I mean REALLY dense. You could literally send him a note telling him ""I love you"" with your name signed at the bottom and he'd think it was a joke or for someone else. Either way, he too had some really funny moments to him. Haruka was the bane of my existence as an anime-lover. His constant obsession over Risa was almost intolerable. But either way, he seemed to have a crucial role in the story, so he was needed, to my dismay. Nobu, yaaaay! Risa's best friend. Probably the most affectionate girlfriend you could possibly have in all honesty. Truthfully I'd like to see someone get in the way of her and Nakao (Nobu's Boyfriend, and also one of the funniest characters in the show), and trust me, that person would die. Then there's Suzuki and Chiharu. I'm lumping them together because they're basically the same person, only 1 is male and the other is female. They're both really shy, but they are really nice as well. Last of all, Seiko. I'm not gonna give you a rundown of what makes Seiko a crucial character, but all I'm going to say is prepare to have your eyes burned out of your sockets and your brain blown up, along with constant laughter.  Enjoyment: 11/10. This is probably my favorite Shoujo out there today. I got my sister to watch it and she loves it as well, and she never watches any anime other than Angel Beats! and The World God Only Knows. She has a limited tendency to watch anime, but if I was able to get her to watch this, you should try it out for yourself as well. This anime had some great comedy, really good romance scenes, and an overall likableness to it. I urge you to watch it, and I really hope that those of you who have seen it can vouch for me in supporting me on how good this was.";Recommended
10;Lovely★Complex;Zanarkandian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zanarkandian;7;"True chemistry is something hard to find. Is it acceptable to dwell on things like..height difference and being comedy partners to ignore it?  I watched this show after a person with similar taste suggested it. The first impression I got was that it was going to be..a romance/comedy show, with the oxymoron of having the roles reversed, height-wise. Risa, our female lead, is really tall for a girl. This is often exaggerated, with her really slim members, to make her look like a giantess from time to time. Our guy, Otani, is good looking, a basketball star, but..he's really short for a guy. Can these two overcome these facts, and start to see each other as more than friends, even though they've been making others laugh forever, getting nicknamed as the All Hanshin Kyoujin comedy duo?  So, I expected this to be about the sweet heartache of having to wonder whether he/she likes you or not. Having to deal with rivals appearing. Trying to deny true chemistry. After a few episodes, I asked myself. Is Lovely Complex what I expected? Well, partly yes, but not exactly...Is this a bad thing? Well, not necessarily...  Personally, I found this show to have a higher comedy value than romance value. I've laughed through out this. I've been disappointed with several aspects of the romance though. It's all a matter of personal aesthetics, of course, but for me, this was too one sided a romance for far too long to move me.  I just don't like it when someone is taken for granted forever. Some might argue that this was realistic at first, you can't change your feelings and stop seeing someone as a friend in the blink of an eye. But if it drags on for too long, like it does here, you're just being spoiled. Beyond that, persistance can be admirable, and having to work for love is something that happens often, sure. It is because it happens often that I'm more interested in things that happen -naturally- . To me, something more rare is more special, more worthy of being told as a story. And then...Whatever happened to privacy, people?!  Sometimes, you have to give your friends a little push. But here..Everyone is butting in the whole time, I can't understand this. Even in moments that really should be private, it is presented as natural to have another four guys join. Then, it's more than just a light push; isn't it awkward, to have everyone forcing one onto the other, having to apologize for not wanting to be with someone, like you owe it to people? And then, what's with lecturing your rival about how she shouldn't give up on your boyfriend ?! Seriously now?  Yes, it is supposed to be funny. But the female lead gets ridiculed too much for me. Watching that second kiss hurts my eyes. Risa's been saying this ""I'm through with liking you"" a thousand times. But then again, who's been a teenager and hasn't done that? And their feelings do develop through out the series. Risa is the driving force; her actions and persistance lead, while Otani's reactions to them are the catalyst. These guys deserve each other, and they do look good together. The part with Risa going to that concert seriously annoyed me, but I guess it was the creator's idea of outgrowing the forementioned one sided phase. Oh, Nobu-chan is a star.  The graphics remind me of a lot of other shows. The characters are quite fashionable, changing attires often. The music was nothing special, but I rather liked the voice acting. I think it made the characters memorable, the All Hanshin Kyoujin duo with their ""Kimoi!"" 's, Nobu-chan with her ""dah-ling"", and uh..that giant going ""Moo"".  Lovely Complex has been quite funny, and it did have its cute moments. It's just my personal belief that a better balance between these two aspects is achievable.";Recommended
11;Lovely★Complex;flyingdolphin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/flyingdolphin;8;"Koizumi Risa. ‘Nuff said.  While she really is all the reason a person should need to go watch this show, I’ll explain what more makes this one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I’ve seen.  When I sat down to watch (more like marathon) Lovely Complex, I really wasn’t expecting anything special; the beginning of the show even had me a tad worried as I could see it easily going in a clichéd direction. Thankfully, I was wrong (well, for the most part).  After witnessing the explosive chemistry between Koizumi and Ootani, before there was even a flicker of romance between the two, any suspicion of them being cliché was blown clear out of the water. Now, I won’t say that their relationship developing further was unpredictable in itself- but that’s not really the point. It’s all about how the show brings these two together.  This is not your typical romance duo- anime or otherwise. Sure, the girl is taller than average and the guy is shorter, but those details take the backseat to these two’s eccentricities and meteoric charm. As lovable as they are, Koizumi and Ootani still have more to them than their comical quirkiness; both have insecurities and show vulnerability throughout the show’s progression. When things do get romantic, it’s always tender and believable.  Now, as much as I do love this series, I’d be lying if I said it was perfect.  The criticisms worth mentioning are few, but still they are enough to make me feel that this show could have been markedly better. Really, it’s just the matter of the side characters; even those that were there from the beginning don’t get nearly as much fleshing out as Koizumi and Ootani. Aside from Nobu (ultimately I felt she was a fairly solid character), everyone else comes off pretty flat. When the show does focus on them, the drama that takes place feels terribly contrived.  The side characters are where the worst of the clichés come in; childhood friend, foreigner, ex, neighbor girl, and coworker all essentially exist for the sole purpose of initiating jealousy/competition for the leading pair.  This show really shines where the focus has been all along- on Koizumi and Ootani. Enough time passes in the show that we get to see the two starting to figure out who they are and who they are to each other. With all the sensitivity and hilarity added on board to that roller coaster, Lovely Complex is a delight to watch.";Recommended
12;Lovely★Complex;YorouzoyaHouse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YorouzoyaHouse;9;"Looking at the ""Romance"" under genre must make you think something like ""...ah! Lemme guess. Another highschool RomCom"". But I will be there saying ""Yes. But no."" You see Lovely Complex IS a highschool RomCom but it is quite different from your usual usual RomCom. I will explain why as I go on.  The setting is the usual -- Highschool, one boy, one girl, they fall in love. But you will see the difference right away from episode one as the characters are introduced to you. See, unlike a normal love story where the guy is always taller than the girl, here, the roles are reversed. The girl is much taller than the boy. This unconventional match-up brings a new factor to the table --- the complexes that the characters experience because of their height. For example, a girlfriend taller than you might hurt your ""manly pride"" (Bullshit! I know) or tall girls aren't usually cute or it is awkward if you're trying to kiss your girl and you can't even reach her. These complexes do play a certain role as the love story progresses and are dealt with nicely which is good to watch.  So on their first day, Risa and Otani are branded as the ""All-Hanshin Kyoujin"" because they are always acting like a comedy duo, always fighting. They're always bickering and clawing at each other. At one time Risa even punches Otani in the face. They don't hold back to include the height difference in the name calling. All this goes on for a while until Risa realises that she has fallen for Otani. But Otani is really dense, he doesn't really see her that way and thinks its just part of their usual comedy routine. The chase from here on out is a nice ride.  Almost all the humour from the show comes from the two main characters as they call each other names while making weird faces. This makes this show overflowing with energy as the voice actors have done a great job with the timing. This is complimented by the art style as the faces those two make while fighting are pretty weird-looking but at the same time, hilarious. The soundtrack keeps up with the energy of the show and I liked the first opening sequence. Also, the energetic openings are complimented by the subtle endings. The show really made me laugh hard at times, so even if you don't like the romance, I am sure this will leave you laughing your ass off.  Unlike your usual boy meets girl, they both fall madly in love, there is a confession, the end ; its a nice chase here which doesn't end at the first confession as the girl gets rejected at first (it happens early on) but she doesn't give up till the end as there is little to no romantic response from the guy most of the time (he is THAT dense). Hell, the guy thought she was joking when she confessed the first time. This dense character of his really annoyed me at times and I wanted to punch him in the face. But all is forgotten when the story concludes itself as there isn't a sudden realisation of the love but it grows nice and slow.  All in all, this was a one of a kind love comedy show and I had a good time laughing my ass off at the comedy scenes all the while enjoying some cute moments as Risa tries to woo Otani. The show does not go deep into the ""feels"" side and I like that they kept it that way. It left its own little print in my heart. Enjoy!";Recommended
13;Lovely★Complex;VirtusSignum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VirtusSignum;10;"I very nearly dropped this anime after the first episode. The animation style threw me off, the characters and story didn't seem interesting and I didn't really like it. I decided to watch one more episode and if I didn't like it, I would move on to something else. Well I did watch that 1 episode after... and the one after that... and the one after that... and the one after that... until I had stayed up to 4 in the morning to get to episode 20. Yeah, boy how wrong was I.  The story centers around a girl who is 170 cm tall and a boy who is 156 cm tall. This dynamic is directly contrasting the typical formula where a man is taller than a woman. The ""lovely complex"" is the complex both of them have about their height, both tall and short. As Risa is taller than most of the boys, she considers herself unattractive and undesirable. This belief is reinforced when the guy she falls for happens to fall for her friend who is much shorter. Conversely, Otani falls for that same girl... but she doesn't see him as a potential romance because... and I quote... ""Otani is easy to talk to, its probably because he is the same height as me that I don't see him as a guy."" Ouch. So its clear where both of them get their issues from.  The thing about this anime that I was confused by, as much as I did end up liking it, was just how many times Risa went back and forth. ""I like him... now I'm giving up on him... now I like him again... now I'm giving up again... now I like him... now I'm giving up again... now I like him... now I'm giving up again... now I like him..."" Its like GEEZUS, make us your mind. That aside, it does lead to some pretty funny scenes.  Overall, this anime is spectacular and definitely worth a watch. It is hilarious and at times very moving. Nothing too deep here, no tragedy or huge depressing thing... I'm looking at you Clannad... >__> Its just a fun romantic comedy that manages to hit all its notes well with a cast of characters that while, mostly forgettable past the blonde girl, are still very likable.  Due to the lessons learned about not giving up on an anime and the amazing nature of this series. Virtus Signum gives this a 10/10. Watch it.";Recommended
14;Lovely★Complex;RepThe21st;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RepThe21st;7;"Disclaimer: Spoilers. Lots and lots of spoilers.  Lovely Complex Review:  The story centers around Atsushi Otani and Koizumi Risa, two classmates and good friends who are renowned around the school as 'All-Hanshin Kyojin"" (or something like that) due to their constant arguing and bantering, and their circle of friends. Risa is tall for her age, while Otani is rather short for his. The show follows their last two years of high school, and ends with their foray into the world beyond it.  The animation is well, nothing to write home about. It's not bad and I've definitely seen a lot worse, but it's not up to the quality of the likes of Toradora, Death Note, Naruto or other high end anime. It's good, but not amazing. As an aside, it rather reminded me of the early One Piece seasons.  One would think that is a bad thing, but it's really not. I think it works well with the style that lovecom goes for. Speaking of style, lovecom is distinctive for its animation, in that characters are often distorted/animated differently in ways regarding their emotions, conversations, etc for comedic effect. I'm not sure how to describe the technique, but all you need is to watch the first episode and you'll know what I mean. I think this style works well with the light show that is lovecom. However, others might not be of the same mind. If you see the first episode and don't like the style, then know that it doesn't change.  The show is rather light-hearted, in that there is no deeper source of conflict. No one dies, no one loses their house, no one's long lost thought-dead twin reappears to seek vengeance, or anything equally dramatic. The main plot for majority of the show revolved around Koizumi's attempts to win over Otani in a romantic way(more on this later). Some might not like this, but to me it's what made the show. It's a romcom, and it does have drama, but nothing eye-rolling like anime tends to do. All drama that pops up is resolved realistically and quickly. All those 'if only he/she got to tell him/her just this one thing' don't happen, because characters on this show do the realistic thing and talk about what's relevant.  As an extension of the above, what really made this show great to me was how smoothly things went. Not in the 'easy' way. I mean that the two protagonists felt like real people, and while anime behavior can't really be avoided, I was pleasantly surprised by how realistically everyone acted. Nothing felt forced. I could see everyone thinking and acting like that.  As for the characters, I liked Otani and Risa. They had real chemistry, and their (eventual) pairing did not feel forced. They had distinctive personalities, different yet similar in many ways and it is obvious how an attraction between them could (and did) develop.  On the other hand, the supporting cast was rather ... not quite bland. Forgettable? Not really given much development? Something along those lines.There is an argument to be made that shows some times take the supporting cast too far, but still, lovecom kind of fell flat there. It didn't bother me, since my interest lay firmly with Otani and Risa, but this could have been better.  Something that I put firmly on the 'Pros' side of the argument, is how the whole plot was handled. To expand on what I mentioned earlier, early on in the show Risa realizes that she has feelings for Atsushi (who is always referred to as Otani by everyone, me included), and for the middle part of it tries to win him over, while the last part is with them as a couple.  The show is interesting because the two of them had been good friends already, and Otani is caught completely off-guard by her feelings. It's classic drama, yes, but I loved how it was handled. Otani just did not see Risa that way. For the longest time he could not transition her from 'best friend' to 'girlfriend' in his mind. It avoided most (if not all) of the cliche drama pitfalls and kept drama to a minimum, while still keeping the situation like that. The show remains positive and uplifting, even when it seems that Risa's efforts are in vain. For the amount of episodes where it seemed like Otani really could not see her that way, I enjoyed it a lot. Otani tried, he gave it a lot of thought, etc but he just could not see her that way. That's something that I honestly haven't seen before. Eventually and over the course of a year and a half (or so) Otani does come around to loving her, but the transition is slow and very well handled.  Another good thing was that almost no episode felt filler-ish. The balance of slice-of-life shows is delicate, but lovecom nailed it. Each episode had its own charm, and none were of the 'unique arc that will have no further impact once complete' kind. Each led into the next, and the show progressed at a decent pace.  Having said that, there were some points in the story that just outright did not work. The whole thing with the substitute teacher (whatshisface) comes to mind. That was simply a disaster.  I guess the main negative is that while I enjoyed the show, there wasn't much impact to it. I mentioned previously that the lack of ridiculous drama was a positive. It is. Still, LoveCom never had me on the edge of my seat, never truly inspired strong emotion in me. Its realism, while refreshing, was a double edged sword. We watch the lives of two people over a period of two years, and by the end of it we are smiling, but there wasn't much that stuck out in such a way that I will remember it months/years from now.   tl;dr: LoveCom is a light-hearted, refreshingly realistic romcom with a distinctive style that will probably be hit or miss with most. Very entertaining show, but not groundbreaking. I rate it 7/10.    If you're a fan of slice-of-life and/or romcoms, watch Lovely Complex.";Recommended
15;Lovely★Complex;henkuku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/henkuku;10;"“If you’re going to say something that nice to me, I don’t mind even if we break up a hundred times.”  That was just an instance in the series which goes to show just how much love there is rooted into it. This has been, in my opinion, the best shoujo series I’ve ever watched and I’m sure most people who have would hesitate to disagree (hopefully!).  [STORY: 8/10] It is a pretty relatable issue in the real world which has been introduced as the initial driver of this series. There are many factors which can contribute to feelings of love and to some, height is definitely one of them. I mean, no short dude would want to be with a tall girl, would he? Well, this series breaks the duck in trying to bring such a couple closer together. Obviously it’s always going to be hard, but did they succeed in the end? WATCH to find out! :D  [ART: 7/10] Well, considering this series aired in 2007 and here I am watching it at the end of 2013, I did not let this bother me that much. The series is so good that you can afford to forgo this bit, I assure you. Besides, it isn’t that bad to be fair, the girls looked pretty good and the guys were… well, standard I guess…  [CHARACTER: 9/10] Superb character development done for the female protagonist, as expected of any shoujo franchise. Through the three years of high school illustrated within this 24-episode series, we get to see how the characters grow as they learn to overcome hurdles in relationships as well as acknowledging their own feelings. Another pointer to touch on would be the supporting characters. The supporting characters in this series were really well made and thought of to integrate into the plot itself. Unlike certain series where supporting characters are created merely for the sake of doing so, they actually played vital roles in this series and I can’t think of any support which had no meaningful purpose.  [ENJOYMENT: 9/10] I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this series throughout. A very good mix of romance and comedy, which is integral for creating an ideal RomCom. For all those facing relationship problems or are having issues regarding love, this series would provide some respite for you and maybe even inspire you to do things you’ve not done before. I’ve experienced it and I approve of this message! (;  [OVERALL: 10/10] Normally I would give this a 9, but because it’s SO good, I think it absolutely deserves to be overrated one more level. For those who haven’t watched it yet, I recommend that you start now and be immersed into the lovely romantic world of Lovely Complex! A must-watch for any shoujo fan!";Recommended
16;Lovely★Complex;amandasparkles;https://myanimelist.net/profile/amandasparkles;10;"""Similar to ToraDora! - Lovely Complex"" That's how i found out about Lovely Complex. I fell in love with ToraDora! (TD) right on the first episode, and i am still planning on re-watching it. Hearing a lot of good thing and the compatibility of these two anime, i decided to watch Lovely Complex (LC) . I can honestly say that TD and LC have similarities and both are very enjoyable.  The female protagonist (Risa) and the male protagonist (Otani) don't hate each other, they just find each other irritating since the whole school call them the comedy duo, and their height difference is just an extra thing for other students to laugh at. Guess which one of them is 172 cm tall and which is 156 cm ? 99% got it wrong. What happens when Risa falls in love with Otani, a stupid guy who is too dense to realize it ?  My ratings of LC are as below,  STORY - 10  I have been on serious anime trips and i needed to watch something light but heartwarming and funny. Call it cheesy young romance or typical high school life , but to me, LC is very unique in its own kind of way. I was hooked right on the first episode. The story line was not once boring and i was very entertained. I laughed way too hard so many times, i lost count. The jokes, the humor, the comedy, whatever you call it, they keep playing in my head even when i have moved on to the next scene, i ended up pausing the episode just to laugh all over again. You might think that it's just like other high school based anime and you might be right, but LC has its own charm and attraction  ART - 10  Did i really just give it a 10 ? even though it was released in 2007 and the quality isn't as good as others ? Yes, i just did. I give it a 10 because the art is one the reasons why Love Complex is very entertaining. The face the characters make when they're making jokes, mad, shocked and feeling gloomy, they look almost inhuman. If i get a dollar every time i chuckled just by looking at their faces, i'd be really rich by now. The art isn't flawless and that's what i love about it, it makes delivering the comedy more effective.  SOUND - 10  The voice actors ? Perfect. Nothing i can complain about.  CHARACTERS - 10  I'm in love with the characters, especially Risa, Otani, Haruka and Nobu. Risa and Otani are both stubborn, love to annoy each other, but Risa is more open about her feelings while Otani is more dense and shy to wear his heart on his sleeves, and together, they're indeed the comedy duo. Haruka is a cool guy in other girls' eyes but he gets weak when it comes to Risa. He felt irritated every time Risa and Otani hang out together and his reactions are always priceless. Nobu is a tough girl who always motivates Risa to confess to Otani, and she becomes Risa's love sensei.  ENJOYMENT - 10  After all the positive reviews, i couldn't possibly give it an 8. I have a stupid smile on my face every time i watch an episode, and there were times i laughed way too hard i can't make a sound, i ended up clapping like a sea lion. i do enjoy Lovely Complex as much as i enjoy ToraDora!, the similarities are there, the only thing is, ToraDora! is more depressing but of course, in a beautiful way.  I couldn't say this is everyone's cup of tea, but would i recommend others to watch Lovely Complex ? DEFINITELY.";Recommended
17;Lovely★Complex;blurryeyes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/blurryeyes;10;I have to begin with saying that Lovely Complex is my favourite anime of all time EVER, but I'll try my best to make this a 'fair' review and not too biased.  First off, the characters - probably my favourite part about this anime. The two main characters both have 'height complexes' - the guy is way too short and the girl is way too tall. They're both very self conscious about this, causing them to always fight with each other but in a friendly kind of way. Risa then realises she is in love with Otani, and the anime basically revolves around her trying her best to get him to recognise her feelings. But it's not that simple. Otani, is completely and utterly oblivious to Risa's feelings even if she comes out and says it bluntly.  Risa is a great character - she's hilarious, stubborn, always throwing tantrums and getting angry at Otani because he is so dumb. But she's also really cheerful and talkative, and her and Otani get on really well as friends because they share the same interests e.g in music.  Otani is also a fantastic character - he's also funny, arrogant (he always acts like he's really cool when everyone disagrees), defensive of his height, he gets embarrased easily but this is just him on the surface. Underneath this, he's really really sweet and a genuine, caring person - and I think I like him so much because he reminds me of myself (???)  This anime is seriously so funny, I've rewatched it many times and from the first episode it has you laughing and smiling and you never want to stop watching.  The chemistry between the two main characters is really, really interesting for me. They hate eachother one second then the next second they're best friends. And when they finally get together (not really a spoiler, you knew it was coming) they're such a cute couple in their own way!  To just add on - some people don't like the art, and I can see why, because at times its not amazing, but I find the characters are cute and I actually love the soft, natural colours used. The facial expressions are so over the top making them hilarious. The opening and ending songs are catchy and I loved them, having said, they're nothing special to be honest - but the lyrics relate to the anime so it's cute.  I seriously doubt you'll find an anime like this one - the characters, the story, the jokes, the romance, the EVERYTHING is unique and just great. I enjoyed every second of it. If you're looking for an anime like this - look no further! You have to watch this one!;Recommended

19;Lovely★Complex;burntlettuce;https://myanimelist.net/profile/burntlettuce;9;Lovely Complex is about a girl(Risa) whose height is above average and a boy(Otani) whose height is below average. These two have always been friends and are often mistaken as a comedy duo. That is until one day Risa start's to look at Otani in a different eye.  It's story sounds very simply, which it is. However it is executed extremely well. The height difference is handled with care and is never made really awkward. The story itself is a romantic comedy and it holds up to it's name. This has to be one of the funniest anime's I have seen. From the bickering between Otani and Risa to the amazing sarcastic nature of the their friends. I have never laughed so hard at something before in my life. Comedy however isn't the only thing that this anime brings to the table. No it brings some very well done drama into the mix. There will be several moments that will have you reaching for the tissue boxes.  Lovely Complex's characters make the series. Koizumi Risa is someone you can't help but love and cheer for her throughout the series as she try's to get her love across. Her perseverance throughout the series is truly inspiring, she overcomes many obstacles and no matter what she always keep's pushing forward. We can't forget our main male lead Otani Atsushi. Otani come's off as incredibly stupid, and I mean incredibly stupid. But he isn't in the least bit, he is just really innocent. He is just your average high school boy who has yet to realize his feelings and thus causes him to act the way he does. The series is more of Otani trying to find himself, and while it is a long bumpy road it is definitely worth the wait.  Lovely Complex's art isn't something extraordinary or ground breaking. The character designs are really well done and there is a lot of attention to detail in the environment. But the main success of it's art is just that it is easy to look at. You have a lot of great color's that come out and support the characters well. Nothing new, but it's done well.  The sound track in Lovely Complex is simply amazing. It's songs like the art isn't something really new or anything along those line's. But it just highlights the scene's and adds so much more emotion to the each and every single detail. I honestly don't believe I would've enjoyed this series as much as I did without the soundtrack.  Overall Lovely Complex is a great anime. It's a prefect balance of Comedy and Drama, it will have you falling out of your seat laughing while at the same time jerking at your heart strings. Lovely Complex may have some faults throughout the series, but they do not stop this series from being truly enjoyable.  And i thank you for reading my first review. I am sorry that you had to struggle with my awful grammatical errors. If you notice any mistakes or ways i can improve please send me a message and again thank you.;Recommended
0;Lovely★Complex;TokyoSanchez;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TokyoSanchez;5;"Can't wait for the hate for this one.  At the start of watching Lovely Complex, I was certain that I was going to love this show, being a fan of shoujo romance. I can't say that I dislike it, but rather I was heavily dissapointed by it.  Throughout the first half, I really enjoyed what it brought to the table. The start was a little rough, but it was a nice twist to an unoriginal genre (I say this way too much with romance anime, but so be it). Otani and Risa are a pairing that are so much fun to watch. The back and forth between them was well handled early on. Not only that, but it did extremely well with the themes of unrequited love and beauty is only skin deep.  The thing is, as the anime trotted along, I realized that this was the ONLY thing it did. It kept beating the theme of unrequited love so much that it lost a lot of it's impact. There wasn't a lot of anything else that the characters talked about other than Otani and Risa's relationship until the very end of the series. The saying goes that variety is the spice of life, and the lack of this in Lovely Complex grated on my patience.  This also bears a problem when talking about side characters. The four best friends of Otani and Risa (aside from Nobu who I will get to in a minute) have barely anything to them. They are left sidelined till the last couple episodes, just so the anime could say that they developed them. Hell, the one defining character trait of Chiharu established in episode one, which was she feared men, was not brought back up until episode the second to last episode.  Nobu is the only other character besides the main leads that gets much screen-time at all. All her character is is her yelling at either Otani or Risa to either do something about their relationship, or yelling at them because they did something wrong. I didn't dislike her character, but I just felt I should mention how one note she felt for the majority of the series.  As for the rest of the side characters, most of them are just plot devices to cause tension between Otani and Risa.  Otani and Risa themselves, while frustrating at times, were the best part of the series. Risa is a girl who tries very hard to achieve her goals. Even though she cries a lot, which did get annoying sometimes, it was hard not to get behind her whenever she fails or succeeds. I also liked how Otani dealt with the whole unrequited love thing. I won't spoil it, but he handled it in a way that was frustrating but very believable, which I appreciated a great deal. They aren't the best couple I've seen, as they suffered a lot from the lack of buildup of their relationship due to the stretched out nature of the middle section of the show, but they were an extremely fun couple, for the most part.  The art and animation was not fantastic. While I liked the colour palette they used, and the character designs were well done, and my god the facial expressions were amazing, but it still felt a little flat to me. The animation was stiff as well.  The soundtrack was extremely memorable. Normally romance soundtracks don't have much of an impact on me, but there were a few songs in this one that were fantastically put together. Some stand outs would be World's End, Risa, DUNK SHOOT, Deep Past, and Theme of LoveCom. Complex is also noteworthy, but only because the first 18 seconds are more or less a complete copy of the chorus of The Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"". Seriously, go listen to them both.  The voice acting is also memorable in how everyone has a kansai dialect. The voices of Risa and Otani are very good as far as I'm concerned. There were technically some bad voice actors here and there, Chiharu and Suzuki for example, but there voices were so different that I loved their voices regardless.  Lovely Complex is a show that seems to focus on very specific things, which ended up hurting many other aspects of the show that could of been interesting. And while yes, these things that were so heavily focused on were well done, I was spoon fed so much of the same thing that it left me grasping for something else. It doesn't help when all your characters talk about is Otani and Risa's love life, and basically nothing else until the very end of the series, and that the drama felt very forced, especially towards the end. That being said, the end did leave off on strong note, with everything wrapping up very nicely, even if the drama was forced. Overall, Lovely Complex was a fun show to watch, with some great cutesy moments and comedy moments, but it isn't a show I would highly recommend. Of course, I think I'm in the minority here, so if you watch it and end up loving it, more power to you.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lovely★Complex;PuruRuru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PuruRuru;6;"Lovely complex is mainly a romantic drama that takes itself quite seriously. The setting is that of a high school in which the main characters have to deal with typical adolescent issues mostly related to love: understanding and accepting their feelings and others', dealing with peer pressure, expressing their emotions, and becoming committed to their relationships. The comedic element is a second-class citizen, a natural byproduct of high schoolers not knowing how to express their feelings and how to react in more delicate situations.  The seriousness is pervasive from the first moment thanks to the character designs - high schoolers DO look like actual high schoolers: there's no oversexualization and no pink hair. I have to give big props to making characters truly look different without relying just on hairstyles and eye color. The backgrounds have just enough detail, generally using colors with mid to low saturation--what you'd call ""soft"" or “toned-down” colors. There are very few lighting effects and the shading is very sublte making it so that there’s nothing to distract from the characters' feelings and thoughts. Characters are slightly stylized and this makes for a great looking anime when it comes to the few fluid movements that get animated. It’s a sad fact that the animation is rather clunky. The design however is refreshing compared to what I consider the overly-colorful (saturated), overly-detailed design used nowadays, Your Lie in April being an example of this. Detailed backgrounds with bright color palettes such as in shows like 5cm/sec or Garden of Words would be other examples so this trend is no news, it’s just more frequent now.  Its main problems come as a consequence of misusing characters. They’re good in the sense that you can’t just box them inside an archetype, they’re all realistic and complex, but aside from the two main characters none get actually explored. Although it’s somewhat at the cost of the side characters, it’s good that much of the exploration of the protagonists, Risa and Otani, is done through friends and teachers helping them fix their issues. It’s a common romance anime mistake to shoehorn in explanations through exaggerated reactions, obtrusive self-talk or over-the-top visuals or story. Another issue is that for part of the duration Otani is so dense that he manages to keep the plot looping and breaks any suspension of disbelief.  A nice plus that probably doesn't get noticed that much is the soundtrack. It's never in the foreground with its rather low volume and the more ambiental style, but one can tell many of the 35 tracks were specially created for dramatic timing of specific scenes. Very fitting, but not particularly memorable.  Most of the issues I have with LoveCom are related to the plot. The anime is slow to start, as we find Risa being rejected time and time again. Couple that with the fact that it will skip from Valentines to Christmas, New Year and Birthdays and you’ll end up thinking each day is a holiday in which Risa is living the same nightmare. There are cases when repetition can be used as a trope, but in this case it will only make you care less and less, or simply get frustrated. If you look at it from a troll’s perspective it’s almost funny, but the anime presents it from the victim’s perspective. If you bear through that you’ll get to the best part. That’s simlpy because it reaches great variety and a good pacing. In fact it goes through almost anything that can happen in a normal relationship. However, when the focus suddenly switches to the side characters everything feels off. They were forgotten for too long . Adding to that comes the fact that their arcs are poorly dealt with: rushed and with awkward transitions. All this is on the background of college exams and choosing their path in life which manage to keep tension up so the anime ending gets to save face with a cathartic ending about the main characters and their life choices.  There’s also some storytelling issues such as the overuse of flashbacks in order to explain some of Risa’s emotions. Most of the times the respective feelings are obvious anyway so the flashabacks duration becomes even more of a problem. Luckily they aren’t used that often.  It’s worth it to mention what type of comedy LoveCom has. The jokes come as a byproduct of the characters’ silly but believeabale personalities or in the form of a funny plot twist having a well timed comedic setup. This secondary role comedy gets makes it that if it doesn’t hit the spot for you it won’t take anything away from the value of the show.  In the end you’re left with a fine anime that repeats the same note before remembering the rest of the song. It’s not a beautifully complex song but it’s catchy and simple and it might just be that one song that makes you understand romance a bit better or at least reminds you of your funny teenage love experiences.";Mixed Feelings
2;Lovely★Complex;ndsempai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ndsempai;6;"I usually do not write many reviews but felt the need to pen my thoughts on this anime. Lovely complex deals with the relationship between the tallest girl and the shortest guy in the class. The two are perfect for each other and everyone know it except the two main characters.  The good: - The characters themselves, both Koizumi and Otani are pretty good and avoid the conventions found in other romcom animes. The chemistry is clearly present between them. - The humour is pretty good. - The story for the most part avoids classic cliches and annoying ""what did he/she mean when he/she said this"" found in other animes. That said this is still present to a small degree. - The animation is kinda old school. Reminded me of some old 90 animes.  The bad: - For an anime with complex in the title, it spends about 2 episodes dealing with said complex and then forgets about it altogether. - The supporting cast are essentially one dimensional cut-outs with noone being particularly memorable. We have a silent guy 1, silent, gentle, caring guy 2, bossy girl and a silent girl. None of them get any character development. Some semblance of a story is cobbled together towards the last two episodes but for the most part they are nothing more than comic relief. - Multiple triangle love situations are teased but nothing ever happens. New characters are introduced 20 episodes in as potential love interests and it feel shoehorned. - One big issue I have is with its length. Nothing really happens between episodes 7-17 and we see the same thing get repeated over and over again. While funny at first, get very annoying after a couple of episodes and characters never move on.  Overall rate it 6/10. Would have given it more if the anime was of a shorter length or if some of the side characters were developed better.";Mixed Feelings
3;Lovely★Complex;brynolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brynolf;5;"Overall I must say I really fell in love with this show during the very first episode. Sadly, it didn't last. The first few episodes are great and promising, but pretty soon the story gets stuck and never really gets anywhere.  This show is very reminiscent of ToraDora and School rumble, but where the former is cousy and heartwarming and the latter is darn funny, ""Lovely complex"" turned out to be neither, but just a tedious waste of time.  Animation I really love this art style, all the characters are wonderfully designed with a pretty non-standard-anime look, and there are plenty of hilarious facial expressions.  Too bad the animators failed big time with making the characters move and interact with their surroundings. The animation is is stiff and generally bad.  Still, a high score for marvellous character design.  Edit: The drawing style reminds me a lot of the ""Power!!"" manga, btw. Could be made by the same people, I don't know.  Sound OP/ED suck (plus, the animations during the songs are mostly just cut-and-paste from the epidodes). Voice acting is not great but not bad either. I guess the bad animation adds to the feeling of akwardly performed voices.  Story Like School rumble (and most other high school romantics) the story consist entirelly of nervous hesitating people trying to confess their love for each other. It gets really tedious, and the story could have been compressed into 12 episodes at most. As it is, most of the episodes are fillers and everything is generally very slow paced.  Another reason for the yawn-factor is that the series focuses on only two people and their love story. If the side characters had gotten more screen time and interesting subplots this could have worked.  Character Most of the characters are likeable and nice, but the only ones that really get any attention are Risa and Otani. Despite their 26 episodes of screen time, they hardly manage to develop at all. Neither do the supporting characters (well, in the last few episodes they actually get to show some interesting sides of themselves), and they are mostly there as a background.";Mixed Feelings
4;Lovely★Complex;Defias76;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Defias76;6;"First off let me say that I enjoy watching romantic anime, I've watched quite a few, including some of the highly rated ones and according to the score here on MAL, this show should be among them.  I believe most of the good things about Lovely Complex were already said in other reviews, I'll just share what I didn't like about it.  1. The two main characters get annoying real fast. Seriously, the heroine (Koizumi) cries literally every or every other episode, usually for no reason (period?) and her Japanese voice over (squeaky, high-pitched) started getting on my nerves within a couple episodes. I didn't have that big of a problem with to-be boyfriend Ootani's voice actor, besides that super fake laugh (almost robotic ""hahahah"").  2. Very slow story progress. This is a problem with most romantic anime(s), since there's just not enough ""content"" when it comes to love between (only) two people. Ever since you start watching the show, you know they get together sooner or later, what matters is the path towards their relationship, rather than the actual result. Now that would be completely fine, if so many romantic shows didn't have this many filler episodes. Every single time it almost seems like the pair might become a couple, some ""coincidence"" happens and all the progress characters made gets scratched. She tells him she loves him? Nope, he isn't paying attention at the moment or he's too dense to realize. He kisses her? Nope, that's just a misunderstanding. He tells her he feels the same way about her as she does about him? Nope, she falls asleep. The only result of that is the show acting like nothing happened and all that indicates any progress in the story are flashbacks and pointless monologues or thought processes that only act as another filler and have no meaning whatsoever. The solution? If the show is as straightforward as this one - only one possible love interest, no major plot twist, etc. - then there's no point at making it to 24 episodes (or even more). 12-13 eps would be more than enough.  Half of the show is about Koizumi trying to figure out her feelings / trying to figure out Ootani's feelings / trying to date Ootani / crying about everything / about Ootani being dense and playing hard-to-get even though it's obvious he likes her, and so on.  3. It's really nothing special. ""Complex"" because their heights are different, I get it. Is that enough to make the story interesting to me? No. What makes the show interesting are the characters and I really did like them at first, but as I said, 24 episodes is way too many and I got tired of them. The last couple episodes were pretty entertaining (18-24) and so was the beginning (before Koizumi sharing her feelings), but the empty spot in between 10th-ish and 18th episode was super boring, sadly.  All that being said, it's still somewhat decent anime with a couple of funny moments and ""feels"" moments, definitely not a 8-9/10, but a solid 6,5 for sure.";Mixed Feelings
5;Lovely★Complex;lisa_cap0b;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lisa_cap0b;6;I had high hopes since I'd heard that Lovely Complex was a classic, but I was mostly disappointed. The idea is cute and unique, but the characters act in such immature and unrealistic ways that it falls flat. The pacing is strange, where time passes extremely quickly but the romance progresses at a snail's pace. I found myself thinking that they both deserved better multiple times, which didn't really lead me to cheer for the couple. It also wraps up in a weirdly unsatisfying way that doesn't take into account the complications of the characters' futures. The art was boring and childish (some of the panels were very janky) and the soundtrack didn't stick out to me. On the bright side, the dynamic between the leads is very entertaining, the friend group is healthy and wholesome, and a lot of the elements of the pair's relationship (even beyond the height difference) are quite uncommon and refreshing. I had a few good laughs, but this show definitely lands at the bottom of my romcom tier list.;Mixed Feelings
6;Lovely★Complex;sopw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sopw;6;THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS  I think this anime really depends on what kind of story you enjoy. You watch the 2 main characters fall in love from beginning to end, every step of it. Lovely complex does a fairly good job of portraying relationships realistically, there are a lot of hardships and conflicts that the 2 have to endure, but also a lot that they bond over. I would say I enjoyed watching it, but it wouldn't be much of a recommendation for me. Some of the things that happen or things that characters do can be downright infuriating, even though it adds to the build-up for the really great moments. The good moments were amazing and great to watch, but I definitely think it depends on what you personally enjoy to watch.  The facial expressions seemed rather strange at first but became quite funny later on. I wasn't a fan of the art style but got more accustomed to it, and I didn't quite like the voice acting but it was very fitting. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece by any standards, but I wouldn't say it was a bad anime.;Mixed Feelings
7;Lovely★Complex;Ridlea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ridlea;6;Okay, I am going to start this review off with saying no one can be that oblivious/dumb. I mean come on! I have to say this anime was very mediocre and is focused on absolute oblivion/ignorance.  The characters are good but after a while loses their charm due to frustration. Yes, it is sweet but I have never seen a boy act so dumb to love before. The story literally relies on ignorance and that isn't a strong enough subject to base a whole story on.  The ending is good but after watching all that happens the leads up to the end you sort of feel like.....well this could of been done and sorted in like episode 5.  HOWEVER with all that being said if you are into romance then give it a watch. Personally wasn't my cup of tea.;Mixed Feelings
8;Lovely★Complex;julteon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/julteon;7;"(SPOILER FREE REVIEW) Lovely Complex. I read the manga in less than 4 days. I was hooked, obsessed, I loved the style and the characters. I loved how goofy and real it was. When you're in high school, you're a loud mess and your feelings are all over the place. This anime was able to capture the vibe, but I think it failed in terms of pacing and how they decided to cut stuff out. If you don't read the manga, you're missing on a bunch of development from the main and side characters, funny stories and details you don't see here.  Still, you have to keep in mind that this is a GOOD portrayal of how high school years feel like - at least, in my experience. Everything is SO important: except studying. Your friends and your crush are everything you need. You have no money, except the little cash you recieve from your grandparents. You're clumsy, loud, and everything feels like it has sparkles. I used to be a tall girl -literally 173, a cm taller than Koizumi-, so I relate to Risa in ways that I can't even explain properly, -being dumb as shit, a crybaby, not femenine enough, liking way shorter guys- so I guess that if you're like me, you'll appreciate this.  I liked this adaptation, and as an anime itself it's a classic. Still, as I said, the pacing of the first half is so slow and repetitive than most watchers will be dropping it if they're not patient enough. I'm here to say: keep watching. And then read the manga lmao.  Enjoyment wise, I feel like it's an 8; I was laughing out loud and feeling the cringe on my own skin, and I already knew what was going to happen! This story has this power over you, but, as much as it saddens me, it could be way better, so that's why it's a 7.  So, as my final thoughts, I have to give props to the voice actors for doing such a great job with the characters' personalities, the animators for capturing the energy and goofiness of the manga, and also the OST for having such bangers as openings. This piece of work made me believe in romcoms again, and for that, it'll always be a safe place. <3";Mixed Feelings
9;Lovely★Complex;LuenVeas;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LuenVeas;5;"You won't believe how disappointed I am in Lovely Complex that currently sits just above an average of 8.0, which is just mindblowing to me. Normally I more or less agree with the average, but this was totally underwhelming. Spoilers ahead!  Story: Starts off fine with the classic ""the main characters want to date other people at first and try to help each other"" trope and unlike everything else in the show, that doesn't get dragged out for long. Then Koizumi realises her feelings for Ootani and then it all goes downhill. First, it takes her quite a while to work up the courage to confess, fine that is normal for the romance genre.  It gets real bad with the fact that for a good 3-4 episodes AFTER her direct and unequivocal confession Ootani is too dumb to realise she meant him.  Then once he realises it, he takes another 4-5 episodes to realise he's got feelings for her and all the while being a giant douchebag by stalling Koizumi and preventing her from moving on  The actual relationship part was decent, it's just that the way to get there made me dislike the show.  Characters: As I said before, I hated Ootani's guts by the time he's about to confess to Koizumi. The side characters are extremely disappointing, many of them outright disappear for large chunks of the show and have one episode of plot relevance each, coming out of nowhere. That Kohori kid coming out of nowhere is the worst example of this and Risa basically going on a date with him the minute her boyfriend, that she has worked so hard to get, hasn't got that much time for her for once, made me dislike her as well.  The show ends with Risa talking about all the good memories everybody made during their high school time and I'm left dumbfounded. She spent most of her time in high school chasing the love of somebody who couldn't give her a clear yes or no answer.  The only positive surprise of this show was how well it handled a trans person back in 2007, not perfect but pretty well.";Mixed Feelings
10;Lovely★Complex;Fran;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fran;6;"I've decided I'm gonna start writing a review for every show I finish, so this is a first in hopefully a long list.  Lovely Complex is a pretty straight forward shoujo. Its goal is basic, showcase a compelling romance, and it somewhat succeeds at this. The gimmick in this one is that the girl is taller than the guy, not only that but they're both below and above average height, from which they develop a complex from. Fortunately this gets resolved pretty early in the show as it's pretty clear what any normal person would think: it doesn't matter.  The first thing that stood out to me was the way they talked. Apprently the author is from Osaka and they speak this weird dialect. It doesn't affect the story much but it's almost funny to hear dramatic moments being spoken like that if you're too used to ""normal"" Japanese. Fun fact only the VA for Otani is from Osaka, so kudos to the other VAs for having to learn a different of speaking.  The show was really promising with it's pace at first (except on episode 1 that's way too fast), with a solid confession in episode 5. This led me to believe that we'd be able to see more of Risa and Otani as a couple and how they deal with that, unfortunately she gets flat out rejected and then we get into the most annoying part of the show.  Risa is basically a saint. Despite being rejected and being talked down multiple times during the show she never gives up in persue of her loved one, because not taking ""no"" as an answer totally doesn't sound creepy in any other context. She really doesn't have much going on besides being in love with Otani and being tall. The show portrays her as a fun person to be around but that isn't a personality. It doesn't bother giving her any sort of goals until almost the very end.  Otani is a dick most of the time. Whether out of embarassment or not he really says and does some really hurtful things towards Risa, something I found extremely annoying. Even if he can't be true to himself or he doesn't actually believe any of that, it's something that really bugged me. Which is unfortunate considering that he's the only character with any sort of goals, it being basketball. As a sidenote, I think it would've been interesting to explore more of how basketball impacts his life, besides the ""he plays basketball and is short lol"". You could've easily made up some sort of backstory of how he was bullied for his height and decided to pick a sport that rewards height to prove people wrong. But that didn't happen.  That's one of my main gripes with the show, it doesn't make a good attempt to portray its characters as other than the instruments for their romance. Now to be fare no one is the most intersting when they're in highschool. I mean I had nothing going on back then, but it would be nice to at least have something.  The other four supporting characters from their friend group aren't super worth noting, except Nobu she's absolutelly best girl, almost being the representative of the audience in calling out the main characters' bullshit. I specially liked the semi-dramatic episode each couple had at the end, specially the one between Nobu and Takao, but it would've been nice to have more of those earlier, so that the ones at the end don't just feel like the author remembering they have to do something with those characters.  I'll now break down the characters that actually have an impact in the main couple, as in being other potential love interests. One thing that all have in common and that I greatly appreciate is that nobody had a chance in breaking them. This may sound like a bad thing but given the fact that it's obvious who's gonna end up with who, I'd rather not see a dramatic arc that I already know the conclusion of.  First is Haruka, Risa's childhood friend. He is presented as a big thread to Otani but is downgraded to ""that one guy that appears in some jokes"" character. He didn't have anything going for him besides admiring Risa so I don't have a problem with this. Same with Otani's ex girlfriend. She was treated more like an actual thread, but then again she wasn't presented in any intersting way.  Seiko is probably the most interesting one, because it's the only one that goes through some sort of character development (that isn't a main character). Of course it gets less points for being the cliché trap guy, but I enjoyed watching his development nonetheless. Even if the conclusion is again not that farfetched: it doesn't matter.  Maity is also a well presented one, but it also represents my main problem with the show. He's the only real adult in the show and it shows in the way he acts. He's presented as Mr. steal yo girl but as we eventually find out he just wants our main characters to be together. When you look back you realize he never showed romantic interst for Risa (because it would be very fucking illegal), but rather he makes it seem like that's the case to make Otani jealous and admit his feelings towards Risa.  And that segways into my main problem: the relation feels unbalanced. Risa is pretty much the only one doing the work, and Otani is treated like a goal more than a person who has to come to term with his feelings. It really doesn't seem like Otani likes her much. I mean it took him two potential love interests to finally get his shit together.  I absolutelly hated the parts from the first confession to when they finally get together. It's fine and even intersting to not have the characters get together right away and make some drama where they question their feelings. What's not fine is have half the show be this dinamic of ""Risa gives up, Otani says or does something slightly nice, Risa requestions the whole situation, she realizes that she still loves him no matter what and decides to keep trying, Otani says some cunt shit, Risa cries and decides shes gonna give up"" on a loop. It killed all the good will I had towards the characters. When you realize this went on for like a year you have to wonder much of a good person or a masochist Risa is to put up with Otani's stupid shit. What's worse except from that part where they meet Umibozu and Risa learns from his wife that love is unpredictable and that no one really has a clue of what they're doing, none of the two learn anything about themselves or about the emotions they're experiencing, they're just going through the motions to deliver some drama.  After they finally became a well stablished couple the show delivered on some great moments, like the stadium scene and the whole arc about the characters going through graduation and what they wanna do after highschool. However that wasn't without its flaws. Like the introduction of two new characters, Otani's neighbour and Risa's coworker.  It's painfullyobvious that neighbour-chan was written to be a ""what would've happened if Risa gave up because of her height"". She is not particularly likeable nor presents any sort of thread to be considered important at all. Her only real impact in the story was linking Risa to the fashion world.  Risa's coworker is the most halfassed attempt at creating fake drama I've ever seen. The first things that we know about he guy is that he's short and that he's an Umibozu fan, sounds familiar right? The second thing we know is that he's a fucking sexual harasser. Did they really try to pass the scene of him tryng to kiss Risa as romantic or dramatic? Either way she then proceeds to go out with him even though a) he just harassed her b) his intentions are painfully obvious. Of course Otani sees this and breaks up with her in an instant because because that's what you do apparently. The ""breakup"" in particular felt extremely wrong because even if Otani is in the right to be mad him breaking up with her in an instant feels like a low blow after all Risa has done. Risa is tring to climb a rope Otani is holding. This only puts in the spotlight how unbalanced the relationship is. Now to be fair this gets resolved rather quickly and in a really cute way, but still the damage is already done.  The conclusion felt rather satisfying. Them sharing a moment due to Otani's exams feels like a genuine couple experience for once. Also the last scene with the graduation was hilarious.  Now I'll say that I overall enjoyed the show, it had enough to keep me wanting to watch it. The jokes are funny and even though the animation isn't stellar the way they portrayed them with the deformed faces and whatnot was really good. The main problem is with the romance itself, which critically damages the overall quality since that's the point of all this. The show set out to tell a compelling romance story and failed in my opinion. It was surrounded by great things all around but it failing at a fundamental level is what brings it down.";Mixed Feelings
11;Lovely★Complex;moe_sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/moe_sama;5;"Lovely Complex is one of the most frustrating series I've watched to date. SPOILER WARNING here because I want to bitch about this one. (mostly in the character portion)  It's a love story about two characters which are similar in personality that struggle with the idea that the person they are falling in love with doesn't match what they originally believed to be their ideal partner. Or it would be but it doesn't get the message across well.   Story 4/10:  The story for Lovely Complex had the potential to be good. It had so much potential in the first arc and I really enjoyed that as one character realized their feelings it became about finding the right way to get that through to the other character. There are moments that are set up in a touching way and it seems that all obstacles are about to be pushed to the side and we can see what happens after this point. That didn't happen. This nice pace is quickly dropped and instead the arc was repeated again, same settings, same major holidays and events, same plot points, slightly different outcomes. It was extremely frustrating to have to sit through a repeat of an arc I just finished because the writers decided to take this approach. The third arc seems like it should end after a certain episode and have the series tie together but there are more episodes after this happens and another small arc, most parts which feel like filler. I just wanted it to end at this point. Your hand is held the entire time you watch this story, not only is an arc repeated twice just so you understand this MC really wants that MC, but you are shown flashbacks constantly. I literally just saw the scene. I do not need a reminder of what I just watched to understand the emotions the character is going through right now or the revelation they are having.    Sound 5/10:  The VAs did a great job on all of their parts. The music choices get old after a while and I personally felt the second OP was worse than the first one.    Character 3/10:  These characters are fucking garbage. Take a tsundere and a tsundere and put them in a relationship together. Kind of an interesting idea, except these characters barely develop into their more caring side and stay cold and bitter throughout most of the series. The male MC is so fucking dense he's on the verge of becoming a singularity and the female MC can not think for herself. The character interactions are entertaining and interesting at first but wear down on you as the series goes on. Imagine being guilt tripped for 3 years to be with someone that you don't genuinely feel the same way about. Kind of makes you feel like shit. That's exactly what happens here. We watch the male MC as dense as he is get guilt tripped by all of the supporting cast (minus his ""rival"") to date the female MC. The female MC lacks any form of self control and cannot come up with any logical idea that her best friend literally plays plot device to drive the story forward at any given time. The rivals are all weak characters that show up for about an episode and a half just to slow the story down.    Enjoyment: 5/10  Lovely Complex was a lot of fun at the start. The characters were fun and interesting to watch. The characters being foiled by their own mistakes and misunderstandings was fun until it kept being done over and over again. I got tired of seeing the same scenes played out and having the constant flashbacks there to just reuse animation to pad out runtime got old really, really fast. It'll be fun for a while but don't expect the fun to last.  Overall: 5";Mixed Feelings

13;Lovely★Complex;xiecake;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xiecake;8;Lovely Complex is good! Overall it's pretty cute at times and I really like the whole short boy/tall girl dynamic, ALTHOUGHHHHH there are a lot of things that I did fuss over while watching it.  1. At times, there were too many comedic relief moments throughout the entire show and it got reaaaally annoying at some point. There could be a really serious situation going on and then suddenly some goofy ass frame of Koizumi would appear and it'd totally ruin the suspense. If you're really not into dumb comedy segments that aren't really necessary, LoveCom has SOOOOOO many of those so watch out if you can't put up with it.  2. The animation/art really isn't all that good. I normally don't really obsess over whether visuals in an anime are good or bad, but at times the characters would be drawn so poorly that I found it hard to take some scenes seriously. Like, there was this one really suspenseful scene happening between Otani and Koizumi, and I COULD NOT TAKE ANYTHING SERIOUSLY because they drew Koizumi's face all crooked and the animation was so choppy that it distracted me from everything that was going on. I really only ever comment on the art in an anime if it's bad enough to DISTRACT me from the plot, and LoveCom just so happens to be one of those anime. I swear the animation and art reminded me of some bootleg early 2000s kids cartoon at some point... Very sorry!!  3. I love the dynamics between the main pairing, BUT THE WHOLE INSULTING AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER THING GOT SOOO IRRITATING THROUGHOUT THE SERIES... Like, I get it, that's their whole thing, that's their schtick or whatever, but come ooonnnn give it a rest at some point bro??? I swear Otani and Koizumi fought sooo much to the point where watching them interact and bicker with each other got so annoying I literally had to put the episode on 2x speed just to get it over with as fast as possible. It made the whole anime a bit irritating to watch, and it made it a tad bit painful, but on the bright side it made the times when they were nice to each other EXTRA nice to witness.  4. There were a lot of weird side stories, like, I swear if they just cut out all of the dumb goofy scenes the anime could be squished down to like 12 episodes... The anime starts off pretty slow and it takes a while for the whole romance between Otani and Koizumi to start out, and the episodes that mostly have to do with the side characters are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING LIKE I SWEAR I WAS ABOUT TO FALL ASLEEP DURING THEM... It's also another reason why I had to put the anime on 2x speed during the bits I wasn't very interested in. I mean, at least there's a lot of content??  All in all, I really like the anime. Also the last episode was so good by the way, I won't say exactly why because of spoilers but it was so cute it almost made me forget about all of the complaints I had about the anime! I love LoveCom, I'll def remember it in the future. If you're bored, please watch it it's great.;Mixed Feelings
0;Lovely★Complex;360ken;https://myanimelist.net/profile/360ken;3;"I really have a lot of bad things to say about this show but I'll warn you if it gets too spoiler-laden. Here starts the review.  STORY- 2 (Dreadful) Lovely Complex is about two high school kids, Risa and Otani. They are a comedy duo because whever they're together they fight, argue, make fun of each other, and cause a scene, which makes bystanders laugh. Risa is taller than most guys and that's a problem for her because she's desperately searching for a boyfriend. Otani is sort of a dumb jock/trouble maker. He's shorter than almost all the girls and he's also self-conscious about it. So two people with height complexes. Well the first 5 or so episodes of this are just filler-type comedy episodes which is pretty nice. Then Risa starts to like Otani for who knows what reason. He picks on her, argues with her, but the creators expect us to believe they're a match made in heaven because they both like this one rap group, Umibouzu. For the next handful of episodes Risa tries to confess her love to Otani but Otani is just SO DENSE he thinks it's a joke when she confesses to him. This is where the show takes a nose-dive in quality. Lovely Complex starts going in circles. Something along the lines of this: Risa confesses, Otani rejects her, Risa cries, Risa beats him up. Risa stops crying and says she gives up on Otani, but then Otani does something Risa finds sweet, so Risa cries, and beats him up. She says she's going to keep loving Otani. Does it sound stupid? Yes it does! It's very long-winded, it goes in circles, Risa must've cried 30 times in this show. The show also shifts from comedy to drama around this point. You may or may not like this, depending on your preference, but you sure as hell don't want to see Risa cry again. Episodes 1-5 were okay, but around episode 6 it was a steady decline to the awful, unbearable, disgusting episodes 8-12. The show became a chore to watch because everytime I finished an episode I was so frustrated, and multiple times I logged into MAL and almost clicked ""Dropped"". I couldn't bring myself to do it. I would have rather never laid eyes on Lovely Complex then drop it at 12 episodes. I will explain why later in this review. Episodes 13 on were watchable to my relief. Not as good as the first five but no where near as awful as 8-12. There is still the cycle of crying, beatings, motivations and what not, but their romance progresses slightly and new characters are added to the mix (which I will talk about later). I'm not going to dwell on the story any longer since I will spoil it for you. So you may be asking, looks like you hated the plot...why not give it a 1? 1 is what Lovely Complex would be if it weren't for some great moments later in the series that just made me go ""Awwwwwwwwww :3"". They weren't anything worthy of bringing my score up past 5 but they were cute sweet shojo moments, and I was happy Lovely Complex included them. But the story is still a horribly low 2, and that's fair. The last episode, though I won't spoil it for you, is horribly contrived and way too unrealistic and convenient for the main characters. All in all, Lovely Complex's story is a frustrating, long-winded, tedious, and boring one with not enough good humour for a romantic comedy. All of it is slapstick which isn't even funny. Risa kicks Otani probably as much as she cries her eyes out. It's a crappy story.  CHARACTER- 1 (Pathetic!) Characters are unlikable and underdeveloped. The main characters...okay let's discuss them. Risa, awful as stated before. No redeeming qualities, just an all around annoying person. Otani, he's probably the best in the whole show, and that's actually sad. He's underdeveloped, stereotypical and dense. Side characters...well the main one here in Nobu-chan who is Risa's best friend and side kick. She's alright, nothing really irked me about her. She had no personality, she just loved her boyfriend and provided motivation and chances for Risa to meet alone with Otani. She wasn't awful but nothing was good about her. I'm not even going to talk about her boyfriend he's so underdeveloped and useless to the story. Also on the topic of side characters, Chiharu was friends with Risa in the beginning but never mentioned past the first episode. She's just a shy girl. The biggest problem, bigger than the character's being flat, is that they weren't put to good use. These names may mean nothing to people who haven't seen the show, but to those of you who have, Maity-sensei, Haruka, that blonde transvestite, Mimi, the red and black haired kid, and Otani's ex-girlfriend recieved no character developement and were brought into the series only to be forgotten. Ok, Mimi, red head kid, and Otani's ex weren't that important to the story, but all the other side characters were! Haruka most particularly, had brought a bunch of drama in the series and created tension between Risa and Otani in the beginning, only to be forgotten and useless to the plot, and never developed. He could've had a story arc about him but the creators didn't choose to go that route which was dissapointing. In the end, no side characters got any actual closure. Character in this show is pathetic, Risa is the worst mainly because she cries too much.  Sound- 5 (Meh.) The ""sad moment"" music just made the scenes too melodramatic. The ""happy, funny moment"" music did it's job and fit in well with the scenes. The ""good moment"" music (ie, when something romantic happens between Risa and Otani) is probably the best. It makes the seens just that much sweeter and it puts a smile on my face. The OPs and EDs were forgettable and just not special. That's all I reall have to say.  Art- 8 (Nothing to complain about here) The art I actually quite liked. The character designs were nice, the colour palette was bright and colourful, sometimes Risa's fish-face bothered me but overall I liked the art in Lovely Complex. It was nice to look at, I would probably call it unique but from what pictures I've seen from Kimi ni Todoke and Bokura ga Ita, the art is all the same. But still, it's good.  Enjoyment- 2 Had some sweet moments but in the end this frustrating tedious mess of a romantic ""comedy"" made me want to bang my head against the wall and had little to no redeeming values. A MAJOR dissapointment.  Overall- 3 Lovely Complex was a terrible, horrible, nauseating show that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Unless you have a strong fetish for slapstick humour, you won't be able to sit through half of this.  (Jokes)  But seriously, it's a bad show.";Not Recommended
1;Lovely★Complex;Obamanizer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Obamanizer;1;This show is not enjoyable. The density of the main male character gets old seriously fast, and then turns to anger.  The story progresses at a snails pace, the characters as a whole dont have much value to each other and no depth. The art is bad but thats to be expected of something so old and the sound is forgettable.  but seriously, the biggest turn off of this entire show was the density of the main male character, it was seriously denser than Thors hammer which is made of the core of a star...;Not Recommended
2;Lovely★Complex;iJocelyn;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iJocelyn;1;"This is the worst piece of shit ever made and I will forever hate it to my dying grave. Imagine if someone wanted to make a parody of all the tropes and cliches of romance anime then forgot to actually make it a parody; you're left with intentional tropes that twist the knife to see just how far you can make the audience suffer through bullshit while at the same time making the female lead suffer and cry that she's stuck with this piece of shit guy whom she loves but doesn't love back because reasons as this goes on for 26 fucking episodes. And every so often, just when you think that there might be some progress, the anime twists the knife to remind you that you must suffer just as much as the female lead. It's horrible and no other art has made me hate its existence more than Lovely Complex. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. Fuck it to hell. It might be the most nihilistic artwork ever made.";Not Recommended
3;Lovely★Complex;Meido-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Meido-chan;3;I noticed there were quite a lot of high rated reviews and some others that had a very similar reaction to what I did, I think it's important to conclude that your enjoyment of this series will depend on what you're looking for in an anime. Please remember to check out the genres of this series as well as the intend age group before starting.  --  I saw the first episode of lovely complex and was completely jaw to the floor. This is EXACTLY what I didn't want in an anime. Fast paced, no subtleties, annoying main characters. Humor which takes away from the development of the show. I understand the humor was supposed to be funny but I didn't really laugh as the jokes were bare-faced and flat. Nothing smart and cunning or carved out.  It's an extremely typical shoujo, all the 'friends' were hollow and just for show. The rivals are there for the sake of jealousy--and let's be real we've seen this done way too many times. It's not healthy, and it needs to stop. The development of 'love' relies on the friends pushing the two main love interests along. The writing forces the plot along only with these events, sports festival, fire works festival, christmas, valentines, birthday and THREE love rivals all withing the first 7 episodes. No regular, healthy progression of love plays forth. None of the characters developed at all, not even the main ones. I imagine this style was newly emerging and 'good for it's time' but it's definitely nothing special now.  Long story short: The show doesn't take itself seriously, and so it's difficult for the viewer to sympathize with characters emotions when it's clear the viewership was intended for those of a younger audience.  * If you're a teenager with little to no love experience, who enjoys characters with no real motives and no development in an over-arching story, you'll enjoy Lovely Complex.  *If you're seeking something more well thought out, detailed and deep love story, I would not recommend this anime.;Not Recommended
4;Lovely★Complex;iSheep;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iSheep;3;"If you haven't noticed by now, one of my favorite genres of anime is the high school rom-com, behind slice-of-life and quite possibly incest. Given that Lovely[star]Complex was one of those rom-com shows, I was excited to watch another rom-com that seems to have reached universal acclaim amongst fans and skeptical viewers alike. Having seen Kaichou wa Maid-sama, Toradora!, and a whole mess of other shows that have always delivered without the action, the fan service, or all those other anime elements that average anime addicts tend to fangirl about, Lovely[star]Complex seemed to meet those exact same conditions. Plus, I was way behind when it came time to watch it on classic anime shows as they call them, so it wouldn't hurt to throw Lovely[star]Complex in the mix of shows I'm currently watching.  With that said, let me try my best to say something nice for once.  ""OMGG!! LOVELY COMPLEX IS SO AWSUM!!! I GAVE IT 15/10-""  Fuck this. Never mind.  If I could say just how excited I was to see this show, a friend of mine who was NEVER wrong about recommending anime shows to me told me to watch it. Every single show he recommended to me, I've enjoyed. Working!!, Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?, Psycho-Pass, and a good number of others. But if our friendship hangs off the balance of one show (and thank your deity of choice it doesn't), then we would've unfriended each other on Facebook over disagreeing about Lovely[star]Complex.  Only Facebook. We'd still be friends.  Your first impression of Lovely[star]Complex might be ""just another rom-com"", the average animated filler to leave yet another dull impression on the anime market, back in 2007. And if you initially thought that, I'll tell you right now....  ....that you are probably not mistaken. Lovely[star]Complex is the average high school shoujo anime and the only real difference is the boy is shorter than the girl, that's about it. You could technically switch one thing to make it seem different and more appealing, but to be honest, it really doesn't make that much of a difference. This leaves Lovely[star]Complex, middle-of-the-road, and not purposed to surprise.  But if it were up to me to point out any one instance in which Lovely[star]Complex had any highlights that gave it a ""head"" above the normal crowd, I'd have to cite it for being a little too excessive. Overexaggerated, overhyped, overrated. You know what happens when a comedy act gets to be, ""too much"", right? It's the only reason Jeff Dunham landed a job as a comedian, and that's not the only reason; I'd have a hard time too getting Muppet rejects onto Sesame Street. Lovely[star]Complex is the same way in that respect. Don't agree with me? Please continue reading.  Story: A King Kong-sized high school girl falls in love with Jeremy Lin, the shortest basketball player in existence who can miraculously drive balls deep behind ""enemy lines"" and somehow manage to get it in, and to clarify on that, horny ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy Lin, who for the purpose of this story will be renamed ""Otani"", is just a really talented basketball player.  While self-acclaimed critics and public conformers ask for certain elements added into a show to make it all the more ""unique"" and therefore ""better"", Lovely[star]Complex overdoes it. As a result, Lovely[star]Complex delivers a plain-Jane romance between a shaven Star Wars Ewok and the girl in elementary school who always stood next to the teachers because she was just too damn tall to fit in the bleachers.  See, a lot of people think that Lovely[star]Complex has been a terrific show for its ""inspirational story about how we must overcome our differences and come together as one"", but I for one don't believe that's the case. It's just a height problem, people outside of scripted lines and animation work around it all the time. It's really nothing special. Just get some stilts and end the show in half the time.  But setting aside all of the height complaints, Lovely[star]Complex delivers too many complications and too many ridiculous situations in 24 episodes. One moment, Risa falls in love with a guy that is ACTUALLY HER HEIGHT, and in the same episode, she decides to herself that she is in love with Otani. I know, it's completely possible, because prostitution services require that you MUST share your affection with other men, but instead of cheering her on as the protagonist, a quick jump like that makes me think, ""is there something wrong with her?"" I'd definitely think so. That's what I thought when I was getting stalked by a girl in high school who easily changed her mind after finding out I was already dating someone, after writing my name all over her notebook which I found out about in due time (yeah, creepy shit. I speak from experience).  The complications do NOT stop. It's always the tragic story of ""we fight, we make up"" with this show, and it happens very, VERY often. Before they begin dating (because we know where this is going already), the show takes on the vicious cycle of fighting one episode, making up at the end. They fight another episode, they make up at the end. Does it get tiring for you to watch? I'm sure it does, but if that was what fans were looking for back then, I think everyone should reconsider their decision, or get their heads bolted on properly at their local clinic (because it spawned eight episodes of the same shit from the 2nd season of Haruhi Suzumiya).  Art: I think this was the worst discovery I had when I first saw this show: the animator was Toei Animation. That's the studio that brought us Air Gear.  You're wondering, ""why is that even relevant?"" I'm pretty sure I've made it well-known that I thought Air Gear was a big disappointment, and one thing that made it horrible was the mismatched comedy which is usually delivered in the worst possible situation or when it's generally uncalled for. Lovely[star]Complex, in my personal opinion, is the exact same way. Emotional sequence? Go ahead and laugh because they made Risa's face look funny. Supposed to be a serious scene? Sure, it doesn't make a difference whether or not Otani's teeth are jagged or not and his mouth is now opening like a dysfunctional 10-year-old on coffee, we can be serious and have fun at the same time. I really disliked the comedy because I felt like the animators placed the comedy in every scene they see fit. Not that it really matters, but how hard is it to laugh at the same joke being delivered in multiple different ways, and recurring every single time you hit the ""Play"" button? If you do laugh, though, I don't blame you. At one point in our lives, we do end up kissing someone's ass so I suppose we can start now.  Character: Why is it a common anime element to fill the protagonist's head with air? The only reason you'd want to is if you wanted to take a ride in him (or on), or if he really angered you that much (and at times, he really did). People are not THAT stupid. You can be the biggest moron on the face of this planet (literally and figuratively) and you'd still be able to pick up ALL of those hints. Think about it. A girl wants to get close to you, she does, and she becomes your friend, now she's your best friend, and suddenly you get a confession from her. If you act surprised, or if you haven't taken a hint by then, either you have amnesia, you've been dropped on your head, or you've been hit by a bus.  Otani probably had all three.  Come to think of it, I really don't get Risa either. I remember one instance where Risa was really serious about giving up on Otani for being a complete blockhead within those first few episodes (and it drags on into later episodes as well), but if that were the case, she'd have given up her pursuit of him and chased after someone else, preferrably of her same height. She fell in love with him in two episodes, without any proper backing aside from touching him. If true love worked that way, all the 40-year-old virgin neckbeards in the world would do their best to touch every ten-year-old girl they saw as a part of their strange little harem they've got going on. In their world, it's quite possible that it did happen, so I'm not too surprised.  I think I went a little off-topic. What I'm trying to say is, in reference to the ""OOH IM LIEK SOOO OVARR OTANI-BAKA-SAN"" (however you Japanglish majors say it), I think there's too much unnecessary drama. Yes, it's a rom-com, and they tend to have drama, but don't you think the drama the type you see in a soap opera, where a poor sucker scratches his $1,000 shoes and throws a fit about not having them cleaned? Hopefully you see where I'm going with this.  Wait, that's a reality show. Oh well, there's really no difference.  Enjoyment: I did laugh somewhere at the end, the last episode where the ""All Hanshin Kyojin"" were supposed to deliver a speech and ended up tearing the paper, but that was about it. The rest of the comedy was like watching a 12-year-old desperately try to make an 18-year-old Internet troll crack up. Let's be real, that will never happen unless he fell flat on his face so that the troll could make a meme about it.  Unfortunately, in this case, Lovely[star]Complex didn't quite do that. I'm a bit mad about it.  For the rest of the show, I was counting the minutes that passed by as I watched with a straight face the show that didn't seem to live up to its expectations. I was sidetracked from time-to-time and I would wake up discouraged, keeping in mind I still had to complete Lovely[star]Complex, but I managed to finish it within two weeks.  For reference, I finished all three seasons and the OVA's for Shakugan no Shana in a week.  Overall: I really wonder how this show managed to get an 8.35/10. I have to say, I'm authentically surprised that a show with an appearance this awful, from storyline down to characters, has managed to deceive the majority of its viewership into thinking they stumbled over the next best thing. There's really nothing special I can see about Lovely Complex, aside from being an overhyped animated sitcom with nothing to offer. And over time, I had hopes that it would turn into a show like Lucky Star, which is an acquired taste and will only appear humorous to fans of the show who have had it grow on them. Unlike Lucky Star, Lovely[star]Complex took no time to grow, now time to develop, and in the end, nothing was left. There's no taste to acquire here. It is what it is; terrible.  Maybe it's a recurring thing for me to rant on anime shows that are generally popular and well-received, but if that were the case, I authentically dislike Lovely[star]Complex. I respect that others like this show, and by others, I mean, most of the people here. But it didn't grow on me, and it won't be anytime soon.";Not Recommended
5;Lovely★Complex;Raspeyer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Raspeyer;4;Lovely Complex in all honesty is going to be boring for anyone who's ever seen at least one romance comedy series before. Or anyone who ever had a crush on the opposite cootie-infested gender in elementary school.  You know what's going to happen right from the first couple of episodes. Even the characters height differences couldn't add much to these two very bland characters. The comedy was all slap stick and you can already tell by the anime's description the jokes mostly revolve around short stack and giant similies.  Seiko's introduction kicked up the story for a couple of episodes and there were a couple of sure-to-be heartwarming moments thrown in.  Don't fret if you've passed up the chance to watch this anime. If you've got other shoujo RomComs in your collection then it'll be easy to cut and past the storyline of LovCom together.;Not Recommended
6;Lovely★Complex;BanjoTheBear;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BanjoTheBear;4;"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)  There's a common phrase when it comes to love, ""opposites attract."" What does this mean exactly? Men fall for women? Innocent girls go for the bad boys? An outgoing person finds the quiet, reserved type attractive? Whatever the case, these types of relationships form all the time. And with the Lovely Complex, it is no different. But as an anime, the show is not as good as people make it out to be.  STORY  Lovely Complex stars Ootani, the short (and short-tempered) guy, and Koizumi, the tall (and equally short-tempered) girl. Due to their antics, they are usually seen as a comedy duo. But as their time together increases, Koizumi begins seeing Ootani in a new light.  The show itself is comprised of about four separate arcs: All-Hanshin Kyojin (their nickname in school) acting as friends, Koizumi realizing her feelings for Ootani, pursuing him, and the conflicts that arise between them. The show starts off strong but by the halfway point, it devolves into repetition and ultimately weakens.  The first arc helps to demonstrate the comedy of the show. Relying mostly on funny reactions and gags between Ootani and Koizumi, it worked to get a laugh out of me every now and then. Their relationship was filled with ""idiots"" and other relevant names. They seemed more like brother and sister with the way they acted towards one another; hostile yet you know that they care about each other. At this point, it is also becomes apparent how fast the shows pacing is. It should not be taken lightly when I say that the show progresses very quickly through events and time. By the end of the show, it has covered the entirety of their high school lives, meaning about one year per eight episodes. This doesn't necessarily hurt the show, but it does leave many details either left to narration or skipped over.  The second arc deals with Koizumi coming to terms with her feelings for Ootani. This was the strongest part of the show for its sense of realism. The show doesn't have the couple come together immediately. Instead, it plays off the relationship they have currently and sets up a believable situation in which Koizumi learns that falling in love and having that person love you back are not the easiest things to have at the same time.  The third arc consists mostly of Koizumi attempting to woo Ootani. However, it is at this point that the show starts to degrade. Where it had a nice sense of realism beforehand, it throws this out of the window in place of illogical choices and repetition. As stated before, the pacing of the show is quick. Therefore, Koizumi's advances actually last for quite a while. So long, in fact, it goes against sanity. I can believe having a crush on someone for a long period of time, but when that person doesn't reciprocate your feelings after having yours known for an extensive period of time, it starts to become a little ridiculous on the part of the confessor. Going back to repetition, much of this arc consists of the same thing over and over: Koizumi loving Ootani, attempting to sway him, her failing, her wanting to give up, then her realizing she can't. It gets rather annoying quickly that she comes to the same conclusion constantly while still holding out hope.  The final part of the show involves many complications that arise between Ootani and Koizumi's relationship. By this point, I was getting perturbed at their sometimes stupid choices that they were making, and this portion was no exception. A lot of the comedy had been removed and was replaced by their high school romance drama. A part of me wanted to like the romance that was happening but their was just something about the relationship that just never really felt as if the two really cared about one another. Whether that is Ootani's apprehensiveness or Koizumi's baffling decision making, whatever it is, I never felt myself rooting for them to finally end up together.  ANIMATION  Watching Lovely Complex is somewhat rough. The art style for the show makes it look as if it was created in the mid-90s, despite being created in 2007. The environments and locations are pretty average and the character designs are pretty plain if not forgettable.  In terms of animation, the show is also pretty bad. For the animation that is present, it is not executed properly and usually pretty choppy. Furthermore, the show loves to employ repetition even in its frames; it constantly uses previously aired material through flashbacks. Again, this starts to happen more in the second half where the show begins to go downhill.  The show could get detailed when it wanted to, especially when drawing the character's faces during key moments, but for the most part this never occurred. Instead, the show mainly stuck to drawing the characters in joke poses or ways.  CHARACTERS  Something interesting I found about the Lovely Complex was that I actually preferred the side cast to the main cast throughout much of the show.  Koizumi starts off being a rather loud and abrasive girl looking for love. And this is pretty much the extent of her character. Yes, her feelings for Ootani change over time, but beyond that, nothing else does. Having so much time elapse, there should have been more development on her part outside of ""I can't live without him."" It's sad because she is quite unique when it comes to main female leads; she isn't super nice and pretty. She's pretty much the atypical lead girl, both in personality and growth.  The same argument can be had for Ootani. He begins as the hot-headed shorty but outside of coming to terms with his own feelings, he doesn't grow either. This is a big problem when you are the star of a show.  While I found Koizumi and Ootani to at least be okay characters, I actually quite liked the rest of the cast. Characters such as Nobuko, Seiko, and Haruka not only provided more laughs than All-Hanshin Kyojin did, but they also were the ones to provide us with plot points and character insight. And while they may also have only one trait attributed to each of them, that's fine; being side characters, I wasn't expecting huge progress from them. But even so, the show does look at each of them, if only for a bit.  And this was the issue with them; outside of Nobuko, the character was usually introduced, used for a few episodes, then discarded. He or she might make a cameo later on, but for the most part, he or she was forgotten.  SOUND  The first OP is at least okay. It sounds older than it probably intends to be, but it is fun and fits with the first half of the show nicely. The second OP, however, is not good. It has a mix of rap and pop to it that doesn't feel appropriate for the show. The first ED is actually pretty good. It has a jazzy and mellow feel to it that complements nicely with the antics that take place before it. But like the second OP, the second ED is just bad. It sounds like it came from a boy band; its too much pop and does not go with the shows feeling at all.  The rest of the soundtrack is pretty bad as well. There is nothing memorable from it or even anything worth mentioning.  As for the voice acting, Akemi Okamura's role as Koizumi and Akira Nagata's role as Ootani were nicely done on their end. Their voices sounded pretty unique and the different tones and inflections they used throughout the series were done well.  ENJOYMENT  You will be hard pressed to find another guy who likes romance in anime as much as I do. But as I said previously, I just could not get fully invested into this one. Perhaps I just did not like Koizumi and Ootani's characters enough to care about them getting together. The romance elements are definitely there but it just never felt as if they really had feelings that complemented each other. Koizumi would always let us know due to her narration but Ootani seemed as disinterested with everything as I did with the show.  The comedy itself is good during the first half, as said previously. A lot of the jokes fall flat during the second half, and I distinctly remembering shaking my head at the ""Grandma joke"" for how completely unfunny it was, despite the characters thinking so. I think that may have been the problem that the show created for itself. By focusing so much on comedy to begin with, it becomes harder to appreciate the romance introduced later down the road.  In the end, Lovely Complex's appeal comes from its characters, simply because it is lacking in almost every other department. But since I didn't particularly enjoy All-Hanshin Kyojin, my experience with the show was just not as enjoyable as it should have been.  SUMMARY  Story: Fine, experiences a harsh half-life  Animation: Bad, art style is old and the animation is lacking  Characters: Fine, weak main cast but strong side cast  Sound: Fine, split on OPs and EDs, bad soundtrack but good VAs  Enjoyment: Fine, better comedy than romance  Final Score: 4/10";Not Recommended

8;Lovely★Complex;tyrandriel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tyrandriel;3;"Okayyy I finally gave LoveCom a try, after being suggested it a billion times. I've exhausted about every romance anime out there, and thought it was time. Well...I was not impressed! Keeping in mind this anime is quite old, I'll try and formulate a review to reflect that.  Story I will say, the show did make me chuckle at a few scenes, which rarely happens, so that was pleasant. I liked the premise of tall girl/short guy, you don't see that very often at all, it's refreshing! Even if that might not be your style. The two main characters are a ""comedic duo"" that banter and bicker a ton. If you're not into ""screamy"" anime, as I call it, you won't like this one. It has A LOT of that.  Wellll girl eventually falls for guy, and guy is MEGA dense. Lots of misinterpretations, stubbornness, density, sobfests to be had. You're going to be sitting around for a long time waiting for any kind of progression, sorry.  I did skip over a bunch of scenes, either the screaming was getting annoying or I simply didn't care for what was going on, especially in the later episodes.  I will say, if you make it that far, the ending is satisfactory, THANK GOD. The kiss scenes are pretty decent and there's a handful of them.  Characters Most of the characters were unlikable. Especially the two main characters :/ I found them to be extremely annoying. Especially in contrast to their best friends who seemed to have their lives more put together and were in healthy relationships with each other.  A ton of characters were brought in and never fleshed out. Which I was pretty thankful for or I would've definitely skipped over them. Examples being the cringe-ass blonde girl/boy and the teacher. I don't know why they even wanted to bring in a teacher love interest for the HIGH SCHOOL main character. I know it's pretty typical with anime and I find complaining about it to be useless but come on. The main characters weren't even fleshed out aside from they both have height complexes and one likes basketball.  Sound & Art I didn't care much for the music, some of it was very repetitive. Probably because I binged it, though. I didn't like the OP&EDs, they were forgettable. HOWEVER, I actually really liked the art style. I don't normally like ""old style"" art in anime especially because it's 2022, but I didn't mind it one bit. It worked very well.  Overall Overall I would never re watch it, but I'm happy I finally gave it a shot. I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a romance anime, though!";Not Recommended
9;Lovely★Complex;Rohling;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rohling;3;So, an romance/comedy/SoL Anime. Frim time to time i watch them just for the fun of it. Reading most of the reviews it didn't sound bad, but for me it was. Biggest problem for me is that it had fit into ~12 episodes, but not 24. Too long did it look like the producers streched it. Starting with the chars, beside the two MC's no other char got a development at all. After the two first episodes they are all still standing the same way. Some got dumped, some showed up later but it doesn't gave something for the story whatsoever. Talk about chars, let's get the male one first: Not only dense, a total assburger. Shoving the girl away ~3 times and still don't break up with her, what a mess. He just pissed me off so much, i needed to FF sometimes. Now the female char: Running for a guy at ~3 jeahrs, gets dumped repeatly and still goes for him? I know it is not RL, but still, this is an alternate universe.  So overall, sometimes i like that kinda shows, but this just dissapointed me.;Not Recommended
10;Lovely★Complex;Oisif;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Oisif;4;"I honestly have no idea why people rank this so high. Everywhere i see, it's always given scores higher than 8's. Lovely complex is a story about a boy and a girl that have a huge complex about their heights, as the FMC is taller than general girls, while MC is shorter than general boys. Due to that, they were constantly bickering with each other, and thus are deemed a comedy duo by their peers. The anime follows their journey as they discover their growing feelings on each other. A pretty simple premise, with the gimmick of their difference in heights. Altho i do find the banters with each other fun, it didn't last very long as it turned repetitive pretty fast.  For the early episodes, everything went well. Things started of with them losing their perspective bf/gf target, as the targets ended up hooking up with each other. Caught me off guard, and at least hooked me into the anime. We also get shown why the main character is called the comedy duo as they both bicker with each other constantly, yet having similar tastes in stuff. And we got some characterization down, they want to have a gf/bf. But at the same time the conflict was that none of their targets views them as potential material, since they're too SHORT and TALL. So then the FMC won't ever go for shorter guys, and the MC won't ever go for taller girls due to the complex they have. They even got the MC a slightly deeper depth, as his ex-gf left him for a tall guy, which gave him a bigger complex. Basically things started of really well, and i got tricked into thinking that this will end up being good.  Boy, the plot development is disgusting. Take the three most used cliche conflict in the world of romance anime. Love Rival, Misunderstandings, and Bad Timing. Now make a 24 episode worth of content with those three. This anime is what you'll get. I'm fine with romance or shoujo anime being slow with their relationship, but at least put some effort in making the conflicts FRESH. In the span of 24 episodes, the FMC and MC have 3 love rivals perspectively, with a total of 6 love rivals. And at least the author is not dumb enough to show them back to back, so what did he do to fill in the gaps between? Put in some scenes full of misunderstandings and bad timings. Their whole plot is centered on these 3 points, and i'm not even frustrated, i just couldn't care less anymore.  Next is the characters of this show Koizumi Risa, she is loud, strong, impulsive, but kind girl who never had a relationship before, so once she realizes her love for Atsushi otani, her whole existence is to love him and to make him realize her charms and date. Atsushi Otani, prideful, kind and dense guy who has a passion for basketball despite his height. Their only internal conflict was their complex with their height, and their goal is to find a partner. But apart from their blandness as main characters, i at least can like risa's active role in trying to get him to see her more than just a comedic duo, and more as a potential gf. And of course, to counter that aggressiveness from FMC, they made the MC so dense about her interests in him, to the point of thinking that her confession to him at the early episodes was a joke. I mean he clearly got the message, there's no bad timing like her voice was silenced by the fireworks, yet was still able to brush it off as a joke.... I guess that's when i realized that this is all the show will be about. Not to mention once he DOES realize she likes him, he rejected her, but they kept on going back and forth between forgetting about it and come back to their original relationship as a comedic duo or not, which is frustrating as hell since the MC kept on giving her hopes every time she wants to move on. It felt to me like he's keeping her as a backup.  But sadly even the only character i liked Risa, came to an end. The final love rival appeared who also have a similar interest as her. The first conflict happened when the love rival approached to kiss her when she was sleeping and they were seen by MC. She was able to explain that it was all a mistake and MC forgives her. Cool. But the 2nd conflict was when love rival appeared to invite her to see a concert they both like.....Now of course, they've been pressing the fact that she liked that band from the early episodes. But she did realize that she has triggered the first red flag with that accidental kiss right ? She's not that dumb to realize that this is a no no right ?... Well yeah.. she is that dumb. I was honestly dumbfounded that she was able to weight the concert more than her love for the MC, which is her only goal in the series to begin with.  And add that with the side characters. All the side characters are bland papers. The MC's circle of close friends whole existence in the show is only to flirt with their perspective couple and to help push the main characters together. Other than the last 1-2 episodes where they were confronted with their future paths, which then actually shines some characterization on them. But by then I've long lost any interest in them as a character. Besides, it's not even particularly intriguing, it's just some basic stuff regarding couples separating due to graduation. And remember those love rivals i mentioned? Yeah they're only pivotal to the plot for at least 1-2 episodes, so the author had no choice but to make 6 of them to fill in the rest of the story. And after that? Poof, they're gone. They'll just exist as a cameo in some other episodes as an NPC character, while poking in the conversation as to how they're not giving up on him/her yet. Obviously with doing next to nothing to back it up.  I still remember how the childhood friend of the FMC was introduced as a love rival, confessed to FMC, and completely disappears in the next few episodes, and when he came back, had multiple gf in the pretence of ""training"" for when he'll get to date FMC.  Other than that i have nothing to say about sound and art style. They're all mediocre.";Not Recommended
0;Lovely x Cation The Animation;ore_no_hentai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ore_no_hentai;10;Story: There are several stories included with this hentai. All of them are good. Lots of affection and love goes there. They are all about people in love, so it will be enjoyable.  Art: Lots of details. Bodies, characters, clothes, places. Voices. Colors. All of them are good.  Scenes: Scenes are more romantic and softcore which I love to see. Males go slowly with caution(most of the time) and females are enjoying their relationship. Lots to talk about, but you better watch yourself.  Non-sense: Free of anything. All the scenes are clear. No anal sex, rape. gore and so on.  This series is a must watch. Exact review goes for other hentai in this series.  NOTE: For good hentai take a look at my anime list.;Recommended
0;Lovely x Cation The Animation;Wicker_Senpai93;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wicker_Senpai93;6;"Lovely x Cation The Animation is an OVA series by Studio T-Rex. I think that this hentai can best be described as perfectly average. Nothing about it stands out, weather that be good or bad.  The story of this anime is... well... it varies. There are 5 (really 4 and a half) stories spread across two episodes. They are all very basic, and all follow two characters who like each other, consummating their relationships. The ""story"" for each part largely comprises the personality of the girl, and in two cases, the setting. The first story concerns a couple who fall in love after presenting a fake relationship. It was okay. The second story concerns a couple who get down to business in a photo booth. It was mildly more engaging. The third ""story"" can barely even be called a story, since it lasts for all but a few minutes. It's about a nurse who is in love with one of her students. I was actually the most excited for this one, but nothing much happens unfortunately. The fourth story is about... something... Yeah, it was that forgettable. The fifth and final story is about a guy and his swimming instructor, and it clearly had the most effort put into it. It was decent and cute.  The real focal point of this anime is the artwork, which is above average quality for a hentai. Everyone looks good, although the eyes on the first girl were drawn far to big. Don't worry though, because the artwork seems to get better as the series progresses. The lighting is also used quite effectively, as it adds to the atmosphere without being distracting.  The sound work is, much like the series as a whole, perfectly fine. The voice acting is high pitched, but the voice actors add a bit of softness into their vocalization, which makes the high voices less alarming to listen to.  Overall, Lovely x Cation is a solid, albeit average hentai. I think most hentai fans, especially casual viewers, will find it enjoyable. Although more experienced watchers might feel slightly underwhelmed. 6.5/10  So, would I recommend Lovely x Cation? Sure, why the heck not.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lovely Day: Boku to Kanojo no Nana Nichikan;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;5;Lovely Day is a story about a girl and guy having sex everyday over a seven day period. There really isn't much given to us other than they are alone together for this period of time and use this time to have sex in various ways.  The art is pretty good in the series, but the animation is really bad. The animation has awkward movement that reminds me of piece of paper moving to create motion/action. Its kind of weird to watch as the action isn't really clunky like you see in other lower budget hentai, its smooth but with no real movement outside of the piece of paper sliding around like action.  The sound and characters are both decent but neither are strong enough to really warrant much of a comment.  Overall the story and variety of sex keep this from being to bad, but the animation is to bad to really get into it. Which kind of leaves it in that mediocre range that no one really has much interest in. The only reason I'd suggest watching it would be to see the animation.;Mixed Feelings
0;Loveless Specials;bufi_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bufi_;8;"This is just some fun little ""afterword corner"" of the original anime, with almost (but not exactly) 2 minute episodes, and in all honesty it worked. It was fun to watch and I think that's all that matters, since this is basically just to hype up a second season that never came. It also explains, in a humorous way, some scenes from the anime, so I think that's also an advantage (although not a lot of scenes and not all of them are 'explained', sometimes they just make funny commentaries about them).  Overall, I'd say it's worth watching since it takes at most 10 minutes of your time and it's also enjoyable.";Recommended
0;Loveless Specials;ProfoundlyCrazy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProfoundlyCrazy;4;"In case you're wondering, this is irrelevant to the story whatsoever. Basically, they were just trying to hype it up to some second season or continuation, which unfortunately never came. They talk about some episodes and some important points of the story so far, in a more humorous kind of way. I am supposing you have already watched the main anime to search for the specials, but if you didn't, this little sum-up may actually sort of help with eventual doubts if you didn't go through the trouble of reading the manga beforehand. I myself have quite the problem with the anime itself, because it took too much time with ""character development"" and none with the actual plot, pushing it until the very last minute to simply throw that in your faces in a not-so-smooth kind of way. The anime story follows up to the 4th volume of the manga, and the specials don't add anything, and just tease what could happen in the future (which is only reachable by the manga). The main characters even try to play a little bit with the ending the main anime took, but since not even the producers were certain about what could happen, there was really nothing they could do. For the ones who enjoy some chill in quick episodes with Ritsuka and Soubi with a different mood and more set out to the fun, I can recommend...? Well, better watch one and see what you think. They are very short, about one minute and a half each, so by the end of all of them it will be like watching half a minute of every episode...";Not Recommended
0;Loveless;sasori_yume;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sasori_yume;9;"For me, the best word to describe this anime is simply &quot;beautiful&quot;... If you truly want to understand it you have to take a closer look and be able to see beyond the &quot;shounen-ai&quot; or &quot;shotacon&quot; tags. I can't even say it's about a homosexual love, because it goes way beyond that, at a more spiritual level. In this anime, love becomes a great source of power. The fighter/sacrifice couples simply HAVE to create a great bond between them in order to become powerful. But love is not the main theme, it deals with a lot of other issues too. For example, the way we project ourselves on others - Seimei appears in one way for Ritsuka, his mother or Soubi, but we find out about his true nature only later on. Another example is forgetness, memories, the link between past-present-future and essential questions that everyone asks himself or herself at a certain point in his/her life, and how 12-year-old Ritsuka is searching for a meaning of his life. Yet another example is the way people are treated in society due to certain tags they wear. In this case, I'm talking about the ct years that explicitly show the status of their sexual life and how others react to that. Also, in this anime, true love has nothing to do with sexuality, and is expressed by strong emotions and subtile gestures.  The story has an interesting plot, and it develops little by little, and unfortunately does not end... You'll just have to read the manga too see what happens next. If you only watch the 12 episodes anime series the story doesn't really make sense at the end and it leaves you with even more questions. But it gets interesting when you start to go beneath the surface and find the truth behind all the appearences.  The art helps creating a slight dark atmosphere. Not dark as in &quot;evil&quot;... but more like enigmatic, mysterious. The colors are not so bright, sometimes dark, it has beautiful landscapes, and a lot of scenes occur at night, sunset or in the dark fighting setting. One of the most interesting artistic elements is the buttefly - it always accompanies Soubi's arrival, or in Soubi's paintigs, as a weapon, or in Ritsu's collection.  The soundtrack also helps a lot creating this slight dark atmosphere, and it backs up every emotion that the characters are feeling. Some emotions don't even need to be expressed by words, the music completes them and amplifies the impact they have on the viewer.  As for the characters, they are very strong and complex ones. Ritsuka is the one in search for his existence's meaning, and for life's meaning in general, feeling lost in a world he doesn't understand and that doesn't understand him. Soubi is the one that has the answers but he cannot give them to Ritsuka. When it comes to love, Soubi is the one to show Ritsuka the meaning of it, the meaning behind the appearances, the powerful and spiritual level of love. But Soubi often acts contradictory, his true feelings remain hidden, he says things very easily but sometimes his actions do not sustain his big words.  To me, it's a very unique, enjoyable combination of drama, love, philosophical questions, mistery and supernatural. The words are well chosen and always make you wonder about the truth and how much you far you have to go in order to find it. One thing is for certain - you have to ignore appearances. I really think this anime is deep and worth watching.";Recommended
1;Loveless;natsuocosplay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/natsuocosplay;9;"I believe that Loveless is MUCH MORE than just some shounen-ai story. It is so much deeper than that. It really delves into the life of a young boy who is lost in the world. Ritsuka's real name being Loveless is a strong showing of that fact.  I have to say that sadly, I was confused a few times while watching this anime. And many people I have talked to get very upset about how it was ended. They say that there were too many questions left unanswered. But think about it, in real life, there are always more questions that have not been answered.  STORY: I have to give this a lower rating because, although at the start the story moved along very smoothly, near the end things got very confusing. At first it was simple. Ritsuka lost his brother, and his fighter Soubi came along because Semei ordered him to. And they fought enemies. Not too hard to understand. But then new characters were introduced and they brought up even more questions, half of which never got answered.  ART: AMAZING. The colors used in this anime are simply awe-inspiring. The way they portray Soubi as a butterfly and they show it in beautiful colors is just wonderful. The characters are all well-drawn and very cute/handsome (in Soubi's case) The noses bug me a tad, but I'll get over it. :)  SOUND: Also great. The OP song is one that I actually always listen to every time I watch an episode. When romantic moments are occuring throughout the course of the season, they play very nice background music. Same with sad moments. The music goes along well with the mood. And not even one of the character voices are annoying! Not even Yuiko. And that surprised me.  CHARACTER: I think that if I could add more favorite characters to my list, EVERY single character from this anime would be on it. There is such a good mix of personailities, from the shy Ritsuka to the serious Soubi and the playful Yuiko and the HILARIOUS Yayoi. The way the characters all relate is very nice as well. Although at times, I was confused at why Ritsuka would just let Soubi kiss him and whatnot, but still... very good interactions and love triangles. It's the whole grade school, &quot;I like her but she likes him...&quot; ordeal. And I sometimes like that! It makes the story much more light and humorous.  ENJOYMENT: I gave this a 9 because for the most part, I was very entertained. There were a few episodes where I did not laugh or almost cry at all. But something kept me watching this anime. I think for the most part it was the characters. But I enjoyed the fights and the love between Ritsuka and Soubi. I just wish there had been more episodes to enjoy.  Overall, I give this anime a 9. Oh... and lastly, go team Zero! *squee*";Recommended
2;Loveless;-Yuki-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-Yuki-;10;Loveless could some times be a confusing anime but it's irresistible The story revolves around Aoyagi Ritsuka,a 12-year old who transfers with a mom having countless mental breakdowns which leads to child abuse dealing physical pain. Two years ago Ritsuka had lost memories and became a different person, from there his brother Seimei becomes important in his life. The anime begins with the death of Seimei which keeps Ritsuka wondering who killed his brother. The story truely begins when Ritsuka meets Agatsuma Soubi, Seimei's former fighter, and all the unexplained mystery comes, well you must watch it to see. It's true that to some the battles seem like it's not needed but let's just say if there were no battles, most likely Ritsuka and Soubi will have no bond.  The art/animation is okay, it's like a regular anime it's not too special, but the cat ears are quite creative and the battles combines fantasy and reality, the art makes the unnatural events possibly believable.  This anime's sound is nice overall, in my opinion this anime has very nice music and sound which creates more intrest to an anime watcher's .  The characters are creative and has a way of it's own, all the characters seems like complete opposite in a way but fits perfectly together. There's always a bond that ties the characters together.  This anime is very enjoyable, but there are scenes at school where Yuiko gets too annoying, that's just the beginning, the episodes in some way becomes better one after another.  Overall this anime is worth watching, I would highly recommend this anime to probably anyone. This anime may suprise you at times and may not be what you would expect so be on caution.  I shall leave it at that.  Hope this helps ~;Recommended
3;Loveless;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;7;"My first shonen-ai anime. I didn&rsquo;t even think it was shonen-ai, so it caught me by surprise. I thought it was about something dark and creepy &ndash; guess not.  I watched anime with shonen-ai premises before, and have watched one shojo-ai anime, but this anime is really different. At first it was hard to believe/handle. I didn&rsquo;t even like it at first because the shonen-ai was very surprising (didn&rsquo;t like it until episode 3). I&rsquo;m a good girl, from a conservative family, so I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. The fact that the main character is a 12 year old boy who&rsquo;s involved with a male college student is kinda scary, but surprisingly, beautiful.  Yes, that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for. The anime would have been much better if it focused more on the boy-boy love, and less about the battles and whatnot. In fact, the spell battles and seven moons were a bit vague &ndash; or maybe I just focused too much on the shonen &ndash;ai. In any case, the whole concept was overshadowed by the shonen-ai.I think that&rsquo;s expected from the original creator who started working on Gundam Wing doujinshis.  The nekomimis threw me off at first &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t get why they were there. I thought they had nekomimis because catgirls/boys are popular among a lot of anime fans, with me as an exception. I found out later they were a sign of someone&rsquo;s virginity, or lack thereof.  Characters were interesting &ndash; Of course, most of them are self-proclaimed perverts (the fact I like all of them scares me). For some reason they&rsquo;re not bothered by the fact that Soubi likes someone way, way younger than him. It&rsquo;s not just him too &ndash; Ritsuka&rsquo;s psychologist seems to have a slight crush on him as well. Anyway, almost all of them are likable (and almost all of them wore glasses, which I love), even Yuiko who irritated me at first. She&rsquo;s not so bad. I have the same opinion about Yayoi, the boy who&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with Yuiko. I didn&rsquo;t like him at first either, but he&rsquo;s actually very funny, and he reminded me of Tamaki from Ouran.  I just wish that the other characters had their fair share of lime light. I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of Soubi&rsquo;s hot teacher, and that Nagisa &ndash; sensei, I don&rsquo;t know much about her either. The character management is just done poorly.  I&rsquo;m a bit iffy about the drawing style. The backgrounds are marvelous, like delicate water color paintings. On the character design is sub par. The drawings tend to waver a lot, and the bodies are way off proportion (specially Ritsuka &ndash; he looks so skinny). Despite the wavering drawing style, there&rsquo;s still a tasteful amount of bishonens. Soubi happens to be my favorite. The colors I don&rsquo;t like that much either &ndash; the colors look a bit too pale, and I prefer more vibrant colors. There was minimal use of CG, which is OK, since it&rsquo;s just complimentary. CG was used a lot for the fight scenes, but the fight scenes still needed work. They weren\'t exciting or fun to watch at all.  I actually like the voice acting, since the seiyus brought out their characters personalities. I am very delighted at the fact that the seiyus for Soubi, Ritsuka and Yukio are all familiar to me &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen, rather, heard of their work in other series before. Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, which is Katsuyuki Konishi is actually the seiyu for Kenta Usui from Karin. I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the same person since Soubi and Kenta have very different personalities, as well as manner of speaking.  The music was so-so. The background music is what I would like to call, music you&rsquo;d hear from a creepy carnival at night, and it would make you want to either freak out or kill yourself &ndash; I mean that in a good way. It matches the theme and feel of the anime, after all. I like the opening theme too &ndash; I have heard it many times before I&rsquo;ve even watched the series. The ending song was a bit dreary and depressing, but that&rsquo;s OK.  Story wise, it didn&rsquo;t impress me. Bishonen-wise, it sure did. I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;s going to be a sequel, even if it&rsquo;s a bit late to do that. Like I said, some issues were left unresolved, and I want to catch another glimpse of the gorgeous bishies &ndash; after all, this is what I love the most about the anime.";Recommended
4;Loveless;shinigamiallie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shinigamiallie;9;It took me a long time to finally sit down and watch this anime and not because of the shonen ai themes...because of the cat ears. Normally I'm just not a cat-ear type of girl, but after watching the first episode or two and realizing the importance of the cat ears and their overall symbolism in the show I was incredibly hooked.  The story was beautiful and well written, however, I gave the story a 9 because I believe that there was a lot left unsaid. It was almost as if they were waiting for a second season that never came to ease up some questions about Seven Moons and Seimei. Aside from that it was just brilliant. The characters are easy to love and relate and you find yourself feeling their emotions as the story progresses. The story deals with the issues of pain and loss and the light of hope that new love brings.  I thought the music throughout the series was also very beautiful and alluring. So overall I gave this show a 9. It is one of my favorites that I've seen in a while and I ended up watching the entire series in one night.;Recommended
5;Loveless;Anomalous;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anomalous;8;"If you&rsquo;re not a manga reader, you probably wonder why whenever a manga becomes an anime, they&rsquo;re will be fans insisting that the manga is so much better. Usually, that&rsquo;s debatable &ndash; anime does have the benefits of things like color and sound, and if there are major plot changes some might be for the better. On the other hand, there are also anime adaptations that are inferior to their respective manga not because of what&rsquo;s in the anime but rather what&rsquo;s not. Oftentimes, short anime series will be made from long manga that end up with a made-up, rushed, or inconclusive ending. This is definitely the main weakness of Loveless, an anime that&rsquo;s suffers much from its tiny length.  Whether you&rsquo;ve read the manga or not, Loveless has a great setting. It&rsquo;s much like our world, but with a notable difference of people being born with cat ears and a tail that they lose with their virginity. That alone makes for an interesting concept if done in a non-perverted way &ndash; and for the most part, it is. But Loveless isn&rsquo;t deprived of a good plot and expect to cover it up with the great setting. Rather, the plot itself is fairly unique and beautifully developed. Ritsuka, a twelve-year-old boy still recovering from the mysterious murder of his older brother, Seimei, happens upon Soubi, an old friend of said brother. He finds out that there&rsquo;s more to Seimei&rsquo;s death than meets the eye: he was killed by an organization known as &ldquo;Septimal Moon,&rdquo; and was involved in a type of bizarre battling based solely on words. In addition to his quest to avenge his brother and rediscover himself, Ritsuka becomes part of the battles himself. It&rsquo;s a great example of a plot that creates a lot of questions that are eventually answered slowly enough to draw the viewer in but quickly enough to keep things interesting. That said, this is the part of the series that suffers most from short-anime syndrome, and the ending that the anime&rsquo;s writers threw together is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t provide a satisfying conclusion, a major flaw to an otherwise ambiguous and well-executed plot.  Fortunately, however, this lack of plot resolution has no negative effect on the cast, which is full of unique people. Ritsuka, in particular, is moody and hesitant, a far cry from other protagonists in similar series. Because of this, the relationships he creates with the rest of the cast are often unexpected yet beautifully done. Soubi, meanwhile, is a bit more typical of the older, experienced type that is seen often in shoujo anime and manga, but since he&rsquo;s actually quite submissive in some ways he doesn&rsquo;t give off the air of a walking stereotype like you might expect. The supporting characters are similarly well-made; from Ritsuka&rsquo;s oftentimes downright adorable classmates other fighters that all have their own stories and motivation (and some of which are apt to cause tears in the eyes of viewers) there&rsquo;s no lack of memorable characters. (A word of warning, though: if you tend to dislike characters that are a bit whacked in the head a la Evangelion or Utena, Loveless&rsquo; cast may not leave the same impression on you.)  Even with this great cast of characters, there&rsquo;s another part of Loveless that is praised more often: the art and animation. That&rsquo;s certainly a justified claim: frankly, the series looks gorgeous. The animation is smooth and remarkably easy to follow, especially considering the style of battling that could potentially be quite difficult. These battles happen on a mostly-black background that&rsquo;s just perfect for emphasizing the important things: characters and attacks. Coming from someone who usually has trouble following action scenes, these are very enjoyable to watch. Outside of battle, the backgrounds are simply breathtaking and the animation is fluid all over. The one disadvantage of the art is character design; primarily I&rsquo;m not much fond of the faces. Overall, there&rsquo;s very little not to like when seeing this series.  The lovely art is paired with almost as lovely music. The opening song, &ldquo;Tsuki no Curse,&rdquo; is a haunting melody that sets the mysterious and somewhat melancholy tone of the series, and both the lyrics and singer work with the music to make the song sound great (if not a bit high). The ending song, &ldquo;Michiyuki&rdquo; is similar in mood, calmer but just as dark; it really wraps up each episode nicely. The background music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, either; the best pieces are fully atmospheric without being intrusive, while others are less effective but still very much listenable.  In technical terms, Loveless is great. In literary terms, Loveless is well-made. Still, the series has a reputation among some viewers as being creepy, even pedophilic, while others find it a cute piece of BL anime. However, both of these are shallow and about as accurate as saying that My-Hime is about breasts or Gankutsuou is a mecha series. In some respects, they are true, but in the big picture they&rsquo;re utter falsehoods. Loveless may be about catboys and girl, and have blatantly sexual situations between an adult man and a young boy, but it&rsquo;s no standard fanservice series. The somewhat twisted relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi isn&rsquo;t just there for kicks; it&rsquo;s a unique dynamic that is never portrayed as anything but unusual, and it&rsquo;s a less-conventional way of helping these characters develop. Enjoying Loveless doesn&rsquo;t require a shouta-loving soul; it requires an ability to look past the surface and think about the complexities of human relationships. It&rsquo;s a series that requires some real reflection after viewing, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth that thought.";Recommended
6;Loveless;izzayizblak;https://myanimelist.net/profile/izzayizblak;10;"I watched the anime before reading the manga, as my friends advised I shouldn't. I admit, the concept was harder to grasp and overall a bit more confusing that it would've been if I'd read the manga before hand. I really love the relationship between Ritsuka-kun and his peers. His wit and view of things is very accurate for someone who recently lost something special to them. He is very observant and also very hesitant. His relationship with Soubi is harder to grasp at a younger age. It seems to be overall complicated, but as it develops; it becomes more of a heart pull. I became very attached to this work in such little time, and was sad when it came to an end. It was very beautiful, and very worth my time. Such a beautiful story, not to mention the anime and manga were flawless. ♥";Recommended
7;Loveless;ycart59;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ycart59;8;Well, this is a hard anime to review, because your enjoyment all depends on your own take on this anime. But this is my take:  STORY: Yeah, this anime may have a hard plot to find. Hell, it might not even have one. But I still found it enjoyable. But then again, it's not that hard to keep me entertained (^.^). It's a dark and mysterious story about a twelve year old boy named Ritsuka and a twenty year old college student named Soubi. Yes, it suggests a few things, they kiss a couple of times, and let's just say that Soubi, in my eyes, is about the definition of pervert. I don't really know why they classify this under yaoi, but I guess after a while you see why.  ART: I really loved the character designs in this! They all looked so smooth and beautiful to me.  SOUND: The subbed voices, in my opinion, matched the character designs very nicely. The only thing I couldn't stand was Yuiko's voice. After about eight episodes, I wanted to hurt her. But then again, that might be just due to her annoying character (Imagine Misa Amane from Death Note, only not THAT bad).  CHARACTER: These characters practically made me fall in love. They grabbed me and made me happy, sad, mad, and all those emotions that anime usually can't do to me. I yelled at my TV at times, I will admit...  ENJOYMENT: Somewhere in this incredibly long review, I must have said something about my enjoyment with this anime, so I guess that it's kinda self explanitory.  OVERALL: This anime could have easily been given a ten, BUT! I didn't reach the ending! I won't spoil anything, since when people spoil things I want to stab their eyes out, so don't worry. Let me just say that there had better be a sequel to the anime, because this was REALLY incomplete. They left a lot of things open, like who Septimal Moon is, which really bugged me. And something else, but I feel like that would be ruining something. But besides the ending, this anime, in my eyes, isn't really a MUST WATCH RIGHT FREAKING NOW, but a watch for one of those days where you have nothing to do, you could watch this.  Like I said in the beginning, I can already tell that some people are going to yell STATUATORY RAPE after watching the first episode, but really don't listen to them. There's really nothing that wrong with it.  All I can say is that if you liked Gravitation, you most likely will like this. ^.^  Thanks for reading! =3 ~Tracy;Recommended
8;Loveless;LottieHottie19;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LottieHottie19;10;I'll probably never be able to forget this anime, because every single episode touched me alot more than i expected. The music is amazing, the characters are loveable and the whole relationship between the two main characters is adorable. Seeing as it was only 12 episodes long, it was gutting when it ended, but that's probably the reason for it being so good.  Ritsuka has been different the past two years since his brother, Seimi had been murdered by the Seven Moons, and he doesn't see the point of living anymore. Until he meets Soubi, the adult, old friend of Seimi. He soon learns that Soubi is an important part of his life, and together they are Fighter and Sacrifice, even though they do not share the same name. Throughout the whole series the two begin to grow on each other and there bond is alot deeper than they'd expected.  I loved some of the things they did with the anime such as the ears, where if you had never lost your virginity with anyone and been in love then you would have ears. It was pretty obvious to see who had done what, and i loved that, because it was like you could read everyone like a book. Ritsuka's teacher still has her ears and she's a very shy character, and all of his friends have also got there ears.  The whole story is pretty confusing, seeing as the Seven Moons are not described until later episodes and the whole 'Name' and 'Bond' scenario is pretty strange. Seimi (Ritsuka's Brother) was called 'Beloved' and he shared a name with Soubi, until he died. Soubi was ordered by Seimi to love Ritsuka and become his fighter, even though Ritsuka's real name is 'Loveless' (one without love). So the two are not destined to be together.  You have to watch the anime to realise how beautiful it is, and really understand whats happening. Even if you don't like the romance there's still a lot of action with 'Spell Battles' and fighting.There is also Yuri (girl on girl) later in this anime if that's what your interested in.  So overall this anime is amazing and i love it. However, watching it a second time just depressed me, knowing i'd never be able to feel the excitement again, knowing there were more episodes to watch which i hadn't already seen. I'd recommend this anime to anyone.;Recommended
9;Loveless;_Daichi_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_Daichi_;10;This is my first review, so please bear with me.  The story line is pretty sketchy, but here goes the main charecter is very conserned about love, and doesn't like everyone saying they like/love him. He has problems that he doesn't want anyone to know about, so it adds to the mystery.  It isn't as much of a love story. It mainly deals with past/present/future destinies.  I liked the anime because it deals with a lot of 'what do i do now' stuff and some of the charecters are easy to relate to (In my case)  I know that this may not be helpfull......;Recommended

11;Loveless;GITface;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GITface;9;"When I first heard about this anime several months ago I can honestly say that I wasn't even remotely interested--the cat ears and tails were a turn off. However, recently, after noticing a great interest in the artwork (that of both the anime and manga), I decided to give Loveless a chance.  I wasn't disappointed.  The idea of 'Fighter' and 'Sacrifice' are fantastic and interesting concepts. The story itself is wonderful. Loveless is something that watchers can relate to--who hasn't lost someone they love?; who hasn't endured inner turmoils and/or anxieties?  I conquered all twelve episodes of the anime and eighty-five chapters of released scanlations in two days, simply because I couldn't get enough of the Loveless universe.";Recommended
12;Loveless;JerichoxBarrons;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JerichoxBarrons;10;Overall Loveless has always been one of my favorite anime series. I first watched it many years ago when I was in middle school. I decided to rewatch it since I forgot most of the plot.  The story behind Loveless has many different twists. You begin the anime with many questions, and end it with quadruple that amount. It is still a very beautiful story, about seeking love and learning to trust.  The art isn't bad for Loveless, since it is older. The soundtrack is completely beautiful and mesmerizing to me though. Both the opening and ending are soothing.  Loveless does a lot of character development and really lets you get to know the main characters. I would recommend Loveless to any anime lover.;Recommended

(ANN)  My thoughts: I really enjoyed watching this anime and wish they would do a season 2. I love Soubi, he's such an intriguing character. And the interaction between him and Ritsuka is great. I'd classify this anime as shounen-ai that could turn to yaoi if they did a second season and Ritsuka is older.  Update: I was able to find and download this anime in english dub and it was very well translated! I have to say I found it better in english because I could focus on the anime and not having to pause to read the subs.";Recommended
15;Loveless;PoisonSunflower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PoisonSunflower;7;The story never really finishes. He never finds the Murderer of his brother, and there are a lot of un-answered answers.

I truly laughed my laughed so hard that I started a coughing fit many times in this anime. It is truly enjoyable.;Recommended
16;Loveless;tg-jade;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tg-jade;7;The first episode definitely made me a fan. The characters (which come in pairs) were very effective in drawing attention and curiosity with how they express their feelings towards each other. How far will they go? What'll happen next? Is someone actually gonna lose their ears? What really happened to Seimei?  However, it was kinda disappointing how the series ended, without any action and without any answers, leaving the viewers with nothing at the last episode. The mystery and suspense of the story is very catchy and will make you want to know what'll happen next. But the end did not deliver much and did not reach the expectations set up by the (unanswered) issues in the beginning.  The story is promising and I think the characters have the potential to grow. I think the series is too short to make the story work and a second (answer) season would be greatly appreciated.;Recommended
17;Loveless;xxZBuck;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xxZBuck;9;"personally i likes this anime and hope that they do make a second series. It was finally starting to get really good towards the end and thats when they started to really pick up the story and add interesting aspects to it. Im rooting for a season 2 of ""loveless""its good and i hope in the next series they start to have Ritska be more willing to be outgoing and act more lively the way he was towards the end especially in the very last episode. personally I liiked this series because it was much different then all the other shounen ai in its genre but it was very intersting in the end. I would recommend other people watch it so that they definitley end up making a season 2. i also hope their are a lot more fight scenes as well as BL ones in the next series. it would be really interesting if the first episode of the next series sums up everything that happens from the last episode +5years into the future and the story takes of running from their already at full speed and kicking. But ill be happy if they just make a season2 personally. i also like that this wasn't one of those rapey BL stories. i would be interested to see it with more action and more romance. That would personally in my opionion make it really really good and put it above most all others aside from junjou romantica /ova/1/2/3&move super lovers 1 & 2 as well as all of the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi's.";Recommended
18;Loveless;christinnuendo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/christinnuendo;9;note: I am specifically writing this for people who have not seen the anime or read the manga, so I will not spoil anything. Also, frankly, I'm too lazy to write out the entire synopsis, so I'm please gather that information from other reviews. Thank you.  I genuinely struggled with deciding whether or not to rate this a 10, and I mean that entirely in a good way. It is quite a beautiful anime that tends to leave many confused, and I think that is what I enjoy most about it. It is incredibly mysterious and vague, using a great deal of metaphors (from my interpretation of it) to make a statement on innocence, virginity/sex, pedophilia, and adultism. I feel that this anime is not as straightforward as people seem to think, but it delves much deeper into the mind and in the reality of our society. If you have trouble catching metaphors and reading between the lines, I do not recommend this anime for you. I'm afraid to say that this anime is very confusing. Perhaps the manga clears it up better (I am certain that the ending will not leave as many questions unanswered). The plot is hard to follow, and there are many concepts that aren't explained. The main complaint that I've seen in other reviews is the fact that it doesn't explain most of its storyline. I blame that mostly on the fact that the anime itself doesn't nearly cover the entire Loveless series. I still recommend watching the anime, for it was HIGHLY enjoyable, despite its vagueness. This anime was truly beautiful and unique, covering many topics that are normally thought of as uncomfortable in our society (homosexuality, pedophilia, sex, etc.). I, for one, very much enjoyed it, so I would hope that others will as well.;Recommended
19;Loveless;hayjay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hayjay;8;I personally loved Loveless loved the story but there's a reason why I gave the story a 6... I was personally disappointed with the ending, and thought this anime could have used more episodes. The ending was not what I wanted, and I feel like they kinda rushed it. With this being said, the last episode is sort of a cliff hanger for me and left me with lots of questions as did Gravitation, and I HATE leaving an anime with many questions unanswered. To me, if I leave an anime with questions that doesn't make a good story. The story overall was really good, I loved the action, but I can't give it a higher grade since the story in my opinion is not completed. I would go into details of what questions I have but that would be giving away spoilers! Haha! Overall though, I recommend this anime! Loved the artwork! Sound was good and I was always excited to come home and watch it!;Recommended
0;Loveless;kiriska;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kiriska;6;"It's rare that a series leaves me at a complete loss for words, and I really don't mean that in a good way. I've managed to gathered the words now though, and here they are:  STORY - ...What story? Seriously, at what point is anything in this series explained? (Hint: never!) There are problems presented, sure -- Seimei, Ritsuka's older brother, was killed and he wants to find out who did it and why. Not really that intriguing or original, but it works, right? Additionally, Ritsuka has amnesia and is a &quot;completely different person&quot; than he was two years prior, but he doesn't know what happened. Also not that original, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, the series doesn't seem to focus very well on either problems and instead teases you by presenting a lot of leads that seem like they're going somewhere, but never do. Soubi, who should serve as Ritsuka's connection to Seimei refuses to say anything on the matter. In fact, as far as Rituska's troubles go, Soubi's pretty worthless for plot progression even if he does defend him from mysterious attackers (who are never explained). And his creepy shotacon ways seem like far, far too shameless an attempt to wind up the fangirls. I like shounen-ai well enough, and while I don't really care for shota, I can swallow it if it's done well. Well, this wasn't done well at all.  The story's only redemption may be that Ritsuka's social anxieties are addressed gradually throughout the series, and the subplot concerning his personality change and memories does see some progress. In fact, it might even be considered a good storyline if we ever got to find out what happened to him, but we don't! Does that even count as a spoiler? The fact that ultimately, nothing happens? The plot with Seimei seemed like it had potential at times -- all of the vague, unexplained hints did seem like they were going somewhere, and if you cocked your head sideways, you might have even been able to pick up clues to the mystery. The last episode seemed like it was trying to explain what was going on, but it was so garbled and nonsensical that it's almost impossible to draw any kind of conclusions from it, and in the end, there's nothing but a big, gaping void where all your answers should be.  The battle system in this series is something else that seemed to have potential. The concept of a Fighter and a Sacrifice is actually pretty interesting, though I think they would have survived without all the gratuitous bondage. Unfortunately, the actual fighting is never explained, and it's difficult to deduce where exactly anyone derives their power or how the mechanics of the fighting works. I really don't know why all of these things were sidestepped; it really doesn't seem like it should have taken that much time or effort to explain something that was so central to the whole Seven Moons and Seimei's murderers madness.  I haven't read the manga, but I get this distinct feeling that it's probably ten times better than this anime, because certainly it can't be worse. Like I said, the wisps of story here and there seemed to have potential, and it was just frustrating to see that almost none of them have a definite conclusion. It seems like this should have been a twenty-six episode series instead of twelve, or they should have spent more time on actual plot progression instead of random shota fluff and molestation. In the end, I think I just wasted four hours of my life watching this series, and that's about it. And even though I'm sure the manga is better, I'm left so frustrated with the series that I'm not sure I even care enough to go read it.  Addendum: The anime was apparently produced when only volumes 1-4 of the manga was out (the series is 8 volumes long), so they had limited source material. Still, I think they could have done a much better job -- certainly things like the fight system could have been addressed better anyway. And while they supposedly left the &quot;ending&quot; open for a possible sequel, there still could have still been an actual conclusion of some sort. But really, unless it's one of those long running shounen series, I don't think there's any reason to ever produce an anime for an unfinished series. It just leads to unpleasant bullshit like this and X/1999. :|  CHARACTER - Ritsuka is probably the best character in the series, though that isn't really saying much. In any case, he seems to be the only character that goes through any significant change throughout the series. His turmoil at the beginning of Loveless is very understandable, what with a crazy mother, no memories, and a dead brother. The sessions with his psychologist summed up his development pretty well, though it did kind of seem like a cheap way to present everything to the audience. His relationship with his friends moved up in a classic line graph as he was somewhat sporadic and inconsistent in the beginning and steadily progressed up towards &quot;real friendship.&quot; His relationship with Soubi... I guess it really wasn't that bad; his reaction to Soubi's advances were realistic: his indignation, disgust, and eventual worry. You could see his feelings change slowly as the series went on, and the relationship did contribute to Ritsuka's overall personality progression, so to that end, I guess it was all right.  Soubi is probably a much more multi-faceted character than the Loveless anime allowed him to be; I could tell by watching, but that didn't change the fact that he didn't end up being explored all that much. Because so little is revealed about his past, with Seimei or otherwise, you never know what his motivation for anything is, which was immensely irritating and frustrating. He tells Rituska some things, but then establishes a steady history of lies, so anything he says is questionable, even if they sound like they might, or even should, be true. Whether or not he really cares for Ritsuka always seems to be questionable, and his masochistic complex complicates the matter further -- not to mention it makes things ridiculously awkward. I think, in the end, you're supposed to gather that he's changed a little (for the better) since his days with Seimei, but it's really not that convincing at all.  All of the other characters were pretty generic, and a lot of them seemed pretty damn pointless too. Rituska's school friends seemed like they could have been plucked out of any other anime Japanese school ever. Sure, they contributed to the plot and Ritsuka's development, but they really weren't that interesting to watch. Kio, Soubi's roommate? Classmate? Random friend? (Ex-)boyfriend? I have no idea what their relationship is because, surprise, they never explained, but he was only fun because he addressed some of my thoughts on Soubi, namely his apparent raging perversion and pedophilia (though Soubi consistently denied these accusations). But other than that, another generic support character? Yeah. The same goes for Ritsuka's teacher and his psychologist, and the fact that both of them were randomly in love with one of the protagonists seemed like more pointless fanservice. All of the fighter pairs sent from Seven Moons were flat and boring -- they were sent to fight, yippee. Did they have their own goals or aspirations? Who knows? Subplot with the lesbians? Seemed like a lame ploy to allow for a convenient winner of that fight. Complete lack of intrigue.  Finally... this was the original reason I had no interest in watching this series. What the hell is the point of the cat ears? What does this contribute to anything at all? It just seems like a silly gimmick to invite giggles from the audience (fangirls think about this stuff anyway, do we really need to encourage them?), and to allow for lots of suggestive dialogue in the show. The only reason I could think of for this is to have &quot;proof&quot; that Soubi isn't randomly raping Ritsuka ('cause it sure seems like it sometimes). Here's an idea -- if your character is so inappropriate that you have to have a lame gimmick to prove his innocence, how about not writing him to be so outrageous in the first place? Certainly Soubi didn't need to make out with Ritsuka in the middle of every battle.  ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Resoundingly average. Ritsuka was cute and Soubi was your run-of-the-mill bishounen. All the other characters were similarly plain, and the backgrounds don't really invite rounds of praise either. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either. The animation was about the same, though I really thought the effects for the fights were unimpressive and cheap.  MUSIC - I'd actually heard the opening theme, &quot;Tsuki no Curse,&quot; long before I saw this series because it was composed by Yuki Kaijura. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with it then, and I remained unimpressed with it in the series. I'm not really sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't stand up against most of Kaijura's other work. The end theme by Kaori Hikita was similarly plain. The music throughout the series actually surprised me by how random it seemed. Most series, even if they don't have particularly great music, still manage to get tracks that are appropriate for their scenes: sad tracks for sad scenes, energetic tracks for fights, etc. Loveless is probably the first series where I've been confused at their music choices for various scenes... They had weird, mecha-style battle tracks that were far, far too exciting for the scenes they were in, and then strange, melodious tracks that conflicted with conversation-heavy scenes. Occasionally, they had some nice, soft vocal tracks that seemed to fit okay, but they weren't prominent enough to balance out the other randomness.  VOICE ACTING - Average.  OVERALL - I think the best way to watch Loveless is to treat it as a drinking game. Take a shot of vodka every time Soubi says &quot;suki dayo&quot; (&quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;I love you&quot; depending on context and translator). You'll be mad drunk by the second episode (seriously, he's a broken record) and will thus be too wasted to realize that the entire series has little substance, never answers any of your questions, has no ending, and is ultimately unsatisfying. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go bash in the brains of the person who recommended this series to me.";Mixed Feelings
1;Loveless;altergenesis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/altergenesis;6;"Highs: Engaging side characters; fascinating environment; crisp animation  Lows: Side characters play very little role; plot leaves many questions; confusing at times; in the end, nothing happens  Normally I am not one to take the time to watch a shounen-ai anime, although the animation and the plot intrigued me enough to give Loveless a chance. I was already taken in by the interesting setting; in which majority of the people in the world have cat ears on the tops of their heads. Seemed like something different and new.  Loveless starts off normally, with a young boy with a lot of angst and problems over his lost brother. The premise seems interesting enough as before you know it, he runs into his brother&rsquo;s friend, which at that time; Loveless begins to show its shounen-ai side. The abundance of characters in this anime is fantastic and each of them has great personalities that grow on you. One of the characters specifically, Hawatari Yuiko brings a lot of energy to the screen and brightens up an otherwise gloomy show. Although, the significance of these side characters are slim to none. They play a very little part in the actual plot and could have easily been written out, which is a shame since the side characters are far more interesting then the main ones.  There were a lot of ideas thrown out in Loveless, but very few of them were actually explored. This is truly a disappointment, there was so much that could have been drawn from the plot and in the end it didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s full potential. The abrupt ending could be partially to blame for this because Loveless lacks any sort of resolution, leaving us wondering if that was really in the end, with more questions rather then answers.  Loveless is a unique anime, with a great environment and engaging side characters, but seriously lacks in the department of story and plot. If bishounen and cat boys are your thing, then Loveless might be a title you want to consider, but otherwise, you&rsquo;ll have no love for Loveless.

2;Loveless;DIYDepression;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DIYDepression;6;"It's a pretty good anime, if you're into pedophilia!  Loveless is the story of a prepubescent boy who is being romantically groomed and pursued by an adult man. If that's your bag, then have a blast, because this is probably the biggest and most popular show that has been officially endorsed by NAMBLA. If you want cat boy yaoi without the unfortunate overtones of Loveless, then go play Lamento: Beyond the Void. If you want a yaoi without any of the creepy undertones, then you don't want yaoi.  With that said, it is a shame that the author of Loveless is probably one or two years away from being arrested for statutory rape, because everything else about the show is pretty okay. It's not great, mind you, but it's more than serviceable, especially considering that the hook for most people was ""cat boys do gay stuff."" This show could have potentially gone mainsteam if Ritsuka had been aged up a few years.";Mixed Feelings
3;Loveless;kuroror;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kuroror;5;I've been wanting to do a review of this anime ever since I watched it years ago. My memory might be a flaky but I think I remember enough.  As there are many reviews for this anime I want to focus on its aspect with the manga and why it disappoints me so much.  Loveless isn't your typical shounen-ai, it never was. Imagine my disappointment when I watched this 12 episode anime of an on going manga I love, the disappointment coming from the fact that Loveless was turned into one of those really bad, cheap shounen-ai/yaoi anime. And this is what sells, girls who enjoy watching boys kiss without an actual story. But Loveless isn't two boys kissing, it's a complex physiological story intertwine with mystery and the anime went completely passed that.  The artwork and animation is fine since this is from the person who made the designs for Gundam 00.  If your a fan you've probably watched it. Is it good? It's fun to watch if you're interested in the gay aspect of it but it does not do the manga justice at all. Overall, I truly wish one day this amazing manga receives an adaptation that does it justice.;Mixed Feelings
4;Loveless;yuuya_heiwajima;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yuuya_heiwajima;5;It's a shame, because this anime could have been so good.  But there is a limit on just how many loose ends you can leave at the ending of a series. Preferably, you leave none. Loveless left all of them! I do not know what happened here, it seriously feels as though the second half of this anime was just chopped off. It's more like a 12-episode advertisement for the manga than a proper series, setting up a promising story and then leaving you utterly unsatisfied so that you have to go and read if you want to find any kind of resolution to the story.  I got a reasonable amount of enjoyment of it, simply because I like BL. Those scenes were the only thing that redeemed this for me. If you don't like BL, I don't think there is anything for you here but disappointment.;Mixed Feelings
0;Loveless;Greenwaves31;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Greenwaves31;3;"The yaoi fangirls are going to kill me here. Loveless stands up with Gravitation, Junjou Romantica, and Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi as one of those BL anime that all yaoi fans love. While out of all of those the only one I legitimately enjoyed was Gravitation, that is just a matter of personal taste. Junjou and Hatsukoi are at least somewhat decent, especially when compared to what BL anime that came before them were like. With that out of the way I can safely say that Loveless is one of the few anime that made me want to claw my own eyes out.  The story centers around Ritsuka Aoyagi, a grade school boy who lost all of his memories two years prior to the start of the series. At that time, he also did a complete 180 in personality, going from an outgoing and popular boy who didn't have the best grades to a student with perfect grades who avoids any kind of social interaction. This apparently put such a strain on his mother that she began frequently beating him (and much worse in the manga) and claiming that he isn't her son, but someone else in her son's body. Apparently, if he does anything that the old Ritsuka wouldn't do, his mother will beat him. Things were at least tolerable for awhile, since his older brother, Seimei, protected him from his mother's beatings, but then Seimei was discovered burned to death in Ritsuka's classroom. The anime itself begins after all this when Ritsuka is transferred to a new class. A girl named Yuiko tries to befriend him, but Ritsuka regards her coldly since she's only doing it because her classmates put her up to it. After receiving harsh criticism from Ritsuka, Yuiko decides not to be pushed around by her classmates anymore and pushes for a genuine friendship with Ritsuka. After that, Ritsuka meets Soubi, a man who claims to be an old friend of Seimei's. Soubi tells Ritsuka about his arrangement with Seimei that if anything were to happen to Seimei, Soubi would ""belong"" to Ritsuka. Soubi turns out to be Seimei's ""sentouki,"" a companion who would fight battles with magic, while Seimei was the ""sacrifice,"" or the person who would take the damage in these battles. Since Seimei is now dead, Soubi must become Ritsuka's sentouki and Ritsuka will become the sacrifice.  Oh, and did I mention that it's a huge plot point that virgins have cat ears? Yeah, way to throw random sex into the plot. That's one thing I really hate.  However, after that huge info dump, nothing is really completely explained again. Most of the episodes consist of Soubi battling another pair of magic fighters and trying to protect Ritsuka in between molesting him. The story itself is so poorly explained that I had no idea what was going on half the time and ended up consulting wikipedia and the manga several times during the course of an episode, and that is not a good thing. I gave it a decent rating merely because it was interesting, but it never did anything more than that. I never really even knew why half these characters were fighting other than some taboo about the fact that Ritsuka and Soubi shouldn't be a team because both their names aren't ""Loveless"" or something like that. The only thing I could understand was the adult molesting the child frequently. Hooray for pedophilia, I guess! Especially on an already traumatized and broken child!  The art was...well, it was actually fairly good, at least on the characters. The backgrounds were a bit lazy most of the time, but at least the magic battles usually looked good, and the character designs were at least distinct. However, the style reminded me a lot of Higurashi in that, while it used bright colors, it always looked like there was a film over the animation giving it a weird misty look that seemed out of place, though that could be because of the poorly done backgrounds.  The sound was easily the best part of the show. I can't really say the dub of either language was particularly outstanding, but the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. 'Nuff said. It's far from being her best work, but it's Yuki Kajiura nonetheless. What's not to like?  The characters are not so lucky. Most of them are boring, unlikable, or underdeveloped. The worst offender of this is Soubi himself. Since he's one of the two main characters, he should be someone the audience can cheer for and want to see succeed, or at least care somewhat about what he's doing. I really didn't feel anything toward him, even when part of his history as revealed. He has very little personality, and he's constantly flip-flopping when it comes to his actions. I can at least understand his motives of wanting to keep Ritsuka safe, but it's hard to relate to that when he's such a shameless pedophile. The only reason I gave the characters a decent rating is because of Ritsuka. He wouldn't have much of an effect if he was a side character, but as a main character he does well. He has a very distinct personality, and his development is very well handled. Sure, he starts off rather depressed at first, but he has every right to be, and unlike some anime characters he does grow quite a lot. His circumstances barely change at all, so the fact that he's able to change his attitude is impressive.  However, the fact that Ritsuka's such a good character actually works against the series. When you actually care about a character, it's not enjoyable to watch him suffer so much without any happy ending in sight. Nobody who knows about his abuse is doing anything about it, even Soubi who claims to love him. Soubi's sexual advances on a boy who's underage even in Japan, especially one who has enough mental trauma on top of amnesia and a possible personality disorder, is just disgusting. I continued watching until the end in order to see something good finally happen to this kid, and it really doesn't. I could barely stand a moment of this, so the enjoyment factor was very low. I was able to enjoy the few quiet moments Ritsuka had with his friends, at least, but that's about it.  All in all, there were a few things in this series that were okay, and the main character is really good. However, it's just unpleasant to watch and I find the fact that all of this is fetishized to be disgusting. Any time I hear someone praising this series, I feel a little sick inside. I suppose people are allowed to like what they want, but I personally find this show terrible. The overall score of 3 out of 10 is surprisingly generous, and I only gave it because of Ritsuka and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. That's all.";Not Recommended
1;Loveless;xhimekittyx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xhimekittyx;1;"Before I begin, I am going to say it outright - I HATE YAOI. Yaoi-fan girls drive me crazy. I have yet to meet some mature ones, but hey, they probably exist right? And guess what? I'm a girl too and I hate yaoi :o le gasp. Also I rarely will review anime I hate with a passion (unless DBZ) and this is the only other exception. When someone said I should watch this - I watch about 5 minutes of episode 1 and stopped. Why? I read the plot. What is wrong with the plot you ask? To delve into what society is today, homosexuality is becoming more acceptable, which is, of course, what you would expect from a growing society. However - PEDOPHELIA IS NOT. Ritsuka is 12 years old-not even in puberty, and some creepy old guy named Soubi is kinda ... making moves on him? Ummm...yea, pedophelia is realllyyyyy acceptable, hmm? I'm being sarcastic. Though I detest yaoi, if they were closer in age, it would not be so bad, but poor Ritska is 12, Soubi 20 -something years old. Honestly, if anyone thinks this is ""cute"" or ""aww, its love!"" you need to get a reality check. Last I heard, when some poor unfortunate child is a victim of pedophelia, most people get angry and ask why someone would do such a thing. This anime makes pedophelia seem natural, which, it is not. It's creepy, sick and twisted and it makes me feel ashamed that girls like me find this stuff appealing. Also, don't think I'm a homophobe for hating yaoi. I'm not. Get your facts straight. To the sane people who still believe pedophelia is just ... NO, then I say - you are a godsend. To those who find it adorable like in this anime...all I gotta say it...why?";Not Recommended
2;Loveless;Galactic_Kitten;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Galactic_Kitten;1;While I recognise the strength of emotion in this series, and the beauty, I was never able to get past the fact that Sobi is a pedophile. There is nothing wrong with Shonen-ai, but this goes way beyond that. You have a man in his twenties chasing after a boy who is 12, barely starting puberty. Even if Loveless was in his later teens, 15 or 16, I'd be able to deal with that, but 12? It's sick. I could understand if it was a brotherly love, Loveless lost his brother, and finds it hard to believe that people could love him. While they do handle the age gap gracefully, it's too much for me.  But the child molesting isn't the only thing I disliked. There is never any explanation of why the battles go on, what happened to Loveless' brother, etc. Some stories can get away with unanswered questions, but not this one.  I originally watched the series, not knowing about this pedophilia, and I liked some of the concepts. The society is based much on sexuality, in fact they have cat ears and tails that the people lose when they lose their virginity. It's unique, and I would like it if it wasn't for Sobi being a child molester.;Not Recommended
3;Loveless;AnshiAneko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnshiAneko;1;DISCLAIMER: I “thank” AWC’s Random Challenge for making me watch this… and honestly thank my friend who suffered together with me.  Also, there are a few spoilers ahead.  There are shounen-ai anime. There are bad shounen-ai anime (which are, let’s be honest, almost all of them). And then there is Loveless, a cacophony of things that just shouldn’t exist.  Yeah, of course, there is this really deep plot about Ritsuka being Loveless and the other guy being Beloved…. lol, nope, there’s not. Let’s be honest, this anime is about a little boy being wooed by a grown up, adult man. I’m not even kidding. But let’s start from the beginning. I’m presenting to you 5 reasons why Loveless is a bad thing and every “fujoshi” or whoever who enjoys this is either a 13 years old OR just a sick person:  1) Ears One of the main aspects of Loveless are cat ears and tail. Cute, right? What’s better than a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail. …I’ll tell you what. How about a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail… without attaching to it some weird “plot” device? Quotes because it’s not related to the plot at all. Let’s say I’m writing a story and I want a cute cat boy in it. How do I justify it? Maybe I’ll just add cat ears to everyone? Ooor I could make this world full of animal-hybrids? No, I’ve got it! IF THE PERSON HAS CAT EARS. THEN IT MEANS. THAT THEY’RE A VIRGIN! YES, GENIUS! …..I get it, it’s probably part of some Japanese weird thing or something. We know Japanese. They are… pretty special in some aspects. But how exactly is okay to just let show off someone’s privacy? It’s everyone’s own choice how to handle their virginity and yes, if someone still has their “cat ears” in 23 it’s completely okay!  2) People’s view of Shinonome … This should perhaps be 1.5, because it’s mainly a continuation of the first point. I myself really disliked Ritsuka’s teacher, but that was because of her character (or… “character” :’)). Shinonome, as a 23 years old teacher who still has her ears, is often a target of remarks about her it. Seme-san… sorry, Soubi, refers to her as “childish” despite her being older then him. And why is that? Try to guess… I’ll say it again… IT’S OKAY TO BE VIRGIN IN 23! SHE COULD BE AN ASEXUAL OR SOMETHING! OR SHE’S SAVING HERSELF FOR THE ONE TRUE LOVE! OR I DON’T KNOW! JUST LET HER BE!  3) The psychologist Don’t get me wrong, it’s completely okay to have a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Everyone has their problems and problems exist to be solved. But what’s not okay is… a grown ass psychologist woman with… a weird crush on her patient?? Who is a 12 years old boy?? What even was that?! What was the point?! Was it there just for the fangirls to have someone to hate on, or what?! Psychologists are supposed to be profesionals and this is casting a really bad light on this important profession.  4) Ritsuka the Sex Bomb Yes, I mean that Ritsuka. That 12 years old little boy who should go play football (…soccer? ‘murica?) or computer games or something. There were just a few characters who DIDN’T want to get the D… or ass… or I don’t know. I have to remind you, that he is 12 years old. Twelve years old.  5) Soubi There he is, the awesome Seme-san, who actually has more than 1,000 Member Favorites on MAL (just… why). He’s a 20 years old art student (let’s say it again: TWENTY years old). His favorite hobbies include fondling Ritsuka, kissing Ritsuka, stalking Ritsuka, breaking into Ritsuka’s room through the window and, finally, offering Ritsuka to “take his ears away”. And we all know what’s that a metaphor for. Also, he’s a masochist who wants Shota-kun to punish him. RIP in pieces.  BONUS ROUND) The Relationship Just to say it again for those in the back rows. The main plot of the story is twenty years old guy being lovey dovey with a twelve years old boy. Soubi’s maybe not a pedophile by psychiatric terminology (I’ll suppose that Ritsuka is already in puberty…) but, you know… I hope that I don’t have to say how much of not okay it is.  Yeah, that would be it. The author was either smoking something when writing this or just has some really big issues. The plot, aside the gays™, was non-existent and most of the characters were really, really creepy. And not the good kind of creepy.  But this is a review, so I should say also something nice. Uhm… the canon lesbian ship was a nice surprise? But, well, it’s Japan. Name one canon lesbian ship in anime that doesn’t have a nice, mostly healthy relationship. Seriously, if the author can write a cute lesbian pair why not also write a cute gay pair? It’s not that hard.;Not Recommended

STORY: story was very unoriginal ,very poorly developed and left me bored out of my mind in by the second episode. And i honestly do think they could have developed it if they wanted to even within the 13 episodes they had cause most of the anime is the characters doing NOTHINGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT AND STORY IS SHITTY BUT YOU COULD AT LEAST TRY EXPLAINING THINGSSSSSSSS!!!! oh and the second last episode is a festival episode. not only that but literally nothing happens asides from this random dude popping up in front of this middle school student (i don't recall their names BECAUSE THEY ARE UNWORTHY BUT ANYWHO) and starts telling him he loves him and was chosen by his dead brother to become his servant. that's it! and then there's these random fights that are completely unexplained and those battles are supposed to be them ""casting spells"" in each other's direction. oh and by spells i mean them saying a single random word like "" negate"" or ""defend"". apparently who ever made this has read the dictionary. congrats! and of course the cat ears (which are not explained in the anime) that apparently represent onE'S VIRGINITY???????????? WHAT?? HOW FUCKING DUMB IS THAT???? SO YES STORY IS SHIT!!!!!ALSO THE MAIN CHARACTER'S REAL NAME IS LOVELESS APPEARANTLY! ISN'T THAT DUMB? DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S DUMB? PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS!  ART: i've seen worse but it was still bad!! their eyes were sinking into their faces! at least i got that impression! the main character's blond lover person has a chin he could stab you with. the effects in the battles were terrible!! and every time they had fire, it looked like it didn't fit in at all! not to mention all bad use of negative space throughout the thing. oh and the butterflies...man they tried sO FUCKING HARD ON THE BUTTERFLIES YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!! BUT THEY FAILED! THEY FAILED...YEAH. ALSO THE CONCEPT ART IS SHITTY AND MEDIOCRE AND SIMPLY LACKING  SOUND: the opening was so...high pitched...like really high, it sounded almost squeaky to me. and i didn't bother listening to the ending. the sound track made no sense. the music didn't fit the scene most of the time. oh and they try so hard to make some parts sound epic by randomly adding an electric guitar but it didn't fit in at all and failed. i didn't like it.  CHARACTERS: the character designs like i mentioned were shit. the character had no development what so ever throughout the thing and some characters didn't even serve a purpose in the thing at all! scratch that all the characters served no purpose except for the two guys and maybe the ugly pink haired girl. the only character that develops is loveless and by develop i mean he goes from being the annoying ass tsundere who yells at everyone to not like him and then complains about being loveless which as i mentioned is his FUCKING NAME, to liking people but still being an annoying ass tsundere  ENJOYMENT: i laughed at how dumb it was in the opening and half the first episode but then was bored out of my mind.

5;Loveless;RedvelvetDaisuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RedvelvetDaisuki;3;"I searched far and wide to download the rare English dub DVD release for this anime and to my disappointment; it is one of the most dreadful and dull anime that I have cross paths with.  Story (5/10)  I can see that the author is struggling and striving for a good story. She used a lot of symbolisms, life problems, and tries to make a sort of fantasy battle anime combined with romantic drama.  First of all, you cannot just make an unknown and boring character jump right ahead with another character without even explaining the connection between the two because viewers cannot relate and feel what is being felt by the said character. Yaoi scenes felt lifeless because of the distance between the audience and the character; henceforth, the romantic lines are rubbish and sound cheesy.  Although she, the author, have the desire to express herself with common life problems, such as the users and the used, loving one’s self, the consequences of love and so on and so forth, the characters are lifeless, edgeless, brainless, colorless and everythingless and killed the entire story. If they have extended the anime into two seasons and give more depth to the story and the characters, it might just be worth watching.  Art (4/10)  When I first saw the anime, I think it immediately gave me anime-cat-phobia. Yeah it is cute but I cannot see the relevance of cats to the story. I understand stories with demons who has usually has something to do with death, deals and such, but when I see cat people, it tells me that they want the story to be cute and that is all. It reminds me of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s broadway musical “Cats.” The difference between Andrew’s Cats and this type of cat though is that his cats has better, more distinct and fierce personalities and does not aim to be cute.  Sound (6/10)  The sound is good at least. Thank my God of Conquest for giving this show something good to remember by – that its music is good enough and the sound was not that bad at all.  Character (1/10)  A character’s personality, for me, is one of the most important elements in an anime or in any piece of literature because they are the ones who drive the story into a good route where the audience could enjoy. The characters are way below the line and do not even feel realistic when they say their lines. I am not sure if the author is aiming for male character with a strong feminine side or what. If so, Ritsuka feels like an awkward male character who immediately surrendered to a female life under the hands of Soubi. Soubi is one of the most robotic and monotonous characters that I had ever came across with – in other words, boring. Yuiko, on the other hand is an annoying, stupid and a useless female character. Characters like her should only exist in a show that has characters with strong and influential personalities. I could go on but there are so many characters with, if not annoying and boring, unrealistic personalities.";Not Recommended
6;Loveless;Demona697;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Demona697;4;OK so here goes my first review, wish I could say I'm writing this cause I loved the anime so much, but I really can't. I actually wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. First off I have to give the story a 3 and here's why: When I rate a story I take into account the ending too, if your like me this read this. The ending isn't really one, to me it felt like a longer series that just got cut off. They don't explain the big secret mystery of the whole series, and the last episode actually left me with more questions than i had before, like they were trying to hook you for a season 2 that never came. I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules. Now Art, that i give a 7: Yeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people. 6 for the sound: The sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either. Characters 4: Now this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd. Enjoyment 3: I say this because of the ending mostly. I mean the whole series they keep building you up with this whole mystery thing that keeps you watching, hoping for a reveal, only to go, WTH at the end. They explain nothing really and actually leave you with even more questions at the end, which I find Very Annoying! So Overall 4: Interesting at first, makes you want to know all the secrets, makes you want to understand the characters and see where they will end up. In the end leaves you wholly disappointed. Only thing I can say is it probably came from a manga and if so maybe that is better or if you know the manga you might get and like this. Otherwise, if your like me and just wanted to enjoy an interesting story and romance, DON'T BOTHER!  P.S. sorry if this offends anyone who actually liked the show, but this irritated me so much I had to write this.;Not Recommended
7;Loveless;SleepyWicked;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SleepyWicked;3;Umm this basically doesn't have plot... Besides virgins have cat ears and a tail? I mean the only actually ok character was the aforementioned cat-eared virgin boy of 12 years old. He was a somewhat relatable pre-teen with his horrible social anxiety. Otherwise the whole thing was mediocre at best. And horrifying at other moments. Especially since his love interest was a 21 year old man. Yay casual pedophilia? And double trouble the guy who was with the 21 year old dude before this is also underaged. So we know he has a type. I don't get how this is popular and is counted on the same level as something like Gravitation. Made me feel icky watching it.;Not Recommended
8;Loveless;Mylaerla;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mylaerla;4;"It's my first review. So please be kind.  I must say that I really loved watching Loveless and actually liked the story until it ran out of episodes. The biggest problem is that the story gets more and more complicated and in the end... no one explains a thing.  The story is generally about Ritsuka who has amnesia and whose brother Seimei has died. So Ritsuka tries to find out who killed Seimei but we actually never see that happen. To get things more complicated we have a guy named Soubi who was Seimei's ""Fighter"" but refuse to tell anything that would help Ritsuka to find the killer. So basically he is there as an yaoi element.  Sadly, the series doesn't seem to focus on the main story and just adds more and more different elements and unfortunately, it makes the whole thing so confusing that when you finish all episodes, you either dislike it, try to desperately find second season or both.  I myself think that Loveless is worth watching but it will leave you confusingly think what would happen next. To say something good, I would like to mention that I really liked the art and the opening was pretty good too.";Not Recommended
9;Loveless;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;3;"“God, what is wrong with you people?!” That is the only thing I was thinking while watching this show many years ago when it was very famous amongst the yaoi fangirls. It is the anime that made me realize their brains are full of hay and gave up on the genre altogether. It’s just too nauseating with no bloody payback! I mean just look at the people who made this. Animated by J.C. Staff, which translates to retarded fan service. Directed by Kou Yuu who has made equally bad gay anime, plus Chrono Crusade and Familiar of Zero which despite their hype and not being gay are still bad for pacing reasons.  And now that we know it’s going to be bad, let’s get a bit more into the story. Or the crumbs of story it has. First of all the setting makes no bloody sense and they never tried to explain it; you just need to accept it as it is. Which doesn’t sound like much of a problem but trust me in this particular case it’s a major downer. Ok, check this out, virgins in the series have cat ears. And when they stop being virgins, those ears drop. WHY IS THAT? Beats me, for all I care it’s just an excuse to throw in cute animal ears on people and to be able to tell who still has his or her cherry intact by just looking at his head. And did I notice an elementary kid in the background with no ears at a certain point? That’s just… EWWW!  So what else is there in this setting besides being impossible to hide you are still untouched? Oh, but of course, being gay is so normal to the point your own relative’s lover comes to take a taste out of you too like it’s a normal thing to do. Man, I am telling you the moral standards in this world are so loose.  So this super hot gay dude comes to the OBVIOUSLY VIRGIN protagonist and tells him the following. “I used to be your brother’s partner in war (and OBVIOUSLY bed too) but now he got killed, so the logical thing to do is to come after you, so you will be my new partner.” Another thing the setting never bothered to explain if the laws in this place really work like that. I mean everything else looks pretty standard but then WHAM these things come out of nowhere.  So the protagonist and his new… partner are to investigate how his brother got killed. He also has to deal with the whole depression issue over his death and to start trusting people again. You know; opening up. Getting closer. Hugging. Kissing. And having sex with your brother’s gay lover. And surely, this other dude seems more interested in that than to reveal the truth of the brother’s death. He even comes out and says it to his face. “I am sooo gonna take away those ears of yours my little love toy.” EWWWWWWW!  So at first it appears to be a story about getting over your sadness, trusting people, exposing the ones who are responsible for your brother’s death, as well as losing your innocence to a gay dude. Sounds like a lot of stuff, right? Guess how many of those issues are resolved by the end of the show. NONE! ZERO! Nothing happens! You get 12 episodes of nothing but a deviant build up which results to freaking nothing! AND THEY CALL THIS A MASTERPIECE!  What the devil is there to like in this show? The production values? They are barely average. The story? Not only it lacks exposition to its own in-laws, but it also has no conclusion. The characters? They don’t develop in any way and are quite the gay uke/seme stereotypes. Plus, I find nothing cute in people with dog ears; especially when said dog ears sprout on top of their scull and above an already normal pair of ears. THAT IS DISGUSTING! And so is butt-sex. Which doesn’t even occur in this show so I see no reason why the fujoshis like it so much.  In other words, there is nothing to love in this show, hence the title. I am losing faith in humanity every time I witness the crap that sell and give birth to even worse crap. It is a terrible show I do not recommend to anyone. Besides of course those retarded women who get their thingies wet by looking at mutated dog ears sprouting out of their sculls. EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

10;Loveless;cupidcryptid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cupidcryptid;3;"Just a warning, there will be spoilers ahead.  I had to fight myself to finish this anime. The the plot to this anime is nonexistent, as the main premise is Ritsuka is obsessed over his brother's death. I know the incident was quite traumatic however, the show failed to depict it as such. The only interesting point in the story (Septimal Moon) was hidden from Ritsuka and the viewer; maybe if the story had started from a different time (like the future) Septimal Moon could have been used as a plot device. It is my understanding that only a few volumes of the manga were out when the anime was made. Ritsuka's and Soubi's relationship may raise some eyebrows however, this is a work of fiction. The author's intention was so appeal to a certain audience and as an author, they have the liberty to write what they want. Also if Soubi really cared about Ritsuka, he would've tried to get him away from his abusive mother. However is is quite clear Soubi is only with Ritsuka because of Seimei's orders. Another thing that bothered me about Loveless is it's depiction the female cast: all of them were crybabies. No one over the age of five cries like that. I felt like many of the characters, and the world overall was underdeveloped. The fight scenes were boring. When Soubi was injured, I felt nothing. Some merits of Loveless was the relationship between Yamato and Kouya. Their story was more compelling than that of the main characters which is a little shocking. There were many unanswered questions. The opening I skipped each time. Overall I felt that Loveless fell short on many things. Wouldn't watch again.";Not Recommended
11;Loveless;Alesko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alesko;1;Oh boii. Many years ago when I found out what word yaoi means I also found out about some anime related to this topic. And this is how I came upon this mistake. This is one really weird universe. First of all, the aspect of virgins having animal ears and tails. Why. Second of all, those pairs of people that have some kind of abilities... for what. What's the point of any of this? There is no point. They just fight and get hurt for the sake of some drama. Many people behave so so strangely. Like this grown man hitting on a schoolboy, or the teacher that's relieved that he doesn't date anyone, or his whole family with that crazy mother and don't even get me started on his brother. I really don't know what else to say. It's really bad. Not recommending it to anyone. It doesn't even have an ending. It doesn't explain anything. This is just a random mess.;Not Recommended
0;Love x Holic: Miwaku no Otome to Hakudaku Kankei - The Animation;slaaack666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slaaack666;6;"""Demi-human races, or ""demis"", exist in this world.""  Story: In a world where humans and demi-humans coexist, our protagonist Amano finds himself in a school full of hot demi-human girls and tries desperately to get a date, always to no avail. But his luck is about to change as he gets some vampie blood into his bloodstream (in a very, very, very stupid anime-esque accident), making him a walking pheromone spray and turning his body fluids into an awakening essence, which can fully awaken a demi-human's latent powers.  Art: Art was mostly good but a bit rough a times, especially with the hands, feet and sometimes faces. I also noticed 2 or 3 loops with coloring mistakes. Animation was okay. The angles were fantastic though, such a breath of fresh air seeing so many greatly positioned shots, especially outside the sex scenes.  Sound: Here is my biggest complain. The voices were good and all but the kid wouldn't stop moaning loudly as fuck like a little bitch throughout the whole thing, to the point that it was pretty much unbearable and I couldn't get into the mood anymore. Good sound effects. Sountrack was fine, just a bit low.  Character: The girls were pretty boring, actually. The dark-skinned one, Seira, was pretty hot but nothing out of the ordinary, just your regular gyaru (fucking loved the part she bullies the old man, though). The protagonist was horribly annoying because of all that moaning, and an overall desperate dimwit.  Enjoyment: I loved the angles, but that's about the only thing this hentai did well and differently. The setting is interesting, but the story execution was stupid from the beginning to end. Could've enjoyed it better, but the excessive kid's moaning turned me off so, so much that it made the whole thing drag quite a bit.  Overall: Generic at best, insufferable at worst and a prime example of why I dislike male voice acting in hentai.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Stage!!: Chotto ja Nakutte;whiteteeth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whiteteeth;7;If you are planning to watch this OVA i suppose you have watched the series already. If you haven't i suggest you do it first, as you will probably won't understand what is going on.  If you haven't read the manga which this series was based of, the OVA covers chapter 16 of volume 4. It starts with Ryouma finishing recording a movie special, and being anxious to go back home and see Izumi again, after they had their first time together nights ago. But back home, for some reason, Izumi doesn't seem to be ready to see his boyfriend again --- won't spoil what follows.  It's a typical episode of the saga, funny, adorable with a bit of sexyness. Maybe i would have preferred if they had decided to adapt another chapter of the manga, instead of this one that doesn't really have much of a story to tell... but if you are a fan of this anime, it's awesome to be able to see this characters animated again, so don't miss the chance and go watch it!;Recommended
0;Love Stage!!: Chotto ja Nakutte;pleochroic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pleochroic;4;Only watch this OVA if you have seen the anime, otherwise you won't get anything out of it.  IMO too much time was wasted on Ryouma's filming -- generally I find that OVAs that follow a single manga chapter or two are wasting too much time on irrelevant things that make sense in the progression of the manga, but make the adaptation have less impact than it could.  The twist is excellent, and really got my hopes up for a moment -- I complained about stereotypical roles in my review of the anime -- but then the creators went right back to stereotype, so this was rather meh for me. Maybe it's heartwarming if you love these characters, but I never invested that much into them.;Not Recommended
0;Love Stage!!;fearlessEdition;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fearlessEdition;8;I am a straight male.  This show is pretty good.  I initially wrote off this show after seeing the now slightly famous intro scene, but soon, a joke amongst friends turned into a marathon of the six episodes that were out at the time. Every week after that, I looked forward to Wednesdays, where I'd get to see the next episode of Love Stage. At this point, after completing the series, the true question is this:  Why did I enjoy the show to the extent that I did?  I mean, it is quite normal for one to enjoy a show that is that is directed towards a different target audience, (I.E. shoujos) and I have nothing but respect for yaoi and the culture, but me enjoying this would seem as a bit extreme...except its not.  What this show does well, and likely the biggest reason to why I enjoyed it, was the characters. I will say, I enjoyed the mere presence of almost every single character in this show. The first of the two protagonists is Izumi, the more feminine character of the relationship, and the youngest member of a family of world class entertainers. He has a dream to become a manga artist, however his complete lack of skill causes his family to worry to quite a large extent. Now, there is more to Izumi's wonderful eyes- His character is well developed throughout the show. We get to see all the trails and tribulations he goes through, whether it be with the relationship between him and the other protagonist, which I'll get to in a sec, or the constant tension with his family, who almost sees him as a lost cause. Izumi certainly does go through some entertaining developments throughout the show. The largest cause of this is the other male in the relationship, Ryouma. Ryouma is a growing celebrity in Japan, being seen in commercials and dramas frequently. As the masculine man in the relationship, is it his duty to take charge and progress the relationship along, and this works to create a dynamic between the two characters that I personally found quite entertaining to watch. The other characters, while not particularly developed, certainly add to the overall show- They accentuate the protagonists, while at the same time, being likable. Characters like Izumi's brother, a member of a rock band modeled off the actual manga writer's brother, make for good laughs, as well as Rei, the manager of Izumi's family. The beautiful thing is, all of these characters are likable: you can relate to their issues, and actually care about what becomes of them. When a character cried, I felt sad. When they were happy, so was I. This is the shows strongest point. All characters have their own moments in the story which makes for a good time.  (Speaking of good time, I will warn that the show, while not a hentai, does contain its fair share of...*scenes* in it, so do be prepared for that.)  As for the story, it is actually nothing quite special, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. Does it take risks? Not particularly, but for what the show is trying to accomplish, (Displaying the relationship between the main characters.) it is quite serviceable. Without spoiling too much, the show begins with a standard romantic, almost love at first sight affair, but quickly turns into a comedic tale about a yaoi relationship. The best part about all this, is that it is quite hilarious. The actual chemistry between the characters is almost more important than the story said chemistry is attempting to progress in the first place. Every scene attempts to have a funny moment, whether it be regarding the hilarity of Izumi's manga, or the conversations between him and Ryouma. So honestly, the story may be weak, but that may be the point.  Technically, the show is quite decent. Animation is quite solid here. Nothing to write home about, honestly, but character movements are crisp, and the palette is quite vibrant, adding much to the style of the show. (I mean, Izumi's eyes!) Keen eyed individuals would notice some shoddy art quality on occasion, such as inconsistent character drawings, but this is a nit-pick at worst. Regarding the soundtrack, I would not likely listen to the tracks outside of the show, but they do serve the show well. Songs play at the right times, while the tracks do not stand out, they certainly do fit well with the emotions a particular scene is trying to emanate. The OP, but SCREEN mode, fits in very well with the show. These guys are fairly new to the anime scene, and I do hope to hear them featured in more shows down the road. The ED is slightly less appealing to me, but still works quite well.  So yeah, Love Stage. This is the first yaoi show that I've every completed, and while I do not believe that I'll be actively searching for more in the genre, I would be lying if I say I did not enjoy this show. The show is only 10 episodes, and while the length did not hurt the show, I definitely believe that it would have slightly benefited from the extra two episodes, for developmental reasons which you will likely see. Nonetheless, I'd recommend it. Go watch it, you will invested in the characters, feel their emotions, and...yeah I still cant believe I watched a yaoi.  Have fun.;Recommended
1;Love Stage!!;HeyYouPikachu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HeyYouPikachu;10;This is now one of my favourite animes, this is my first review so bare with me, I've never felt like writing one til i watched this anime. As a fan of yaoi/shounen ai this was a breath of fresh air as it's so hard to find decent animes in this genre because there are little to choose from and they're lacking in every department.  This is a -absolute must- watch for fans of the yaoi and shounen-ai, but also i would highly recommend it for those new to it and want to check it out, it would make a good starter into these genres because it's quite cute, nice animation, likeable characters, good development in only 11 episodes and also it's quite tame when it comes to the sexual things compared to other ones like Junjou Romantica, yet it's still enough too excited about.  Izumi stared in a wedding commerical with Ryouma when they were younger and since then Ryouma has loved her..ahem him... ever since. Later they meet in a reunion commercial and Ryouma's love is releaved.. and so is Izumi's real gender, but that doesn't stop his love. And so Ryouma pursues Izumi. Izumi plays the Uke, he's very cute, and loveable i just wanted to squeeze him to bits. Ryouma as a famous actor I wasn't expecting him to be a such a lovable character. He was so sweet, caring and kind.. it was cute seeing what love does to him, he was the kind of guy I would want as my man. Overall I really liked them as a couple. The supporting charcaters were great aswell, especially Izumi's brother he's quite funny.  Though there's only 11 episodes I was worried no way that's enough and I'll be disappointed cause it will leave me hanging incomplete. But actually it developed further than I thought in such the short time it was nice. Unlike other romance animes you have to wait for 24+ episodes just for a confession or even a kiss. I was excited for each episode and how it'd progress next.  The art was nice and especially the detail in Izumi eyes, so pretty. Only bad thing was lets say Izumi is walking down the street.. he will be detailed and everything but all the background people are whited out figures like ghosts or something which was a bit lazy.  There's not really any music in the anime it'self other than the OP and ED, they're really catchy I would always sit through them, usually I skip through the Op and ED on animes and get straight to watching the anime.  Only downside was that Izumi is a hardout fan of a anime La la Lulu which i found a bit childish but it goes with his cute character but after awhile it was bit annoying, especially that La La Lulu alarm clock omg lol. But it effected the anime to where there were La La Lulu scenes.. some which toke minutes that I had to skip and I didn't see the point of myself and just wasted the screen time.  Make sure you watch the OVA aswell for a total of 11 episodes. Though i wish there was more - there's alot of potiental for 2nd season, though the 11 are still satisfying.  Overall don't miss out on this anime even if you don't watch shounen-ai, this is a good place to start especially if you're into the romance genre. I tend to watch only romance animes and the romance in this anime was great it got me excited and fangirling on the other side of the screen. So give it ago you won't regret it :);Recommended
2;Love Stage!!;whiteteeth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whiteteeth;8;"As with any genre, yaoi/shounenai is often criticized by people who doesn't like it. Actually shounen ai (and shoujo ai too) is mostly the same as ANY romantic comedy anime out there, the only difference is that the main couple features homoromantic characters, which tends to scare off straight viewers.  The thing with ""Love Stage!!"", what makes it so special, it's that for some reason it seems to have broken that genre barrier, and a big part of their viewers are straight male people who don't usually watch shounenai/yaoi shows.  The premise of the story is very simple: Ryouma, a famous actor, fell in love with a girl when he was a child and has been obsessed with her memory since then, and once he meets 'her' again, now as a young adult, he discovers 'she' was actually a him: Izumi, a clumsy otaku with a showbusiness family.  What makes it SO good is both the comedic value, because the story is tremendously HILARIOUS, and the characters itself, which are really very well developed in just a few episodes.  The art is pretty cool, nothing out of the ""shoujo norm"", but myself, i love the character design a lot. But i'm biased because i really love Zaou Taishi's drawing style.  So, i must say that if you are a fujoshi/fudanshi or a person who appreciates the genre just like me, this is a MUST watch. If you are a viewer who usually doesn't like yaoi/shounenai, or you haven't watch one ever, i will give it a try. Odds are you are going to like it... and if not, at least it's worth the laughs.";Recommended
3;Love Stage!!;SizzlingTear2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SizzlingTear2;10;"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK  Love stage is a Shounen-ai anime. Most of the male population really won't enjoy this but it's mostly for girls. The anime is really good and was enjoyable with Comedy, Romance, Drama etc...  Story -8  Story's pretty good. Izumi wants to become a manga artist. His family is in show biz and so they want him to enter the show biz world. Note that he is only in college. He is often mistaken for a girl because of his cute looks and such. Ryouma, our main male character number 2, mistook him for a girl when they had to do a commercial when they were young. After meeting 10 years later, Ryouma still has feelings, even after finding out Izumi was a guy. Izumi struggles to draw manga. It gets rejected and gets into despair. I really like Izumi's character development through out the show. He slowly realizes his feelings for Ryouma and gets into show biz in the end.  Art - 8  Art is beautiful but there were times were the art was iffy but it's good overall.  Sound 9  I love the OP and END. There both really amazing and also the background music  Character 9  Characters are great as well. A lot of development with Ryouma and Izumi. Shougo, Izumi's brother who is a musician, has some secret affair going on with Rei, the Sena family's manager. But no one really actually realizes it unless you really pay attention. Izumi's parents are side characters and so are his friends. Most characters get a development.  Enjoyment 10  It was really enjoyable. It made me laugh. There was some sexual moments and they were steamy. The drama is good and they left us some cliffhangers. Romance is beautiful as well. Though no one knows Izumi and Ryouma are gay hehe.  Overall this anime is great. If you're a yaoi lover than give it a watch, you'll love it. If you're a guy and watch Yaoi then I also recommend it. It's not as amazing compared to Sekaiichi Hatsukoi, but it's close. There isn't a lot of intimate scenes, maybe few. Unlike most of them that are M ;)  So give it a watch, and I'm sure you will like it, unless you hate Yaoi dont bother watching.";Recommended
4;Love Stage!!;MizukiHaruno;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MizukiHaruno;8;"this is the first yaoi anime I have ever watched and I want to admit it was very good. I thought that this anime would be uninteresting and the plot would be very bad but actually it was not. You may not be a yaoi fan but if you love romance animes you would enjoy this too. The story is about a major otaku Izumi Sena who just entered college and wants to become a mangaka like his idol Saotome (the writer of Lalalulu). ten years ago when he was 8 his parents were making appearance in a advertisement ""Happy Wedding"". this was the first time when he met Ryouma. (The girl for the commercial couldn't show up because her flight was delayed, so Izumi's mother volenteered him for the missing girl's role. Izumi ended up doing the commercial with Ryouma, and ended up dressing like a young female. ) Ryouma fell for Izumi because he thought ""she"" was a girl. After 10 years they were shooting this commercial again. And this was the time when Ryouma found out that Izumi was a boy but after this his feelings didn't change. He continued loving Izumi and even confessed to him saying that he didn't care that he was a boy he still loved him. But at that time Izumi didn't love him so they remained as friends but after a short time Izumi fell in love with Ryouma and they ended as a couple.  maybe my review wasn't the best but the story is quite good. I would give it 8. Also the art was very good I liked it very much and I would give it 9. I enjoyed the opening and the ending very much too. Also I loved character's development. The anime had many comedy/romance moments and some dirty ( not too much ) moments which every fangirl (like me) would enjoy. So for the enjoyment I would give 8. The only thing I didn't like about the anime was that it was only 10 episodes ( I know that it had Ova too) but it would be better if it had more episodes. But I am a big romance fan and as my first yaoi anime it was quite very good . I recommend you this anime.   - sorry for my bad english. also this was my first preview so don't judge me-";Recommended
5;Love Stage!!;MagicPotato98;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MagicPotato98;8;I thoroughly enjoyed this anime even though I'm usually not usually into this genre.  TO keep it brief, the reason why I liked it is because it is so funny, there are moments when you are rooting for the supporting characters as well as the main, and the characters are generally well developed in just the mere 10 episodes.  Because I am not usually into this genre, I found it a little bit uncomfortable in the intimate scenes, but if you substitute Izumi for a girl, it would be totally fine. However making him a guy makes it all the more hilarious. But yes, I would warn people who are not usually into this genre that it may make you feel a little uncomfortable in some minute parts but all in all, please give it a go, it was very fun to watch. :);Recommended
6;Love Stage!!;5sos;https://myanimelist.net/profile/5sos;10;"I have seen many a yaoi genre anime. In fact, maybe around 30-35% of anime I have seen falls in the yaoi category. But, I have to say that Love Stage!! has been my absolute favorite. Most yaoi or yuri go ahead and jump into the relationship aspect and everything that comes along to being in a relationship. However, nothing ""touchy touchy"" came along till the very end. The creators made sure to throw plenty of character development in which I looooooove. So if you enjoy an actual story and character development, but also want something that has a relationship aspect to it, this yaoi anime is for you. I gave this anime a 10 overall for those reasons.  However, the art and sound could've been better. Admittedly, it wasn't my most favorite artwork I've seen. BUT, for a yaoi anime, it was decent. That's why it received a 7. The music in it wasn't very catchy or enticing which is why I gave that part a 6. The character and enjoyment obviously catches my attention more than anything else in an anime. If there isn't good character development, or none at all, and if it isn't enjoyable, it is automatically dropped. This wasn't the case for Love Stage!! I was captured all the way through the ten episodes. I was upset to find that there were only ten; however, which is a little disappointing only because I really got into the show.  All in all, Love Stage!! was highly enjoyable and even a straight male would enjoy it. If you haven't watched yet, I recommend you start it soon. (I've watched it twice.)";Recommended
7;Love Stage!!;Fear_the_Reefer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fear_the_Reefer;8;The teenage years are often referred to as the best years of your life, but they can come with their own set of challenges... It’s the time of life where you’re still finding out who you are, who you want to be, and what’s important to you. Even as late as the crucial age of 18, it can be difficult to find your place in the world, especially if you’re struggling to find the place where you belong. This is even worse for Sena Izumi, because in addition to his more normal adolescent woes, he’s the youngest member of an entire family of entertainers and celebrities... His sly father is a stage actor, his spoiled mother is a model/actress, his doting brother is the lead singer of a popular rock band, his family has it’s own talent manager... And he wants to be a manga artist. Naturally, this has caused a bit of friction in the family, as the excitable and outgoing Sena family is beginning to seriously worry about their youngest son, who’s locked himself in his room like a hermit and dedicated his life to a passion that they believe he has no talent for the field that he dreams of finding success in, and they’ve decided to do whatever it takes to get him out of his introverted shell.  Fortunately for them, an opportunity to do so has just presented itself. When Izumi was only eight years old, he was dressed up like a girl for a wedding scene in a commercial, and the company wants to do an anniversary commercial... A sequel, where the children from the original classic have grown up and are marrying themselves. After some creative persuasion from his brother, Izumi agrees to don the drag dress one more time, but little does he know that his walk down the aisle is leading him into the arms of destiny. His costar, the now famous Ryoma Ichijou, has been in love with him since the first commercial, and this isn’t just imprinting... The sight of her face has gotten him through ten long years of hardship in the entertainment industry, and it was HIS idea to get the original cast back so he could finally make his dreams of seeing her again come true. Will his discovery of his bride’s true gender bring his longing to a grinding halt, or has he come too far to turn back now? And what kind of effect will getting caught up in all of this have on Sena’s routine lifestyle? They may only be married in fiction, but the red string of fate is all too real.  Love Stage comes to us from JC Staff, who I believe I’ve said before has no real consistency in it’s visual presentation. It goes all over the place in terms of quality, but out of the three general camps that I mentioned in my Kill Me Baby review, I’d say Love Stage fits nicely into Camp 3. This is, once again, the camp where anime has a modest budget, there’s no real room for excess, and they do whatever they can to make the show look as good as possible without putting themselves into a compromising financial situation. Much like other shows in this camp, Love Stage never really goes out of it’s way to impress you with it’s animation, but it still looks fucking great. The characters use very simple movements whenever motion is needed, and it never tries to do more than it needs to, while at the same time never feeling like it’s skimping. There are budget saving tricks at play, but the producers were clever enough to make sure it all felt like part of the visual style and tone of the series, which they succeeded at.  And speaking of the visual style, this is a very beautiful show just in terms of it’s art alone. For about 90 percent of the series, the color palette is bright, warm and welcoming, almost like it knew how intense it’s kind of subject matter could be, and was designed to put viewers at ease right from the early stages. The other ten percent of the time, when the show does get a bit darker, what with the characters dealing with issues and internal turmoil, the palette changes to reflect this, but it’s never for long. The level of detail is also stunning, with it’s depiction every little crack in a shattered marble only being the tip of the iceberg. Just about everything in the background is shown with intricate detail aside from the people, who are drawn as colorless silhouettes, and while I’d normally rag on a show for this... RWBY season 1, how ya doing... The fact that it only really happens when a character is busy with internal monologues does make it feel like an accurate portrayal of their distracted mindset.  While I’m not a fan of shiny white halos surrounding a character’s hair... I’ve bitched about it before, and sorry, but I’m not cool with it here either... The character designs are otherwise very attractive and tell us a lot about the characters as people. Ryouma and Izumi in particular were designed to fall right in the middle of masculinity and femininity, as they’re obviously coded male, but they still have the big moe eyes, slender bodies and feathery hair that’s just long enough to frame their faces, and the details that would normally code a character as seme or uke are more than just there, they’re ingrained into their personalities. Izumi’s eyes in particular are multi-colored, mostly amber but touched by a subtle swirl of blue at the tops, giving them a mysterious quality that you can understand someone getting entranced by. The other characters in the cast are fairly generic in design, but it doesn‘t really hurt anything, as their looks do inform their personalities. I do feel that the blushing artwork is a little too over-pronounced, but that’s a minor issue.  The music is a bit on the generic side, but it’s not bad or anything. I didn’t find any of it to be repetitive or annoying, like in a lot of shows I’ve seen. The character songs are a lot more interesting, with LalaLulu’s song being a delightful parody of the Magical girl genre, and Izumi’s brother Shougo has a really cool song called Love or Die, and yeah, I can see why the band Crusherz became famous. The opening, Lovest by Screen Mode, is awesome. Not only is the song catchy, upbeat and fun to listen to, but the video is just as fun and fits every beat perfectly. The constantly changing visuals are simple enough to grasp what they’re showing you in the time they have, and they match the energy and tone of the show. Surprisingly, the ending theme is more of the same, a catchy song with visuals that are pleasing to the eyes and match the beat of the song, and while most of it features posed characters, there’s an actual burst of expensive animation towards the end. I can’t remember another show where I watched all the way through the opening and closing as often as I did with this one.  There’s no dub, and I’m not a good judge of Japanese acting, but I’d just like to point out that if there’s ever a dub for this show, I hope they cast Chris Patton as Ryouma and Greg Ayres as Izumi. Moving along.  Okay, let’s just rip this band-aid off right now... Love Stage is a yaoi. It’s not a shonen-ai, oh no, it’s a full on yaoi. I’ve never reviewed a yaoi before, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t seen any. While I’m no expert on the genre, I have dabbled a bit, and unfortunately, what I’ve seen prior to Love Stage wasn’t all that impressive. I read the first few volumes of Loveless, I saw the first four episodes of Gravitation, I’ve seen the movie Fake, and while it’s more subtextual than anything else, I sat through the first season of Black Butler. In short, my exposure to the medium has revealed it to be a minefield of problematic situations and over-all just shitty story-telling, relying way too heavily on love at first sight, people turning queer out of nowhere on a dime because the plot demanded it, romanticized sexual assault, writers who forgo necessary information and development because seem to just want to get to the action already, and way too many couple where the age differences lay on different sides of the law. I’ve been told by people far more versed in the genre than I am that most if not all of these observations are persistent from title to title.  Now, does that mean there are no good Boys Love material out there? No, not necessarily. I plan to watch Yuri on Ice and Nabari no Ou in the future, and I’ve even seen some shows that I thought would have been improved if the main male characters went gay for each other... Kids on the Slope, for example. But alas, thank the LGBT gods, there is at least one good yaoi anime out there. I’ve already praised the art and animation from this show up and down the wall, but the number of problems and genre cliches Love Stage avoids, subverts, or just has fun with is insane. Now keep in mind, I’m not saying it’s an accurate portrayal of homosexual people or homosexual couples, and I’m not saying it presents it’s gay characters as realistic people or that it exists for reasons outside of tickling the libidoes of ravenous fujoshi, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be good. Yeah, I made a big deal about figuring out whether or not Strawberry Panic was faithful to it’s subject, but that show was garbage and needed the extra point. Love Stage doesn’t have that problem.  Right off the bat, we’re introduced to the main character, Sena Izumi, the uke of the situation. Oh, but we find out much more than that about him. After making sweet promises to us in the form of it’s animation, Love Stage wastes no time establishing Izumi’s character. We find out who he is, what he wants from life, what his family’s like, what his backstory was like, what his issue is, several possible resolutions to it, basically everything you need to know about him, and this is expressed without a lick of unnatural dialogue or exposition, and even better, we learn all of this before the first kiss is even taken. We don’t learn quite as much about his seme Ryouma until much later, but we know about their shared history, and through his actions revolving around his interactions with Izumi and his coworkers, we do learn enough about him to not have any lingering questions about him that really need to be answered. I can’t say they feel like people I’d meet out there in the real world, but they still feel like fully developed and fleshed out characters.  They also both have personalities that tie directly into their seme/uke coding, with Izumi being childish and submissive, but still driven by his own interests and possessing a decent level of propriety and agency. Ryouma is tall, dark and mysterious, quick to anger and somewhat closed off, but still struggling with the conflicting feelings inside of him and trying his best to control the parts of himself he doesn’t quite understand yet. While it takes them a while to work out their personal hang-ups and finally come together, they do make a really likeable couple. I also really liked the Izumi family, as viciously manipulative and backstabbing as they can be. Shougo, Izumi’s older brother, dotes on him and gets clingy to the point that he honestly can be a little creepy at times, but he still has plenty of moments where he redeems himself by showing a genuine concern and protecting him. We don’t see much of Izumi’s parents, but despite Dad acting like he knows best and Mom acting self-centered, they both clearly love their children.  Perhaps the most nuanced character is the family’s manager, Rei, a cold and calculating character who’s not above pulling the strings whenever necessary, selling people out to family obligations and looking for every possible advantage in his day-to-day dealings, but he still cares enough about his employers that he’ll set aside all of his business concerns if it feels like the right thing to do. Izumi’s manga club, only one of whom kind of registers his presence, is designed so that he’ll look out of place there, not that he ever notices. Similarly, the fictional character of Lala-Lulu, his fantasy Waifu idol, is so far removed from bearing any resemblance to actual girls that it’s not hard to see how disingenuine his attraction to the fairer sex really is. A few of the characters can get annoying at times, the fat otaku feel like an unjust stereotype, and I’m pretty sure I’d have a gripe with Izumi’s parents if they were given more to do, but over-all, I really liked all of these characters. I’ll admit that Ryouma does test me a little, but that just leads me to a few other cliches.  First of all, there’s the love at first sight cliche, which Ryouma falls neatly into. He’s been in love with a certain girl since they were 8, and while that would normally earn an eyeroll at best from me, the fact that his love for her carried him through the entertainment industry... A field of work where you NEED to hold onto some form of innocense to survive, let alone succeed... I can give it a pass. Plus, with Izumi turning out to be a gut, and Ryouma being unable to shake the feeling anyway, it does feel like Love Stage is having fun with this cliche, rather than using it straightforwardly. Ryouma’s feelings are portrayed as crazy, but not the stalker kind of crazy... The romantic kind, where you know your love for someone makes no sense, and is totally out ofl eft field, but you’ll still stay true to who you are and who you love, the world be damned if it stands in the way. This is probably the best usage of love at first sight that I’ve seen in an anime, let alone in a yaoi, but unfortunately, Ryouma falls into other cliches that are much harder to forgive.  A constant occurrence in yaoi is rape. It may not be carried all the way through, but it’s there, from gay characters in non-yaoi shows that speak in exaggerated falsetto and frequently make unwelcome advances on straight characters, to attempted rape that’s played for laughs, to actual rape that’s romanticized and sparks a new level of romance as a result. And yes, there is a point where this show gets... Rapey. I won’t tell you exactly what happens, or the reason that it happens, but three episodes in, Ryouma does something, and he winds up losing control of himself and coming within a hair’s breadth of doing something he’d never be able to take back, before he’s interrupted and the unforgivable thing is just barely prevented, but here’s where Love Stage takes a major step away from the worst of it’s genre... What he does is considered to be a bad thing. The writers don’t try to sweep it under the rug, oh no, it’s painted exactly the way it should be, and it’s this turning point that really got me invested in this pairing.  After the... thing... Ryouma feels genuine remorse, and he has to apologize and earn Izumi’s trust back before he can even THINK about pursuing a relationship. He’s accepted his feelings by this point, but Izumi is a much harder sell, and even though he buries the hatchet with him... Mostly out of pity... It isn’t until Ryouma proves his devotion by getting involved with Izumi’s lifelong passion, helping him along towards his goal, and doing everything in his power to encourage him and build him back up when things don’t go the way he wanted. He slips back into problematic territory when he kisses Izumi a bunch of times in his sleep... I mean, come on, seriously? But he earns those points back when he refuses a carnal offer that he can tell Izumi doesn’t really mean. I won’t say whether or not these two wind up together in the end, but... Isn’t that alone a breath of fresh air? The fact that you can’t tell? Yeah, they have numerous encounters, both as friends and as romantic prospects, but the outcome of their time together is just as engaging as the journey there.  Love Stage is available from Sentai Filmworks. The original manga by Eiki Eiki is available from SuBLime. The original light novel is not available stateside, but the series can also be viewed on Crunchyroll. There’s an OVA episode on the DVD that I highly recommend, and as for what it’s about, let’s just say it’s more of Ryouma being a pain in the ass.  Now, after all the time I’ve spent talking about how good this title is compared to other titles in the Boys’ Love genre, and how it deconstructs and subverts a bunch of troublesome tropes, the reaction I’m probably getting from most readers is... So what? Even if it’s a good yaoi, it’s still a yaoi, and most of the anime fanbase will have no interest in that kind of content. Well, there is one thing about Love Stage that I feel gives it a more universal appeal: This show is fucking hilarious. I was hooked right from the first time that Shougo manipulated Izumi with Lala Lulu merchandise, and Ryouma’s reaction to Izumi’s gender reveal was just icing on the cake. It’s visual style works extremely well with it’s comedic timing, which follows a healthy combination of gag and character-based jokes, most of which hit their mark. It was almost enough for me to forgive some of the more problematic scenes, including Ryouma’s missteps and an attempted gang-bang towards the end that came right the fuck out of nowhere. It’s a yaoi, so it’s going to be a mixed bag, but it’s a bag I won’t mind reaching into a few more times. I give Love Stage an 8/10.;Recommended
8;Love Stage!!;AhmedAmin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AhmedAmin;7;If you are looking for a sweet, light-hearted love story, then regardless of your gender go for it, it will surely put a smile on your face. But if you are looking for some love story full of all types of emotion and struggles people go through when in a relationship then definitely Love Stage isn't for you.  Story: The story is full of sweet and funny moments, there is hardly any scene that can make you sad or feel pity for the characters. Everything worked out well for the lead characters well, and I found this approach quite unrealistic. In a relationship, struggle becomes part of your life but our characters hardly faced any struggle. And I think that's what make this anime so lovable and cheerful. It really puts a smile on your face.  Characters: The lead characters are surely awesome but the same can't be said for the minor characters. The feminine features of Izumi are well justified and you can actually feel love busting out of Ryouma. Anybody in love can easily relate to Ryouma and that's what makes him the best character from this anime.;Recommended
9;Love Stage!!;shadowfireflame;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shadowfireflame;8;In this hysterical boys’ love anime, college student Izumi is the youngest member of the Sena show-biz family—the only member who is not interested in being in entertainment: awkward, with paralyzing stage fright. As a child, due to a casting emergency, Izumi ended up in a wedding commercial with his family and a little boy named Ryouma (Izumi played a girl and Ryouma played a boy), and now they’re reuniting for a 10th-year anniversary.  Like most anime in the BL genre, there is a disappointing undercurrent of homophobia—but unlike most, this anime has that at the beginning and then Ryouma accepts that he’s in love with a guy and that his feelings transcend gender. Like many BL anime, there is an assault scene—but unlike most, the perpetrator realizes what he’s done is deeply wrong and takes every step he can to sincerely apologize and undo the hurt he’s caused.  Both the leads are very appealing, and the supporting characters are all wonderful, as well: Izumi’s doting parents and wonderfully supportive brother, long-suffering manager, school friends, and manga crush (magical princess Lala-Lulu). Parts are exceptionally funny, like Izumi’s hopelessness at drawing manga. And I love the exploration that sex and relationships need work and aren’t always perfect on the first try.;Recommended
10;Love Stage!!;peachxmoon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/peachxmoon;10;This is the first yaoi type anime I watched and so I really enjoyed it. The beginning shows you a little bit about Izumi and when he was younger. It's exciting and a little funny. But since this is a first for me, I can't really say if it's one of the best out there. It's probably not very original in the anime world but it is a pretty interesting story.;Recommended
11;Love Stage!!;reinakun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reinakun;7;"Overall: 6.5, rounded up to 7.  It's hard to rate an anime when there's very little basis for comparison (the genre being extremely limited) but I’ll do my best. Love Stage is, while definitely a cut above the majority of the genre, still not what I’d consider a remarkable anime. The characters are one-dimensional, their motives are dubious at best, and they show little to no growth throughout, all of which is a typical and recurring issue in yaoi/shounen-ai series.  I think the most disappointing aspect of the series is that it had a lot of potential – potential which was never realized because of the obvious effort put into it to keep it from being ‘serious.’ In the process, important themes were left unexplored, critical issues were hand-waved, and overall, it just left the impression that the creator…didn’t really care. Not about the characters, or the plot, or about making the story believable. And it wasn’t.  If you’re wondering why I gave the series an overall rating of ‘6.5/7’ when I’ve done nothing but criticize it so far, it’s because I went in with very low expectations, as I tend to do when it comes to this genre. I didn’t take it seriously, didn’t anticipate character depth or development, and didn’t hold high expectations of gaining anything from it (i.e., a moral, sense of awe, etc) aside from amusement.  Love Stage did have its pros: the art was decent (I do adore Zaou Taishi’s style, but you can tell they were on a budget with this one), the audio was clear, the voice-overs were very fitting, and the subs were sharp. There was nothing special about the opening/ending music, including the video(s), but it wasn’t terrible. Typical J-pop songs, though certainly less catchy than others.  The romance was…cute, if you disregard the attempt at sexual assault between the main characters at the beginning (which, at least, the author did attempt to address and treat with due seriousness, though she didn’t really succeed, and I believe that stems from different cultural attitudes towards rape more than anything). The attempted assault towards the end of the series was also tasteless, but unfortunately it’s common in shounen-ai/yaoi as a plot device.  TL;DR – Overall, it was a decent anime, for its genre, and I’d recommend it anyone who 1) is in the mood for a cheesy BL-romcom with little in the way of substance, 2) doesn’t have assault-related triggers, 3) loves gay stererotypes (i.e., seme/uke), romance cliches, and/or crossdressing, and 4) likes watching cute boys kissing other cute boys.";Recommended
12;Love Stage!!;kon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kon;8;"So recently I finished a re-watch of this show a few weeks back and only now I'm reflecting it. So what can I say about the show? I really, really liked it.  From the yaoi anime I've seen (JunJou Romantica) there seems to be a format with yaoi that goes on. There's the obvious seme and uke, the fact that the uke may not like the seme or the other way around, and there's a LOT of pinning down.  Love Stage fulfills these criteria, yes, but I feel that has a charm that surpasses JunJou Romantica at least. The humor definitely springs from the main character Izumi Sena, who gets wrapped up in his family's popular lifestyle, when instead he wants to be a mangaka. Plus, his Mom's name is Nagisa - and the seiyuu for Izumi voiced Nagisa in Free!. Rei is also here, with the same seiyuu too!  The roles for who the seme and the uke are in this show is Ryouma as the Seme and Izumi as Uke. This is obvious in their appearances; Ryouma is a young, fit acting superstar. Izumi is an incredibly femmy young adult who has the ability to look EXACTLY like a girl with makeup and proper clothes - as expected with any closed, shut in otakus, I suppose. Their relationship is off to a rocky start, but then there's the whole thing with another trope I notice in yaoi anime, the eventual realization of being a homosexual. Ryouma begins with Izumi thinking he was a girl, but after a mishap with Izumi's brother (who's also gay) he horribly finds out he was a dude all along!  Of course, as time ravels on, he continues to think of Izumi. This leads him to eventually have Izumi pinned down naked. Unlike with JunJou Romantica, the sex here is stylized and not as explicit. The manga, however, is extremely explicit, to which I HIGHLY recommend it on that basis! Either way, Izumi is creeped out by all this but eventually warms up to Ryouma once he does something FOR him! Wow! After buying Ryouma's bought him clothes and food on a date, it's only after he helps with Izumi's manga project is that he realizes he's not a bad guy after all. This struck me as weird on Izumi's character.  Eventually, both parties come to realize their love for one another after some weird trials. For me, this is one of the things I can't credit Love Stage for is the story. It's bothersome that Izumi has to realize his affection for Ryouma after Ryouma has done so much for him. It seems like to me he doesn't really love him at all. Another thing is how Ryouma even starts to love Ryouma in the first place. He latched onto a picture of a shota Izumi dressed as a little girl for 10 YEARS! Then in the manga, the story dives an irritatingly cheap plot line that'll be disclosed later.  After all that rambling, what can I say overall? Well, Love Stage has a plot line that, while not frustratingly dumb or anything, is a bit questionable but still pulls off it's cute moments. Izumi and Ryouma aren't shallow and underdeveloped, they're real entertaining but still have their times when you want to seriously ask, ""Why?"" on what they do. Side characters like Rei and Izumi's brother, another couple in the show, are also good. Not dished to the side or anything, they work into the plot without being an annoyance half the time.  I recommend this show, definitely should watch it if you're considering it.";Recommended
13;Love Stage!!;Magpies;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Magpies;8;First things first, I am one of the pickiest BL fangirls in the world. I despise Junjo Romantica and Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi. But Love Stage surpasses them with flying colours.  Story 8/10 Gasp, there's actually a plot, and it's pretty good. Its strongest point is that the drama does not solely revolve around the characters' romance. Izumi might be a shut in otaku, but outside of his relationship with Ryouma, he has a vision of becoming a mangaka. He actively pursues his dream and you can genuinely relate to his coming of age struggles. Ryouma's fame also plays a part in the events instead of being treated as an excuse for him to be rich and not do anything. My only problem is that it still uses sexual harassment as a plot device. Romance-wise, I like that the main focus is kept on Izumi and Ryouma instead of having a bunch of flat beta romances like other BL. Honestly, their relationship is better paced than most hetero romances I've seen.  Character 9/10 The only reason I didn't give this 10 is because the background characters are pretty much cardboard cutouts. Izumi and Ryouma are very real in contrast. While the show falls into the sexual harassment trope, Izumi has a very realistic reaction in the aftermath instead of immediately falling for his aggressor. He also grows from the experience so he doesn't end up being a damsel in distress later on. Ryouma, unlike other characters I immensely dislike, regrets his loss of control and has to beg for forgiveness. I love that he doesn't get it right away and has to earn Izumi's friendship, then eventually his love.  Art 6/10 It's not horrifying to look at, and no one has a severe case of yaoi hands, but the eyes are drawn in that way where you can see them through the hair. The lips are a bit weird looking too. It's not my favourite style but it's certainly not as bad as Love Pistols.  Sound 6/10 The OP and ED are okay. The background music doesn't add much but doesn't detract from the drama. No one would watch this for the music anyway.  Enjoyment 9/10 This was such a refreshing series compared to most BL. The premise is cute, the ending is sweet, and it doesn't perpetuate abusive relationships. What more can a girl ask for? If you're looking for a shounen ai series with a realistic relationship and a good sense of humour, then you'll love this!;Recommended
14;Love Stage!!;NixKaen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NixKaen;8;A BL story done right. These days, BL either discards conflicting sexuality emotions or plays off the love story subtly. Often times along with discarding confusion about sexuality they tend to pretend females hardly exist. BUT, Love Stage does not do this! As a person who does not generally enjoy BL, shounen ai, or yaoi, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime from beginning to end. Both leads go through confusion and denial about their feelings towards each other largely regarding their sexuality. For such a short anime it was pretty well put together with the pacing. Still enough kyaa-ing and frustration without the feeling of being to rushed.;Recommended

As the story played out I got hooked on each character, wanting to see what would happen next and growing as they grew. I must say, the main character made me have my ups and downs, between rooting for him and pushing him down, but as the story continued on I watched him grow and I loved his character even more. I have no words to describe this anime. By Far the best romance I have seen. Needless to say I am watching more BL anime, but... well I am going to watch this one again ;)  Story: Original, entertaining, stays on topic.  Art: Shounen Ai ... do I need to say more???  Sound: When it was time for tears or laughs the sound hit it perfectly, never missing a beat and always filling you completely of that emotion, never left wanting more or feeling like something was missing  Character: You see it from many of the characters views and each character grew, but the main character grew the most, making me feel overjoyed when the final scene played out.

A masterpiece of yaoi hihihi;  I only lay low in that part where Ryoma practically stripped Izumi to see if he still liked him even though he was a boy, for me this scene should be deleted from the face of the Earth.  I confess that I identified with Izumi: he felt humiliated in his childhood, because he embarrassed himself in front of the production of the program so he retracted in his own world, lowered himself compared to everyone in his family and lived like this for Years.   But like, I know most of the audience is feminine, but recommend for everyone, it is a gorgeous yaoi of an innocent love (on the part of Izumi Heheh because the Ryoma osta of a same lemon) and I hope not to be the one who considers this one of the most favs.  (portuguese) Aaaaa o que falar desse animezinho que já assisti várias vezes por causa da história original, dos personagens que são uns amorzinhos e da arte que é absolutamente linda??

Confesso que me identifiquei com o Izumi: se sentiu humilhado na infância, pois, passou vergonha na frente da produção do programa por isso se retraio no seu próprio mundo, se rebaixou se comparado com todos da sua família e viveu assim por anos.

Now I'm not saying this show will make you go gay, but it's one of the best romantic comedies ever made even without the yaoi aspect in place, there's a few scenes some closed minded kids might think is close to rape -but as we say in the west, ""if it doesn't go in, it didn't happen"", and so I'll start off by letting you know this is one of those series that gets better as you go, you'll watch episode 1 and be like ""eh this is like a 7.5/10"", then you'll see after the credits and think of that one asian guy in school yelling ""Ha! Gayyyy!"" from that movie none of us have actually seen. Then you'll go on to watch the next 2 episodes and just think to yourself ""I like where this is going"", then you watch a few more episodes and you're just like ""Oh man!"" and then you think to yourself ""If this has a good ending I'm gonna shit myself...."" because it's just that good. You finally get to the last episode, episode 10, everything is totally wrapped up and you just fell in love with 2 men and don't even feel gay about it and you're just left with this sense of fulfillment with your life.....then you find out there's an OVA literally titled ""Episode 11"" and you're in shock and dismay at the same time because you just hope they don't screw up those last 10 episodes for you, and then the planets align and a comet shoots by during a meteor shower and you snap a picture of them all in the same frame to have the OVA not only continue the story where it left off, but to make it even better....I know it doesn't seem possible, but this is the show you'll watch and right as you finish it you'll be covered in a thick white sticky substance and everyone will come in the room and you'll have to explain that there was a spooky ghost and it got ectoplasm everywhere like Randy Marsh from South Park.

I watched Love Stage with BL tropes and Junjo Romantica specifically in mind. The #1 best part about this anime is that the main character actually has a personality. He's not just some closeted twink (I mean he is); he has interests and dreams. He's an otaku who dreams of making a manga, but he sucks at it. He also has to struggle with being in a super talented family even though he hasn't found his ""calling"". The relationship is... yeah, ok. I'm really cynical of any romance in media. They just met, they are not in love. There's sexual assault but not rape. I can't believe my standards are so low. The brother's crush was really shitty and annoying. Isumi already has Ryoma fawning over him, what does the incest add? I wasn't a fan of Izumi's hobby change. Obviously there is noting wrong with liking anime. I don't get why he had to quit it. I also don't understand why he became an actor (or as they put it ""being in showbiz""). I understand that he's probably going to be famous because he has his family's name. He was never shown as having an aptitude for acting. I guess it's good that he got over his stage fright. As usual in Japanese media being gay isn't really acknowledged. I mean wouldn't this relation ruin both of their careers? Art: I am an art snob. The art was typical anime style- no complaints. The way the mouths are drawn and animated though... yeesh. Maybe they're trying to look sexy, but I find it disturbing. The backgrounds don't really exist, probably to save money, but you know, I think they pulled it off.

0;Love Stage!!;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;5;Love Stage started as a romantic comedy manga by Eiki Eiki and Zaou Taishi. In 2014 our old friends at J.C. Staff, behind such titles as Yami no Matsuei, Hachimitsu to Clover, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora and a bunch of other anime I've reviewed, started releasing an anime adaptation. Is it a romance that's worth your time? Let's examine it and find out. As it was Valentine's yesterday and this seems like a good week for some romance.  Story:  Sena Izumi comes from a show business family. His mother is an actress. His father is in theatre and his elder brother is the lead singer of a band. Izumi, however, doesn't want to be in show business. He wants to be a manga writer and artist. In spite of not being good at drawing. I know how he feels. That's why all my writing just uses words. Things change for Izumi when he receives an offer to be the bride in an advert that's a follow up to one he was in a decade ago. He initially refuses but finds out that the other intended star, Ichijou Ryouma, won't take part unless the casting is the same as it was a decade ago. Reluctantly, Izumi agrees to take part for the sake of his family's business. Little does he realise that Ichijou's insistence has to do with the feelings he's harboured for a decade and little does Ichijou realise that the co-star he's been pining for is actually a boy. I detect incoming hijinks.  The biggest flaw with this series is that a lot of the early stuff involving the romance is questionable, at best. Ichijou carries around a picture of eight year old Izumi and he's been obsessing over him. That's pretty creepy. You'd think a mentally stable person would have gotten over their first crush given a decade. There's also a scene where Ichijou actively tries to force himself on Izumi which begs the question of why a light-hearted comedic romance involves attempted rape. That's not remotely suitable for the tone. To its credit, the series does acknowledge the atrocious nature of Ryouma's actions and spends a good amount of time having him try to redeem himself but it's still really tonally awkward and poor form for the start of a romance. There's also some awkwardness involving Izumi's brother harbouring a complex for him that borders on incestuous.  On the positive side, the romance does get pretty decent once its past the initial awkwardness. The comedic elements of the series also generally work pretty well. It's not uproariously funny comedy, but it is pretty good.  Characters:  This series has two types of characters. The first are the major characters who are a step or two above archetypes. They develop, albeit in kind of shallow ways, over the course of the series. The second are the side characters who are pretty much the epitome of generic. The interactions vary a bit. Izumi is unrealistically quick to forgive Ryouma but their latter interactions after that whole plot point dies down are pretty decent and develop almost naturally. My favourite interactions by far are between Izumi & Rei, a gent who acts as a guardian and parental figure towards him. It's a multi-faceted dynamic that can be genuinely heart-warming at times. Then we have the brotherly relationship which is far too clingy and a bit creepy.  Art:  The artwork is, as a whole, pretty decent. The series does suffer a bit from the whole comedic undetailed moments that you get in a lot of series. The mouths are also a bit awkward both in how they move and in their appearance. I do quite like the way they do the eyes in the series, although the spectacles look awkward, and the regular scenes where they aren't doing something odd for comedic effect look quite nice. I also do like that Izumi's drawings are realistically amateurish. They don't make them look exaggeratedly bad like a lot of series that have a character who's supposed to be bad at artwork do.  Sound:  The cast in this is pretty good. Eguchi Takuya, Hirakawa Daisuke & Yonaga Tsubasa all deliver nice performances and the rest of the cast are all competent. The music was handled by Nakanishi Ryosuke and he did a decent enough job. It's not a soundtrack I'll be listening to on its own but it does get the job done.  Ho-yay:  I've already talked about Izumi And Ryouma quite a bit but there's more homo-eroticism in the series than just the two of them. Towards the end it's heavily implied that Izumi's brother and Rei are in a sexual relationship. I don't know why they didn't do more that instead of focusing on the kind of creepy brother complex.  Final Thoughts:  Ultimately, Love Stage is a series that has a massive shadow hanging over it. The shadow of the messed up way the main romance starts. And while the series does markedly improve over that very poor first impression, it never quite breaks away from it. Ultimately, those things it does well kind of strike a balance with those it does poorly. Is it a bad series? No. It has quite a few funny moments and the latter stuff with the romance is decent enough. Is it a good one? Also no. It's simply hurt too much by the tonal awkwardness in the beginning and by the whole brother complex aspect. In the end, it's pretty average. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. If you like romances and can forgive the whole way things open, you'll probably get some enjoyment from it. Next week I'll look at JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders series 2.;Mixed Feelings
1;Love Stage!!;pleochroic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pleochroic;5;"I never quite know whether I should try to rate BL anime within its own genre or not, but since MAL makes no genre distinctions when showing top anime, it seems fairer to rate it as I rate all other anime. But I will point out where it stands within its own genre.  I am gay and used to read a lot of BL. Tip to North American audiences: in these reviews most people use confusing terminology, so here's a quickie refresher. BL (Boys Love) is what the Japanese call boy-on-boy manga and anime mostly written by women and mostly directed at women. Yaoi in Japan only refers to very explicit BL doujinshi (fan fiction), which are basically pornographic without much plot. In the West, people tend to misuse yaoi for boy-on-boy romantic works with some amount of actual sex being portrayed, while some call romantic works without explicit sex shounen-ai. Again, that's not the term used in Japan, where shounen-ai only refers to a very narrow part of BL produced in the 1970s and 80s by a specific group of mangaka who expanded very romantic, idealized, exoticized shoujo concepts to boys. Do yourselves a favour and learn to call boy-on-boy manga and anime BL, that way you're in tune with the country that actually produces most of it, and it'll reduce confusion. This anime is BL, without graphically explicit sex. Here endeth the lecture ;)  Love Stage!! turned out to be a fluffy, mildly amusing, quite inoffensive BL anime. I have not read the source manga, but BL anime is almost always less explicit than its source. If you think homosexuality is a sin, don't watch it. If the thought of boy-on-boy sex makes you a bit uncomfortable because you're a straight guy, I think you can fairly safely watch this without breaking out in hives. There is clearly some sex happening, but it is stylized away in a rather imaginative way; nothing is ever shown graphically, other than kisses, and even those are darn tame; no lips as much as move. I gotta say I especially loved the pink elephants, that had me laughing out loud. Most of the humour is also not suggestive, and while there is some fan service, it doesn't even get close to hetero ecchi -- we get some naked torsos without nipples, woohoo. Most of the anime consists neither of lovey-dovey action nor of sex, it spends more time on Izumi's attempts to find himself, career-wise and romantically.  Story 4/10: Anime in general doesn't necessarily come up with believable stories, but the fluffier BL often takes the cake. Ryouma, an up-and-coming hot actor, when he was a boy apparently fell in love with an 8 year old crybaby girl based on a single encounter, and carries that flame in his heart for the next 10 years. Yeah, tell me another one. When he has a chance to meet that girl again, he grabs it, and finds his love confirmed as the girl has grown up into a super-cute young woman. Only, she's not actually a girl, she's a boy. Henceforth we get the usual disgust upon the denouement from both Ryouma and Izumi, the cross-dressing boy in question, but love naturally conquers all in no time flat, without a whole lot of hesitation. This is basically completely unrealistic on all levels, and because it's also thoroughly tropey, and one of my least favourite tropes are the stereotyping of seme/uke roles (sexually dominant / submissive), and the feminizing of the uke, I don't give it a lot of points. Redeeming factors are that Ryouma actually tries to connect with Izumi on a personal level, and that Izumi doesn't get stuck in his panicked reactions but thinks further. Still, it's all very shallow. Most of the comedy wasn't funny to me, though I laughed at some of the visuals.  Art 5/10: I'm not a big fan of Zaou Taishi; I find her mouths very unattractive, and her lines too heavily inked. But it's all very bright and colourful, with lovely eyes in shades no human ever had. ;) The animation is decent for BL, not so much in general -- BL anime tends to have very small budgets and it always shows, though this is better than what it used to be.  Sound 5/10: nothing special, neither in regard to music nor voice talent.  Character 4/10: Izumi actually experiences some growth, though it's minuscule. Ryouma gets over his initial disgust so fast it must have caused whiplash, but at least he didn't turn out as arrogant as he first came across -- never have I seen somebody kowtow more, which was interesting. The other characters are all barely there (I imagine the manga probably expands at least Rei and Shougo's roles, since they're obviously the secondary couple).  Enjoyment 7/10: I enjoyed it more than one might think from reading the preceding paragraphs, because the pacing was good and the characters were likeable, and I am grateful for any BL anime at all. But I want to add something here for the reviewers who said: ""yay, at least there was no rape or dubcon (dubious consent)!"" You have been conditioned by too much bad BL. There damn well was dubcon -- Izumi gets kissed many times without his consent, he gets nearly raped by Ryouma who only stops because Izumi is crying (though that actually tempts him too, which is a Japanese bullying trope I hate), he gets nearly raped by 3 strangers upon whom he comes in the process of a robbery. On the plus side, the creators are at least not valorizing any of that, which is a step forward, but they're still playing it for laughs, and I can't express just how much I want BL to get further away from all the dubcon. Enthusiastic mutual consent is sexier than dubcon any day.";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Stage!!;Pastabeanchuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pastabeanchuu;6;Love Stage!! is a pretty good surprise in the BL genre. It's not incredible but gives us a fair love story and enjoyable characters.  Story: 6 The setting is common and overused in both shounen ai and shoujo manga, but it's not too long and unfolds well. Once you get into it, it can be pretty heart warming and has its inspirational moments. It's a relief that there are no dub/non-con in this story (and it is pretty sad that I have to mension this in my BL reviews).  Art: 6 Pretty good for a BL anime, and still very pink.  Sound: 6 The opening song, LΦVEST by SCREEN mode is a cheerful and happy tune, not unlike every other j-pop songs you could have heard in animes so far. I admit it... I started watching LS!! because I knew Hirakawa Daisuke and Yonaga Tsubasa (respectively Rei Ryugazaki and Nagisa Hazuki in Free!) were acting in it. It was nice to hear their voices in the same anime again. Overall the voice acting is good.  Characters: 6 The characters aren't especially well written, but they come off as funny and enjoyable. They all have a little something that makes them likable in the end, and it is all we can ask for. I especially feel for Izumi, the main character.  Enjoyment: 7 Yes! a decent BL love story! It's common and unoriginal but it keeps its promises.  Overall: 6 If you want to watch a cheesy BL story, Love Stage!! is a pretty good choice. It's short and nice. Don't expect a masterpiece and you will be pleased with what this anime has to offer.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Stage!!;nekonekonekochat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nekonekonekochat;6;I have mixed feelings about this show.  Firstly, I love shounen ai and yaoi. I like fluffy romantic anime from time to time. There were a few moments in this show that I genuinely enjoyed. Also, it's pretty to look at, especially the eyes.  But...  I just wasn't feeling the leads at all. The main character is whiny and indecisive and the only thing he is passionate about is something he really sucks at. Even though we see him put in time, effort, and practice, we never see him improve at all and ultimately he gives up and gives in to family pressure.  As for the love interest: he's a jerk. Not a misunderstood jerk with a dark past, just a jerk.  Honestly, I would much rather have watched a show about the background characters than either of these guys.  Shougo and Rei > Izumi and Ryouma;Mixed Feelings
4;Love Stage!!;cocolita22;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cocolita22;5;I know this is a really popular yaoi but it was not my favorite!! I think if you have the time, it's easy to get through the ten episodes, but it isn't exactly super exciting... I think other yaoi are ten times better.  The ending, however, is very cute but also feel rushed. The music was really nice. I loved the opening theme -- made the show feel more exciting than it really was. The art was great! I don't have any complaints there.  The characters were very one-dimension and I honestly found Ryouma to be super annoying at times.  At the end of the day, a yaoi fan should see this.;Mixed Feelings
5;Love Stage!!;JudeMelody;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JudeMelody;6;"Love Stage!! was the second shonen-ai anime I've watched (the first one was Yuri!!! On Ice). The first two episodes were enjoyable. They sounded promising. Izumi, the main character, is very cute and funny. Ryoma, who falls in love with Izumi, is that kind of exaggerated guy that makes you laugh. Rei, one of the employees of Izumi's family, is amazing! The music is awesome too and I'd constantly catch myself thinking of the opening theme. But all the other episodes were a little bit strange with some flaws and other stupid cliché stuff like: ""Hey, I know who you are."" Then you put on your glasses and I don't know who you are anymore. (Yes, that old Clark Kent thing.) But let me be a little more specific:  STORY - 5 The story is ok. Just that. Love Stage!! isn't very different from that silly shoujos with silly characters. At the end, only one thing matters: will Izumi and Ryoma go through all the external challenges and be together? Nothing to be surprised, you know. But there some points that made me feel uncomfortable. By the way, this will probably be a spoiler, so if you don't want to read it jump to ""ART"". And the spoiler begins: it seems that everyone wants to touch Izumi. Yeah, in the sexual sense. Izumi is a cute, timid, female looking otaku. The others characters look at him and become all: ""OMG! He is so cute I want to eat him!"" And Ryoma is like: ""I can't control myself when I'm close to you. I'll attack you because you are so cute."" I don't think that's funny. Seriously, I don't. So, if you don't like romanticized rape either you'd better look for another shonen-ai.  ART - 8 The art is very good. I liked it very much. Izumi's smile is contagious. The characters in general are beautifully drawn. It's not a masterpiece, you know, but it's enjoyable.  SOUND - 7 Nothing to complain here. The opening theme is fun and sticks easily to your mind. The ending sound doesn't get behind. But again, it's not a masterpiece.  CHARACTER - 6 As I've said before, the characters are silly. I mean, there's not a single responsible adult here. Izumi is a spoiled introvert otaku unable to do anything without help. He grows very little during the show. Ryoma doesn't change very much either. Izumi's parents, Seiya and Nagisa, are stupid to say the least. Nagisa acts like a teenage girl who only thinks about parties and handsome men. Seiya isn't a very mature and careful father. But from time to time they say something apparently profound about Izumi--just to pretend they are good parents. Shougo, Izumi's older brother, is spoiled too. He likes to do everything on his own way and doesn't care how his actions will affect other people. But he cares very much for Izumi and is much more helpful than Seiya and Nagisa. Rei is the stereotype of the good employee who respects his bosses and does everything to make their lives more comfortable. He is Izumi's eternal protector. Although I liked Rei very much--he is my favorite character from the show--it's undeniable that he has a great responsibility from Izumi and Shougo being so spoiled! Oh, and there is Lala-Lulu, the main character of Izumi's favorite manga. Lala-Lulu is the stereotype of the mahou shoujo with a heart full of kindness. She has no personality at all--an empty lovely character--and her voice is irritating. But she is important for the plot. Finally, we have Takahiro Kuroi, Izumi's classmate. Kuroi is the only responsible character in the entire show. Too bad he didn't receive much attention!  ENJOYMENT - 6 Love Stage!! was an OK anime. It made me laugh sometimes, the songs are good, the art is beautiful. Nothing more than that.  OVERALL - 6 I think I've said everything I had in mind. Love Stage!! is a silly show with handsome male characters and fanservice scenes. Lots and lots of fanservice scenes. Depending on how you interpret them, they can be pretty offensive.  I hope this review has helped you. Bye bye!";Mixed Feelings
6;Love Stage!!;crimsoughtan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/crimsoughtan;6;"This anime can be off-putting to some viewers especially those who came to look for something wholesome. The show contains certain scenes that may make you cringe by how awful it is especially with how the characters treat Izumi. Izumi, as the main character didn't come as a strong one and even when he tries to prove his resolve, he just always end up being pushed around by the people who are supposed to look after him. The dynamic on Ryouma and Izumi's relationship wasn't that impressive either and felt bland. They had their cute moments, but their relationship could've been a lot better. The buildup was just to say ""happened so miraculous"" or unrealistic considering Ryouma has been breaking Izumi's personal boundaries and did a lot of stuff to him without his consent. If ever, Izumi has a lot of reasons to stay away from Ryouma. Everyone is free to try and watch this one but personally, you're better off watching another BL.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Stage!!;RebelPanda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RebelPanda;2;"Happy LGBTQ+ Pride Month! In celebration, I’m reviewing one of the most beloved Shounen-ai anime from 2014. Love Stage!!  ... … …  *Trigger warnings: Homophobia, transphobia, sexual assault, victim-blaming.*  Once upon a time, your average ~straight~ teenage boy awakens from his bed and greets his idol, Lala Lulu. Izumi, the boy in question, lives with his family of actors and musicians. They constantly put pressure on him to become an entertainer, to his dismay. Izumi is an introverted otaku who dreams of becoming a famous mangaka. Despite wanting to move in a separate direction, he is dragged into showbiz by his family. When I first watched Love Stage as a teen, I thought this would be a coming-of-age story about a boy who achieves his dreams and embraces his sexuality. Oh, how wrong I was.  Ten years ago, Izumi starred in a wedding commercial with Ryouma Ishijou, a now-famous actor. Back then, he played a girl due to his feminine features. When they first met, Ryouma fell in love with Izumi’s femininity and beautiful eyes. In the present, they reprise their roles for a new wedding commercial. Once they meet again, Ryouma confesses his feelings because he assumed Izumi was a woman. The two believed they were straight, but their feelings are strong enough to kindle a romance. They enter into a complicated relationship in which Ryouma stalks and sexually assaults Izumi until he ‘becomes gay.’ This is all framed as romantic, cute, and sexy. After all, this is a boys love anime; therefore, it adheres to the most toxic and homophobic cliches ingrained in the genre. Note: Love Stage frustratingly never acknowledges bisexuality exists.  Izumi is assigned the submissive uke role (he doesn’t get a choice). Conversely, Ryouma assumes the dominant seme role. In the traditional yaoi erotica, the seme is aggressive and creepy, Ryouma lives up to those expectations. Whereas Izumi is helpless when confronted with emotional and sexual abuse. Ryouma stalks Izumi at school and home by manipulating his family’s trust, as a child groomer would. When Izumi finally calls Ryouma a creep, he apologizes profusely, guilt-trips him, then showers him with shallow compliments until Izumi forgives him. Of course, all that is manipulative bullshit because he kisses Izumi while he’s sleeping in the next scene.  Mainstream audiences comprised of mostly straight men and women agree Love Stage is ‘pretty good for a gay anime.’ At the same time, most LGBTQ+ people strongly dislike it, as we should. If Ryouma wasn’t a “hot” and wealthy celebrity, no one would defend their relationship. Stereotypical portrayals of gay characters in anime have desensitized people to homophobic tropes since the inception of boys love manga.  The absurd premise forces the ~straight~ men together like two north-pole magnets. Rather than developing a realistic romance like Given and Bloom Into You, it panders to the lowest common denominator with romanticized homophobia. Including both men being disgusted upon realizing they kissed a man. Ryouma insults Izumi for being a “Cross-dressing pervert” as if we needed more clues he’s homophobic. Implying people who try to pass as women are perverts attempting to trick men is also an argument used by transphobic people. There’s only one transgender woman in the cast—an unnamed hairdresser with a stereotypical transphobic character. She is voiced by a man in both the Japanese and English versions. Her only comments are to sexually objectify Izumi. The show continues to be transphobic and homophobic. Occasionally both in the same scene, remarkable!  Izumi’s manager, Rei, is also gay. He is supposedly brilliant but frequently allows Ryouma to be alone with Izumi. Which often leads to sexual assault. Throughout the show, various contrived situations force Izumi and Ryouma together. The anime even pokes fun at these deus ex machinas. It is aware of how cliche it is but not aware enough to subvert cliches. Simply doing the trope repeatedly is not the same as parody, satire, or subversion.  After Izumi’s first sexual assault, Rei consoles him by confessing his previous forays as a confused homosexual. He describes being gay as “A mosquito that needs to be squashed before it becomes a monster.” Rei pridefully claims homosexuality is a phase that gay people can suppress with effort. These are the same manipulative arguments homophobes use to justify conversion therapy: a variety of harmful practices that target LGBTQ+ people to change their sexuality or gender identity. It often leads to anxiety, depression, and possibly suicide. Not only is Rei’s advice wrong, but it is also dangerous and shows an offensive lack of awareness on the writer’s part. Rei is not a villain; instead, he’s framed as a mentor and treated as though his homophobic beliefs are valid.  Izumi’s brother is gay as well, and he’s in a scandalous relationship with Rei. His brother has a not-so-subtle incestuous crush on Izumi and blames his cuteness for why Ryouma attempts to sexually assault him. Again, this is not targeted at the people who it’s about: gay men. It is almost fetishistic how Izumi and Ryouma reject their sexuality. Both make it clear they’re suffering from internalized homophobia, seemingly treated as a cute tongue-in-cheek joke. The only way you know they’re making a ‘joke’ is with the same goofy song and chibi art, regardless of how awful the situation really is. Homosexuality is treated like a dirty secret that everyone must hide, and they do. To the public, they are just “good friends,” and the only openly gay men are stereotypical predators (Including a scene in episode 10 when random men nearly rape Izumi, but it is played off as a joke). The only jokes that made me crack a smile were Izumi’s dream sequences about his idol Lala Lulu.  The few female characters are shoujo stereotypes—screeching harpies who fetishize both Ryouma and Izumi. The only exception is Izumi’s mother, who is arguably worse than a non-entity because she doesn’t protect him from his predatory boyfriend and forces him to become an actor. His father is equally to blame for Izumi’s lack of autonomy.  The art is what you’d expect. Like most boys love anime adaptations, it was made on a shoestring budget, with not much animation and very bland backgrounds. For 2014, it looks serviceable. The character designs live up to yaoi manga, thin guys with identical body types and abnormally pointy chins. As for the music, the opening and ending are pretty catchy. At first, the soundtrack distracted me from the appalling dialogue. Each background song was repeated over and over until it became mind-numbing.  Love Stage is a repugnant anime, but the perfect example of everything wrong with boys love anime. It is stereotypical, homophobic, offensive, and it romanticizes abusive relationships. There’s nothing romantic about this bizarre romcom that seems to care more about condemning homosexuality rather than convincing us these two polar opposite men are genuinely in love.";Not Recommended

2;Love Stage!!;nic0_nic0_n0pe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nic0_nic0_n0pe;2;"As a gay person, I found a lot of this show tropey/boring and some of it outright insulting. Yaoi isn't generally the place to look for great, nuanced representation of actual gay people - I'm aware it's mostly fetish porn for a target demographic of straight women - but this one hit on every trope that particularly grinds my gears. Love Stage leans hard into the idea that gay men fall into ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" roles in their relationships with each other (they don't), and its characters are largely empty vehicles for blundering into tastefully-drawn-but-compromising positions. Like most yaoi, it features a good degree of predatory behavior from its gay characters, and stalking/sexual assault are core elements of its romance.  The show admittedly looks and sounds better than most yaoi - not on the level of more mainstream anime productions but at least not painful to watch, which is the reason I gave it a try. That said, its quality ends there. The plot loses its footing after the initial ""gender confusion"" premise, and proceeds through a series of typical romance story beats without much deviation from a very by-the-book shoujo, except with additional sexual harassment and internal protests (""I can't do that, we're both boys!"") which evolve into stereotypical justifications (""it's only okay if it's you""). Though the show occasionally succeeds at being funny (I'm not too stubborn to admit a few of its jokes made me laugh), there isn't enough solid character writing or unique plot ideas to make me care at all about what happens.  We're lucky enough now to have dozens of shows with genuinely compelling, complex, well-written portrayals of LGBT anime characters (Banana Fish, Bloom Into You, Devilman, Zombieland Saga, Given, Wandering Son, even Yuri on Ice). If anything, Love Stage is a reminder of how far we've come since the days when Love Stage and shows like it were widely considered acceptable. This show aged like milk. That's okay - now there are other, better options. I recommend that, unless you're somehow still living in 2014, you take one.";Not Recommended

4;Love Stage!!;Idontwantto2mal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Idontwantto2mal;3;Disgusting childish and problematic. Another BL on my list where seme should have been arrested a long time ago. Okay, here we go The love stage starts quite interesting. We have a gender intrigue here, where the main character thinks he has fallen in love with a girl who is actually a boy. Sounds interesting enough? But the show will show you that such a seemingly ridiculous idea for a romantic comedy can be spoiled. When Ryoma learns that Izumi is a boy, he decides to rape him. Yes Yes. He's already getting started but gets hit by Izumi's brother's friend. After this incident, Ryoma locks up in a room and cries for several days. Then comes to his brother who knows Izumi has been attacked and almost raped. Only the brother says he has nothing to worry about, starts to blame him for not leaving the room, and it's actually normal for a guy to get horny when they lick his nipples. Brother doesn't mind the rape of Izumi. Better to blame the victim. Then Ryoma stalks Izumi, then apologizes to him. And they start dating. Dating your rapist according to the show is very romantic. And it's okay after that, but one day Izumi sleeps over with Ryoma and Ryoma, and while he is asleep, he starts kissing Izumi many times. The second scene is a complete failure. In the next episode, Izumi tells Ryoma that he can do whatever I want with him. Izumi is exhausted by this idiot apparently and his mental state is terrible. Ryoma kisses him and Izumi lies down, cries, and doesn't move. Ryoma gets pissed off and blames Izumi for taking advantage of his feelings. Another victim-blaming scene. Then we have the typical crumbs of life again, and practically nothing interesting happens except that Izumi understands that he loves Ryoma, so he runs to his house and on the way, a group of people attack him and try to rape him. Jesus Christ, why is everyone attacking Izumi in this show? It's disgusting. It doesn't come to that and Izumi says that he wants sex with Ryoma. Ryoma is happy and says he won't stop having sex if Izumi changes her mind. And towards the end, Izumi says that he has changed his mind after all and he doesn't want to and he changes his mind, but Ryoma manipulates him and says that he is cute and he wants to know more about him. It's disgusting. From this show you can understand that: It's normal for a family to forgive the rape of a family member. It's normal to stalk someone It is normal to tell a sexual assault victim that they are exaggerating and do not worry It is normal to manipulate someone It's normal to blame someone for your problems and actions It's not a show is a documentary about the Stockholm syndrome.;Not Recommended
5;Love Stage!!;reimachii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reimachii;3;Love Stage Some may say it is a good starting spot for those who seek anime with LBGT representation, however I NEED to disagree. Hello! Although my sexuality doesn't necessarily matter in the grand scheme of this review I will mention that I am a gay male. I have seen my fair share of anime of this genre but so far Love Stage is the weakest link. It is hard to find a place to start so i'll discuss the plot first. Izumi wants to be a manga artist, parents want him in the family show biz. They just want whats best for him yadda yadda.. Izumi is our main protagonist and frankly he is rather irritating and annoying. He is also ignorant, and since his family is rich he is rather careless in his decisions. As for our main love interest Ryouma, he is boring! There is so little to say about him. All there is to his personality is liking Izumi, he has been waiting and obsessing over Izumi. Izumi's brothers personality is also Izumi! for such an annoying kid he has quite the fanbase... Izumi is obsessed with manga and anime. HE buys merch, collects, talks about it, wants to become an illustrator and thats essentially all he cares about. He drags ryouma into helping him. Eventually he moves that obsessive personality over to liking Ryouma. Theres no development to any of the characters. Literally none of them change. The only likeable character is Rei and he gets so little backstory and screentime. Overall just go watch Given <3 its worth it way more than this;Not Recommended
6;Love Stage!!;Jupiter20;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jupiter20;4;Good time to review another rapey yaoi, with some non-con and compulsion. Everyone has probably already talked about this problem in Junjou Romantica, a show that is not ashamed to show sexual harassment in the first minutes. But now it will be about Love Stage. The plot is generally not bad, it really does have what could be called a model of simplified gender intrigue. Story A boy who thinks he is in love with a girl who is actually a boy. The plot is very simplified because the gender secret is only for Ryoma and it's until episode 3. An episode where Ryoma wants to make sure Izumi's gender is hard to believe. And a nightmare begins. Because Ryoma takes Izumi's clothes off and, after making sure of his gender, decides to rape him. And from what I understand, he started molesting him by the nipples and kissing him, but he gets hit in the head. My brother's friend does it. Thank god it could have ended badly. Izumi is sitting and crying in the room. His brother comes over and says it's normal for him to get excited as he licks his nipples. Logic and realism finally left this anime. Then Ryoma stalks Izumi and apologizes to him. Okay ... What happens next is nothing wrong and interesting. Plain romcom. Characters Typical character yaoi archetypes. Izumi's brother and boyfriend are okay and they are probably the best people in this anime. Izumi, a little infantile kid who grows confident in the end. Ryoma scares me. The rich man from the elite pays attention to someone more ordinary (although Izumi comes from a wealthy family, he is considered a loser). He's supposedly trying to help Izumi and be nice, but this incident scares me. Art I don't like lips and eyes, the colors are terrible and my eyes hurt. Everything sparkles. But overall it's not bad. Enjoyment Very average. Such meh ... It's funny at times, but the romance still fails.;Not Recommended
7;Love Stage!!;Ironoverloaded;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ironoverloaded;2;"Let me start off by saying this is one of my first reviews. I was going to go through all yaoi anime, and systematically rewatch them and offer a review whilst the show was fresh in my mind. And then I got to Love Stage's turn...  And I can't. I can't rewatch this. To make me rewatch this would be harder than physically pulling out my teeth. It is that bad.  To be fair to it, once upon a time I enjoyed this show - I THINK. And you never want to have to think about whether you did in fact enjoy something. But I binge-watched it and liked the setting of the entertainment industry. I had a fun time watching it. But looking back, that enjoyment was reminiscent of watching a train wreck you can't avert your gaze from.  I realise now that the reason I finished this anime was *fascination*, not enjoyment. I wanted to see if they could pull off a ""good"" yaoi anime with a more lighthearted plot than many of the dark, forced yaoi with horrid visuals and homophobia.  News flash: they couldn't.  To borrow my friend's review line: ""Love Stage is a repugnant anime, but the perfect example of everything wrong with boys love anime. It is stereotypical, homophobic, offensive, and it romanticizes abusive relationships.""  And, to be quite honest, Lala Lulu ~sucks~ and I would rather gouge my eyes out with a melon baller than have to rewatch any scene with that screeching harpy in it.";Not Recommended

If you are like me and enjoy a good BL story, this will only build you up to drop you so hard and leave you hanging. It really felt like it was going somewhere and then stopped. Did it have what you could call a happy ending? I'm mean sure. I know ""but it only has 10 episodes how could it do everything you're wanting it too?"" I know I should of saw that and been like there's no way, but the reviews put it above avg so I thought why not. I'm sure this is a case where the manga is the way to go for this story. Also it plays around with consent, it's very weird. I had a hard time with some of the characters and the choices that they made, but they seemed pretty one dimensional. There are a lot of shows worth watching and this one is not one of them. IF you have seen every other BL show then maybe watch this....., but like that's 3-4 hours you could be watching something else.... -Ano";Not Recommended
0;Love Selection The Animation;Cro_pc;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cro_pc;10;"Let me get you straight to the point. This, as many as you already know is a hentai. I am not really into hentai myself, but this one is a little bit different from the ones I seen. For starters, there is no rape in this hentai. There is no old fat men raping sexy teens. There is, however, romance between what I would call the main male character (Daiki) and the girl that he loves (Ami)  If you are a BRUTAL RAPE SCENE lover with old men, monsters, etc... you will NOT like this, because there is none of that.  The good thing I like about this, or some ladies might hate it is the fact that they censored the &quot;penises&quot; out. You can still see them, but blurry. The humor is fantastic, I just don't understand why anybody hasn't thought of something similar to this before.  The music, sounds, etc... were excellent-outstanding. You will not be disappointed by it.  The art is Excellent, if you are a big-breast fan then this is a MUST watch for you.  Characters, hmmm... There isn't really any character development, but I can tell you this, you will love all of the three girls and the main male character.  SPOILER!!!! The only development I saw was when the episode was ending Daiki and Ami started going out.  Enjoyment, what can I say... I was pleased every minute I watched this, the art, sound, and small jokes really fit all in.  Overall, I would recommend anyone that enjoys romance, comedy and of course, sex (mutual) to watch this wonderful OVA. If you like to watch hentai with brutal rape scenes with old men... This is not the right hentai to watch.";Recommended

EP1 gets a 10 all around Hormones. Yes Hormones drive a group of 3 girls average looking ""college"" girls to the point of giving in. These are the kind of girls I never got to meet in college. Truly a beautiful group sex scene. I really liked how the guys did a 360, and said ""wait whaaaaat."" All the girls where cute. The guys had faces but where mostly clothed. For male beginners this would be a great hentai.  A great sequel could be about a sex ed class where the teacher shows the students how things are done. The final is graded on how well the student preforms with a partner. Thumbs up if you agree.  EP2 gets an 8 Man meets whore, but doesn't know it. Whore says come to our ""restaurant"" on a certain night. Man shows up and finds out its sex night and you can guess the rest. The girls where cute and well done. The main character guy was a pussy, and couldn't stay focused. Which is the reason why this one receives an 8. It was a beautiful hentai.

0;Love Position: Halley Densetsu;slenderfall;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slenderfall;8;"I decided to write this review more for its historical value than anything else – Oh, it is my first MAL review, too, so be gentle.  Love Position, Legend of the Halley was the first OVA by Tezuka Productions, a company created by Osamu Tezuka. The title was released in December 1985.  This, like so many amines of the day, was undoubtedly made with the intention of selling to the US market. For example, the opening sequences are set in a familiar Nevada desert setting (for no apparent reason). But the American influences do not stop there. The arrival off an alien agent comes straight out of the scenes when Arnie arrived to Earth in Terminator. The Vietnam War atrocities flashbacks are like homage to Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, and with a dose of Indiana Jones just to keep the Lucas fans happy.  The plot follows with a twist concerning Halley’s Comet, where an agent travels from a far off world which created Earth, traveling via the comet. But these far off beings see that humans are destroying Earth and basically not worthy, so the agent is set to destroy us. This first happened in 1910, but the agent saw the beauty of Earth and decided not to carry out its task. The present day (75 years later), the beings have sent another agent via comet express to carry out the original mission.  As you can tell, there is nothing really groundbreaking. Young man teams up with beautiful, innocent, angel-like alien against evil-looking alien who has taken the body of an escaped US convict. Bet you can not guess who wins.  It has all the clichés of its time; a love relationship hampered by an over jealous father, who happens to be the boss of a very large company, who in turn has thugs as bodyguards. One of them wants to marry the daughter in question. Also, like so many OVA’s from 80’s and 90’s, there are flaws in the plot so big one could go deep sea diving.  The artwork is great for its time, and some of the few fight scenes are well executed. There is some mild nudity, but nothing to get upset about, and it does sort of fit in with the plot.  The music is very unremarkable, though there is quite a melodic love song 30 minutes into the movie. Though one of my favourite parts is the disco scene; the dancing is hilarious.  You may be surprised, despite all of the above, that I gave this 8/10, as it really delivered everything I thought it would: crass plot, poor character development, etc. However, it just oozed that old school charm with a sprinkling of Tezuka, who only oversaw the original story.  Would I recommend it to you all? Probably not, unless you are a huge Tezuka fan and fancy watching a bit of light-hearted nonsense for an hour and half.";Recommended
0;Love Position: Halley Densetsu;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;"Let's be honest here - this is mostly just a thematic ripoff of The Terminator, as nigh-invincible massive hulking guy (who looks suspiciously like Ahhhhnold) is on a mission of destruction. It seems like nothing can so much as scratch this monstrosity.  Well, almost. There's another alien agent that was also sent to Earth, but is trying to save it. Only she's this soft, gentle, willowy, innocent girl. And yet, she is his nemesis.  The ""hook"" that makes this ""catchy"" is the convoluted and weird tie-in to Halley's Comet. For those who weren't around at the time, it was a Pretty Big Deal back in the day, and anything marketed as related to the comet would have extra cache.  Aside from the implausible and cliched general plot, they also throw in a love triangle and and abusive relationship, the story's pretty messy. On top of that the artwork is less than stellar (even when compared to its contemporaries). Sub-par all around.";Not Recommended
1;Love Position: Halley Densetsu;HeavensBlade13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HeavensBlade13;2;"TLDR; Love Position was built around a gimmick tie in to Halley's Comet and had mediocre production values, an extremely messy story, and flat characters.  Story: A hulking terminator-esque villain hunting a beautiful alien who has fallen in love with Earth was in the first place not particularly unique, but it was made even worse by being extremely muddled and hectic in its presentation. The focus jumps all over the place in both time and place between several story threads which all involve different characters (an overbearing father, Vietnam war flashbacks, the looming evil alien, and the main character's journey) all in only ~90 minutes. This does not mean the story was hard to follow just that the extreme lack of focus gave me little reason to care about what was happening, created no meaningful themes, allowed for zero character development, and meant there was no escalating tension for most of movie.  Characters: Largely as a result of the aforementioned unnecessary or overdrawn plot threads the main characters all lacked depth and experienced no growth. In particular I think the split focus between the father and son's respective relationships with the good alien was particularly harmful, and that for a movie of this length they should have been combined into one main character. The aliens were also a weak point as neither of them was fleshed out; the evil alien's only traits were walking slowly and killing people by hand (which made him unthreatening throughout the movie), while the good alien didn't communicate much with the cast outside of baby talk or briefly while in a lab.  Art: The artwork/animation was not very good. I have only seen a few anime from the mid 80s, but visually it was definitely not impressive compared to other movies of its time such as Nausicaa or Macross: Do You Remember Love?.  Sound: The OST was generic but passable, and included a lot of Harmonica playing. However, in regards to the sound effects some of the noises during the drawn out fight near the end were quite screechy/ grating on the ears.  Enjoyment: My enjoyment was pretty low because of the terrible story and lack of good characters but it was somewhat funny to watch a third rate terminator meander around along with a pretty hilarious disco dancing scene near the beginning.  Overall I would not recommend this movie unless you have some historic interest in the movie or its creators, as I found it to be extremely lacking in almost every aspect.";Not Recommended

0;Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation;Ionliosite2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ionliosite2;5;"I remember one episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, where Nergal came in with a pizza saying he prepared it with the best ingredients, once they taste it Billy says it's the best pizza he has tasted and then Grim tastes it and says ""it's good but it ain't all that"". That's exactly my experience with Kaede to Suzu. Now let me explain why, once the first episode of the hentai came out it immediately became popular among the kind of anime watchers that, well, watch hentai, calling it stuff like ""peak hentai"" or ""one of the best hentais"", I came into contact with it shortly after and I was left like ""that was all?"". And let me explain why:  Kaede to Suzu is a hentai about two twins that are part of the student council, Suzu (the quiet one) wants to put a trap to Kaede (the tsundere-ish one), Suzu calls the president of the student council (Kaede) and the secretary (the guy who you are supposed to self-insert into). Kaede is curious about a mysterious box that is on her desk and when she puts her hand in, her hands are held, both the main character and Suzu, desecrate it and begin to incite ""Kaede"" with an electric massage wand, and after that it starts more sex and stuff as you usually see in hentai. So, when watching this episode but what they do is pretty nonsensical, think for a moment, why does Suzu even wants to put her sister with this guy? Because she hears her saying her name when she masturbates, then does she need to put a trap to her to make her be with him? I'm sure she can get with him without any kind of trap that gets as close to rape as it gets; and don't get me wrong, it's not the rape-y thing that bothers me, it is that I'm sure there are so many more ways for this guy to have sex with Kaede than having to literaly put a trap to her, since if she likes him I'm sure she would be fine with planning something with Suzu to be with him.  So, what makes it so good? The characters? They are as basic as they get with even a boring quiet one and a more expressive one the guy is a regular guy, nothing to say about him. The plot? A guy having sex with sisters has been done a lot of times before and also better than here, especially because Suzu while is in the ""action"", she is never actually getting it inside of her in neither episode, that is pretty much a disappointment in itself, the closest it gets is in episode 2 when the guy is rubbing it between both girls pussies, but aside from a blowjob that is all, she is just there because they are twins and according to Suzu they should always be together. The animation? While good for a hentai, it also isn't the best you will see, and this very same studio has stuff that I would argue looks the same or better. So what is left? A pretty normal hentai with some twincest there.  Thank you for reading.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation;Kiba_Snowpaw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kiba_Snowpaw;9;"Hello again, furry friends and anime adventurers! It's Kiba Snowpaw, back with a fresh tale from the vast plains of pop culture, ready to howl at the moon about another dazzling anime gem. This time we're digging into the steamy world of hentai with a critique of ""Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation."" So brace yourselves, because we're about to tread on some wild and uncharted territories of anime.  First, let's get one thing straight - hentai is as much a part of the anime landscape as shonen, seinen, or any other genre. It's not just about the sizzle, it's about storytelling, character development, art, and sometimes, a good dose of humor. And let me tell you, Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation is as tastefully crafted as a mug of hot cocoa on a snowy evening - sweet, steamy, and oh so satisfying!  Now let's embark on this frosty exploration with a good old Scooby-Doo quote, ""Ruh-roh!"" Because this anime isn't your run-of-the-mill romance. No sir! Instead, it's a tale of a guy and two sisters, living under the same roof, caught up in a whirlwind of unexpected and risqué situations, courtesy of the cheeky little minx, Suzu. It's a simple setup, but let's not forget, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.  The art in this anime can only be described as jaw-droppingly stunning. It's as if someone caught the aurora borealis and spilled it across the screen. But it's not just the quality of the art that's noteworthy, but also the characters' design. The sisters, Kaede and Suzu, are as beautifully rendered as ice sculptures under the pale moonlight - intricate, mesmerizing, and just a little bit mysterious.  Then there's the sound. Can we take a moment to appreciate the flawless audio? It's like the gentle rustle of leaves on a breezy day or the melodic chirping of birds at dawn. It's an integral part of the experience, breathing life into every scene and making them all the more immersive.  But enough about the technicalities, let's sink our claws into the characters. To say that Kaede and Suzu are captivating would be an understatement. They're the yin and yang of this anime, with personalities as distinct as day and night. Kaede, the tsundere-ish one, brings a dash of spice, while Suzu, the quiet one, adds a hint of sugar, making for an intoxicating cocktail of characters.  It's time to touch on the most delicate topic - enjoyment. Is it fun? Is it hot? Does it make you blush and laugh at the same time? The answer, my furry friends, is a resounding ""Yes!"" Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation is as enjoyable as a playful romp in the snow. It's hot, it's hilarious, and it's undoubtedly one of the best FFM hentais out there.  Yet, like the enchanting moon that never reveals its dark side, there are some aspects of this anime that remain elusive. The plot, for instance, is a straightforward tale of a threesome, a trope that's been explored ad infinitum. It begs the question - what makes Kaede to Suzu stand out from the crowd? The answer, as always, is in the details.  The animation is fluid and stunning, much like watching the dance of the Northern Lights. The unique dynamics between the characters, the absence of the typical 'ugly bastard' trope, and the distinct personalities of the twins all combine to create an anime that's a cut above the rest. The execution of the ero scenes, coupled with the intriguing twincest aspect, adds a unique flavor to this H-series. And if that doesn't get your tail wagging, I don't know what will!  Being an old wolf in the anime wilderness, I've watched enough anime to tell you that there's more to this one than meets the eye. It's not just about the sensuous scenes or the adorable girls; it's about how all these elements come together to form an unforgettable narrative. After all, as the old saying goes, ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""  Now, I'm not saying it's perfect. No anime is. It's like trying to find a perfectly symmetrical snowflake - a futile pursuit. But does it do its job as a hentai? You bet your furry tail it does!  Love Me: Kaede to Suzu The Animation is a steamy expedition into the frosty realms of desire, where passion meets humor, and boundaries are pushed, all the while remaining tasteful and engaging. So strap on your snow boots, take a hearty sip of your hot cocoa, and dive headfirst into this winter wonderland of anime goodness.  Stay frosty, my friends, and remember, every anime, like every snowflake, is unique in its own way. Until next time, this is Kiba Snowpaw, howling out to you from the frosty frontiers of the anime world!";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;8;"Having put Love Live's final adventure off for weeks after weeks, afraid of meeting the end of the series, now, after finally gathering the courage to watch it, I am left with the thought that Love Live may be the best idol series created.  It's surprising how far the series has come over the past couple years. I'm not sure most people thought much about it when the first season aired, other than that it was your typical idol show with some cute girls and some cool tunes. But after the airing of the excellent second season, and now with the movie finally cementing what it is that makes the series so special for so many people, Love Live has established itself as one of the most significant series in the anime industry and present-day Japanese culture.  It would be foolish to claim that all Love Live has going for it is its popularity, however. It succeeds at being more than just a fun little idol show. Even if it may have a few minor issues, as all anime do, and even with the large layer of cheese surrounding some of its dialogue, Love Live is a truly heart-warming and excellently crafted anime, and I am very sad to see it end.  Love Live's movie is similar to the K-ON movie in many ways, particularly in its structure, as the trip to New York represents only a portion of the film's screen time. And, really, it is for the better that way. If all we saw were the girls of Muse having fun and singing around in New York City, it's likely it would feel like a mere spin-off rather than a meaningful advancement in the story and the characterisation. Love Live does advance the story-- it does give you something to care about, as it is not only an end for the girls, but also for the fans, as it is unlikely we will ever see anything involving these characters again, at least in the animated form. And that's hard to accept at times; there was a sinking feeling in my stomach that I don't often get from watching anime. But this is the way it should be. I'd be more than happy to see the girls continue their idol activities past high school, but it was the right time for this chapter to end. It is an ending I can be satisfied with, even if I do not want it to be over. And I don't.  While the TV series had a couple characters I wasn't too big on (particularly Nozomi), none of them felt bothersome or out-of-place here. They have all done enough to earn their place... though, certainly, I would not complain if my Nico were to hog all the screen-time instead. It was somewhat difficult to pay attention to what was going on since I would often start laughing like a crazy person whenever Nico appeared. I hadn't seen my glorious Nico in animated form for a year and a half, so it could not be helped. I was also a bit surprised at how damn adorable Kotori was; it appears I may have been blind and deaf when I was watching the TV series.  A great job is done at making New York City feel alive and bustling, with real locations modeled upon and with random pedestrians occasionally having their say. Seeing Honoka and the rest fumble around with their terrible English (ekkusukuzu mii!) in a futile attempt to communicate with Americans, is, unsurprisingly, pretty hilarious. By the way, I have no idea how the hell that one girl knew they were Japanese at first sight. Even I, having seen a whole heck of a lot of Asians in my lifetime, have some difficulty immediately telling a Japanese person apart from, say, a Chinese one. I'll just assume Random Blonde Lady is smarter than me!  It seems Love Live likes to experiment with the idea of being a musical, too, since the characters will sometimes bust out their dance moves all impromptu in the middle of the city, random Americans joining and signing along and all. It certainly adds some... uh, life and energy to the story, even if I would personally prefer they find a less silly reason to showcases their vocals. Love Live is obviously not aiming to be a perfect representation of reality, and that's just fine. Who needs reality, anyway?  The dialogue can occasionally be a bit cheesy (Honoka hopping and twirling around at the end, claiming she ""can fly!"", yay!), but this isn't nearly frequent enough to be a big deal. If anything, it'll just make you laugh a little bit. I don't expect all scenes to be perfectly mature and believable, because Love Live is a big series with big appeal, especially for young girls who normally enjoy that sort of thing. I don't feel comfortable taking that away from them. Love Live is fine as it is.  The songs are great and their performances well-coordinated (particularly at the very end with Nic-- with Muse dancing and tapping their feet along), but my one complaint is that the movie still uses some CG during these scenes. The CG doesn't look bad, not by any means, nor does it feel out-of-place (especially when compared with rival shows such as Aikatsu), but certainly it would have been nice if fluid 2D animation were used all the time instead, rather than most of the time. The animators could have gone all-out here, but they chose not to, presumably because of deadlines and other business-y things. Instead the movie looks merely good, rather than fantastic, which is something I'm still pretty OK with.  It is also worth noting that, unlike a majority of anime, Love Live actually knows how to time its background music in a way that feels appropriate - sentimental yet not melodramatic. It doesn't go overboard, but it does still make an effort, hitting the key moments of the track as it pans over the girls sitting and pondering their future in the club room, rather than screaming at the top of their lungs as most anime characters apparently have a fixation with. I don't think most people will tear up during these scenes, but it is quite hard not to have at least some sort of emotional reaction. Love Live knows knows how to convey emotion to its audience when it wants to.  There are also a few subtle visual tricks that add to the cinematic feel, like a young Honoka jumping before immediately cutting to present-day Honoka's foot slamming off the ground. These aren't details that are likely to cross your mind as you watch, but they do add up and give the experience more of an impact and a punch. It's clear the animators wanted to set the series off on a grander stage than it started on.  The Love Live movie is a hell of a time, and is easily the most fun I have had with an anime since Shirobako finished airing. I came in expecting nothing more than to see more of my Nico doing her thing and being the beautiful lady that she is, and while there certainly was a decent amount of that, there's far more here, too. Love Live wanted to end on a happy note rather than a sad one, and it did a fantastic job at doing so. I've had a lot of fun with you, Love Live, and while I don't know if I can let go, I can at least say goodbye.";Recommended
1;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;TCTriangle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TCTriangle;8;"I had the pleasure of watching this in theaters in Japan, and the movie is just what you would expect a Love Live! film to be: 1/3 music and dancing, 1/3 anime girls doing cute/funny things, and 1/3 drama - an animated musical comedy. If you already watched the first 2 seasons of the show, you know exactly what you are getting yourself into. However, there is one huge difference between the movie and the show: the first half takes place in NEW YORK CITY.  As a New Yorker, it was an absolute joy watching my favorite group of animated girls take on the great metropolis on the other side of the world. It also had great insight into how Japanese people think of the United States. As someone who lives in NYC, I don't fully appreciate the city, but from the perspective of Japanese high school girls, it must be a helluva place.  It is also clear that the art crew for the movie did their research and location scouting in NYC, because a lot of the spots featured throughout the film are locations I walked through just last week (although it's also clear that they probably didn't interact much with real New Yorkers; the NYers featured in the film are WAY too nice and well-mannered haha).  Anyway, my review breakdown:   Story: 6  The story for the Love Live! anime has never been any more than a means to get the girls dancing and singing, and the movie's no different in this regard. Basically, the plot is very simple: the girls have been invited to perform a live concert in New York City (the first half of the movie), and after they get back to Japan, they are surprised to find out that their overseas stint has earned them fame back home (second half of the movie). There is some drama involved regarding the third years graduating and whether to continue the group, but it's basically the same main conflict as the second season of the TV anime. Once the group gets back to Japan, it's the usual stuff we've already seen before.  The plot is pretty bare-bones, and since this movie is almost 2 hours long, there were definitely parts of the film that felt dragged out. Some of the songs and dance sequences also came out of nowhere with little segue, like some sort of Broadway musical. Overall, I'd have to say the story was the weak point of the film.   Art: 9  The animation is almost the same as from the show, and all the characters' movements and features are beautifully animated. The musical dancing scenes are especially well-done, although I'm not a big fan of the CGI concerts (this film has 3 of those, and 3 purely 2D ones).  One place the movie surpasses the show is the backgrounds. As I said before, the backgrounds for New York are meticulous and surprisingly accurate. The Akihabara backgrounds are quite detailed as well. It was quite amusing looking at all the brand parodies in the background in the film's attempt to avoid a copyright lawsuit.  Overall, solid art and animation, slight but not major improvement over the show.   Sound: 9  All the characters' voices are on point as usual. It was quite amusing listening to Honoka and Nozomi trying to speak English in NYC. To the film's credit, they actually got legit English speakers to voice the New Yorkers in the movie, so the film remains MOSTLY Engrish-free.  The songs are the catchy tunes we've come to expect, and pair off really well with the dance sequences. However, I will say that the 6 songs featured in the film are not the series' strongest ones (my personal opinion is that the group's best song was the opening from season 1). They are quite good, but not good enough to put on my iPod.   Character: 7  All the characters we know and love are back, a mysterious new character comes into the mix, and a new generation of school idols are hinted at towards the end of the film. But there is one HUGE problem.  It's no secret that Honoka is the least popular of the 9 girls, and after watching this film, I think I know why: the film spends WAY too much running time trying to develop Honoka's character and her inner struggles as the team leader.  It would be fine if it's an episode of the show, but in a 2-hour film like this, the result is that screen time is taken from the other girls who are just as, if not more, interesting in terms of talent and personality as Honoka. By the end of the film, I wished there was less Honoka, and more of the other girls. Not a problem with Honoka's character herself, but more with the direction of the movie.  Also, as expected, Nico gets all the funniest scenes in the film. She's my favorite. :D   Enjoyment: 10  Despite some of the flaws I listed above, the film was overall wholly enjoyable. A great way to spend 2 hours sitting back and enjoying some great music and dancing, funny antics, and cute girls doing cute things. What more could an anime fan ask for? If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the show, then you are sure to enjoy this movie as well.  Overall: 8";Recommended

The story seems to be bland but the implied content there is very strong. I do not want to spoiler it but, you need to watch it to understand so, I just leave it here.  For animation, Sunrise really did a good job maintaining their usual animation performance much like previous LL series like dancing and background. For OST, it was pleasant to hear with their singing while dancing, also they included some nice old soundtrack and for me it’s pretty much nostalgic.  Verdict (for movie): For any anime watchers or Love Live fans who has finished LL S1 & S2, I strongly recommended to watch this movie as the answer for those who feel empty after their finished the series like me. You may feel like boring or not-to-awesome like previous series, but there is something that the movie or specifically Muse want to say to you. As always, it’s 10/10 for me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Final verdict: So, the movie has end, from what I can view, think and understand about this series. It’s one of the masterpieces in anime industry. I know you might want to say, I’m biased or something like that but to tell you the truth, LL series so far has moved me way better than anime I have done watched. The exciting, the feels, the emotions are really portrayed and it makes you truly immersed with the characters especially Muse member (of course).  I would not recommend for those who have weak-willed or easily to feel depressed because the sad moment can strike you hard but, the cure is out there which is LL movie, so go finish the series as soon as possible and watch the movie. I’m really sad because Muse was disbanded and because of that I cried a lot, depressed and empty-inside but, as Honoka said: “We will see this through the end” and it turns out to be true which the ending was the movie.  I will try to support new incoming school idol “Aquors” but to me Muse still my best school idol and I can’t deny that. Last but not least, I still remember their catchphrase ""Muse - A story achieved together"" which was true since their first single. Thanks for reading my review and I really appreciated that.

3;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;AndyKyrielight;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AndyKyrielight;10;The Love Live movie celebrates what μ’s essentially is, namely the school idol project. The idol group was formed as a way to save the girls’ school, Otonokizaka Academy, from having to close down. While μ’s mainly consists of the nine school idols, other Otonokizaka Academy students - as well as the principal - always offer their support when it comes to organising and promoting performances. However, as the third years graduate, the group comes to realise they cannot continue as school idols anymore and begin to fear that the end of μ’s will mark the end of their friendship.  Over the course of the movie, the members of μ’s mature by accepting the inevitable end of their school idol project and by understanding what it means. The band members realise that their friendship is not bound by idoling and how a shared love of something can bring together different people. This, also understanding that, even when that thing is over, it won’t spell the end for their friendship. Love Live! The School Idol Movie celebrates μ’s and the friendship that binds them.  While the latter half of the movie focuses more on Honoka, the screen-time the μ’s band members receive is very evenly distributed. All members get their chance to shine through songs and character moments, yet the movie still always focuses on them as a group, be it a group of friends or an idol group. Additionally, the movie features three insert songs sung by the third, second and first years, respectively, giving every year the opportunity to stand out. This shared focus on all of μ’s’ members further emphasises the theme of friendship, which ultimately takes centre stage.  The movie consists of two parts: The first part finds μ’s going to New York in an attempt to make school idols more popular worldwide, and the second part deals with μ’s’ last performance as a group. One could even argue that the movie serves as a great introduction to Love Live as it is exactly what fans have come to expect from this slice-of-life idol anime and doesn’t really offer anything new but a shiny exterior. To some viewers, exactly this may pose a problem since they have expected something bigger, especially plot-wise. The plot of the second part as well as the centre issue μ’s has to deal with in particular are rather problematic as they have already been done in the TV series, though in the movie it is elaborated upon. However, Love Live is not beloved for it’s deep and meaningful plot. You watch it for its light-heartedness, its innocence, its catchy J-Pop and most importantly, its loveable characters with their contagious cheerfulness.  Love Live! The School Idol Movie is Still 10/10. Very enjoyable, Had laughs but mostly crying at the end cause they are ending. All the performance is amazing too for me. If you're a fan of the Love Live series, then you should watch this. Actually, if you're a fan of the Love Live series, then I don't know why you haven't watched this already.  However, if you're looking for a film that has a deep storyline, and unique characters, then you're better off looking for another anime movie.;Recommended
4;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;Mata1ch1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mata1ch1;9;My first introduction to the Love Live! franchise was the app game Love Live! School Idol Festival. It's a very fun, challenging, and addictive game. The playlist is very well done. Some of the songs are very very good!  I almost didn't watch the movie since I haven't watched seasons 1 or 2 yet. But since I already knew the characters from the game I figured I just watch the movie and watch the 1st 2 seasons later on. I'm glad I did because the movie on it's own was great.  The story is easy to follow and not very complex but it manages to still be a really good story that will invoke both laughter and tears. You kind of start to get the feeling of how important it is to make good memories with your friends and enjoy the time you have together growing up. Eventually things change and as adults we will see some of our friends go a different path than we might take. So no regrets... cherish these moments now.  The art was stunning from the streets of New York to the sakura trees of Japan. Everything is vibrant and colorful. The 3 main musical sequences in the movie were beautiful. The New York outfits RAWR! The group idol outfits very nice. And the outfits for the end performance were stunning.  Although the music for the game is much better. The songs in the movie were okay. The main songs and side songs actually fit their respective moments pretty well.  I enjoyed watching this movie more than I thought. Even though this isn't the type of anime I usually watch. (more action and fight scenes type of anime) It's really worth watching if you're already thinking about watching it. Even if you haven't seen the previous 2 seasons, I don't really think you need to. It's still a great movie even if you're not familiar with the characters.  Thank you for reading. Enjoy the show! ^_^;Recommended
5;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;TheBaka-Otaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheBaka-Otaku;9;I managed to finally watch Love Live and this time in theaters! It was an amazing experience might I add even though it was the second screening and there were no posters... So let me say that this was an insanely great movie and really showed what I love most about Love Live... The music.  The story was good don't get me wrong but overall I really enjoy the music even though I can't understand what they are saying. The songs have a catchy beat to them that just get's stuck in your head. It's been over 12 hours since I watched it and I still have Sunny Day Song stuck in my head and have already listened to it over 15 times!  The story this time was a little different in the sense that it's the buildup to the end of Muse. They plan to break up after a concert to show the appeal of school idols to the world. Before this happens though they end up going to America to meet up and do an interview about School Idols and also play a Live. They sing the song Angelic Angel which let me say I have played a bunch on the game.  They return to America and... BOOM all of a sudden they are extremely popular with everyone and there are posters and there Live of Angelic Angel playing all over the place. They are shocked but more importantly they are surrounded by their fans in the airport!  After running away from their fans the problem arises *HAHA The puns* where they must decide... will Muse break up or will they continue to sing as Idols! If you didn't figure it out yet they broke up there band and finished off the movie with Sunny Day Song!  The movie overall was abesolutely amazing and brings back the feels of the anime when you watched it for the first time. There were many funny moments throughout the movie and it was much more enjoyable then I had expected! Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Love Live Franchise and also anyone who hasn't seen Love Live should defianetely watch the series then the movie.;Recommended
6;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;-aochii-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-aochii-;10;Disclaimer: I'm a huge Love Live fan, so this review is most probably biased. Also, this is my first review, so I'll try to not spoil anything.  Love Live, the series that has touched the hearts of many and united a lot of people. It is no doubt well-loved. So to see a part of such a series end, it must be pretty painful and sad, right?  Story - 6  I give the story a 6 since there isn't really much to it, really. The movie picks off right where the second season ends, with the reveal of the message Hanayo receives after the third years graduate at the end of the last episode of season two. There, they find out that they've been actually invited to perform abroad. Obviously, they take the opportunity and fly to New York to further make people know and acknowledge the existence of school idols, all while Honoka struggles with herself to find closure with the end of μ's.  Yeah, there isn't really much to say about the story, it's simple and plain enough to understand.  Art - 9  Now we're going to the good stuff. This art and animation in the movie is a great improvement from the two previous TV shows. It's more fluid and nicer to look at, something changed about the color, too. However, the greatest improvement in the art and animation, in my opinion, is the animation during scenes where they dance and sing, the CG scenes.  Anyone who has watched season 1, season 2, and this movie know what I'm talking about. The CG animation from the two TV shows were admittedly terrible, they looked really choppy and bland. They obviously stepped up their game in the movie since the dances look smoother and the colors more vibrant (especially during BokuHika, the last song). It was a really nice change, and it made the experience of watching the movie way better.  Sound - 9  Well, since this is an anime that revolves around the world of school idols, music has to play a huge role in this series, and I'm happy to say that they didn't disappoint.  Sure, I really am Love Live trash, so my taste in music may be biased as well, but I really enjoyed the songs that were in this movie. From the first song from the first years, to BokuHika, I enjoyed every moment listening to the music and watching the characters sing and dance. I can't really say the same thing to the BGMs, however. They aren't really memorable. Heck, I've forgotten about most of them.  The voice acting was great. No complaints there.  Character - 10  Now this is the part where the series really shines, in my opinion. The characters are way too lovable and relatable. Watching them interact with their new environment and with each other was extremely enjoyable. Their characters work so well with each other, that they make a scene of them just talking to each other a nice watch.  Sure, the cast may be pretty cliche. Honoka, the energetic and optmistic leader. Maki, the tsundere. Eli, the cool beauty, etc... But they work together in a way that makes you not mind at all.  Enjoyment/Overall - 10  Of course, I enjoyed every second I spent watching this film, and I've re-watched it multiple times already. If you're a fan of the Love Live series, then you should watch this. Actually, if you're a fan of the Love Live series, then I don't know why you haven't watched this already.  However, if you're looking for a film that has a deep storyline, and unique characters, then you're better off looking for another anime movie.;Recommended
7;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;8;"I've talked about the first two series of Love Live. In both cases the results were fairly positive and I rather enjoyed the experience. I'm sure some of you are thinking, ""but you're literally the biggest killjoy in existence, you aren't allowed to like things."" I'm sorry, but that accusation is still hilarious to me. Putting that aside, the second series of Love Live ended with Hanayo getting a message and running off excitedly, followed by the other members of μ's. This film, released last year, follows that plot thread. So, does it lead somewhere interesting or will this be a waste of our time? Let's look.   Story:  We open with the members of μ's learning that the next love live competition is going to have a larger venue than any before. With plans for it to be held at the Akiba Dome. In order to make those plans come to fruition, they're asked to go overseas as the winners of the last competition and gather interest. In the process, they find themselves riding a sudden wave of popularity, forcing them to question whether they really want to disband.  The biggest weakness of the film is that a lot of the main conflict is based on retreading through the ending of the second series and the questions the girls have to ask themselves do lose some of their impact.  That being said, overall, the film works quite well. The pacing is well done. The charm and fun of the series are very much present. Even the retreading does kind of work, given that there's a strong impetus for them to have second thoughts.  Characters:  The cast doesn't develop all that much beyond where they were in the series proper. Which makes some sense, given that the film takes place directly after. The film's strong suit lies in taking these familiar characters and putting them in a new situation. Which allows some new facets to emerge for their characters and enables some strong interactions among them.  Art:  The artwork looks a lot like the artwork from the series.Which isn't a bad thing by any stretch. the dancing and musical numbers are vibrant, interesting and very nicely done. The characters look good, particularly when it comes to their costuming, and the backgrounds are nicely detailed.  Sound:  I can't complain about the sound. The cast is made up of excellent singers who are also strong actresses. The sound track is as magnificent as you'd expect based on the series.   Ho-yay:  The film doesn't include les-yay to the extent that the series does, probably because they don't have as much time. However, they still have a good amount. Hanayo & Rin get a romantic moment. Niko gets seemingly jealous over seeing Maki act close to another girl. Niko, Honoka & Eri share a bed in the Honeymoon suite and there's just a lot of general intimacy among the girls.  Final Thoughts:  Love Live: The School Idol Film is about what you'd expect. It's a charming film with endearing characters, superb acting and music and ample amounts of les-yay. I would say that it's well worth the watch. As such my final rating is going to be an 8/10. Tomorrow, I'll look at something where I don't have a good idea of what I can expect. I'll be looking at Magic Tree House.";Recommended
8;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;EbiNewin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EbiNewin;9;The video review is up, but here is the written Review. This review may be a bit biased due to my fanboyism. I had an awesome opportunity to go watch this Movie in Theatres, with a bunch of awesome people. Whether they were cosplayers or just fans, this franchise has meant a lot to them. And it’s sad to see it all come to an end, but with that they gave us the fans what we wanted and ended on a high note.  Story - 7/10  If you haven’t seen or watched the Love Live! Yet, I recommend you go watch it, because there might be some spoilers ahead.  The story begins right after the ending of Season 2 of Love Live! Where Hanayo gets an email from the organizers of the Love Live! Competition to hold another Love Live! in Tokyo Dome, but in order for that to happen, they need more publicity, so they ask μ's to go to America to give them more coverage. At least that is what the first half of the movie is about, the second half of the movie focuses more of the group μ's and their future, without spoiling too much.  The first half, when μ's is in New York plays out as a rather light hearted slice of life, where the girls just basically act like how tourists should. They basically just have fun in New York leading up to their concert at Times Square. The pacing of the movie felt kind of awkward as they seem to jump through multiple plots a lot. There was so much story they were trying to fit in, so some of it concluded either awkwardly or felt too rushed. However some of the plot either made no sense or didn’t needed to be included in the first place. Such as a certain scene where A-Rise is asking to sing with μ's, although the conversation happened, it never really happened in the Movie. And there was a bit of supernatural themes in the movie as well, as we see this mystery woman in the movie, who resembles Honoka, but it’s never confirmed who she is. The story felt like it was doing too much for its 1 hour and 40 minute runtime. We see the girls go to New York, come back realizing their super famous, deciding whether to stay together or not, and organizing a concert. However despite all this, it ended nicely.  Characters - 9/10  For the characters all I can is that we get an equal amount of time to spend with all them, with the exception of Honoka, who gets the most attention. But over the course of the movie who see Honoka struggling to make a decision whether to keep μ's or disband them, and it’s that development towards the decision is what makes this story so heart-warming and incredible. The highlights are when all the girls interact with each other, the amount of time they spend with each other a reflected on how feel about each other. They all have the mentality this is the last time they spend, so all their interactions felt very emotional. However they also felt so real as well, as we can feel the emotion in their reactions. Because Love Live! has been more about the members of μ's, its sad to see them interact with each other for one last time, so their final moments together are very touching and entertaining at the same time. I still wished we saw more of the other members of μ's, because Honoka was shown a lot, and I get she’s the center, but an idol anime should be about the members, not just one character, which is kind of disappointing to me.  Animation and Sound 9/10, 10/10  The art style and animation is pretty much the same as the tv anime, however there is clearly more detailed put in the movie. The backgrounds look amazing, they look colourful and lively, which is something that was lacking from the tv anime. This can be seen when they go to New York and Akihabara, the environment feels so at home and warm to their real life counter parts. The girl’s designs are cute as usual. However the performances are what shines the most, even though I’m still not a huge fan of 3D, I can’t help but appreciate the choreography of the songs, they used. It runs smooth and looks nice. Where the anime shines the most is not during the 3D performances, but during the times when the characters would randomly break into song like a Disney Musical, where the animation is done in 2D, which makes me wish for them to have done the performances all in the 2D, because it looks so much better.  There are 6 main songs in the Movie, 3 of them are Performances and 3 of them are where the characters of each year level break into song randomly. The highlights would be Sunny Day Song, when μ's is performing in front of massive crowd in Akihabara, and the fact that they had so many other idols in the background, it ran smoothly. And 2 of the songs the first and third years broke into where amazing as well, and was so awesome to listen to. There is one thing I like to say about the set list is, it feels there was too little and they didn’t really sound as good as Season 1, in my opinion. To me season 1 had better songs, but I would say the movie is slightly on par with season 2, it’s just because season 2 had Snow Halation. Also apparently the mystery woman was singing an English song, in the Japanese theatrical release, however it was just ‘lalala’ in the global release. Also speaking of the voices, big props to the studio getting actual Americans to play the New Yorkers during the New York scenes, as you can tell their Japanese was so cringe, and also hearing μ's, English was so cringe as well, but in a good way. Because that’s how they should sound, as foreigners.  Enjoyment - 10/10  If your fan of Love Live! You’re going to love this movie. The movie itself pays so much homage for the fans of the franchise, so as a fellow fan, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The reason for it is because I love the series and know the characters and all their personalities. A lot of the comedy are rehashed from the tv series or reflecting on the characters personalities as we know them, which is why the movie does so well, when we the fans know these are how these characters react. However if you don’t know how these characters are, you’ll be confused. There is a lot of enjoyable moments in the movie and fan service. And I’m not talking about fan service as we see sexualise content, but we see quite a few shippings here and there, which got the audience in the cinema hyped. Especially one scene that was my highlight involving Maki and Nico, who are if you haven’t guessed my favourites. But there is still a lot enjoy from this movie than just the character interactions, the performances and song bring a nice blissful vibe to the whole movie, and your just filled with glee afterwards, which works so well with the ending, because you’re happy to see these characters interact one more time. And I know from experience this is how Idols usually work, they sometime in their lives have to stop, but when they do, there is always another light at the end of the tunnel, and you can’t help but appreciate you were part of the journey.  Verdict - 9/10  As we begin to wrap up the review, I give the story a 7. The story is weakest part of the movie for it’s awkward pacing and plot holes, however it is a heart-warming story that should make you feel emotional in a happy way and it ended well.  The Animation and Sound get a 9 and 10. The detailed put into the backgrounds and choreography are amazing to look at. And the performances in 2D are awesome to look at, but it does make me wish the 3D performances were 2D, I’m just not a huge fan of the 3D, that is all. The soundtrack it may not be as good as Season 1, but it’s still exciting and enjoyable to listen to. They are all condense with emotion, and the singing is just incredible and brings out the best in you with its happy vibe.  The characters get a 9 from me, because each characters get equal amount of screen time, it’s only the fact we see Honoka too much I’m deducting a point, because it should be more about the whole group. But their interactions with each other were good and it was nice to see their relationship with each other for one more time as they develop.  For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 10. As this is a movie for the fans, the plot touched my heart and the amount of references and appreciation for the fans in the movie is incredible. This movie is indeed a big thank-you for the fans, and I enjoyed every moment of the movie.  So for the overall score of Love Live! The School Idol Movie, I give it a 9/10. For casual anime fans this can be debatable, so this movie is aimed towards its fans. I recommend this movie as a must watch for Love Live! fans there is so much tributes for them. I also recommend this to idol fans as the story is very touching and light hearted to enjoy. As Love Live! fan this movie is a big amazing send off for μ's, the anime at least, because I don’t know if the actual group is stopping yet.;Recommended
9;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;Nadimi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nadimi;8;"When you're a 20-year-old woman who enjoys watching the animated adventures of Japanese school girls, then you know that there either must be something with you that is seriously wrong, or that the creators of this anime must be doing something seriously right. Personally, I like to think it's the latter, and I hope that this review will not only illustrate why, but that it will also encourage you to watch Love Live! The School Idol Movie.  As with the original series, the art and animation used in this anime are truly outstanding. The dance sequences (as well as the outfits and the facial expressions) are as spectacular as ever, although now they also come with some new settings and backgrounds.  Since part of this movie takes place in New York City, we get to see a bit of America come to life through the eyes of Japanese artists and animators as well as those of animated Japanese schoolgirls. (Although I personally hate how pretty much every 2 out of 3 movies seem to take place in New York, seeing it in animated form is a different story.)  If you watch anime, then you probably know how the Japanese cleverly avoid copyright issues by switching around letters and slightly altering logos of famous brands and trademarks. This movie is no different, and its Japanese take on Times Square and Broadway is nothing short of hilarious. The Phantom of the Opera becomes ""Phantasm"", Mamma Mia! becomes ""Oh Dio"", and (my personal favorite) The Lion King becomes ""The Tiger Queen"". If these funky signs fail to elicit a laugh or a smile from you, then worry not, as there is plenty of Engrish and cultural clashes to keep you amused. From American girls making the Japanese girls feel uncomfortable by being overly friendly, to the former not knowing what ""school idols"" are and the latter being fed up with eating bread, all these funny / awkward incidents are extremely well grounded in reality and make this movie feel as authentic and realistic as its depictions of Central Park and the Statue of Liberty.  Although I would have personally loved to have seen the girls spend more time in NYC so that they could have come across more different, foreign (and inevitably funny) experiences, I do realize that the prime focus of this anime is music and singing rather than international differences, similarities, or cultural clashes. Since younger audiences might also be unable to catch on on these little quirks, having the girls quickly go back to Japan seemed like an understandable and logical course of action.  Regardless of whether the girls are in Japan or America, they always stay true to themselves and not only engage in their usual antics but also go through the usual struggles. Nevertheless, this movie is far from being repetitive and is not only consistent in its quality of art and animation, but also in its level of amusement and entertainment.  Love Live! The School Idol Movie is just as amusing, entertaining, and endearing as the original series. As mentioned above, in some aspects, it's even better (e.g. settings, art, and animation) while in others it's slightly worse (the story and the struggles are slightly predictable). Overall, however, it is a cute and sweet little movie as well as a wonderful addition to the Love Live! collection. Although you're likely to forget the bubbly and generic JPOP songs featured in this film, you're definitely likely to remember its lovely characters as well as the endearing, positive tingles they will have made you feel inside. If you love Love Live! (or at least kind of like it like I do), then this movie is one you simply can't miss.";Recommended
10;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;PinkyForever;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PinkyForever;10;Story: Is the last journey for Muse, I say is a good send off for them! The explanation isn't the best and you will probably get lost a little if you didn't watch all the previous show.  Art: Same thing, Character improved and the color scheme of the show is basically perfected with it!  Sound: All the song and soundtrack here is just fantastic! Maybe is just me being a fanboy here, but I think most people will enjoy the music even if they don't watch it  Character: Not much is added here outside of honoka childhood. But since is made for the fans I will let it pass  Enjoyment: Still 10/10. Very enjoyable, Had laughs but mostly crying at the end cause they are ending. All the performance is amazing too for me  Overall: Do I think this is a good way to send off Muse? Yes for sure. Do I think they should end? No. But I guess is the right decision, is time for them to rest (We are we going). If you're a love live fan you shouldn't miss out!;Recommended
11;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;cappedea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cappedea;9;How do you end a six year legacy that has helped revolutionized the way people see 2.5D idols? This is the answer.  The Idolm@ster franchise may have kickstarted the whole idea but it is without a doubt that Love Live! especially μ's made it become a cultural phenomenon nationwide in Japan. Don't get me wrong, I love both series. I am an idol fan myself. I played the Xbox 360 port of the original Idolm@ster game and have known about μ's since it debuted in 2010. It was because of Idolm@ster that I got into the world of idols in the first place anyway.  Onto the actual review of the movie - it was highly satisfying. It's the final show with a set-list of 6 new songs going into μ's Final Love Live. Sunny Day Song is my favorite μ's song. It was nice of the writers acknowledging the international popularity of the series and decided to include a K-On! Movie style trip overseas. The usage of a mysterious character personifying Honoka's inner insecurities is highly plausible. Not many slice of life series use this particular plot technique as far as I can recall. It was also theorized that the character is actually the adult version of Honoka but the movie intentionally leaves its viewers to utilize their imagination and determining the significance of her character is all up to one's personal interpretation. To me, the main message of the whole movie - the whole series even, is that even with unreliable wings, everyone can fly. The question is whether or not you're willing to risk falling and try flying again. The mysterious character helped emphasize that message. The first scene showed child Honoka jumping across a huge puddle albeit slipping into the puddle a few times. Heck, in the first episode of both season 1 and 2, Honoka jumps. She jumps a lot. It's a recurring theme. I may be mistaken but the first trailer of Love Live! School Idol Project when it was first announced in 2010 had her jumping as well.  What would happen to μ's once their third year members graduated was answered towards the end of the second season but the movie gave us a further glimpse of what happens to Otonokizaka High's Idol Research Club once all of the remaining μ's members, the first and second years, graduated which leaves a 3 year gap after μ's disbanded. This is important to take note as Love Live! Sunshine starts to take place at the end of the movie as well but was not particularly mentioned so far. Maybe it is saved for next season.;Recommended
12;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;NipahAllDay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NipahAllDay;8;"Love Live the movie is a great movie. As a fan of this franchise, it's sad knowing that it may be their last time being together. The movie knows that and does a good job at making a decision for muse. Also I am going to talk about some of the section of the movie. But it won't be that big on the spoiler side, so don't worry for the people who haven't seen the movie.  The story starts right after end of second season. (Not exactly. They show Honoka and the second years as a child first) They realize that there will be another concert. To be able to go there, they need to become more popular. They will need to go to the US. The first quarter of the movie take place in New York city. You probably wouldn't know though because they never mention New York. You could tell if you look at the buildings tho. Anyway, the story is quite simple, but it has many good meaning for both Love Live fans and non fans. The theme of Love Live is that it's not always a bad thing to say goodbye. It's about the time you had spent with each other. It is not too philosophical, but it has a strong meaning to it. I think the strongest part of the story is that they take advantage of the characterization and place them in different surroundings. They react to the things that they're not use to seeing. For example, Hanayo have problems with the restaurant because they don't have white rice. Which I can relate to her, since I really love to eat food with white rice. The movie is a huge fan service to the Love Live fans. When I say that, I meant they do many things that Love Livers like to do in the fandom; like ship tease. Some people say this already, but the pacing is the problem. To be honest, I really wanted Love Live to be a season 3 instead of a movie. I like movies and all because of the higher budget, it's very limited since it's an hour and 40 mins long. It can't really tell as much compare to a one cour season. Though it does a good job at maintaining a decent flow to the story despite that. The pacing may feel a bit weird because they go point A to point B fairly quick in the movie. After the concert, there's a section when Honoka was by herself and she meet this woman who look similar to her. Hm, I wonder who is she? After their first meeting, Honoka talk about her problem with her. The older woman question Honoka's deliema and tells her the best option to deal with it. It plays a big role later on in the movie. I think this was done wonderfully. This developed Honoka to be a mature leader and decides what best for muse.  I mention the characters already, but I want to add something. The characters doesn't really go though a huge development compare to Honoka, but that isn't a bad thing. There's no reason for them to change. They are developed enough and the story is about them growing a bond with each other. They are likable and flesh out from second season.  The animation improved a lot. The camera angle and cinematography are lively and appealing as always. They done a lot better at the transition to 2D to CGI. Speaking of CGI, it looks a lot smoother and better. I know some people have problems with CGI, but it's not really bad. If you compare to Idol anime or anime CGI in general, it's not that bad as you are making it to be. The characters design felt strange to me. They look the same, but at the same time, it feels different. I think it's just me, but is Honoka's and Maki hair a bit darker?  The soundtrack as usual is good. The insert songs is really catchy and upbeat. There's not much to talk about it. I would recommend you to listen to the ost and songs when you have the chance, unless you don't like j-pop. Also I want to give props for having real English speakers to voice the people. I think the acting is meh, but I love the effort tho.  Overall, I think Love Live is a great film. I would totally get it when it gets a home release in United States with an English dub. I gave it an 8 if I want to be critical about it. 10 for my enjoyment.";Recommended

14;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;-Kurara-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-Kurara-;8;"That's not easy to separate a portion of something that completes itself very goodly, and judge such a portion as only one thing. Especially when it comes, specifically, to a so witty film as the first one of Love Live's franchise. Before all, I'd like to make it clear that this is my first time doing a review, so I apologize if I am not clear enough, or if in some moment I sound more like a fan (or a hater) than an imparcial spectatress.  Since the beginning the film is surprising: the photography's finesse and choices, the calm soundtrack and the conceptive equilibrium of the initial scene (Honoka, when she was a child, trying to jump over a puddle and failing) represent the direction's thorough job, and its cleanliness with the project.  Love Live's movie is dynamic: in only five minutes, we can all get aware about the girls' situation, that travels to United States to announce a new Love Live event. Availing of this new ambient, the script makes well used jokes in every good moment, what creates an even bigger interest for the protagonists' journey.  About the script, it's good in lots of things, at least in the initial ⅔ of the anime. It uses the pauses in the agitated soundtrack to capture surprising expression from all the characters, producing funny moments and fanservice; it has brief dialogues, full of precise informations; and it doesn't keep everything melodramatic. That's a great form to work with such a plot (taking into account that there are nine protagonists to a moderated screen's time).  The movie's rhythm is impressive: the serenity in all the presented topics, just like if anything had been previously timed , creates an incredibly natural ambiance, avoiding to be too fast in its development. During the film, everything looks like just another TV show's episode.  It doesn't disappoint in terms of photography as well; all the choices of angles and takes is simply inspiring, with really beautiful and memorable frames, since the vision of buildings until an impressive flowers field. Similar to the Disney's animated movies, Love Live: The School Idol Movie is full of musicals, all of them, incredible. There's no any presentation without a great characterization, choreography and lyrics. For being such a beauty, these musicals work as a river between the film's acts, separating the development from the conflict, and etcetera.  Bad things in the movie   The script begins to oscillate in the moment Honoka gets lost from her friends, and knows a misteryous singer. Even though it creates a little doubt about the woman's identity (and her presence shows more demonstrations of geniality from the movie's producers and directors) her presence is more like a convenience than any other thing. And, being sincere, that's a little predictable where that part of the story was going to end, since our first contact with the character. Another problem present in the development is the rhythm loss of the final moments. In the movie's conclusion, the work stops being really dynamic, losing time in trivial things, what cracks the cadence and dynamism of the movie until that moment.  Conclusion  Even though the plot's content hasn't been very good or necessary since the beginning, the film was going in a great way, and for this reason it was very above average. Losing a little of this sagacity after the Honoka's past resolution (that thing with the puddle), the movie lost quality. However, ignoring these little imperfections, and the unnecessary fanservice in some moments, the first Love Live's movie is a really fine work, principally in technical terms. A very beautiful movie, full of memorable moments and great messages.";Recommended
15;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;leezodne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/leezodne;8;"Love Live! School Idol Movie: The moment when these girls, the U's, went out with a bang.  Setting aside the obvious question of ""Why did they not think that they are popular already before the tour overseas,"" and how convenient things are for these girls and other side characters--I think I have no complaints about this movie (speaking plot-wise). The story has this feeling that their time as a school idol group (and also the time for the series) is coming to an end. Conflicted with the dilemma of going to continue as a group, or reforming the group, or just putting it to an end; the main characters are having difficulties with finding the ""right"" answer. The movie's plot revolves around that idea alone (and of course, along with the plot is the situational Music Videos and frequent comedy scenes).  Compared to the prequels to this movie, I find that this had better animation, and better combination with the ""usual art"" and the CG animation. They blended these two kinds of animations beautifully. But then again, you can't help but think of their faces and body proportions and motions as something weird when compared to their ""usual state"" when they are drawn by hand instead of being a computer-generated art.  With regard to the characters in the movie... There really isn't much to work with the characters. Given that there are already two seasons completed before they released the movie, it is very difficult to introduce additional characters that will contribute to the plot and plot progression of the film. I find it to be ""okay"" when they inserted an additional character that will help Honoka find a resolution for the group as the leader of U's. But the rest was just ""same old, same old . . .""  For the final aspect, I find the sound very appropriate and fitting (regardless of a few bumps every now and then). As expected, I've given it a full score for it.  Rating: story 7/10 art & animation 9/10 character 8/10 sound 10/10 (Rewatch score) Overall 8/10; I found it to be enjoyable and quite good as a sequel to the two seasons, nothing serious and nothing to be missed, but it's a good ending for the Love Live! School Idol Project series.";Recommended
16;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;arvincom;https://myanimelist.net/profile/arvincom;8;"*this is the first time I'll be doing a review*  As someone who rarely likes Idol-theme show (or rather can't finish watching them), This movie is indeed a good one to boot (and I manage to finished it without being to tired from dealing the drama), and serves as a end pin to the great big franchise. (Unless the guys from Sunrise decided to make a spin-off of this show.)  Story: 7  I appeal that this story is actually good despite not really meant for greatness. But I kinda liked on how they managed to close the fact that the the story is true and most of us will eventually or has experience such kind of dilemma. But I think the story kinda a bit dragged and almost ruined my view on this one, But they managed to end it in at least around 25-30 minute time frame when it was needed to be delivered. But, The story shouldn't have focused on one side of the coin... But instead, make use of it's great cast.  Art: 9  Art is almost everything that can decide if it's a great watch or not. Art in this category is good and the animation used is somewhat a mix of 2D and 3D and sometimes purely 3D. The art in this movie is great and almost accurate to the details.  Sound: 9  I remember the time when someone makes a comparison on the certain Idol shows that are flourishing and was talked about. They say that If you want to listen to great sounds, Love live is the way to go. I kinda agreed to that after Listening the songs played in the movie itself. The ED is interesting (I could probably put it in my music player and now Love Live OP in season 1 is not alone).  Character: 7  Love Live Characters kinda fell flat for great characters. But They do have great chemistry despite having those kind of character. Nico Is funny as expected, Maki was very endearing and some of them are also good, if not great.  Enjoyment: 8  Despite some flaws on how the characters work and how the story kinda dragged the movie plus the prevalence of elements in a drama (which I think kinda failed to get me engaged). Overall, This movie is a good watch.I enjoyed the time they had in NYC, the random inserts of some songs and the few moments before their last hurrah. The Music is great, the dance was alright and the feeling good mood is also good. Though I didn't get a good cry on this film but overall, this movie is good; A good movie by standards.  Overall: 8  As a non-Love Live fan, I can vouch that it is good and is enjoyable. I might hit the two seasons if I can get my hands free.";Recommended

The School Idol Movie"" is not only the best anime movie I've seen in years, it's simply the BEST movie I've seen in years and is, very thankfully, the movie that the loyal Love Live fan base rightfully deserved. Honestly there isn't much to say about this movie, it plays out like a collage of everything that made Love Live the beloved series it is and adds a deeper, more philosophical spin on it all. Rare is the event that I would recommend a movie even to somebody who hasn't seen the parent anime series but this may be such an event.  The Love Live movie is every bit as musical as the rest of the franchise with the girls spontaneously breaking out in song and dance. Every little character quirk returns and we get to see M's travel abroad(personally this is the highlight of the movie). Recapping the moral of the entire franchise, the movie tells a story of friendship and perseverance. A story achieved together.";Recommended

I just watch love live recently even though it was released all the way back then in 2013 and the hype was great but I was a little bit skeptical about the show back then so I dropped it, I meant like, really? Idol based anime? but I was wrong and this anime got much more than just Idol in it now I regret why I didn't watch it way back then in 2013 so I can join the hype train. Those feelings that has been built up from love live first season and second season all come into this one movie, it is a burst of feelings for the fans, and for you who haven't watch the first and second season, this like the ending part so watch the first and second before you watch this. Love live itself is a very motivating anime not for just those who strive to be an idol, but for everyone to keep your spirit up everyday in every up and down of life. The movie of course a must watch for the all the fans out there and I highly recommend you who are at the not so good moment of your life to watch love live, this anime has the power to pull you out from that bad moment.;Recommended

0;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;-Remix-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-Remix-;5;"When I started to watch Love Live!, I was extremely skeptical of how the plot would play out. I'm not really into the whole idol culture but I wanted to keep my mind open and give Love Live! a shot. And boy am I glad I did. Now I can at least appreciate what idols have to undergo.  The movie, which builds off plot-wise immediately after the second season, uses the same kind of group dynamic that was present in the second season. Although this form of group dynamic doesn't change much from the second season (or ever, lol) you could almost feel the charisma beaming from the group. The characters, despite the fact that their personalities are clearly drawn from stereotypes/archetypes, clearly mesh together very, very well. They complement each other and this is reflected through their dialogues and reactions.  As for the sound, well, this should be pretty self-explanatory. What would a music-themed anime be without, well, music? One interesting thing that this movie does differently from the prequels is that there is a much heavier emphasis on the sound. In the previous two seasons, the songs were still there (and done very well, if I may say so myself) but they served more to advance the plot as a whole. In the movie - for a lack of a better phrase - the μ's break out into song based on the situational context that they are in. Basically, think High School Musical all over again. Is this done well? I think so - it certainly adds new flavor to the entire series, but that is my own personal opinion.  Now for the cons. Bear with me for a bit.  The plot itself had a rougher execution than the second season. There were some parts in the movie where the plot was rushed to some degree. For example, consider the transitioning scenes from New York (where they are at Times Square) back to Japan (where they are meeting fans at the airport). To me, these scenes were kind of thrown together into an incoherent mess. Although you could tell what was happening at any given moment, sometimes the plot jumped from Point A to Point B inconsistently. These scenes needed to be flushed out more so that viewers can more easily comprehend what is happening.  Another thing I didn't really like was how the movie was piecemealed into two parts - one part in NY and the other back in Japan. The connection between these two parts of the movie needed to be more clearly established. True, perhaps their trip to NY served as inspiration to the Idol festival in Japan, but this was not really flushed out well. If the movie left out the entire adventure in NY, could the rest of the plot been executed in the same way? Perhaps. Maybe some of us wouldn't like that, but it's still possible.  One last thing: the symbolism. Okay, I know this movie tries really hard to integrate some kind of deep symbolism that was not present in the first two seasons of Love Live! But if you're like me, just an average anime watcher, the symbolism completely flies right past you (e.g. the street singer in NY). Symbols don't necessarily have to be obvious, but they should be incorporated into the plot in a way that still makes sense. But kudos for trying.  Overall, definitely a nice way to end Love Live! But is it on par with the second season? I argue not.  tl;dr  Pros: + Good music + Crisp art, like always + Good group dynamics + Some development, especially when the μ's explore their identity, but definitely not on par with the development in the second season  Cons: - Some parts of the plot transitioned poorly (i.e. were rushed), making it difficult to follow - Connection between NY + Japan somewhat unclear and needs to be flushed out more - Symbolism present but difficult to interpret  Story: 4 Art: 6 Sound: 9 Character: 6 Enjoyment: 7 Overall: 5  *Note: I put a heavier emphasis into my rating on story and characters.

1;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;theragingautist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theragingautist;6;The Love Live movie has been something that I have been looking forward to for a while now. When the time finally came to see it in theaters, I was stoked. But after seeing the movie, it left something to be desired. The movie, although enjoyable, had some pacing issues, story issues, and a ton of annoying cliches. Now I'm usually not one to dock points for story, especially for an anime about cute girls doing cute things. However, its just felt like a bunch of unrelated events which would be great as episodes of the show, but as a movie to conclude the series, it didn't do a good job at all. Another thing about this movie is that it has the exact same premise as the K-ON! movie. Seriously, it's exactly the same. Musically talented girls you come to know and love from two seasons go to a foreign English speaking country for the first part, and deal with the graduation of some of their members the second part. Now this shouldn't be a problem, given that I absolutely love everything K-ON! However, the whole movie seemed like I had already seen it as an end result. As for the pacing issues, their trip to New York really bugged me. They spent 45 minutes focusing on them walking around New York, which is fine, but instead of elaborating on why they were there at all, it just cuts to them singing, and the next cut is them on the plane back. It just seemed odd. Now I don't mind cliches, but there were so many cliches it felt almost like a cheesy musical by the end of the movie. Speaking of the ending, it left a lot to be desired. It just felt rushed and unemotional, like the writers just wanted to get it over with. However, despite these shortcomings, I did quite enjoy myself. The characters are the characters we have all come to love, except for Umi, for whatever reason she was extremely hostile in the film. The songs were decent, but they weren't nearly as catchy or enjoyable as the songs from the series. The animation was great, except for the obligatory CGI. So, should you watch the movie? If you liked the series, you for sure should watch it. While you could watch the movie without knowing nothing about the series, I wouldn't recommend it, as there are a lot of references that you can only appreciate if you've seen the series. I know this review seems like me complaining about it, but I found the movie to be very enjoyable, despite these flaws. It's worth a watch, I just wouldn't watch it expecting something as good as the actual series.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;Rinri_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rinri_;5;"A Review on Love Live: The Movie Story – The story at best is simply: “Ok”. There isn’t anything exciting or interesting about it. It’s just mediocre. This was already an apparent trend in the actual series, but having it condensed in a 1 hour 39 minute movie, really makes it obvious how bad it is. The pacing is god-awful and it just throws you from scene to scene will barely any suitable transition. At one moment, it’s like: “HAH, HAPPY FUN TIME WITH MY FRIENDS” then it’s a supposedly seriously moment with a (kinda) heavy atmosphere. Then it swaps right back to the “happy, energetic moments” with again, little to no transition. It makes you question, “what was the point of that whole scene?” It feels like a waste of time and adds nothing to the overall story. It was there for simply the moe appeal. That brings up another issue I found while watching this. Because of this over usage of dramatic moments with no substance, it made me care less and less about those moments. Why is this bad? Because when there are scenes with actual substance, such as the whole tension about continuing the Muse after the third-years graduate, I couldn’t care less about it because the viewers have already been diluted to the point where their perception is just “another pointless dramatic scene.” If I were to give this Movie anything, it creates a decent conflict for once. A battle against “ the audience they wish to continuing performing for and their relationship as a group” vs. the “philosophy of what school idol means to them”. It’s a shame the execution was just terrible, it had no proper built up, and once we got to the climax, it felt underwhelming. I also need to point out the transition to the music videos, or song section if you will. Based off what I’ve seen, it feels as if they made those segments first, and were like: A:“Hey, check out this cool music video we made!” B:“Great! Where is that going in the movie?” A:“Oh”  Out of the six song segments, I’ve seen, four of them were just awkwardly placed there for the sake of “We need to put this somewhere”. What annoys me about this is that seeing how they could fit in two other songs in the movie well, they failed to do it with the other four songs. It was lazily incorporated into the movie, and honestly felt like I was watching a kids show where they suddenly break out into song just out of nowhere. My best example of this is the first song segment. Where it’s just “suddenly, it’s raining... ooooh that’s bad… we can’t have fun… (or something). Then BAM, SONG. Like what? It goes from one side of the spectrum to the other within a split second, and the initiation to that segment was just, Rin jumping…. It’s a mess. Art – The animation has been half-and-half for me. Overall the drawn animation looks pretty good, especially during the dance segments. There are parts where it looks a bit stiff, but otherwise it was well made. My only complaint would be the CGI. It just awkward to look at and contrasts heavily with the background. You may argue that “dancing is hard to animate”, which it is, so using CGI is justified. But they keep on switching from CGI to Drawn, and sometimes the dancing is done in 2D animation, AND IT LOOKS BETTER. And sometimes they have CGI AND Drawn in the SAME SHOT. IT’S LIKE THEY COULDN’T DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY, otherwise, its awkward and a pain to look at. Sound – The music is good, this is the only good part of the movie. They’re idols after all, this is probably the reason why you’d watch this in the first place. If the music was bad, I don’t know why this movie would exist then, let alone the series. Characters – My main issue with Love Live would be its overall premise. They tried to make an anime based solely on an Idol group. That’s it. In an Idol group, you only need a few things to be successful. Good songs, Moe Characters, and quirky and cute personalities. In an anime, you can’t do that, you can try, but the quality will surely drop. The Love Live gang is just generic. They’re not interesting, they don’t have any character development, they’re just one-tricks. Quirky and baseless. It works for the first ten minutes at most, but in a movie? It gets fucking annoying. Allow me to run down the list: Honoka – Clutsy leader Rin – Makes meow noises at the end of her sentences, this isn’t cute. It’s annoying. Hanayo – WHITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Other than that, nothing is memorable. Umi – Overreacts to literally everything Maki – Generic Tsundere attitude Niko – NICO NICO NIIII. That’s her contribution to the story Kotori - Her contribution in this movie specifically was minimal, mainly just restates the lines. Nozumi – Has tarot cards and just is there. Eri – Serious, and gets the plot rolling. Of course this a general description of the characters, but it's to get my point across. The issue here is that you can’t make a show just on very shallow personalities. From start to finish, they’re the same. Boring.  Enjoyment – Can’t say I enjoyed it. I had literal headaches watching this. It was a waste of my time, and I’d rather would just want to see the music videos.  Overall – The Love Live Movie is bad…. Not terrible to the point where it’s unwatchable, nor a “masterpiece” as some may describe it. It suffers from being just extremely bland, average, and mediocre. Despite the movie having great music/dance segments, that only constitutes maybe 10% of the movie. Making the other 90% of the movie just unbearably annoying.  To clarify, I don't think Love Live as an Idol group is bad, I just think that the transition from an idol group to an anime and full-on movie was very very poor and deserves another look at the drawing board for we cannot continue with the perception that this series is ""well-made"" when it clearly lacks in the most important areas in what makes a good anime.

4;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;mintyorphan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mintyorphan;6;/// Spoilers for School Idol Project Season 2 ///  To be fair, if you went into this film thinking it was just a light-hearted, entertaining time-killer that couldn't possibly offer any artistic or creative genius, you would probably have a good time.  But unfortunately for me, School Idol Project Season 2 touched me in a way I had not thought possible. It beautifully expressed relevant themes about surrounding yourself with people that make you feel whole, enjoying your youth, and of course, knowing when to end a good thing.  This film took absolutely none of that into consideration. It simply did not need to exist, in any capacity. Season 2 crafted a beautiful and heartfelt goodbye to these characters we have grown to love, sending the third years (and the franchise, supposedly) off with Aishiteru Banzai and Oh, Love & Peace. It was perfect.  And then the money came calling.  I know it may seem odd to be getting mad that an IDOL ANIME FRANCHISE cares about making money more than producing a quality product, but if Season 2 taught me anything, it was that idol anime can be artistically AND commercially fulfilling.  But this film wasn't even bad. Angelic Angel, Hello, Hoshi wo Kazoete, ?←Heartbeat, and Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari are all absolutely fantastic songs with beautiful visuals, and as a whole, the film was very technically sound. So why am I mad?  Well, this franchise blatantly backed up on its own core themes.  In Season 2, Episode 11, μ's came together to make a very difficult decision. Even though Yukiho and Alisa would be enrolling into Otonokizaka in a few months and would love to join μ's, μ's is not μ's without the third years. It's always 9, no more, no less. They each stand out in their own way, but they only feel whole when they're around each other. THAT is their legacy: knowing when to end a good thing, even if its not an easy choice to make.  And that completely parallels the franchise itself. Yukiho and Alisa represent Aqours, and μ's represents... well... μ's. The higher-ups in Love Live could've either continued using the μ's name with the inclusion of a new generation (keeping μ's around a little longer), or made the right choice, which was to end the μ's saga while they were still on top.  We all know what they chose.  Needless to say, the μ's saga should've ended with the conclusion of season 2, but the executives decided to take the easy road and extend μ's's time in the limelight. They literally did THE EXACT OPPOSITE of the characters that THEY wrote. So to recap, some fictional Japanese schoolgirls are more mature than the executives behind the most popular idol franchise in all of Japan. Interesting.;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! The School Idol Movie;brynolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brynolf;4;"Love Live took off great with the brilliant 1st season, started to stumble with the 2nd, and lands in a real belly flop in this movie. I'm really quite sad to see it end this way.  What got me hooked from the start of the 1st season was the CG song/dance performances, and this movie lacks most of that. There are some CG left in the movie that looks cool but mostly it is just ""regular"" animation. The graphics are good, don't get me wrong, but I really liked that kind of 3D choreography with vividly moving camera angles that the first season brought.  Sadly I didn't like the music either. The first two seasons had some ups and downs regarding song quality, but in this movie, none of them hooked me. At least the voice acting is alright as always.  The plot is overly simple, un-dramatic and feels mostly like an afterthought. Half of the movie is just cute but non-funny comedy, the other half is cute but rushed, non-dramatic drama. The characters that carried a big part of the two previous seasons don't get much time to bloom, and the time they do get is mostly wasted on shallow ""comedy"". There really are too many members of Muse; sure they all have different personalities and all, but at least some of them could have been trashed to make room for the rest.  At least it looks good. NYC really gets a fair treatment and the girls are as alive and well designed as ever.  The only thing I actually enjoyed was Hanoka's ""new acquaintance"", a really beautiful symbolism that could have made a bittersweet ending even more sweet (Not that the ending actually WAS bittersweet, but I guess that's the direction they were aiming).";Not Recommended

Superstar!! 2nd Season;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;10;Just when I think Love Live has reached its peak it kicks things into gear and surpasses everything I thought I knew about this franchise. It’s with great pleasure that I say Love Live Superstar!! S2 is easily the best the franchise has ever been and is a blast from beginning to end.  When the Liella girls got announced a couple of years ago I was cautiously optimistic about how their anime would go. They had amazing designs, but not much was known about them since they were only formed in 2021. Fortunately, from the very first episode of season 1 I was hooked on the girls’ music, personalities and overall vibe of this LL iteration. That only continued to increase as season 1 went on, and things have got even better this time around in season 2. The biggest overall improvements for me are the story, the drama, the stakes and the performances. LL is at its core a light hearted idol series, but this season actually did a good job of creating tension with Keke’s family situation, introducing the new girls and Margarethe’s rivalry with Kanon.  Speaking of the new girls, I LOVE all of the first years, with the exception of Natsumi. I think they were all such great additions and Shiki and Mei have already become two of my fave idol girls in general. Seeing liella finally come together as a full unit and reach their full potential was just amazing. Of particular note for me was Sumire. She’s one of my fave characters ever, and you could really see her take major strides in this season. Going from kind of a jokey comic relief character to a real leader and her episode with Keke is among the top 3 in LL history imo. A truly beautiful episode.  Now of course, you can’t talk about an idol show without going over the music. I thought the music in this season was phenomenal. Several of the girls solo songs are on constant repeat in my playlist and it looks like Sunrise have nearly perfected CGI blending during performances too. It’s amazing how we’ve come from such blatant and obvious CGI during lives to not even being able to really detect it. Of particular note for me are Margarethe’s performance from episode 10, Liella’s first full 9 member performance and Shiki’s solo performance. All 3 were just stunning.  Love Live Superstar!! Season 1 is a must watch for any fan of the idol genre. Not only is it the perfect follow up to season 1, but it’s one of the best idol seasons, period. The Love Live franchise continues to push the bar and sit atop the music anime mountain, I do not see that changing anytime soon.  Love Live Superstar!! Season 2, gets 10 out of 10.;Recommended
1;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;Starchaser;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Starchaser;9;Love Live as a franchise shows no sign of slowing down, and the 2nd season of Superstar happily continues that momentum. The thing with sequels, is that they’re generally not as good as the original, any piece of creativity that surpasses the original is about as rare as hen’s teeth. As someone who loves Love Live to the stage and back and considers Superstar to be the best out of the four current outputs, I had feelings of excitement, curiosity and disappointment.  Thankfully, the last feeling evaporated after watching this and even before the last episode aired, I realized any fear I had was simply misplaced.  The 2nd season of Superstar continues the story of Liella! with the hopes of winning Love Live after their defeat from the previous season whilst hoping to recruit new members to the group. All the charm, positive energy, and endearing character development are all present but also refined as the girls now all feel like veteran idols whilst having a reputation to uphold. This definitely helps when it comes to introducing the new members.  Which actually was the source of my aforementioned disappointment. When it was announced that season two would be adding new characters to the group, I was surprised. Watching (and then re-watching) the first season, I didn’t notice anything that indicated something like that would happen. I was disappointed because Love Live has had nine-girl idol groups before and Superstar instead focused on a smaller cast of five which was one of the biggest draws for me. Still, I did say I would keep an open mind and in hindsight, I’m glad I did. Previous series definitely struggled when it came to introducing nine idols all in one season since there would be a few characters who were significantly less developed or captivating compared to the others.  The way Superstar solves this is by fleshing out the girls in season one and now, with the school idol club in full effect and a tangible goal in everyone’s mind, season two serves as the perfect opportunity to introduce new girls and their aspirations for idol hood, letting their characters bring new life to shake things up a bit. The four new members to make their debut in the spotlight are: Kinako, Mei, Shiki and Natsumi.  I am unapologetically partial toward Shiki. She’s without a shadow of a doubt the most relatable character any Love Live has ever created to me. She’s a science geek, part-time mad scientist, loves reading and animals, is kind and gentle and to top it all off, she’s now an idol. Even though all of those are great, it’s her long-time friendship with Mei that truly establishes her. They have a friendship that could be a spin-off on its own and the anime does a unique job of making their friendship dynamic thanks to Shiki’s constant support of Mei into becoming an idol, flashbacks to when they were in middle school and Mei’s tenderness toward Shiki. It all ties in well when the two eventually join Liella!  Speaking of Mei, she’s even more obsessed with school idols than Keke. She even applied to Yuigaoka with the hopes of joining her faves! She has something of a stubborn, tough girl exterior, but mention anything school idol related around her and she’ll get cutesy and starry-eyed. She also has a talent for playing the piano. Her character is at its best whenever she’s around Shiki, but she also has amusing moments with others, especially Kinako. It’s not a coincidence her hair is red and Shiki’s is blue. They fit the red oni, blue oni trope to a T. They are essentially the same while being different. They both are bad at expressing themselves, they’re shy, they have similar insecurities and are trying to encourage the other to keep going forward even though they never take their own advice.  Kinako is, all the way to her design, the most “normal” of the bunch and is the first one to join. That’s not to say she’s boring, she’s an excellent addition to the cast as she initially provides an outside and hilarious perspective of Liella!. It can be easy to forget that every member has their own quirks and the ability to create chaos and funny shenanigans. She also provides a bunch of heartwarming moments in the anime. Her senpai/kouhai relationship with Kanon is a wonderful example of this. It used to be Kanon who thought she wasn’t good enough to be an idol, but now she’s in a place where she can provide support and encouragement for Kinako. Kinako isn’t the first character to think there’s nothing special about her to be an idol, and that insecurity is amplified when the 2nd years try to ease up on their training schedule since she’s so far behind and second guesses whether she’s really cut out for it. While the older girls’ have good intentions when it comes to handling Kinako, she takes it as a sign of pity which just adds to her insecurity. It makes it all the better when she does stand up for herself. She knows she’s behind, she knows she has to work harder, but she’s going to become a school idol with them no matter what so they don’t have to worry about her so much!  Natsumi tends to stay in the background for a bit working various side gigs, but does get her proper introduction later. She initially comes off more of a clout chaser than anything else. She likes money, a lot, like she’s Mr. Krabs. She also didn’t have any interest in idols whatsoever so it can be easy to dismiss her as selfish. I would argue she does end up being likable once her deeper motivations are revealed, it’s just that I wish Sumire played a key factor in that. She and Sumire had and have similar motivations for joining Liella!, similar experiences with failure, even down to similar hair colour! You’d have to be as blind as Joey’s sister from Yu-Gi-Oh! to not notice the similarities. I’m not just saying that because Sumire is my favourite from the OG 5 and I want her to have more screen time (though, that’d be nice), there was a lot of potential on writing how they’re alike and in doing so, Sumire can become something of a mentor/big sister to a first year and pass on her experience and lessons to someone who needs them. Hey, I only gripe about this stuff because I’m a big fan of Love Live and these characters are so realized, but I believe there are better ways to make that even more so.  Regarding realized characters, just because new characters are brought in, doesn’t mean the older girls don’t get any more development. Kanon becomes something of a mentor figure, Chiasto becomes more of a leader, Ren ends up picking up a new hobby, and Keke and Sumire’s relationship deepens. It shows how far they’ve all come while also having them take on new roles.  My biggest complaint though has got to be the character, Margarete. I don’t hate or even dislike her, but I did have mixed feelings about her in the beginning, and in the end, my feelings haven’t changed. But I at least sympathize with her. She’s supposed to be this mysterious, skilled rival to Liella!, and especially to Kanon. She comes off as someone who’s stuck-up, mean and aloof, but you begrudgingly admit they’re talented. As expected from Love Live, there’s always something else to it. It’s just that I don’t find it all that compelling when it comes to how her problem can be solved. No spoilers though!  Art and animation remain as impressive as ever. All the characters look as visually charming as before, the world/background still has a very warm feel to it, the performances are a treat to look at, and you can play a game of pausing the anime to see the distinct, unique and funny facial expressions the characters make (Natsumi and Mei do this a lot). Love Live in general never fails to impress in this department.  The 2nd season’s music is wonderful, another facet Love Live excels at. I really enjoyed this OP because it conveys the theme of winning, something Liella! hasn’t had the experience of yet. It gives a very happy, uplifting vibe to this season. The music throughout is all about keeping with that style, giving it a determined feeling. The voice actors continue to do a stellar job with their respective characters and kudos must be given to the voice actors of the new members as they convincingly bring their character’s personality to life.  Superstar continues to be a truly enjoyable series overall. Personally, I would see it equal in every aspect with the 1st season. While maintaining everything that made it great, the 2nd season leaves on a high note for the upcoming 3rd season.  That's all I have to say. Thanks for reading.  そんじゃ　あばよ！!;Recommended
2;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;Naneo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naneo;9;New season, new member, new song, new rival. We will now continue to follow the story of our fellow Liella member on their 2nd years of high school. With the school popularity increasing because Liella live show last season, the school is saved from closing down. And now they have a new goal. Win Love Live tournament and recruiting new members for Liella.  Even though we are not facing a graduation problem like every previous Love Live anime, it can still give us some emotional story. I'm not saying previous Love Live installment is bad its just a breath of fresh air to not see this graduation problem on 2nd season of Love Live. Instead we get served with new and unique story only Liella could have. We have heavy problem that include tears dropping everywhere. And we also have the silly problem like gaming addiction, yes idol anime girls with gaming addiction. That is my favorite episode.  Though we got new members now, the old members is not forgotten. We can still see their characters development, even more deep into their personality and personal struggle. At early episode is what i thought the best in context of characters. Because everyone act so realistic to the situation. One example is how the 1st years feel insecure around their upperclassmen. You should watch it yourself really. One thing that still didnt fit for me is their new rival. How she introduced and her act is just weird. I mean its unique, but still kinda weird.  There isn't any significance change in art from season 1. They still got the colorful and vibrant animation style. Plus now there is a lot of new characters design with bright hair color. Actually this affect me on pre-anime hype. There's this one girl who's hair color is normal, she looks like background characters. But after we got introduced to her in the anime, she just as interesting as the other new member. The development of their friendships as they work towards their goal of becoming successful idols is heartwarming and inspiring.  I give every seiyuu involved a thumb up for their great job. Not only they voicing the characters, but also sing and perform all the song they produce in real life. If they dance inside the anime, they use CGI and I can tell you that it is beautifully smooth. But to be honest, there are no songs that stuck in my head. They all sound so generic, except the ED song. Beside from that, nothing grasp my feeling.  Despite all the flawless this anime have, I still enjoy it overall and give it a 9/10. This is the first anime that didn't get a perfect score in my 2 years of watching anime. Doesn't mean its bad, it is still a great anime but lack something small. Either that or my taste in anime advanced as I watch more and more anime every season, I hope its not the latter. Anime scoring beside, I'll definitely rewatch this anime if its get a dub. Thats all I can say about this anime. Thank you for reading my review.;Recommended
3;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;AyemAFK;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AyemAFK;8;It was good,(8.12) for me. It was good enough for an idol anime.  In terms of story, actually I didn't expect much considering this is an idol anime. But actually, some of the plots that are presented are quite impressive even though in fact they are still light on the overall story which was predictable from the start of this anime's release. The characters presented in this series have their own motivations which are quite unique and become something fresh in this anime. The main character is also quite impressive and really has the aura of a leader so she gets plus rating points because to be honest I really like her.  In terms of design, there isn't much that can be discussed because in reality it's normal. The character descriptions and costume designs provided are actually good but nothing more than that. From a visual standpoint, this anime likes to flex in moments where they are performing songs. And at that moment, to be honest, the visual quality displayed can be said to be quite good and eye-catching. In terms of the most important in anime idol, namely audio. This anime spoils us with the quality of the oshi that cannot be doubted and also the songs that are given are actually quite good objectively. However, in terms of subjectivity, it is natural that people have their own preferences.  Finally, I just want to argue that only stupid people expect a lot from aspects other than audio in idol anime. Overall, this anime is fun enough to be enjoyed by idol lovers. For those of you who want to start an idol journey, Love Live will be a long but exciting journey. But if you are not ready to sacrifice time, money for other personal satisfactions. Better to just watch ordinary anime.;Recommended
4;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;AnimeEnjoyer420;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeEnjoyer420;7;"I should lead off this review by noting that I am not typically a fan of idol music in anime, and neither season of Love Live Superstar has changed my mind about that. I mention this to add perspective, because I do enjoy this series despite my lack of interest in the music and I think it often gets pigeonholed as something only fans of J-pop would enjoy. Honestly, it bears more of a likeness to ""cute girls in a school club"" anime than being specifically about music and, in my opinion, remains highly accessible even to people that don't care for idols or their music.  That's all largely unchanged from season one, and that sense of continuity is the greatest strength of season two. There was a fair amount of consternation over the announcement that 4 new first-year girls would be added this season, and I was skeptical at first too, since I thought one of the strengths of the first season was the tight cast and how it gave you time to really get to know the characters. I'm pleased to report that, for the most part, the 4 new girls are well-integrated. Kinako fits in so naturally that you almost forget she wasn't one of the original 5, and Shiki and Mei's introduction to the group, while bumpy at times, ends up being pretty heartwarming in the end. Out of the 4, only Natsumi, the money-grubbing Youtube streamer, felt like an afterthought, and 3/4 ain't bad.  It also remains the case, like season one, that Superstar is at it's strongest when it's doing wacky comedy and often stumbles when it tries to do drama. The comedy is still there in season two, the episode where Ren goes down the Gaming rabbithole was a favorite of mine, but laugh out loud moments aren't as common as in season one. On the flip side, season two also avoids some of the bad drama lowlights from season one, like Ren's attempt to ban the school idol club. The drama is still mediocre with few exceptions, but does at least touch on a few interesting themes, especially with regards to the anxieties of the new girls trying to figure out how they fit into Liella. They aren't as talented or experienced as the original 5 yet, and don't want to hold their senpais back from winning Love Live, but they'll never be on the level of the original 5 if they split the group by class. How to balance the growth and integration of the first years with their ambitions is an ongoing theme throughout the season and they do get a few nice moments out of it, but it often tends to be a bit on the treacly side, like most of the drama in the series. There is also a sadly missed opportunity with a subplot about Kanon wanting to study abroad in Austria that, without getting into spoilers, is resolved in a highly unsatisfying way when it had potential to be an excellent storyline if it had been handled better.  There is also one more addition to the cast that I haven't mentioned to this point, and she ends up being one of the most positive things about this season. That would be Margarete Wien, a solo singer that arrives out of nowhere to become Liella's toughest competition in the Love Live regional qualifiers. She oozes chuuni goth princess energy and her philosophies about music are pretty much antithetical to the bright and shiny teamwork that the franchise lives on, which gives the series a shot in the arm every time she shows up. In fact, one of the weaker points of the season is in how she arrives like a hurricane on Liella's doorstep early in the season and then... just disappears for 4 or 5 episodes. It's a bit of a momentum killer given how immediately magnetic she is. It's also frankly hilarious how much better her operatic songs and theatricality are compared with the candy-colored stages and generic J-pop of Liella. It can actually be difficult to suspend your disbelief at times and think that anyone would vote for Liella over her. While I have little interest in most of Liella's music and find their lyrics cloying, Margarete was an entirely different animal and having her sing music that was not J-pop in any practical sense actually made me sit up and pay attention, something I was glad for since she's quite a talented singer. Her presumptive addition to Liella in the already-announced 3rd season is the thing I am most excited for with the future of the series because she's going to bring something completely different to the table than any of the girls in the group now.  Overall, this was a nice continuation of the series. If you liked season one, you'll enjoy season two as well. It makes a few changes but handles them well for the most part. It peaks with comedy and struggles with drama just like season one, but is more consistent. The highs aren't as high in season two, but the lows aren't as low either. The main cast additions mostly get the job done, the original characters don't get pushed to the margins in favor of shiny new objects as I and others feared they would, and the new rival-turned-ally character shows a lot of promise for the future. All in all, a successful sequel that injects just enough change to keep it feeling fresh without compromising its identity.";Recommended
5;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;i-like-this;https://myanimelist.net/profile/i-like-this;9;Love it! SuperGalaxy!!  “Love Live! Superstar!!” is back and it’s just as funny, wholesome and moé as it’s first season. Now in their second year of high school the girls are having trouble expanding Liella! and getting first years to join due to how popular they are, but also because first years are all concerned they can’t keep up with the intense training schedule. This is a premise I don’t think I’ve seen an idol show attempt before, but it’s a brilliant way of showing off the girls growth and physical fitness from the first season plus it’s a sticking plot point woven through the second. It also helps limit the amount of new characters that can be introduced at one time which helps make their introduction feel organic and impactful.  Superstars biggest strength over the other Love Lives has always been it’s small, intimate cast. Were as the other love live casts like Nijigasaki High School Idol Club suffer from what I like to call ‘Too many characters syndrome’ Superstar’s first season main cast consisted of five who were given enough screen time to fully develop as characters, and we in the audience spent a lot of time getting to know them. Thanks to that the four new members of Liella! are given enough space and screen time for their own developments whilst the continuation of Kanon’s, Keke’s, Sumire's, Chisato’s and Ren’s new developments feel organic and natural rather than a quick update to make up for their lack of development in the first season. Kinako, Mei, Shiki and Natsumi are all very charming and fit into the group dynamic very comfortably. I never felt like they didn’t belong to group despite their quirks. The only character I didn’t particularly care for was Margarete the antagonist who stands between Liella! and first place at Love Live!. Her motives are… just not all that interesting and she comes off more of a weird stalker rather than an immovable talent.  The animation is still absolutely gorgeous too. From backgrounds to cgi music numbers to… everything else. It’s just a real stunner to look at. That along with the impeccable voice acting makes this show a treat to watch.  If you’ve watched the first season of “Love Live! Superstar!!” and enjoyed it then you’ll enjoy this one too. I personally don’t think the songs are as good as the first seasons, but that didn’t effect my enjoyment. It is definitely the best Love Live! variant in the franchise by far in my humble opinion.  9/10 Amazing.;Recommended
0;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;Ace_Entertainers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ace_Entertainers;7;Worst Love Live season in my opinion. The downgrade from season 1 in story quality is just something else. I completed the season but still don't get why they added the new characters because they play such a small role. The absolutely destroyed Kanon's character and did the most BS ending with her in the final episode at the last minute. I thought was a actually a good conclusion of her character for season 2 but they did not commit to that at all. The art and animation is the good like season 1 but the rest is just bad. Music compared to season 1 was a downgrade too. The songs are good songs but are not as good and memorable as season 1. With season 3 announced I am not sure what they are going to do because literally there is almost nothing left and at this point just feels like they are just making for making another season.

1;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;GG-WP;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GG-WP;9;"Is this season better than the one before it? No, it clearly isn't. Is it, however, worth watching? Yes, the show was able to maintain its consistency in terms of comedy and SoL-like factor.  This season introduced new characters, including a rival named Wien Margaret, who appeared halfway through the season. The story for this season can basically be summed up in a few sentences: first-year students joins Liella!. Liella! fights for the honor of representing their region. Liella! defeats Wien Margarete, as expected. And Kanon Shibuya gets invited to study abroad at one of the most prestigious music schools, which is the final and most unexpected event in this season (With a 360 turn).  The plot in general was mediocre and lacked the spark that the previous season possessed. The show's finale did not help matters either. For the positives: The addition of new members added more personality to the group, making Liella! more lively and adding more drama to the show. Wien Margarete's singing surprised me, as it did most people, since she was clearly the best singer and had the best songs this season. And as for the negatives: The songs this season aren't as good as those from previous season or other Love Live series, but they're still worth a listen and adding to one's playlist. The introduction of the new members also had little impact; aside from Shiki Wakana and Mei Yoneme, who are at least decent, the other two's reasoning for joining and becoming idols didn't make much sense. And, let's be honest, Wien Margarete joining the fray as a rival was a bit of a puzzle, as it appears she was thrown in for the sake of being an antagonist and having a new and fresh face.  In general, I believe that the comedy and SoL aspect truly distinguishes this Love Live series from the others, as it manages to keep us engaged, from being sad, happy, to a genuine heartwarming moment, as that this series is designed to be light-hearted and a switch your brain off series to manifest different types of emotion. This is a show that is about feeling good rather than heavy drama. Given how engaging the story was in the previous season, I expected more from this season in terms of story and execution, but it is still worth watching.  I would recommend the show to the following people: - Fans of Slice of Life. - Fans of Comedy. - Fans of Love Live.  I would not recommend the show to the following people: - Not a fan of dull or boring stories with little to no progression. - Not a fan of drama that doesn't elicit much emotional response.";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;7;"Considering the Love Live series' pattern of having two 12-13 episode seasons for each iteration, it was inevitable that Love Live Superstar would do the same thing. And wouldn't you know it, not long after the first season ended, the second season was announced. It even aired right after season 2 of Love Live Nijigasaki ended. I need to finish my review for that particular season. I admittedly liked Superstar, though a little less than Nijigasaki, but I definitely enjoyed what Superstar tried to do, even if parts of it didn't always make the landing. But when it was announced that several new characters would join Liella, many LL fans were both excited and nervous, excited to see what these new characters would bring but worried that their inclusion might mess up the dynamic that the original members of Liella established. Plus, adding these new characters seemed to lean back into an established formula even though Superstar originally intended on just having five main characters. This was especially worrisome because most Love Live series often have the issue of trying to juggle too many characters at once, having some characters receive focus episodes while others wind up getting shunted to the background. Even as someone who's only seen this and Nijigasaki, I tried to temper my expectations and keep all this in mind as I watched the show.  Needless to say...the previous LL fans and I wound up being right, to an extent. So season 2 takes place immediately after season 1. While Liella admittedly didn't make it into Love Live, a new semester has started and they're looking forward to what the new year will bring. They even manage to recruit some new members: Kinako Sakurakoji, a spacy country girl; Shiki Wakana, a quiet, soft-spoken science fanatic; her best friend Mei Yoneme, a passionate idol fan who tends to hide under a tough, menacing facade, and aspiring YouTube star Natsumi Onitsuka, a greedy, money-grubbing gremlin who really, really wants to make bank. Things start to get a little heated when a mysterious singer named Wien Margarete comes into the picture and seemingly wipes the floor with all the other idols, including Liella and Sunny Passion. It doesn't help that she seems to have some kind of grudge against Kanon for reasons nobody, not even Kanon, seems to know. But Liella isn't one for giving up, and with new members under their belt, they're determined to get farther in Love Live than they did before.  I have a lot I want to say about Superstar season 2, and some of it...you're probably not going to be happy about. As far as the new characters go, I think Kinako, Shiki, and Mei are fine. Not necessarily as fleshed out or developed as the main five, but I found them to be okay characters. I do appreciate that Ren got fleshed out a bit more in the focus episode she got in this season, and I was pleasantly surprised by the direction they decided to take her in. Speaking of the main five, I do like that season 2 does put in some effort to develop them a bit more and have them try things here that they didn't do before. Remember in season 1, when people nominated Kanon to be the student council president? In season 2, Kanon decides to willingly join the student council as vice president as a way to take the burden off Ren, which is really significant because she takes on more responsibility, and is shown to be pretty good at it. That being said, I really didn't like Natsumi. I found her extremely annoying and her motivation to become an idol just felt really shallow and forced. But more than that, I also didn't like the new rival character, Wien Margarete. She just felt like nothing but a plot device whose only purpose was to boot Sunny Passion to the side and be a source of conflict that Superstar really didn't need. Poor Sunny Passion doesn't even get to do anything in this season! Her whole motivation just felt really stupid and melodramatic, and the show's attempts to make me care about this emo brat really didn't work for me because they didn't give her enough of a presence beyond her concert appearances to make me care about her. That being said, she does have the best songs in the show, so I'll give her that.  Speaking of melodrama, I know Love Live has a bit of a reputation for not always being good at tackling big dramatic storylines. I haven't seen the first Love Live series, but I know that had a particular subplot involving Kotori near the end of the first part that really didn't go over well with the fans. And unfortunately, Love Live Superstar also has this problem with a subplot involving Keke. I won't spoil anything, but this subplot was briefly mentioned in season 1, and it gets followed up on in season 2, but the way the anime resolves it just felt really stupid and hollow. It doesn't help that the anime has the characters scream their feelings out in a really forced, artificial way and go into cry fests that just scream ""We're trying really hard to make you feel for these characters! Now feel sad, dammit!"" and it really didn't work. It's similar to a subplot that Ren had back in season 1, with it somehow getting resolved with a handwave near the very end, even though the series previously made a huge deal out of it before. But whereas that subplot suffered from just having a convenient solution just handed to the characters without feeling earned, the subplot here with Keke tried too hard to force drama that could have been resolved in a less...theatrical and melodramatic manner.  And as much as I hate to say it, the songs got a bit of a downgrade this season. They're not bad or anything, and like I said before, I loved all of Wien's songs. But several of them just weren't as good as the ones in season 1. I admittedly really didn't like the song that played when Natsumi joined the group, but I did like the one Liella sang to welcome Kinako into the group. The songs range from good to uninspired. The actual soundtrack is fine, and the opening and ending songs are nice to listen to as well. But season 1's songs were just better by way of having more versatility and a willingness to explore new genres. I mean, why do you think people consider Nonfiction to be the best song in the entire Love Live Superstar canon? Because it kicks ass, has a fun beat, and is a pretty good take on rap and hip-hop, two genres I admit to hating with a passion.  But I don't want you to think that I consider Love Live Superstar season two to be outright bad. Like I said before, the series does make the effort to flesh out both its old and new characters, even if it didn't do so for others, I liked several of the new Liella members, Wien's songs are all great even though I hate her as a character, and the animation work is about the same as the previous season, so it's still nice to look at on a technical level. Plus, and this is a rather petty, personal thing for me: Superstar has no boob grabbing. Thank God. And funnily enough, a lot of what I just described could very well be addressed later on because Superstar was just announced to have a third season in the works, making it the very first LL series to ever get a third season! I still enjoyed the season as a whole, flaws and all, and you can bet your ass I'm watching the third season for sure!";Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;Porukana;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Porukana;8;"After watching the first season of Superstar, I had taken an almost 1 year break from idol shows, and so when I finally sat down to watch season 2 of Superstar, I feel like I went in with a much more different perspective than others who may have kept up a little more with the fandom.  I feel like most of the negative feelings towards season 2 of Love Live! SuperStar is based around the new members who were added into Liella. Although I understand the precious feeling towards the original unprecedentedly small cast of Liella, I don't necessarily think the added characters ruined the show or the group. I admit, that some of the introductions and induction into the club felt a bit forced at times, but in total I disagree with the sentiment that their designs were sub-par or that they didn't fit well with the synergy of Liella. On the surface, their characters and personalities do have good synergies and is relatively harmonious to the group, I think it is only when you compare the altered/updated group dynamic with the original 5-person group that you feel like something special was lost. But I just believe that this is a testament to how well the characters were written in season 1, and how it is really hard to maintain such a thing for season 2.  I probably only have this opinion since I had long forgotten the unique and excited feelings I had for the original 5-person Liella, and was able to view this season with a cleansed pallet, so I understand if those who are more invested don't agree with my sentiment.  But other than that here are a short list of pros and cons of this show:  Pros: - Incredible animation, it seems that the quality of production has just been going up and up - Some good story writing, it has been a while since I've felt that the writers of the story decided to give any thought in synthesizing details and events across episodes, as opposed to the traditional ""each episode is dedicated to a certain character"" type formula (Although it is still present, it feels much more thought out and harmonious) - (some) good character development - Banger songs (mostly), and killer OP!! - The voice acting for the OG members of Liella have definitely improved significantly! Especially the voice actresses for Sumire and Kanon blew me away at times  Cons: - Some aspects of characters or story can feel forced or awkward at times - The classic idol show cringe! (can be a positive depending on who you are...) - Ok so what the f- is the ending? Please explain... like why? - The stuff I talked about above  Honestly I really liked this new season, I think in what it lost in the uniqueness of the small cast, was made up with the sort of magic touch that was similar to the original love live school idol project, and it did it well and subtly as compared to the other love live series that tried to copy it.  Though I may be kind of biased since Mei x Shiki made me squeal like a dolphin haha...";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;myokohi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/myokohi;2;With this being the third anime installment in the Love Live! saga (not including Nijigasaki which is a separate entity), Superstar!! had a lot of pressure among the larger LL community to live up to expectations that would recreate a familiar formula while also providing something new to entice the fans.  Unfortunately, it has failed at this goal, and nothing short of a miracle can salvage this anime series.   While there's much that can be said about Superstar!! in regards to its plot, like retaining a common structure comparable to School Idol Project and Sunshine!!, it manages to do incomprehensibly worse than its predecessors at telling a coherent narrative. What sold this show to me to get this low of a rating though has been the characters and their dynamic with one another, which is practically nonexistent if Shibuya Kanon is not involved.  As opposed to both μ's and Aqours (as well as Nijigaku), Liella, the idol group in this anime, only comprises five members in contrast to the usual nine… only until it doesn’t, deciding to add an additional four members (Shiki and Mei are amazing, the same can't be said for Natsumi and Kinako) while leaving the original five, minus Shibuya Kanon, with little character growth besides comedic bickering (Keke and Sumire) or last minute dialogue (Ren and Chisato). Had Liella! followed its initial vision from the start of the series, there was the possibility of developing closer and perhaps more realistic character interactions than seen in the previous installments. With how the characters have interacted with each other so far in both this and the prior season though, this seems to be unlikely to happen even with an unprecedented third season.  At the end of the day though, Love Live! at its core is a music anime, and wow does Superstar!! fail to deliver in this category. While in the insert songs present in the anime are mediocre at best to downright awful at worst (the b-sides of their singles are amazing though, and it’s infuriating these superior songs weren’t featured in the anime like they should’ve been), the true musical aspect of Superstar!! that it shares with his predecessors has been the original soundtrack. At least, that’s what I would’ve said had they built upon the soundtrack from the first season instead of recycling the same two themes whenever something even slightly emotional happens (call it the Ren funeral song when a somber piano and/or violin plays). In other words, this season managed to make me have utter disdain for the one element of a Love Live! anime that never failed to disappoint me. I gotta hand it to Superstar!! Season 2 for pulling off the unthinkable ^^  Whether you're a diehard fan of Love Live! or just stumbled upon this anime by mistake, I would strongly avoid giving Love Live! Superstar!! a watch so long as you're interested in a compelling story, relatable characters wanting to achieve their dreams, or great music. For those who are among the Love Live! community that have decided to give Superstar!! a skip, I applaud you for making the right call, as School Idol Project, Sunshine!!, or Nijigasaki are all infinitely better stories within the Love Live! franchise, and only deserve far more love than the trainwreck that has been Liella’s journey.   What could’ve been a fresh and beautiful story about a group of friends going through their three years of high school together to win the biggest idol competition in Japan, what we got instead was nothing short but disappointing, especially as someone who had high hopes for this group when they first debuted. Overall, a 2/10 for Love Live! Superstar!!;Not Recommended
1;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;rrakku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rrakku;5;"“Welcome to our world!” The five girls’ first performance of this season was a warm welcome not just to the aspiring members of Liella, but also to the audience for returning to witness a new chapter. And I mean, who could resist? Superstar season one is perhaps one of if not the best idol show out currently out there. So, how did second season fare?  Well, not great. Introducing new characters this late into the series naturally comes with some compromises, and this season of Superstar had the wrong priorities.  Now, I don’t mean that Kinako, Mei, Shiki, or Natsumi are bad characters, they are decent. They have strong, distinctive designs that reflect their personas; some of their character traits mesh very well with the original five, like Mei with Keke or Natsumi with Sumire. Mei and Shiki’s relationship is adorable. And although Some of their attributes on the extreme end, e.g. Shiki’s nonsense gadgets and Natsumi’s “desuno” mannerisms, could annoy some people, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and I digress.  To introduce new members to an existing idol group is to risk alienating your audience, because people came for Kanon, for Keke, for Chisato, for Sumire, and for Ren, not for Kinako, or Mei, or Shiki, or Natsumi. So the question is, how do you get people to keep watching while you introduce characters that no one cares about? The solution Superstar gave to this question is to get their introduction over with as soon as possible, cramming it all into its first episodes. I don’t think that’s a good approach. The first episodes resemble the real life equivalent of a freshmen ice-breaker, not necessarily the most entertaining stuff.  In later episodes, as the characters get to know each other, you can see their characters play off each other better. Conversations feel substantial, sometimes even fun, and not just vegetables talking to each other. In a sense you could argue that therefore the awkward start only makes it more realistic: the more time you spend with the same group of people, the more comfortable you are with them. However, disregarding the discussion of whether the realism of fiction is always preferable or not, it still doesn’t make it any fun to watch.  One could also make the case that their addition was a cornerstone to season two’s structure, essential for the dramatic confrontation between Keke and Sumire. Keke’s potential departure is perhaps the easily the most intricate, important, and interesting plot thread in season one left unresolved, it’s very intricate and showcases the emotional intelligence of both of them. However, in this season, the whole situation ended on quite a bitter note. The confrontation and solution is too cheesy, and the most detrimental part about it is the climatic scene where Sumire spills the beans about Keke. But there are redeeming qualities: the voice acting coming out of the whole sequence is done insanely well, the drama feels authentic and there are nuances in everyone’s thoughts that the audience can understand and appreciate. And that’s about the high-note of this season in terms of story.  Because if last season’s story required some suspension of disbelief, the story this season is sometimes borderline incoherent. I won’t delve into it deep here, because there plainly isn’t much to talk about, I’ll just give a few examples. Obligatory spoiler warning.  Episode 1: somehow because Kinako stumbled upon the five practising, they suddenly want to HER specifically as THE new member(?)  Episode 3: to celebrate(?) their loss at a local competition, they decided to hold a performance at their own school(?)  Episode 7: Ren got addicted to games, so their solution is to play together to overcome her addiction(?)  I guess the only other storyline that made any sense coincidentally also comes from a new character: Wien Margarete. She is the real rival of Liella, hinted at in episode two and only appears every now and then when she needs to. Even then, so little is known about her until an exposition dump in episode eleven, which backfilled her motivation and established a “she doesn’t have a soul of a school idol” narrative. Even then, it's like the writer knew that there would be a season three, so they just left this part of the story unfinished, so we'll see how that goes. On the topic of Margarete, we were told that her performances are jaw-dropping, insanely good, on a completely different level than even Liella or Sunny Passion. In reality, we can’t even see the performances when they have lost, and the only time we saw her beat, it was when Liella squarely diffed her both in terms of music and choreography.  Which brings me to season two’s saving grace, its performances. At this point I am convinced that the Love Live franchise has the most talented people in the industry working on the 3D models, animation, and music. They continue to be stunning this season, and sometimes even one upping themselves. Chance day, Chance Way! has Chisato jumping up in 2D but landing in 3D in one continuous shot, which I swear is more impressive than it sounds; Sing! Shine! Smile! has hands down the most beautiful set, most expressive faces, and most natural movements in any Love Live; Mirai no Oto ga Kikoeru is subtle and comparatively muted as a finals song, but it reflects on the growth of everyone over the season and the decision to put Ren in the centre was refreshing. They definitely do cut corners when the characters are not performing though, to the point where it feels like the video game equivalent of cutting back to gameplay from a cutscene when the girls get off the stage.  Superstar season two may be best described exactly as this, a series of dazzling music videos with this poor excuse of a story put in between them. Let's wish season three isn't as much of a disappointment.  At least the songs are still bangers.";Not Recommended
2;Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season;k_nick;https://myanimelist.net/profile/k_nick;4;"I've been into Love Live for years. At first, Liella didn't really catch my eye when they were introduced as a new project, but the enjoyable 1st season of the anime coupled with the casts' amazing live performances in their 1st live tour made me fall in love. The chemistry within the group (the seiyuus) is definitely special, and the second years have been a delightful addition to the group. I hope I'm able to win tickets to a performance in 3rd 🥺🥺🥺.  Unfortunately, I don't feel the same passion as I do for the seiyuus as I do for the anime. To put it simply; it was very disappointing. There are so many things to nitpick from the anime that bring it down, but I think the main cause for the disaster was a lack of any overarching narrative other than 'let's win Love Live' and a sporadic mess of ideas.  The good things. - Production (Lives super pretty, no real negatives here) - Some of the songs are pretty nice - Prepares you for Liella 3rd Live Tour :D  The bad... 🥺 Introduction of the 1st years. With the exception of Shiki and Mei's arc being solid, Kinako and Oninatsu's arcs were... unfortunate. Their addition into Liella feels not only forced, but uninteresting with a lack of genuine emotion. Also, once all of them are added into the group, you can't help but feel they are pushed to the side and basically become air in the presence of the other 5 members.  Lack of meaning in songs. Love Live's production has only gone up since School Idol Project, and it's clear as day to see within this season's MVs. Despite this, however, I found there was no real sense of connection between most of the insert songs with what was actually occurring in the story. In season 1, almost all the songs feel specifically created for that moment in the story - something that was lacking in this season. In one episode, a Japanese-Rock type song is performed by the group. Is it good? Yeah. Does it make any sense in the story? Not really. The contents of the episode prior to the live was such a juxtaposition, and it made the song feel completely out of left field with it not having any correlation to the 'sentimental' nature the episode was trying to portray. Also most of the songs are kinda mid compared to 1st season lol  The new rival i don't even wanna explain this one man. not a fun/interesting character. I didn't really understand why she's being forced so much until the last episode. I have a pretty good idea what the LL staff are wanting to do with her now and the direction the story/group will go in, but wow the execution was just poor. Poor Sanipa as well... got done dirty,,,  Just not that interesting :( Most of the episodes were just boring. the drama wasn't particularly well written, so it was hard to connect with the characters on an emotional level. although I don't think season 1 was perfect or a masterpiece, there is definitely a spark missing from this season that made the 1st season as enjoyable as it was for me. The emotions I felt during Mirai Yohou Hallelujah and Tiny Stars just didn't exist in this season.  TLDR Unless you're a huge fan of Liella or the sequel makes this season worth enduring, I can't honestly recommend watching this season. It's an uninteresting mess of a story, and if you just want to watch the live performances, you can just go on youtube for that lol. I love Liella so it pained me the write this, but it's because I love the group so much that I feel like I needed to make people aware that this season was just bad, even as a huge Liella fan. If you're still interested in the group though, I'd highly recommend checking out their live performances/content outside of the anime. The group is 尊い and honestly as long as they keep doing what they're doing, 1 bad season of anime isn't gonna bother me.";Not Recommended
0;Love Live! Superstar!!;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;8;With Superstar being the franchise's fourth and latest adventure, it's understandable that some may be reluctant to watch once more a series seemingly treading familiar roads. Coming less than a year after the third Love Live series, Nijigasaki, I was worried of the fatigue that may come from yet another shuffling of the cast.  Those fears, however, were misguided.  Superstar revealed itself not just as an excellent anime in its own right, but also the most fresh the franchise has been in nearly a decade. Contrary to expectations, Superstar is actually a slice-of-life anime first, and an idol anime second. Where the previous series opted for a more dramatic approach to the storytelling, Superstar looks instead to comedy and catharsis as a means of connecting with its audience. There is no impending doom from the girls' school potentially being entirely closed, nor is there romantic tension or heated rivalry in the lieu of Saint Snow's portrayal in Sunshine— quite the opposite. Instead of striving to make the audience teary-eyed, Superstar looks to instill joy and laughter.  In many regards, the 'school idol' setting of the franchise is more a backdrop than a primary focus. The girls do not even decide on a group name until the last few episodes of the season. Those looking for performances and idol moments may find Superstar's first season feels like more a prologue than a first half of a story. And, naturally, this means Superstar will not be to every Love Live fan's palate.  But it is exactly this aspect that made Superstar so refreshing for me, as a veteran of the franchise. If I wanted those idol moments, I would watch the original once more. If I wanted drama, I would watch Sunshine. And for romance and emotionally-charged character moments, I would watch Nijigasaki. By breaking away from genre expectations, Superstar succeeds in crafting its own identity, which is perhaps the single most important characteristic for a franchise now in its fourth stage.  Superstar also withdraws from the nine-girl trope we have come to expect, and instead focuses on a smaller cast of five girls. For the most part, this is a wise creative choice for a two-cour anime, as the previous series would typically have two or three characters that are significantly less developed or interesting than the others. But this does not necessarily mean the five girls from Superstar are profoundly more developed than the girls from previous series. Rather, the unnecessary characters have been trimmed, like a chef treating to the fatty parts of a steak.  Kanon and Chisato are the standout characters from my perspective, a level above the rest of the cast. It is rare for a girl in Love Live to play the role of a mentor and instructor, as all the girls typically start out as fresh-faced newcomers. This is largely why Chisato grabbed my interest early on in the story, as her goals regarding music, as well as her long-time friendship with Kanon, tie in neatly with her later addition to the group. The anime also does a solid job of making Kanon's and Chisato's friendship with each other feel natural, through the work of several flashbacks and episodes dedicated to expanding this part of their characters.  And, while Kanon may sport a similar design to previous protagonists Honoka and Chika, she is much more interesting than her predecessors. Kanon is actually opposed to involving herself with school idols at the start of the story, due to childhood traumas and ever-present stage-fright, an important issue that many idol anime fail to touch upon. So, rather than being the instigator and vehicle for the group's activities, Kanon is actually a major participant in the story herself.  Ren is also a recipient of solid characterisation. While she initially appears to fit the mold of the stereotypical class-rep, objections and all, she has perhaps the most meaningful backstory of all the girls. My only issue is that the anime has detailed her mom's experiences, but has shown little of Ren's own feelings and ambitions towards the world of school idols. Perhaps this will be explored further in the second season?  This leaves Keke and Sumire. While these two have adorable character designs and are the cause of some hilarious moments, they aren't quite as developed as the other three. Sumire is essentially Superstar's comedic relief, abducting the protagonist and literally wearing a poop-themed hat in one scene! Her ambitions of becoming the group center are sympathetic, though, due to the feelings of inadequacy she's no doubt endured throughout her experiences in self-proclaimed show-biz.  Conversely, Keke is a force of cuteness and plays her part by encouraging the rest of the group, but doesn't have any outstanding moments or features at this point in time. As someone who was also a foreigner living in Japan for a number of years, I'd like to see Keke's experiences adapting to Japanese culture explored with a bit more detail and finesse. As it stands, the foreign aspect of her character seems primarily a means to broaden the franchise's appeal with its large Chinese fanbase. So, while Keke may indeed be speaking Chinese on Japanese TV, I'm still not entirely sold on this element of her character when she otherwise behaves just like any ordinary Japanese girl would.  The art in Superstar is of a high caliber. Love Live always set high standards for itself in this regard, and Superstar is no exception. In tandem with the series' more easygoing nature, the art style has also shifted slightly, as there are larger contours and rounder faces characteristic of much of the slice-of-life genre. Those with a distaste for cutesy art designs may have troubles with Superstar, but then it would almost be paradoxical for someone averse to cuteness to be watching such anime in the first place.  Superstar's music is wonderful, as is the norm for Love Live. I particularly appreciate the way the ending song starts early and leads naturally into the ending cinematic, in a similar vein to other popular anime like One Piece. My only issue is that there are not many full songs actually performed by the Superstar girls over the course of this initial season. But the songs that do exist, including the opening and ending, are excellent, and there is not more I could ask from them.  That said, the 'rap' scenes in one episode did feel slightly out-of-place. While some people who watch the series may also be fans of rap (myself included to a lesser extent), it is not what anyone is watching Love Live— of all things— for! My suspicion is that Sunrise was trying to birth some meme material out of the series, in the hopes that it may go viral on social media. The effect this might have had is unknown to me, however, as I try to abstain from migraine-inducing platforms like TikTok and its ilk...  One can only hope that Superstar will break free from the franchise's two-cour format, as there is so much more potential to be found in its characters. As well, the slower pacing, relative to other Love Live series, would lend itself perfectly to a three or even four-cour format. I'm also not entirely sure having a fifth Love Live series in a single decade would be the right move, as it can be emotionally-draining for fans to grow attached to a cast only to see them replaced by a new series every couple years. We shall see soon what Sunrise's plans for Superstar and the franchise as a whole are, once the second season flies us by.  Love Live has learned a lot from some of the mistakes it made during the Sunshine era. At this point, with its fourth outing, I believe the franchise has truly nailed just what it is that makes Love Live so damn special for so many people.  I can't make the claim that Superstar is some grand, ocean-deep story, but then it was never trying to be such in the first place. It is entertainment first and foremost, and in that regard, it excels in a way few anime can even dream to.  As someone who has found themselves struggling to watch modern anime, Love Live Superstar is a beacon of hope, a testament that joy trumps all.;Recommended
1;Love Live! Superstar!!;Nexis09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nexis09;10;When I was first watching love live superstar, I writ a review on how good I thought it was. Since then, it has managed to maintain that quality throughout all 12 episodes and has now became my favorite in the love live franchise and I'm going to now explain why it is worth your time:   -New to love live, should I watch the others first?-  No, you do not need to watch any other seasons and I actually believe that this is the best place to start if you want to get into the franchise  -Art and animation-  I've seen many shows and I am quite the fan of the 'cute girls doing cute things' genre but it rarely looks this visually appealing. You can really tell that the budget has been thrown into this show, especially with things like the backgrounds that are so detailed that they bring a fresh atmosphere to the typical anime high school setting. Animation is also really smooth and the characters express their feelings and personalities through exaggerated movement very well.  -Characters-  Compared to the other seasons, the main cast has been cut down to only 5 members. I think this was a great idea since each character gets to have a well developed backstory and motive, instead of some of them being left out. Also, due to the characters all having more screen time, it is a lot more easy to get attached to them since they don't just come across as one dimensional. The designs themselves are also quite unique, look nice and convey the personalities of the characters well.  -Soundtrack-  With this being an idol anime, the soundtrack is really important and I thought a lot of the songs were good, especially if your a fan of jpop. There's also the additional bonus where if you do like the songs, then more will be released outside of the anime for you to listen to. On top of this, there is some great piano background music which works so well for conveying the emotions of the characters during more sad scenes.  -Story-  I won't lie and say its the best story you will ever see but it doesn't have to be. Just having the plot of some teenage girls wanting to make it as idols works as a great catalyst for drama and acts as the central character motivation that drives them. The individual character backstories are also realistic and well written.  -Comedy-  There's not much anime, even labelled a comedy that can make me laugh this much but somehow this one did. A lot of the jokes are ridiculous and catch you out of no where and because you like the characters, it becomes amusing when they say/ do dumb stuff. Sometimes when the pacing is slower, this is what keeps you invested in the episode and brings in some fun scenarios that makes me realize how much I love the absurdity of anime sometimes.  -Enjoyment-  Enjoyment is definitely the reason why I love this anime so much. It won't change your life but it might make you smile and laugh and I think that's something that's underappreciated when watching media. If you just want to not think, have a good time and watch cute girls then I recommend this and if not then that's okay.  -Voice acting-  Considering most of these voice actors are completely new they all did a great job. They also continue the brand of live live voice actors with doing interviews and stage performances where they seem like genuinely amusing and nice people. To top that off, they also have nice singing voices as expected.   In conclusion, if you are looking for something simple, with nice visuals, characters and you either like or don't mind jpop songs then I recommend you watch this. A lot of people may think this stuff is 'cringe' and I can see what they mean by some moments in older seasons but this one feels very modernized and acts as a great starting point for new fans, a great reintroduction for past fans and a brilliant addition to people who follow the franchise religiously.;Recommended
2;Love Live! Superstar!!;rrakku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rrakku;9;"Like how the wider society used to judge anime fans as nerds that like obscure Chinese cartoons, the wider anime community looks at Love Live! fans and idol fans alike with the same weird gaze. There’s this stigma of “I’m not one of those idol weebs”, but I reckon this too will soon fall to the wayside, as the quality of idol shows becomes harder and harder to gloss over.  I was one of the doubters before watching Love Live! Superstar!!, and the only reason I started it was because of a clip of Tang Ke Ke’s tantrum. The irony of a Chinese heroine requesting freedom from a Japanese school is something I just cannot miss. And I’m glad something silly like that had gotten me to watching this show, because nothing else would’ve otherwise.  Tang Ke Ke’s antics aside, the characterisation of the cast in Superstar!! is incredible. Having only five instead of the usual nine members in the group is certainly a fine change. It goes without saying with less characters, the show gets to allocate more time and go into more depth with each of them. I’ d love to give examples, but going into detail about how memorable and strong everyone’s situations or personalities are would be no different from spoiling the whole show for you.  Now this is where my inexperience comes back to bite me: I have only ever watched the OG Love Live!, and I haven’t even finished it. So people can point out how Superstar!!’s story is “repetitive” and the only reason why I don’t find it tiring to watch. And they have every reason to believe so: three out of the four school idol groups from the Love Live! had the goal of preventing their school from shutting down.  The other thing that people always bring up without fail is how the story is predictable, and it’s no exception in Superstar!!. But these holes in these arguments are easy to spot, even with my untrained eyes regarding this genre. Love Live! isn’t here to serve you a unicorn narrative, it’s to entertain you with just enough novelty with new characters while retaining as much familiarity in the story as they can. It’s kind of like fast food chains if you will, you go there because of the predictability and consistency, but there’s always enough variety so you don’t get the same things every time. It shouldn’t be a secret that people can find comfort in that.  It’s not like nothing is fresh story-wise. The way that Hazuki joined Liella!, although unassuming, is unlike anything that came before. Her reasons were presented in a eureka moment that juxtaposes her perviously established character; it's subtly hinted at and built up to that moment. Tang’s personal struggles are the most relatable thing you could ever imagine; you would know if you live with Asian parents. Obviously these will not be the most mind blowing thing you have ever seen, but its still a breath of fresh air in the formulaic idol genre. Even the most stubborn fast food chains should change up their menu once every few years. (Okay I will stop with the fast food analogies)  With eleven years worth of experience and three different installments of Love Live! under their belt, Kadokawa, Lantis, and Sunrise better spice things up a notch. And they didn’t disappoint, delivering us the best rendition of the idol’s road to prominence narrative through Superstar!!. Character motivations for joining are much clearer and make much more sense, the group felt like it took serious effort (and luck) to build. The point of conflict in the series is also an organic result of the group member’s insecurities, rather than something that is derived from an external plot device. These improvements are, again, only possible because of the extra time granted by reducing the number of members in the group.  The things I have said above might well be controversial, point granted, but I believe anyone with a pair of well-functioning eyes will see the amazing animation displayed here. Sunrise has clearly improved over the years, not only in animation, but also in choreography. It’s no exaggeration that Superstar!!’s 3D animation is the best I have seen to date: the eye-catching dances, the smooth transitions from 2D to 3D, the small attention to details on matters of continuity, they really have it all. You may point towards ufotable or studio Orange, come back to me again when they have their demons or anthropomorphic animals do idol dances on stage. I know I am rambling at this point but I cannot get over how expressive the 3D models have become and how well choreographed the dances are. To those who are curious which performance is my favourite, it’s the one where they sang “Wish Song”, by a mile.  I’ve been singing (haha) praises for Superstar!! for a while now, but I wouldn’t be able to tell you with a straight face that it’s perfect. When thinking about its faults, two distinct scenes come to mind:  First one is where Hazuki is giving her speech when the whole Liella! squad interrupted her to try to convince her that “this idol thing really is great, trust us”; it was awkward, drawn out, and overdramatic for my tastes.  The second is rather minor, but it’s also so stupid I don’t know why it was even made in the first place. Let me elaborate with as little spoilers as possible. Through certain circumstances, Tang wants to give Sumire a crown as costume for their next performance. She is conflicted to accept it because of reasons, before she can decide, a strong breeze had blown the crown out of Tang’s hand and sent it flying. Sumire follows it, running and falling into a bush before finally catching the crown, accepting it. Yes, a metal crown was sent flying by wind to dramatise this scene. Trust me, this doesn’t get better with context and is as bland as my words described.  I know that some suspension of disbelief is granted with these kinds of shows, but the end product is not good enough to justify these inconsistencies. If they would stop relying on it, I bet Love Live! as a series, not just Superstar!!, would reach a wider audience.  Regardless, Love Live! Superstar!! is no doubt the most ambitious of its kind since Bokura no Live Kimi to no Life. It made so many steps in the right direction for the controversial genre that is idol anime. Love Live! has been huge in Japan ever since its release in 2013, and I reckon future generations would point back to Superstar!! for being the start of the idol praise for anime fans in western hemisphere.";Recommended
3;Love Live! Superstar!!;rehoshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rehoshi;8;"The Love Live franchise and the series that it produces has always been a coin flip to whether it's going to end up being mediocre or great. To name names, Sunshine falling short of its predecessor and the School Idol Project's lackluster finale. If you were to ask me what side of the coin did Love Live Superstar land on, I would confidently be able to tell you that it landed on the right side.  Superstar is a great entry show to the Love Live franchise. It barely has any connections to the previous installments, making it an easy and clean entry to just turn on and watch. It was a bit of a surprise to me that Superstar took up the: 'school is closing down' cliche so late into the season. What surprised me even more, while continuously watching it week by week, was that it didn't shove this cliche down your throat 24/7. In comparison to School Idol Project and Sunshine, Superstar takes this cliche at a different approach. The cliche still serves its purpose of giving the girls more motivation. But instead of constantly hitting us with this theme like in School Idol Project and Sunshine, Superstar makes the girl's desires, to help one another overcome their own problems, as the make focus and theme of the series. This emphasis on the girls gives them more room for growth as characters, whilst using the 'school is closing down theme' as, just as another motivation when needed. You may argue that's this cliche is the appeal of School Idol Project and Sunshine, but I believe this approach for Superstar was the right choice to make.  What School Idol Project and Sunshine lacked in my opinion was the growth for all their characters. Each character likely only got one episode per season focused on solely them. Yes, these episodes with my favorites characters were some of my favorites to watch, but they lacked MAJOR growth as a whole. They likely only solved one problem they were having at that moment. What Superstar did in comparison was that they cut down the cast to 5 members instead of the regular 9, which gave more room for development and growth as individuals and group chemistry as a whole. They kept struggles each character had within them (e.g. Kanon's stage fright, Sumire's inferiority complex, etc). They didn't shallowly cast it aside during the episode it was brought up, rather it waited until the group as a whole was able to help solve it together, making the series flow more naturally and made it feel more realistic.  Although one of the negatives I found in Superstar was the weak rival group that was hardly used in the story. What I think School Idol Project and Sunshine did better in comparison to Superstar was that they made full use of their rival groups as another major motivation. Sunny Passion felt shallow, as they were hardly given screen time and felt forcefully used in the story. They aren't another main driving force Liella uses as motivation, unlike each of the character's personal struggles or the school closing down. Sunny Passion is sort of just sitting on the bench waiting to played, but ultimately stays and keeps it warm.  Ever since Sunshine, the quality of animation, art and also character designs of Love Live has just gone up and up since then. They still have their trademark exaggerated faces which everyone loves and as an added bonus, derpy faces are used when the characters faces are out of zoom, which I personally loved to death. Superstar also has some really amazing background art to go in tandem with the amazing CGI. Heck, sometimes I couldn't even tell that some of the performances were in CG. Everything about the art just felt really clean, almost even perfect.  As expected of Love Live, all of the songs are such a bop. The Ending, 'Mirai wa Kaze no You ni' is probably one of favorite endings in Love Live of all time. The song itself is amazing, but the visuals is what makes this ending so great. No there aren't any hidden themes found within the Ed, it's just the group of Liella having fun and showing some of their daily activities. As a bonus, each of the members of Liella join Kanon one by one as they do the trademark waving, one of my favorite scenes in the Ed. But this simplicity is what makes it so great, fitting to Love Live's main slice of life genre. As also expected of Love Live, all of the voice actors are amazing. They perfectly fitting to the corresponding character they play as and have distinct and beautiful voices.  What Love Live always excels at is making amazing and likable characters. Even if you don't like them at first, you somehow always end up loving them in the end. Superstar's characters, don't feel like a re-skin of any of the characters from the previous Love Live, which were a major problem for some people when watching Sunshine. Each of the girls help each other grow as characters. Their struggles don't feel shallow, and as a viewer, it's really satisfying to watch them overcome them because of that fact. The smaller cast and group also helps flesh out each of the characters more, even with the smaller episode count. It really lets the viewer to get to know the girls more and lets them grow onto the girls more and more.  Superstar is overall an amazing successor to the Love Live franchise with it's; iconic cast of characters, corresponding with equally amazing voice actors, it's trade mark character designs, and it's amazing songs which makes this series/franchise so appealing in the first place.  It's an amazing installment to the Love Live franchise and didn't disappoint in any aspects what so ever. If anything, it well exceeded expectations.";Recommended
4;Love Live! Superstar!!;NotRoyce4;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NotRoyce4;10;Story: 7  Cute girls doing cute things!! The story reuses some overused elements from earlier Love Live series and there are one or two weird plot elements, but the formation of this series' school idol group, Liella!, is satisfying. The main characters are all first years, and the ending of this season sets up subsequent seasons to show Liella!'s journey after the first year. This would be the first Love Live series to show more than one year of a group's journey, so I'm excited to see what happens next.   Art: 9  The scenery and backgrounds in this show are extremely detailed and colorful, and the quantity of different backgrounds used in each episode is incredible. Specifically, the buildings and streets feel warm and immersive. I think this sets a new standard for art in Love Live anime.  I was skeptical about the character designs initially, but I grew to like them after the first or second episode. They are all cute, and their expressions and costumes are equally cute.  CG is used during the dances, and it blends nicely with the hand drawn animation. There were some cool effects such as the lighting in Tiny Stars and the reflections in the bubbles in Wish Song.   Sound: 10  Love Live is known for its music, and every song in this show is good. Mirai Yohou Hallelujah!, Mirai wa Kaze no You ni, and Tiny Stars are outstanding. My other favorites are Tokonatsu Sunshine, Dreaming Energy, and Nonfiction.  Superstar's ED is my favorite among all the Love Live EDs. I love hearing the ED begin to play during an emotionally climactic scene. The song begins with delicate piano notes and becomes more upbeat as more instruments begin playing. This creates a beautiful feeling of hope and catharsis. The character who was the focus of the episode sings the ED, and this makes it hit extra hard. The music, lyrics, and visuals portray Superstar's themes of faith in oneself. At the start of the chorus, the girls are shown running together along the Olympic Bridge at sunset. The animation in this shot is beautiful and fits the tone of the song perfectly.  The seiyu's performances were outstanding. Their singing was consistently beautiful, and their voice acting was amazingly expressive. Painful and sorrowful moments sounded and felt real. Also, there were plenty of cute and funny sounds during slice of life scenes.   Character: 9  The 5 main characters are great. This season shows us how they meet, and we see them become friends, play together, work hard together, and give each other support. The character development was satisfying, and I cried during a few episodes.  The rival group, Sunny Pa, does not receive enough screen time. I hope they get more in season 2.   Enjoyment: 10  I love Love Live, and I loved watching Superstar.   Overall: 10  If you like Love Live, I recommend this show. If you like cute girls doing cute things and singing and dancing, this show is worth a try.;Recommended
5;Love Live! Superstar!!;Naneo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naneo;10;This is such a refreshing anime from Love Live franchise. For you who doesn't know, we usually get a lot of main character in the anime. But this one is different, there are only 5 MC here. And because of that, every character can have their development perfectly and didn't look rushed. I'm not saying all the previous anime is bad, it just feels something different.  Story 10/10 As always, even though Love Live Superstar is a music anime doesn't mean they throw off the story. The story is also as amazing as their music. Heartwarming and sometimes emotional, the story is a mix beetween those two. How they create their own school idol, how they recruit their member, how they make their music. It all packed perfectly. Not only that, this anime also has a laughable moment. Those make all the things balanced, beetween sad and funny.  Art 10/10 Gorgeus, pretty, beautiful. All that combine and you got this artsyle. What i really like from this is the atmosphere/mood we got from it. It hard to explain but you know, like when there is a specific scene whether it sad or happy. They can bring it to us viewer. So it feels like we are there ourself, see it with our own eyes. Yes its kinda weird, but try to watch it and experience it yourself. Also don't forget that when they perform on stage its always beautiful. Their choreography is smooth as hell.  Sound 10/10 I love all the song here. The ED song, OP song, insert song. In fact some of them are in my playlist. Especially the one that play at the end of episode. Their voice is soothing and relaxing. Its so comfortable listening to their song when i'm alone in my room. Their voice is also fits perfectly. And for the SFX, its all sound so natural. I didn't hear anything weird.  Character 10/10 They manage to nail all the characters personality really good. They only have 5 MC and i love it. Because of that we can have more episode of them deepening their bond with each other. For comparison, previous Love Live anime need a 2nd season to do that. And this one doesn't. And for the side characters. They didn't throw them off and instead giving them a really big role in the anime helping the MC.  Enjoyment 10/10 This is the first airing Love Live series i watch and it really satisfying to finally finish it. Even though i just finished it, i'm already craving for 2nd season which is just confirmed not long ago. I reccomend you to watch all previous Love Live anime (if you haven't) while waiting for 2nd season. Also i will definitely rewatch this series in dub when they are coming out.  With all that being said, should you watch it? Definitely. If i am not a Love Live fans and watch this anime, i will be one. This anime have something special in it that will drag you into idol hell. When you go into idol hell, you can't come back. But for real tho, come on join us. Whether its on Discord, Twitter, Reddit, the community is all good. At least thats what i see.  Thank you for reading my review;Recommended
6;Love Live! Superstar!!;Starchaser;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Starchaser;9;"Love Live Superstar is a wonderful surprise. It may be easy to look at it and see the same theme of a group of girls becoming school idols as they sing, dance, write songs and develop a strong bond with each other and dismiss it as the same old thing. But by doing so would not only be a disservice to yourself, but this anime.  After watching the highly enjoyable Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, I was feening for more. It felt like a long and simultaneously short time for Superstar to arrive, and am I glad it did. If I ever needed a reminder of why I love the Love Live franchise so much (to the point that my siblings teasingly ask me when I'm watching an anime, ""Does this one have to do with a group of girls making a band?"") this is it. Superstar encapsulates all of the series' strongest elements and with a few tweaks and new facets of simplicity, I can safely say I find this to be the greatest Love Live ever created so far. Yes, even surpassing the original.  First and foremost, Superstar is a joy to watch, literally. Everything looks so polished. The character designs stand out, the CG dancing has improved, and even the backgrounds are given careful detail. Whether it's the streets of Kanon's neighbourhood, the architecture of Sumire’s shrine or the surroundings of the school itself, every place is vibrant with colour and has a warm, inviting feel to it. The animation feels so alive too whether it’s the girls dancing or one of them simply writing something on a board and it inevitably ends up looking pretty. I was particularly impressed with the girls’ performance when Sumire was chosen as the center, that’s an example of crisp and fluid animation.  Visuals alone won’t be enough to carry an anime, of course. There’s an immediate and welcome change of formula in the form of the main protagonist, Kanon. Rather than a big ball of joy like Honoka or Chika, Kanon comes off as a highly relatable teenager. That’s not me knocking the other two characters or saying they’re not relatable by the way. I consider myself an optimistic idealist/idealistic optimist so I find them quite endearing even though I’m aware that kind of energy is incredibly rare. Anyway, what I’m saying with Kanon is that she sees herself as an ordinary person with no particular skills or aspirations, and she’s seen in the beginning spending a good amount of time struggling with her insecurities. She’s shy, sarcastic, she gets flustered and has mood swings, but she obviously has an interest for music which makes her a shoo-in for the main character for this kind of anime. It’s interesting to note that in one episode, she’s trying to get through a song, and that same song ends up being the ED. Just little things like this is one of the reasons I’ll always hold Love Live in high regard.  I’ve found it incredible how Love Live manages to have a large cast of characters, but somehow is able to give each of them development and screen time, to the point that while I’ll always have a favourite or “best girl”, I still appreciate everyone else too. Another change with Superstar is it cuts the number of the main cast in half from nine or ten, to five. Does this work to its advantage? I believe so. Just because there are fewer in number doesn’t guarantee they’ll all have their characters fleshed out in a meaningful way. Thankfully, they do though as each of the girls is given the spotlight to show why they matter and why you should care.  A shining example of this is Ren’s episodes. One constant in Love Live is the student council president showing dislike for idols or anything relating to it at the school. While she might come off as mean and cold at the start, it’s later shown there’s a deeper reason for her opposition. While I can appreciate the previous girls’ concern, Ren’s reason hits way closer to home. The reveal of her complicated and downright depressing family life made me interested in her thoughts and motivations. Maybe it’s because losing a loved one has happened multiple times in my own life as much as I hate to admit it, but Ren’s story makes a lot of sense and at the end, I was genuinely happy for her through my teary eyes. If her character was given something similar to work with, she would’ve felt similar to the other Love Live student council presidents. But with this she has earned her place as not only being relatable, but a stand out character.  Other than Ren, my personal favourite would have to be Sumire. She’s quirky, over-the-top, charismatic, and is as cute as a bug’s ear. While she tries to portray herself as some superstar, deep down, she’s a big softie with an inferiority complex. She also has a surprising amount of depth to her. She constantly wants to be the center of attention or take on the main role when she was in show business, yet she was consistently put in minor or background roles instead. Due to her taking so many L’s, she became terrified of failure and starved for validation. A good amount of the humour comes from her too (usually at her expense). The episodes that revolve around her are well-written and it’s easy to understand what part of the group she plays and how she operates as an individual. Galaxy!~  Like I said before, when it comes to Love Live, I end up liking each character so with this being the fourth series, that’s a given at this point. Every girl here will have her fans and she definitely deserves every single one of them. There’s a character here for everyone to relate to and cheer on. Another change which is a bit more subtle is that all of the girls are first year students. What I get out of that is that we could end up seeing all of them growing up together for three full years! This dynamic makes things exciting for any future seasons.  The last thing I’d like to bring up about them is their group name: Liella. It’s a combination of French and Spanish words, namely lier and brillante, respectively. Lier means to bind or connect, and brillante means to shine. So they’re going to connect you with their music. It might seem like a small thing to bring up, but if you ask me, this is the best sounding and most meaningful name so thanks to everyone who voted on Dengenki G’s magazine online poll for making it happen.  Despite all my praise, there is one aspect I wish was expanded more on and that’s the rivalry with Sunny Passion. It’s not like they have to be at each other’s throat or anything like that. But even though they’re portrayed as an accomplished duo in their own right, their presence wasn’t as impactful for me. Maybe they can be better explained in another season and I definitely would look forward to it, but as of right now, they don’t do much for me.  Still, Love Live Superstar is an experience. It’s one of the most fun I’ve had watching an anime for quite some time. Even if you’ve never watched a Love Live before, but are a slice of life fan, then this is worth a watch. Or maybe you have, but for one reason or another haven’t dug deeper. I would strongly suggest you give Superstar a chance as it’s on a completely different level. It’s not just an anime for Love Live fans, idol fans, slice of life fans, or music fans, but a gift to all of them.  Again, this is the best Love Live offering as of today. The visuals and animation are by far the best. The music is the catchiest it’s ever been. The characters are all compelling. The humour is incredibly on point. Man, the poignant moments are guaranteed to crank the water works.  Even if another season never gets made, this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best slice of life and idol anime out there.  That’s all I have to say, thanks for reading!  そんじゃ　あばよ！!";Recommended
7;Love Live! Superstar!!;flowerscissors;https://myanimelist.net/profile/flowerscissors;9;"Love Live! Superstar!! is the fourth entry in the Love Live franchise, and as such, I was expecting that they might have started to run out of ideas. Luckily, that turned out not to be the case. This is the first Love Live! series to get its main run as a prime time broadcast, and I really felt all the special care and little details that went into making this a success. While Love Live! has always been fairly solid, Superstar not only lives up to the standard, but perhaps even surpasses its predecessors.  Even though it is part of a franchise, it is worth mentioning that it's not necessary to have seen or finished any other Love Live! series to enjoy this one, as the setting is original. If you have seen any of the others the premise is more or less the same, but with a smaller main cast, prettier visuals, and it takes a more wholesome approach with less of the fanservicey humour.  I couldn't talk about this series without first mentioning the music, and it is both emotional and catchy. The opening (Start!! True Dreams) and ending (Miraiwa kaze no youni) themes are both instantly memorable, but the insert songs for the live performances are what really got my tears flowing. The visuals for the live performances are incredible too. Both the stages and outfits are cute with a lot of little details you'll need to pause to notice, the camera effects are magical, and they're all animated in a higher frame rate, which really brings the dancing to life.  And regarding visuals, the characters are cute and expressive and really captured my heart, but one other thing that really stood out was the highly detailed backgrounds. The character designs are lovely as always, but the backgrounds here take it further and really bring the places to life. This is the sort of series for which I love posting screencaps, just to show how charming it is.  As with other Love Live! series, the story revolves around a ""school idol"" club at a high school, but without giving too much away, the thematic focus of Superstar is confronting anxieties. As someone who has often felt anxious, this resonated with me deeply and made me feel encouraged to do my best. Nothing comes to our main characters easily, which makes it all the more satisfying when they do succeed, and when they fail but become even more determined to keep going.  Overall, this has been my favourite Love Live! series to date, and I recommend it very much whether you're a new fan or an old one.";Recommended
8;Love Live! Superstar!!;MochizukiTomoya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MochizukiTomoya;9;"This anime is surely great and can be an option to start the franchise. Not about winning after the struggle like Muse [School Idol Project], not a depressing story like Aqours [Sunshine!], nor Nijigasaki who has tons of member which truly represents a school club. Superstar is different, more like slice of life-ish idol story with only 5 members in it. That's what I thought when watching this show for like the first half season (?)  Let's talk about this first half that I was excited for. First thing you will notice is how good Sayurin's [Date Sayuri] voice when singing. The anime will let you listen to her singing at the very beginning of the first episode. More like 'Beautiful', rather than 'Unique' like how Love Live! characters always supposed to be.  Again the protagonist comes with orange-ish color (tho I don't recognize Ayumu as protagonist from Nijigasaki since the other members also gained the same spotlight). Kanon is a girl who love singing so much but something won't allow her to exploit her potential. It reminds me on how Muse told us that it's hard to be an idol who have to keep smiling while singing and dancing.  How they recruit new members is also amazing. Sumire with her ego, Chisato with her promise, and best of all, Ren with her past. I even cried in Chisato and Ren's case. Something new that I didn't get after Sunshine! ends. Soma Ria from Golden Loveriche once said that it's too common to use dead people as tearjerking matrerial. Sunrise can easily get out of the box thinking about this.  But the amazement on the story dimmed right after Ren joined the club. The drama feels rushed and half-heartedly written only to reach 12 episodes target. Yea, I admit that the story is not that bad, just the pace that is not right for me. It's just too fast even at the end of 12th episode I asked myself, ""oh, it's ended already?""  Fortunately, critical pace problem can be covered with great insert songs. Nonfiction as example of insert song in 10th episode. They use rap as central point of the song. I was like, what the hell they're going to do. And when it showed right in front of my eyes, it ended to become one of my favorite. In twelfth episode, a scene will remind you to Muse.  Post-credit's Liella no Uta also my biggest point on why I always waiting for this show every week. Drawn in unique artstyle, combined with pretty good song, it just relaxing. Ah, FYI, Liella no Uta in 6th episode makes me fell in love with Paychan's [Naomi Payton] voice.";Recommended
9;Love Live! Superstar!!;Moemoe96;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moemoe96;9;"Superstar is a step down from the previous love lives. What do I mean by ""a step down""? Unlike your previous love lives where there are altleast 9 girls, here we get 5. The story and plot is way more down to earth and simple. The 5 girls are all freshmen unlike from previous LLs where we ususally get three per year level. it kinda gives off this fresh and new feeling even though superstar is quite similar to the previous installations. Despite of it being a step down, Superstar might be the best one out of all. crazy am i right?  Before we actually review Superstar, let's first understand what are its intentions. Season 1 really focused on Liella's growth as individuals and as a group so what we got was full of character moments and interactions. Its as if that season 1 was not really about the love live competition itself but rather about introducing and building the characters.  okay so here is the review  Characters - 8/10  First Things first, I really really love the characters. I love Kanon's role as the main protagonist, she is not your usuall overly optimistic airheaded klutz. She is more level headed, chill, and is actually relatable. Same goes for the others. They are so down to earth and are super relatable. All of them have very simple personalities yet despite that they are very expressive and not bland. They are not these in depth charcacters with a ton of backstory rather Its more of them focusing on one thing that they need to overcome, which I really really like. Though if there is one thing to point out, there are some inconsistent character moments. Other than that I really enjoyed watching the characters develop and interact. Oh another thing, the character interactions are pure GOLD, watching them is super fun and enjoyable. The enjoyment of watching Liella kinda gives off a similar vibe to K-on with its character interactions . (not saying that k-on and superstar are similar, in fact they are polar opposites) . Having 5 characters instead of 9 is better because we get to know them more.   Kanon is best girl  Story - 9/10  I won't go too elaborate on this part because I don't want to spoil you  The sequence of events is really good and makes sense. The actions and decisions of the characters are understandable and things don't go out of hand that much. Thats what I really don't like about SIP and sunshine. Its that they tend do too much, they overdo it which loses my interest in watching it. Like literally one of them wanted to go to America just to convince someone which just doesn't make sense (sunshine). On the contrary, Superstar's approach is much more simple which makes it more enjoyable and easier to understand  SPOILER WARNING  Sadly we can't avoid spoilers. I notice that a lot of people are quite disappointed at SunnyPa's role in season 1 since we didn't get to see much of them which I understand. I do wish we got to hear their songs but that's really it. One thing that we should understand is that Liella and SunnyPa are not rivals until like episode 12. They make it seem like Liella and SunnyPa were rivals from the beginning which is not the case at all. In fact the reason why Liella happened in the first place because one of the members is a huge fan of SunnyPa which made her want to start a school idol group herself. Like what I mentioned at the beginning, season 1 entirely focused on the characters themselves and their motives on becoming idols rather than the Love Live itself. We would probably focus on the rivalries more on season 2. Yes the cliche ""school going under"" returns but that's just a plot tool to boost the characters' motives and is not the main focus.  Art - 10/10  The art is IMMACULATE, I love the character designs, the temperature of colors, the visuals, and the animation is just beautiful. I LOVE the visuals in Love Live superstar. It is way way better than the art and animation of SIP and sunshine  Sound - 9/10  To be completely honest, I wan't a huge fan of idol songs before watching Superstar. I just didn't like the cutesy and forced high pitch voices that some songs have. Liella however is not like that, the songs they make sounds so good because their voices sound much more natural. Kanon's voice is just amazing. The voice actresses really did a great job.  enjoyment - 10/10  at this point do I even have to explain why.  in comparison to other Love Lives:  Unlike School Idol Project and Sunshine, Superstar has a more simple and down to earth approach. The girls become school idols because,...well because they want to become school idols, not because of some bizarre reason like saving the entire school or what not. That's also the main reason why I didn't enjoy SIP and Sunshine as much as Superstar. SIP and Sunshine tends to overdo it with the ""save the school"" thing where everything they do is for saving the school. Yes the cliche does return in superstar but they used that as more of a plot tool rather than being entire focus of the show  Overall - personally a 9/10  Overall Superstar is a breath of fresh air because of its new and simplistic approach that gives more room for the characters to develop. They portray the saying ""less is more"" really well. Every element of Superstar carries the show. The characters, art, story, and sound is really good which makes Superstar better than the previous love lives. I highly recommend you watch Love Live Superstar if you are an old fan or a new fan.";Recommended

12;Love Live! Superstar!!;i-like-this;https://myanimelist.net/profile/i-like-this;9;Loved it! Superb-star!!  Love Live! Superstar!! has absolutely no right being this good. I've personally never watched any of the Love lives beloved as they are by it's apparently huge fanbase (the more you know), but I couldn't be happier to have Superstar be my jumping on point. School idol/moe club shows are a dime a dozen so it takes something really special to stand out from the crowd (something 2021 falls idol shows are struggling to do at the moment), but Superstar shines above the crowd like... well... a superstar!  Firstly, the animation is absolutely stunning. Characters move smoothly against densely detailed, information packed backgrounds. The CGI and tracking used for performances looks beautiful and some of the animation background detail in these scenes rival most anime movies. It is overall a seriously impressive piece of art which compliments the Liella original soundtrack. Speaking of which, almost all the songs are bangers. This is one of those shows where you don't finish watching until after the ed's finished and even after that you'll be treated to a small song in beautiful crayon styled animation.  Our main quintet of moe blobs are adorable in their kawaii-ness, very funny and each get surprising deep and well thought out character development helped by a well paced story and a school setting which has interesting history, traditions and quite literal class divisions between the music program students and those on the general course. Viewers who are involved in show business in some way can probably relate to the struggles and frustrations that come with stage fright, anxiety, lack of self worth and confidence which all the girls go through and come out on the other said better thanks to the power of friendship. It is a school idol anime so the story does get a bit predictable and cringe at times especially around the middle of the season however. It doesn't do anything to much to shake up the formula and it probably doesn't really need too, but if you've watched a few of these kind of shows before then story fatigue will probably kick in for you at some point.  That's the only real criticism I have. After finishing I really hope that this story line continues. I'm going to miss Kanon, Keke, Sumire, Chisato and Ren and their fantastic chemistry. I really did not expect to like this show as much as I do, but now I appear to be a Love Live fan and I can't wait for Studio Sunrise's next School Idol Project.  9/10 Amazing.;Recommended

14;Love Live! Superstar!!;288124;https://myanimelist.net/profile/288124;7;"Anyone who's seen Hibike Euphonium knows that one scene in S1E12. Kumiko walks, then breaks into a desperate run, tearfully galvanising her competitive spirit into action. One sentence stands out in that outburst.  ""Umaku Naritai!"" ""I want to improve!""  As Kanon proclaims, in front of her entire school and town who've been standing behind her all this time, that ""I want to win!"", the same chill went down my spine. It's a pity I'll have to wait more than a year for this story to continue.  Episode 1 immediately hooked me, not just because of Kanon's wonderful solo, or Keke's antics. What really got me was its final 4 minutes. A gleaming quill settles into Kanon's backpack, as cherry blossoms dance in her wake, and she spontaneously breaks into passionate song. I've rewatched this clip way too many times, and a lot of that is thanks to the brilliance of its art and OST. The town that this series is situated in is so, so well drawn - its shopping district, teeming with families and students alike, gives such a cozy and warm feel that makes us immediately at home. Not only are these backgrounds detailed, but the liberal use of bright colours and natural elements (just look at Kanon's family cafe!) sell us on a perfect, pastel world with its own tight-knit communities, a setting that comes in handy much later on in the series. I don't usually pick up on OSTs during a TV series too, but the orchestral tracks that support some of the show's more climactic scenes are difficult to miss. And that isn't even mentioning how good their songs are!  3 songs in particular stand out to me. Tiny Stars, with its subtle nods to Keke's roots, its catchy melody and heartwarming choreography that concludes a fairly emotional arc of friendship. Nonfiction, for being an absolute banger with the most impressive choreography I've probably seen in an idol show to date (and for giving off very strong Sagajihen vibes!!). And my favourite out of them all, the show's main ED. Not only is it fully animated, with different solo, duo, and group versions that reflect the events of their respective episodes, it is so incredibly warm. I love EDs whose instrumentals begin even before the episode is over, and the way Episode 2 transitions into it is cheesy, but oddly perfect. When that first titular line comes, the show finally feels complete.  But if its art, soundtrack, songs, and story are all so captivating, why isn't this an 8 or above? A severe limiting factor to Superstar!! is its characters, and how specific arcs are developed. Consistently, the solution to overdramatised problems is to talk it out, and tease out the underlying reasons behind a character's actions. While this worked for its initial few episodes, the same formula was applied to increasingly contrived conflicts, making their cheesy resolution seem painfully hackneyed. A certain character was the worst offender of this - not only was her turnaround jarringly rushed, but the change in her perspective came from an incredibly unrealistic chain of events that made me wince. Her arc felt like 3-4 episodes compressed into 2, and its rushed pacing seriously impacted my enjoyment of her involvement for the rest of the series. The dialogue eventually got on my nerves for how childish and unrealistic it sounded (no one talks like that to their close friends?!), especially when the girls were discussing their love for their school, or a suitable group name. Maybe I'm just being overly cynical, but I couldn't really buy into the suffocating levels of optimism that Kanon showed towards connecting the entire school through the power of music. Love Live! is a franchise that frequently dabbles in such extremities, but I imagine it would be even more off-putting for newcomers to its power-of-friendship copouts. And even though the CGI was markedly better than its three predecessors, some performances still looked stiff and unnatural, breaking my immersion in its atmosphere.  With all that said, I'd be lying if I said those flaws were fatal. Maybe it was the power of Kanon's voice, or the vibrancy of its art that kept me going to the end, but this was a show that I genuinely felt excited about after every episode. Quality and enjoyment often come hand in hand, but for Superstar!!, though I had constant qualms about the originality of its writing and the execution of its drama, that flame of anticipation was never extinguished within me. That's what I admire about Superstar!! the most - in every performance, frame, and detail, the passion of its creators shines brighter than anything else. Its makers poured their heart into delivering a new generation of characters for us to love, and love them I shall.";Recommended
15;Love Live! Superstar!!;FlexySpagoot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FlexySpagoot;7;I was never really much of an idol anime kind of guy and decided to try some more out to see if I liked it. I hadn't seen anything other than Zombieland Saga, which I thought was fine, but nothing too special. For my next taste of the genre I picked Love Live! Superstar!!, what was apparently a great new idol show in the Love Live! franchise. I can't say I'm overly impressed. To me it just felt sort of average. It has some strong points, but is overall a fairly average-quality show.  I'll start off with the shows strongest aspect, the art. Love Live! Superstar!! looks really good, definitely a 9/10 in my book. The colors pop, the backgrounds have a great amount of detail, and the show as a whole level of quality that oozes talent and high budget. The CGI used in the show is also pretty good, there are a few points where it looked sort of sketchy, but overall it blended into the scene well and was well animated. The only problem I could say I really had with the art would be the weird look that lips sometimes had. I can't describe it exactly, but sometimes the lips of characters would just look sort of off.  After the art, I'd say the characters where its second strong point. None of them really deserve masterclass level praise or anything, but they were entertaining and flowed well together. Keke was funny, something helped by her VA, who did a great job. Kannon was bright and optimistic, as I'd expect the main character of any idol anime to be. And the other main characters also had their own elements that made them enjoyable. Although I would say I wasn't a big Sumire fan, she was kind of lame in my opinion. As a whole I think the characters were done quite well though, so I won't complain too much.  Next in my list of elements ordered in descending order of quality is the music. I don't think it was bad per say, and I say this as somebody who does listen to a fair amount of J-pop, so its not like I just don't like the genre as a whole (believe me, I know how annoying it is when people who just don't like a genre at all tell you a song you like from it is bad). I just personally didn't think it was really anything special. This is a pretty subjective part of the shows quality, and also one of the more important parts, but I really just didn't think it was anything too fantastic. It certainly wasn't anything I'll put on my Spotify playlist, and I just didn't think it was really good enough to really warrant bumping my score up higher.  In my opinion the show's weakest point was its story. I get that that isn't something super important for this genre, but I just felt it was kind of weak. The pacing was a real problem for me, with them taking forever to fully form the group while only spending like 3 or 4 episodes on the actual Love Live! competition. It also felt kind of boring at points, and as a whole really wasn't anything that interesting or special. I didn't think it was necessarily bad, just definitely in need of some improvements.  My experiment to see if the idol genre is for me has succeeded, I now know that it isn't really my thing. I don't hate it, but I just don't really think it appeals to me that much. My experience with Love Live! Superstar!! is best described as average, and while I'll likely catch the second season to see the conclusion, I don't think I'll dip my toes into this genre too much in the future. A bit of a gloomy conclusion, but it is what it is. If you are a fan of idol shows than maybe you'll get more enjoyment out of this show than I did, but personally I don't really recommend it.;Recommended
16;Love Live! Superstar!!;Banskiii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Banskiii;8;Im posting this review because of one reason.   THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST VERSION OF LOVE LIVE. Character's were very well made, the music is fire not to mention the OP and ED were absolute bangers. I've gotta give credit to the animation staff. CG Improved so hard it was so enjoyable to watch and it feels good in the eye.  Storywise it has the elements of Love live, MC loves to sing started an idol group in a small number, has a goofy member and of course, the student council president is also a member of the group. Yeah did I mention the school is closing down because of low new student applications therefore the group will join love live to gain popularity and save their school.  Anyways as I said its the best version of love live since the original with μ's.  8/10;Recommended
17;Love Live! Superstar!!;ren0080;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ren0080;8;Slight Spoilers are included in this review. You have been warned.  This is what peak Love Live looks like. Likeable characters, Gorgeous animation, Emotional rollercoaster, everything is here. This is the perfect idol anime.  The story is good enough for a Love Live anime. I still think that Sunshine has the best story, and I once thought that Superstars might surpassed Sunshine, but it fell short right at the latter half of the series. While the first half are perfect, the second half was pretty rushed with how fast the conflicts and problems were solved. I also didn't like the conclusion of the final episode since it looks like a joke compared to how Aqours handled their own unfortunate conclusion in episode 8. But nonetheless, it's just a nitpick so don't mind it.  The characters are the best since Sunshine. With the members of Liella being 5 girls as to the usual 9, this helped Liella cast being more developed and have more dynamic interactions with each other. Though Ren got the short end of the stick being the last member of Liella, meaning her being the lesser developed character compared to the rest.  The animation is probably Sunrise at their peak when it comes to Love Live. Though the start of the series, the CGI was kinda iffy prob due to the clothes, but the animation quickly became much greater than the past series' aside from Nijigasaki's animation. Though I had one more problem, more so on the art. It's how simple and dull looking the clothes are in this series aside from episode 10.  The music is banger. Love Live does not disappoint with the music with how many bangers they produce with every series they released. And this one is not an exception.  Overall, this might not be my favorite Love Live series, but I can wholeheartedly agree that this is the best addition yet in Love Live. (8.2/10);Recommended
18;Love Live! Superstar!!;Pikolina;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pikolina;9;"I started this anime, as many others, a bit afraid because it came out really soon after the previous Love Live! series (Nijigasaki) (Which, btw, I loved). Thankfully, after the first chapters I could realised my worries were unfundated.  I think with this show, the Love Live! franquise really found a way to continue in time, and I'll explain why through the main points that made me love it:  1.- THE MUSIC: Being of course Idols Jpop sounds new and fresh, not like a repetition of the formula of previous shows, and some of the tracks are very ""sticky"", like, you can't stop singing them. I think that's a must in a music series, specially if you don't want people to get bored of the style.  2.- THE REFERENCES: It's not a copy from previous Loves Lives! seasons, you can perfectly watch it and understand everything (not like with Sunshine), but at the same time it has som hidden references that will make the old fans say ""I understood that reference!"" (insert Captain America meme here) and feel happy and melancholich (in a good way)  3.- THE PLOT: Ok, it's not the super newest and original argument, but it changes in comparason with previous ones. You don't feel you are watching the same idols story once again. The have different motivations, different personalities, different character developmen... And I like it. It feels fresh, and makes you not get bored by watching it. Of course you will find some similitudes with others Love Live!'s, but well, they are high school girls being idols, that's always the departure point.  4.- THE ART: It feels a bit different thatn previous ones, and, as with the music, being the same style, you feel it fresher than other times. Also they improved the use of the 3d animated parts (thankfully)  5.- STARLIGHT PROLOGUE: I wont say why, or when it sounds (to not sopil you) but I'm OBSESED with that song now. It's the next choreografy I'll learn :P  I can really assure it's been my favorite season since Love Live! School Idol Project (Muse one, the first), and I was already surprised with Nijigasaki (I never really enjoyed Sunshine, I felt like it was coping the previous one to hard, something that you don't find in Superstar).  So, I highly recommended to every fan: the ones that lost interest I think will find it again; the ones who still love the show are gonna have a great time; and also, the people that want to get into the gender can start throught this one with no problem! (Even though I recommend start with the first one)";Recommended
19;Love Live! Superstar!!;NikoNikoNiiLover;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NikoNikoNiiLover;8;Love Live Superstar is another lovely edition to the Love Live franchise that continues to cement Love Live as one of the best and most heartfelt idol franchises in the Japanese industry. Full of touching music, likable characters and beautiful animation, Love Live Superstar is perhaps the greatest the franchise has ever been. Rather than standing in another series’ shadow (Sunshine) or being made specifically to cater to All Stars fans (Nijigasaki), Love Live Superstar stands firmly on its own as a wonderfully pleasant slice of life show.  I have to say that Love Live Superstar will not cater to all Love Live fans, particularly for those who come for the music and drama. While previous seasons of Love Live were heavier on drama and melancholy, Love Live Superstar is more clearly a slice of life anime. In fact, not only do the main heroines not decide on an idol group name until the very end of the season, they don’t decide to enter the Love Live competition until the very end either. If you’re trying to determine if Love Live Superstar is for you, ask yourself which is more important to you: the idol premise or character development. If you answered character development, then this show is certainly for you.  I found that this installment of Love Live has some of the best character development we’ve seen in the franchise so far. I believe that the staff’s choice to focus on a much smaller cast with only five girls was certainly the right call. Every girl has their moment to shine and none of their arcs seem rushed. Each girl is given approximately two focus episodes, which is a huge plus, considering how previous seasons normally gave each girl only one, and the presence of the numerous others often overshadowed their development. A smaller cast certainly helped the characters become more likable and realistic.  Out of all the characters, Keke was definitely my favorite, even if she was more of a gag character who didn’t really have much serious development like the others. I am drawn to ridiculous idiots most of the time anyway, and she certainly fits that stereotype. All of the other characters were absolutely fantastic as well. Kanon was a unique protagonist compared to the others. While stage fright seemed to be subtly explored with Ayumu in Nijigasaki, it was very a huge part of the plot. Kanon’s struggles with stage fright and her subtle descent into depression that began after it hits incredibly close to home. In fact, I really do see a lot of myself in Kanon. The line in the final episode when she confirmed she didn’t need her headphones anymore because she had friends now nearly made me burst into tears.  Chisato was also a very well developed character. Out of all the characters revealed in the teaser, she was the one who stood out to me the most, although her personality was not at all what I expected. She acts as the foil of the group and is a very strong character with relatable morals. The idea that she wanted to be good at something like Kanon so she didn’t constantly stand in her shadow was surprisingly realistic. Ren was also wonderful. Out of all the token school counsel president characters present in previous installments, her motivations were the most realistic for me. The little hint at her liking yuri content was also a hilarious joke…I actually laughed so hard I nearly cried.  That leaves Sumire. While a very funny and entertaining character, I felt her plot development rather…well, sloppy. It just didn’t feel at all like how a teenage girl would realistically act. Considering how high and mighty she was acting prior to being offered the center position, it just didn’t make any sense for her to suddenly go through all this inner turmoil of how she was “never chosen”. I have to admit, she really was adorable though, even if her development was a bit annoying to me. Her “Galaxy” catchphrase and isopod shenanigans were super entertaining to watch.  Another aspect of the series I liked was that the “rival” characters were never actually rivals. Sure, Sunny Passion were rivals to Liella professionally, but they never treated them bad and were always very kind and helpful. It was very refreshing to see such a change, and their music was also very catchy without relying on the “edgelord” formula.  The music certainly isn’t bad. Nonfiction was the only song I ended up adding to my Spotify playlist, but the others aren’t bad in the slightest. If anything, most of the group songs are very generic, which was somewhat disappointing, since I liked a lot of the group songs from previous generations. Regardless, there isn’t a song that is boring, even if they are all familiar. The animation in the show is also absolutely stellar. Beautifully vibrant and gorgeously fluid. You can hardly tell when they switch to CGI.  I highly recommend Love Live Superstar for fans of slice of life. They will not only find lots of cute and fluffy moments in this series, they will find realistic character development and some lovely music to brighten up their day! Can’t wait to meet the new girls in the second season.;Recommended
0;Love Live! Superstar!!;SingleH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SingleH;6;I see a lot of people being nice to this show, and while I kinda see why, I also really don’t. In Japan, Love Live is an insatiable money-making behemoth whose appetite only grows with the eating, but here in the West, it’s largely mocked by the mainstream. But apparently not Superstar. What other people are getting out of this show is something I can’t get out of it, and it might just be because I’ve seen too much. It might just be because I’ve become numb, and maybe if this was the first time I’d ever seen an idol show like this, there’d be stuff I could pick up on which didn’t seem like tired, insipid, clickbait garbage, but I’m too old and storied for that shit. I’m fine with media selling itself, I’m not a child, but when it comes to idols, the girls themselves are the products, and while an anime’s storyline can help dilute this reality, I can’t not see it, so everything just feels fake. Despite being well-directed, the concerts are totally non-diegetic, because they’re being shot from angles no in-universe camera could ever capture. One of the girls is an antagonist to a point, where upon the cast spends two episodes confronting her corny, melodramatic backstory, after which she immediately becomes part of the team even though she’s an outsider who everyone hated five seconds ago. A character travels from a competition in Tokyo to the Southern Islands before the sun can finish setting, waiting for her there is a costume which she never planned to have made, in which she performs flawlessly alongside the others despite not having practiced the set. The show is comprised of contrivance after contrivance after contrivance, thoughtlessly and lifelessly checking off boxes on a bulleted list of Love Live tropes required by the producers. Not every relationship feels this soulless, and not every action feels this manufactured, but to those pretending like this series is significantly more genuine than any other installment of Love Live, I’m afraid I must disagree.  After all these years of having watched thousands and thousands of anime, I’ve deduced by far the easiest way to dismiss a series is to scrutinize its production, because most anime look like shit and cut so many corners they become entirely different shapes. Indeed, most generic trash actually LOOKS like generic trash, but this doesn’t. This looks legitimately impressive, and since I couldn’t write it off, I had to endure it, and the technicality behind the concerts was so jaw-dropping, I cannot pretend I didn’t have fun here. The girls have their gimmicks, but their character designs are so much more individualized than previous installments of Love Live, it’s commendable. Love Live girls have always had copy/pasted faces, bodies, hairstyles, and personalities, only adding enough of a difference between them to be legally distinct, but this show breaks the mold in that respect completely. Each girl looks and acts like a separate human being, not like a slight variation of a figurine, body pillow, or cardboard cutout which you already own. They aren’t deep, and some of the forced backstories I mentioned earlier certainly bogged down the script, but the girls are still pleasant and cute. It feels like everyone creatively involved in this project has improved measurably. We all know Yoshiaki Fujisawa is a genius, and while Jukki Hanada still can’t write convincing drama, he still can write funny dialogue and natural chemistry between characters. Love Live has singlehandedly revolutionized the landscape of CG, and Director Kyougoku has absolutely mastered the art of transitioning between the mediums of 2D and 3D. The CG integration is better than some Production IG shows, and the CG itself outclasses Studio Orange. This show is no visual masterpiece, and episodes seven and eight saw heavy inconsistency, but the animators absolutely pampered these girls as much as they possibly could, even if they only exist to fuel Bandai’s merchandising.  Thank you for reading.;Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Superstar!!;PandaUwU;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PandaUwU;6;"Superstar is the 4th installment of the beloved and long-running Love Live series. It is easy to follow and does not reference previous parts, allowing both old and new fans to enjoy it.  This installment goes back to its roots, arguably simpler than the base of its roots were. Kanon gets picked up by Keke to start a school idol club, but complications arise when the student council president tries to stop them; the standard Love Live stuff.  The special part about it this time is how Kanon acts in opposition to the other main characters of previous installments of Love Live. Kanon has stage fright. This stage fright helps drive her character throughout the story as an obstacle for her to get over. It is a good character element that can add some growth and depth to her character, but I felt it was rushed. There were not many episodes where it was the main focus and even when it was, I felt it was not explored enough.  This pacing issue crosses through Sumire as well. Ever since she was a kid, Sumire has always wanted to be in the spotlight but had never been there. This would also provide for an interesting plot, but once again, underdeveloped.  As rushed as I may be describing the pacing, this was only felt during the last third of the show, which is when a lot of the important parts of the characters' arcs happened.  Contrary to this was Chisato’s character arc. Chisato was introduced in episode one and slowly developed throughout the show. This is due to her arc directly tying into her relationship with Kanon, and how they affect each other. It climaxed beautifully and became my favourite part of Superstar.  And once again, in opposition to Chisato’s arc is Ren’s arc. Ren’s character arc did not make too much sense and was not developed a lot, kind of just happened.  Finally, Keke. So far, Keke’s arc has only been hinted at and not a lot has been revealed about her, even if she was the first member to join the group. Frankly, this is not a bad thing, as a later season is likely to go further into her character.  So far, I have only spoken about their development, but how are they individually? Honestly, I think I only like Chisato and Kanon individually.  Even if I only like two of them individually, the writing is something of note. The characters play off of each other very well. Every character has a different way of speaking to each other, whether friendly (Kanon and Chisato) or a more aggressive tone (Sumire and Keke), creating a very immersive environment and overall makes character interactions an enjoyable experience.  The writing also excels at telling jokes. The jokes are very fast-paced and usually succeed to at least put a smile on my face. It combines both visual humour and wordplay, effectively churning out jokes quickly. It is more visual than wordplay but is still a great combination of both.  Now onto the more technical aspects, the visuals of each new season of Love Live are always astronomically better; this applies to this season. Hair bounces with each step and the animated dance choreography always looks clean. Full of bright colours blending well together to create appealing visuals that are hard to get bored of.  As it usually is with Love Live, the performances where they sing and dance are mostly CGI. Love Live has quite the mixed history with CGI, as sometimes it looks very off, and other times it looks pretty decent. In this case, the CGI looks good. Used solely for the dance segments, studio Sunrise can create higher production choreography and CGI. It does a smooth job transitioning between the CG and the animated parts during the dance segments to help emphasize movement.  These stage performances also sound great. Love Live is often associated with cute girls and high-pitched voices, but it is cute girls and “normal” pitch voices this time. This change can make the anime enjoyed by many more people, as many people were turned away by Love Live due to their high pitch.  In addition to looking and sounding good, they also flow well. Every time song is broken into, it feels like you know exactly when it is going to happen and instead of being boringly predictable, it is satisfying to see.  Alongside the dazzling stage performances, the background music is also good. Nice and relaxing most of the time, but it can also get you a little hype for the more dramatic moments.  Despite its characterization and pacing flaws, Love Live Superstar provides a fun time for both new and old fans of the series. It has arguably the best looking and sounding in the series and is overall a worthwhile experience. I will be looking forward to more of it!  Final note, I’d like to thank @hnf9982 and @lonelyhearts0 for reading over and helping me edit this review.";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! Superstar!!;Jaikeis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jaikeis;6;Love Live! Superstar is a solid show production-wise, but its position as the fourth separate continuity in the franchise only highlights the increasingly formulaic nature of Love Live's writing.  The show starts out promising enough. Kanon is our now apparently archetypal spunky orange-headed protagonist. Unlike Honoka or Chika though, she gets to have real character flaws. She's grumpy, she sulks, she talks back to her family. She loves to sing, but she has struggled for years freezing up in front of an audience. When we meet her, she's convinced she'll never make it as a performer. There's potential for a focused, if rather well-worn, character arc here that Love Live has never really done before.  Unfortunately, this lasts about two episodes in total. Within days of meeting Kanon, Keke sweeps her up into doing the school idol thing with her, with only token resistance from Kanon. One pre-concert jitters scene later, Kanon's stage fright is cured forever (or at least until we pretend it's still an ongoing issue nine episodes later to try to have some kind of conclusion for the end of the season), and we never see her acting moody again. Apparently, solving a lifetime's worth of anxiety issues is sometimes just that easy. A few episodes later, Kanon's childhood friend Chisato mentions that she specifically went into dance so that she could help Kanon out by doing the things Kanon can't do, but the implications of this put the opening arc of the show in a weird spot. I guess despite the two being close friends for nearly ten years or so, Chisato just never tried hard enough to help Kanon conquer her stage fright.  Aside from all that, Kanon herself is very popular at school, even though it is barely mentioned outright. Kanon handily wins a class vote for their idol group's center where most people voting would have no reason to care, and she's implied to have had a very good chance at the student council president seat if she hadn't refused to run. She's struggled with stage fright in front of her classmates for years, but the only bullying that ever happens is over Chisato drawing some stick figures in the dirt at a public park when she was a little girl. It's like a committee took someone's script and proceeded to shave off anything with the remotest chance of offending someone, all for the purpose of circling back to the safest route possible.  As we build up the school idol club, we're informed that—surprise, surprise—the student council girl, Ren, is against it. Why? Well, her mom was a school idol too, but she never kept any records of her club activities, and she apparently only mentioned her feelings about it once to Ren. But Ren forgot—yes, really—what her mom said to her, and thus concluded that her mom must have regretted being a school idol, it's the only explanation. She is thus very vocal on her anti-school idol position as she runs for student council president. Ren manages to get the votes of the general curriculum students by promising that everyone will get to participate in the upcoming school festival.  Once she's elected however, she insists that only the music course students will be performing, because she believes it's the only way to get more students to enroll in the school. Yes, apparently, the school is in danger of shutting down. Yes, again. Not only is the plot point derivative to the point of self-parody, but logistically, it makes little sense. Yuigaoka is literally in the very first year of its operation since it was formally refounded. How could it fall into such dire financial straits in the span of a few months? Are we to assume there's some embezzlement happening behind the scenes?  Ren's abrupt about-face in policy naturally upset the general curriculum students who start a petition in protest, and we see heated arguments break out between the general and music course students. Oh, but don't worry. All of this is resolved within the episode when Kanon and the gang showed Ren that no, her mom really did love being a school idol. So Ren relents and immediately reverses her position, allowing the general curriculum students to participate in the school festival. In response, the students all clap. Literally, everyone claps. Apparently, there's sometimes no one more understanding than a room full of irate teenagers. The school shutting down doesn't even get brought up again until it's suddenly solved off-screen in the final episode, so I guess it wasn't that important either?  Before Superstar aired, I had hoped that the smaller than usual main cast was a sign that we would see more nuanced, fleshed out characterization, but the characters are just as shallow here as when we had nine main characters in previous Love Live anime entries. Nothing the characters do have any real consequences, and every conflict is resolved almost immediately. There's never any stakes because the characters are never allowed to meaningfully fail. Early on, the fledgling school idol club is given an ultimatum: they have to win first place in an upcoming idol festival or they'll have to disband. They end up losing to the contest favorite school idol duo Sunny Passion, but the school just shrugs and lets them have their club anyway with no pushback.  Sunny Passion functions as our main rivals, but they might as well not exist for how severely underutilized they are. Their whole characters can be summed up in three traits: they're nice, they never sing on-screen, and they look like they got picked off the cutting room floor of Aikatsu character designs. They get a full episode where they invite the girls out to perform at their island resort, and even then they have barely any presence. I'd be surprised if anyone remembers their names because they matter so little.  Meanwhile, our main cast of girls get to have cute antics with good production values, but that's all there is to it. The only character flaws they have that aren't tossed aside are ones that can be spun as cute, as if they're disguised strengths in the weaknesses category of a job interview. The one exception to this is when the focus shifts to Sumire, whose hangups get treated some actual weight. She's insecure and afraid of failure, and that doesn't magically all go away after receiving one kind gesture from her friends. Two episodes cannot carry a series however, and the show otherwise never tries to be anything more, quickly quashing any hints to the contrary.  Love Live is a mega popular franchise with more than enough dedicated super fans to weather a few unexceptional anime entries, but a franchise that keeps playing safe is one that will eventually hit a wall in market saturation. As of now, Love Live is juggling three different active groups to run the live concert circuit: Sunshine's Aqours, Nijigasaki, and Superstar's Liella! Each one has the same basic premise of starting a brand new idol club in the face of student council disapproval. Sunshine, at least in its first season, distinguishes itself by having a consistent through line reinforcing its central theme. Nijigasaki flips the focus in favor of individual character episodes instead of any overall plot, and at least its school isn't in danger of dying for no good reason. In contrast, Superstar has little giving it its own identity.  On its own, Superstar is serviceable if light on substance, and it has enough great scenes to demonstrate that someone on the staff really cared about the show, but they're always fighting against the show's refusal to take a step outside the boundaries of past successes. Taken in the context of the franchise, it has little innovation to offer. Newcomers to Love Live will have no issues enjoying the series, and super fans don't need a second opinion. For everyone else though, it's more or less skippable.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! Superstar!!;Christa54;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Christa54;6;"Well I'm starting this review by saying that I used to be a huge fan of this franchise and series.  With that in mind, I have to say that Love Live Superstar has to be the most wasted Love Live yet. Most of my struggles with this series are about how they mishandled so many situations, Love Live is also known for having some musical moments that will melt your heart, but aside of the animation (that we know that it only gets better and better), none of the performances transmitted anything to me really, I would only rescue one (which I will not say because I'm not gonna make spoilers) but it's kinda forgettable tho.  The problems that girls face are very redundant and some of them don't make sense in my opinion (I feel that there're contradictions throughout the series), actually in previous installments of Love Live, the series has been able to handle a bigger number of girls and showing different facets of them, and ALSO transmitting their emotions in a single chapter, something that Superstar is not capable of executing correctly since most conflicts are not taken seriously.  Going to the humor and charisma section, in this series, I also find nothing outstanding compared to the previous installments, in fact, in Superstar I feel that the ""funny scenes"" are less effective most of the time.  I think Love Live Superstar it's ok if your looking for an anime that you can kill time with, but at the same time it's very mediocre in many ways, and it's one of the most forgettable Love Lives to date in my opinion.  PS: Sumire has the best episode imo";Mixed Feelings
4;Love Live! Superstar!!;Pravaris;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pravaris;5;"I started watching Love Live! Superstar!! with the expectation that the smaller cast of 5 would allow more time to explore each character's dreams and worries, strengths and flaws, past failures and present efforts. Exploring their character, in other words.  Well, yes, but actually no.  While each character certainly had more screen time and lines compared to some idol anime, the additional attention was squandered. The anime eventually became formulaic again. Most character development and progression was made in service to the overbearing and repetitive Love Live formula.  The best episodes were the first 4. Each one focused on the three starting cast of characters, Kanon, Keke, and Chisato. The in-universe Love Live competition was but the lofty dream of Keke; the fuel that drove her actions and compelled her to push Kanon — who, in turn, pushed Chisato. This worked excellently in the anime’s favour because the characters, the most interesting part of the anime, were developed. The Love Live premise was used to drive character growth.  As an example (minor spoiler), I want to focus on the first character we’re introduced to, Kanon. The anime began on a personal level. Kanon was a bright, passionate, and talented singer with a dream of getting into an art program of a prestigious school. Her dream was dashed, however, when crippling stage fright took hold. Cut back to the present, she lay in bed with a vexed expression. She derided herself for choking when it counted. Her failure coloured her every interaction as she entered the new school year at the aforementioned prestigious school — but as part of the general curriculum.  As the episode went on, we learnt more about her. After a few encounters with the pushy Keke, perhaps answering her enthusiasm with sincerity, Kanon opened up, explaining that she had always been unable to sing at important moments. She had experienced a series of major setbacks. So she gave up.  I distinctly remember that the first Love Live anime dealt with this exact topic before but I don’t care — I think this type of story is what Love Live is good at. A personal story of encountering repeated failures and still pressing on. It then came to a heartwarming conclusion; with support from others — like-minded people who will stick with you no matter how long it takes — you can keep trying.  Too bad “The Love Live plot” had to come in eventually.  Student council doesn’t approve? Yes. School shutting down? You bet. Student council member joins the group? Of course. Prolific rival helps them out? Hell yeah.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  This level of predictability would not be so bad if “The Love Live plot” stayed in the background and fuelled character development but no. Past the halfway point, the tried and tired “Love Live plot” got its Love Live coloured appendages all over the script and every single character arc now had a predictable and rushed end. Every character struggle must wrap up in 1 episode — 2 episodes tops. Every arc must end with a dramatic resolution, whether or not human behaviour or the laws of physics have to be flagrantly broken.  By the time I got to the grand finale, I realised that I could not care less about their triumph or defeat because my immersion had long since evaporated. The hand of the author(s) was too obvious and I could no longer suspend my disbelief. Suspension of Disbelief: Gone The most glaringly obvious influence of “The Love Live plot” are the 2 rival characters, a school idol unit called Sunny Passion. They are a pair of convenient counsellors with an uncanny awareness of the protagonists’ plight. Where there is a void that the main characters cannot fill, they warp into existence, twisting and stretching their personality and abilities into the shape of the void. These vapid husks, masquerading as humans, are lauded as the greatest school idols of the region and just that fact tears down my suspension of disbelief.  I exaggerate. Kanon’s clairvoyance and Keke’s creation magic also ruined my immersion.  I tried to turn off my brain and enjoy the emotional moments, but the eldritch hand of the author(s) is too much to bear. My eyes were opened and I could not look away. “The Love Live plot” controls the world.  In conclusion, although the first third of Love Live Superstar showed promise, it quickly fell back into a predictable plot that tainted all character development with the same predictability. If you are a fan of idol anime and can ignore the franchise’s tendency to bend reality, you will probably enjoy this too.  For the rest of us, skip.";Mixed Feelings
5;Love Live! Superstar!!;valiantslakr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/valiantslakr;6;"Hate to be that one negative guy, but I think I'm just getting tired of Love Live at this point. The anime started off with much promise with a radically different type of main character, and a smaller but more focused cast, but it eventually just devolved into your generic love live fluff that plays it a little TOO safe.  Aesthetically of course, the animation is not too shabby, the girls are cute, and the music is good. However, it all just feels super dragged on and likewise with love live nijigasaki, there's just no sense of conflict or like a threat of having their school being closed down. All in all, tl;dr it had promise but became incredibly generic as the episodes went on. If you've watched any of the previous love live anime before, this is going to feel more similar than you hoped";Mixed Feelings
6;Love Live! Superstar!!;Hanakoizumi_Anne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hanakoizumi_Anne;5;If you haven't watched other Love Live series yet, I recommend starting from the first series (Love Live School Idol Project).  I will give my honest thought after completing all 12 episodes. Although this series is new and refreshing compared with the previous LL series, LL Superstar is #3 for me based on the character/story and songs. The 1st and 2nd episodes are the only enjoyable for me. The story kinda messes up for me as the episode goes on and some characters make me confused (I have to rewind many times at certain scenes to understand what is going on).  The arts and songs are great but the story and characters are average, not too great and not too bad. Overall, I find this series is good to watch but did not give some impact like the first series. You guys can watch it but if you are new to the Love Live series, I highly recommend watching start from the first series because some of the stories are related to it even though a little bit (you'll understand if you watch it yourself).;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Superstar!!;Lilfukoling;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lilfukoling;4;As a fan of love live, this was probably the most boring love live I've seen. The story was okay but kind boring. Average at best. The art is your every day love live art style, taking after the original and sunshine. The character designs aren't great, this was probably the poorest designs I've seen so far from the love live series, the worse looks being sunny pas and rens design overall, the only thing that makes it work while is the personalities for 4 outta the 5 main group, ten being the most poorest of personalities. The outfits aren't amazing there very poorly designed especially the opening outfits which didn't look like they knew what they were doing with it. The music was average and just sounded like things I've heard before to the point of the first ending looking visually and sounding like aikatsu precious, way to closely in fact. Overall this series is below average for me with only the characters actual making it worth the watch at most but even then I wouldn't go back for seconds unlike the other series which were far more enjoyable and had far more likable characters to them.;Not Recommended
0;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;dadnaya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dadnaya;10;After a long wait, the movie has finally arrived for us to watch!  Love Live! Sunshine!! Over the Rainbow (or in short LLS:OTR) was quite a phenomenal movie. Though it didn't really do much new when it comes to Love Live's nature.  The story makes zero sense. I won't spoil, but we get MORE drama throughout the movie that feels so out of place, and many flaws you can point out that make no sense. But if you're already used to Love Live!, you'll understand the basic concept does not make sense at all (Ex: Where the heck does the music come from?), and still a few other contradictions.  If we put the story aspect aside, we get a masterpiece of a movie. The songs and dances in the movie were amazing, especially with the constant switching between CGI and 2D, which I found to be done really well (especially if you compare it to the very first season of LL).  The songs were really good overall, a few bangers, a few mediocre ones, it balances it out.  The setting in general was really nice (Italy!), though it's quite a shame that like in µ's movie they didn't have way too much time abroad and went back to Japan to solve the rest of the series.  The movie gave the finale we needed for the series, and I still have hope to see spinoffs or similar anime adaptations in the Love Live! universe.  Oh, and by the way, if you're a 3rd years fan, this movie just hits the sweet spot that gives them quite some screen time.   In general, if you're already a fan of the series, you're going to love the movie, but if you aren't really, you'll meet the same old flaws and problem yet again.  And since I'm a huge fan, I rated it 10/10.;Recommended
1;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;10;"u went to America for their movie, Aquors went to...ITALY!??!...what was Giorno their guide?  Where the u's movie merely did a cursor glance at any resolutions and pretty much retread of it's anime series finale just with America added in...Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie Over the Rainbow gives us the resolutions that the anime series left us and did it BRILLIANTLY.  Well the premise of this movie to even get Aquors to Italy is that Mari, Kanan and Dia have gone missing and Mari's mother tells the remaining to find Mari and Mari's mother will give them a huge sum of money if they succeed, thus Italy but it's not as easy as it seems, but this plotline is only the base premise as Chika and the remaining Aquors have a bit of a problem both performance-wise and friendship-wise what with Mari, Kanan and Dia having graduated and it's affecting them harshly. Later on, Saint Snow comes in and much like Aquors' breaking up, Saint Snow but more precisely Leah can't take it that Sarah is also graduating and is ALSO having problems forming an school idol group on her own.  For characters themselves, Mari has taken focus for the first half of the movie what with Italy and all, but she gets some much needed development aside from being the wacky Engrish girl and sure....her development is to do with her mother thus family issues and as much as it's cliche, Mari's development was still decent and a nice foundation and push for the plot to move forward. Yoshiko's chunni gets her own due, yes for laughs but nonetheless. Hanamaru and Yoshiko seemed to be the comedic relief of the movie Yoshiko...being Yoshiko but Hanamaru gets the running gag of eating EVERYTHING in Italy. Kanan and Dia become essentially satellite characters to Mari for the first half of the movie but what with both of them having development from the anime series it kinda makes sense for Mari to take the spotlight as she needed it. Ruby much like Leah gets the same development with their older sisters but Ruby is at the end of it as she KNOWS and has moved forward whereas Leah is at the middle of it and finally given the resolution she got in this movie. Chika, Riko and You gets oddly enough the least amount of development with once again You getting the least out of the three. Chika being the de facto leader of the 6 remaining Aquors members and really she does most of the decision making for the movie, while Riko and You are the cheerleaders, You does have one other addition that of You's cousin, Tsuki who is a student of the main school that Uranohoshi's student have transferred to and much like You helps Aquors, oddly enough Tsuki got the development that You needed as Tsuki tags along with Aquors and later on finds how great being School Idols are and in turn making the main school to show that Uranohoshi is worth being in their school (instead of the branch school they got dumped into). Riko though is similar to You, screentime wise and ""yuri shipping goggles-wise"" got way more than You, as Riko interacts more with both Chika and Yoshiko. Once again You gets shafted.  The animation done once again by Sunrise, well the background work was AMAZING especially during Aqours' stay in Italy. The character designs and expressive facial animation was done to great and sometimes wacky results. Character designs-wise, though it's still consistent as the anime series, the movie gave Aquors are VARIETY of costumes for any time they change locations or a new time of day (seriously, their sets of costumes could fill up a rich mansion's closet!). The Live's CGI got better as well from the second season's anime series, though it's still obvious when they use CGI, they blended quite well to the point it's not distracting, just noticeable. All in all, Sunrise went ALL OUT for this movie's animation and for such a ""farewell"" movie, it was to be expected.  Voice cast was back and great as always, with some standouts being Aina Suzuki as Mari because come on, while Yoshiko and Hanamaru's voice actress Aika Kobayashi and Kanako Takatsuki gets to go full ham or comedic and their one liners were great. Tsuki's voice actress who was uncredited (?) was pretty much the same cadence as Shuka Saitou voiced by You pretty much showing that Tsuki IS very much You's cousin. But all in all, since they not only voice the characters but the singing was great and with that. Aquors' voice cast is back and better than ever in this movie so all in all. Great voice cast..as always.  Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie Over the Rainbow did what u's couldn't with their movie and that is RESOLUTIONS and Over the Rainbow actually made it a tearful but satisfying resolution and farewell with Aquors and tied up loose ends from it's anime series and to that end makes it a much better constructed movie, yes it's similar to the u's movie at the start (main cast goes somewhere outside of Japan) and the 3rd Years have graduated and having to deal with it and to Over the Rainbow's end with characters have a mixed development to their resolutions, some little to nothing *cough* You the ever satellite character *cough* but Over the Rainbow nonetheless ENDS tying up ANY loose plotlines with it's characters the anime series left hanging, whereas u's movie gave us an open ended farewell and left it at that.  u's anime series and movie was too happy go lucky, almost coincidental in how things ended up as to be status quo and got the series in a static limbo with its movie's finale, but to state, LA doesn't think u's movie is horrible as a result, that movie did what it did, yes with some flaws but it was a farewell just not a decent one, whereas Aquors from it's anime series dealt with being an idol group and with it's 3rd Years gradating soon in a much more logical way and with this movie gave us a proper farewell and resolutions that were established in the anime series.  If you haven't noticed, LA was very satisfied with this movie as LA can see Aquors moving forward in earnest. Over the Rainbow...well went over the rainbow and once again, gave us a pretty satisfying, yet tearful farewell, what else would you want more for an idol movie than that showing that an idol group can happily move forward with no regrets.";Recommended
2;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;badabass;https://myanimelist.net/profile/badabass;10;For the huge Love Live! series, and the last sequel for the Love Live! Sunshine! Series, this movie was a massive show. Eventhough i never watch the prequel before, because i just need this movie just for a refreshener, i can't say a bad word for these amazing music story. I may be too over reacted, but my point here was clear and exact to the main course, i love this movie!  Following to the disclosure of the mqin school, they try to give a brand new school idol to the branch school on an abandoned building as a main school base. Like its written in the synopsis based on MAL, the mission was simple. But, they failed first. Then had a great movement in the next scenery and so on. How heart-warming for me! Despite random activity happen for the next half of the movie, like goes to the Italy, prevent arranged marriage of Mari, even helping their solo rival Leah arise again, these movie can not lose its shine!  Straight to the last performed, until their final music show, all of them match together in harmony. Aquors, now bring more fun to the new school citizen, and gladly received a welcome appreciation! I can't say other words rather than an incredible amount of sweet music, an amazing art and animation, a beautiful sounds performance by all of the VA, a wonderful story and well building to the characterization, just that words can flowing from my mind. I might be naives, giving too much score, straight to 10, to a non-watcher series before. However, after watching the first franchises of Love Live! School project in the first, my points shall be crystall and solid. Yes, i shall watch the anothers. But, for this solo movie, my 10 can granted all of my wish together as one.  Thats all i can say for thiw short summary of review, as usual. Not much, i think. Even the last review can not be the same as this. But still, 10 per 10 for all of the sections was my final deduction.;Recommended
3;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;HalfbloodJedi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HalfbloodJedi;7;This should have been the second season. I'm baffled that this whole thing was shoved into a movie instead of being the plot of the entire second season, which it could have easily accommodated (and the second season instead being a bland repetitive plot with no originality). The art and music are, of course, stellar and the characters are at their most extreme - which is good, because that's when Aquors feels most original, rather than their usual day to day not-quite-knock-offs of the Muse cast. Yoshiko and Mari get a lot of spotlight here and that's fair, because they're some of the most interesting and original of the crew, unlike Hono- I mean Chika. The side characters are meaningless and I don't really understand their introduction but they're in the movie so little that I don't care. In all honesty, though, this movie is the thing to watch if you want the best of the Aquors experience without wasting your time on the bad pacing of their two seasons, the repetitive nature of plotlines, and at least it isn't a direct copy of the Muse movie, unlike the rest of the Aquors series. My hopes for the next group of girls being in any way new or original now that another anime has been confirmed isn't very high.;Recommended
4;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;Asasphinx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asasphinx;7;I've held the Love Live series in high regard for years at this point and have went into each series cautiously and optimistically in mind to how the series got its start with School Idol Project. Of the many spin-offs and followups after SIF, Sunshine definitely had a rocky start as Aqours' biggest issue throughout Sunshine seemed to be establishing their own identity apart from the likes of Muse and in some way this movie gives them another chance in doing what season 1 was trying to do, but it still has it's own issues.  Over the Rainbow follows up on the plot point with the school that season 2 left off with and the 3rd years are naturally preparing for life after high school away from Aqours and the remaining 6 members struggle to function as a group knowing the 3rd years won't be with them going forward. This is the biggest plot point of the movie along with a continuation of school drama Aqours seeks to resolve following the closure of Uranohoshi Girl's High School in season 2, but it's not the only one as the film picks up a good few other narratives and attempts to provide some clarity on. If you're a fan of Sunshine then perhaps you'll be content with how it looks at all issues with heavy dramatization and solving those issues through configuring their emotions and everything else works alongside their own evolutions. You could say the overly dramatic approach to storytelling is a part of what makes this series what it is at this point and I'd be inclined to agree, but I didn't feel like it juggled the handful of plot points too well here. The trip that they take to seek out the 3rd years gets rendered pointless by it not being relevant other than mostly serving for a temporary setting. And like it the other plot points are either rushed towards a conclusion too soon or resolved a bit too easy in favor of the movie reaching a satisfying ending for everyone.  Aqours themselves are all back and carrying the same cute quirks and traits as they've always had and along with them Saint Snow as well. Over the Rainbow somehow felt like it didn't do anyone in Aqours too much justice for anyone individually. Even for the few who get highlighted we're not given too much time to absorb ourselves in the drama because it gets solved quicker than it feel like it should've been. The few who'll get some seperate camera time get at least a little something in, but the rest seemingly get relegated to roles they already had from the TV series. (Like You being snubbed of screentime more than Chika & Rika, Hanamaru & Yoshiko acting as comic relief to varying degrees, and Ruby at least being able to synchronize & develop in a similar sense with Leah from Saint Snow over their sisters and idol performances with them)  While it staggers with the story it does of course do great with everything else. The songs and performances are of course good as expected, may be so bold as to say I might have a new favorite Aqours song or two now from the movie. While I don't quite have an eye for details regarding things like CGI, there is nothing I have to say against it here because it's something Love Live does very well all around it's multiple series. The models always look good and the choreography for the dances seems impeccable, some of the best choreography in anime tends to come from this series. Also liked how the movie felt more like a musical too with how well they'll move from a scene then immediately transition into a performance.  Over the Rainbow treads into the same familiar territory that it the Sunshine TV series does but for better and worse in various respects from both seasons, but if you liked Sunshine then you'll likely like the movie as well. The movie didn't quite feel like the farewell for Aqours that I hoped it would've been like with μ's but it felt like it did them just enough justice for me to walk away and feel like the series has concluded. But I did like that it ends on the same note that season 1 starts on, and rather than that goodbye like μ's had this felt simple and pleasant. While Aqours' overall tale was a bit rough having retread familiar territory and stumbling a bit on it's own spins it was still nice being with Aqours for the ride.;Recommended
5;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;DaddyDubs;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DaddyDubs;7;In some ways, I actually like this movie more than School Idol Project's movie, which you won't hear many people say. However, there are other ways in which it falls flat. Over the Rainbow is a movie with a good plot but with poor writing.  Spoilers:  So one of my biggest problems with the movie is just how absurd it all seems. The conflict and the early plot are actually pretty good, I like the dynamic with Mari and her mom fighting about her potential marriage and the fact that the third years ran away. However, the story wasn't executed the best. The characters range from pleasant like Yoshiko to annoying like Hanamaru, who essentially does nothing but eat and whine. Then you get other characters like You that get no screentime because they decided it would be a good idea to include some annoying 1-dimensional copy of her who takes away some of her screentime. Kanan and Dia also don't get nearly enough screentime, I think it would have been kind of cool to see them talk more about their relationship with Mari. The music is phenomenal, as to be expected, especially Saint Snow. The art is pretty good although some of the design choices like the lips bug me a little (that may not bother you, it's more of a personal preference for me). The pacing isn't the best but it is better than the other LL movie, so I guess that's something. I don't really see what was essential about the girls going to Italy. They could have literally done the same story but just have the 3rd years go run away to Tokyo or something. Why Italy? Is it because Mari has family there? You can add that to the list of things that this movie never explains. I do like the conflict towards the end with Leah and Sarah, it's kind of a nice touch but I wish it had been built up to throughout the movie better, it's just kind of shoveled in there.  Despite my critiques, this movie does do a lot of things right. It kept me invested, it had good music, the art was good, and it is, I suppose, a satisfying conclusion to Aqours' legacy. Not the best movie of all times, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.;Recommended
6;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;Fishymonster_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fishymonster_;8;"I waited a few months after finishing the second season of sunshine to watch this, and to be honest I didn't really like show part of sunshine. I watched it right after school idol project, and it just felt like an exact carbon copy with slightly different characters and circumstances, and I got a little tired of the forced overdramatic scenes.  Coming back and watching this movie, I realize that's what made this series good in the first place. The drama is overdramatized and the ""touching"" moments are so cliche and stupid you could laugh, but honestly I still love it. It's not well written, but despite that it still manages to be fun. This series still has some actually amazing music though, and the animation is surprisingly good too.  Overall, this is basically just a trashy high school drama, but I still love it.";Recommended
0;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;6;"It's a heck of a lot better than the second season, but that ain't saying too much.  As someone who still holds the original Love Live in somewhat high regard, Sunshine was quite frustrating to watch. The first season was decent, OK, but left a lot to be concerned about regarding its future. And sure enough, every single concern I had was present in the second season, with a few extra frustrations tossed in for maximum joy. The drama was overblown, so cloying, so far up its own arse that it thought minivans flying into the moon is apparently what idol fans were clamoring for. The characters remained one-dimensional caricatures with minimal growth, save for perhaps Ruby's and Ria's involvement with one another, which was probably the season's one saving grace. So, yeah, a bit disappointed I was, perhaps one might say.  And so comes the movie, Over the Rainbow, bringing the series back somewhat to its roots, serving as a reminder of what Sunshine should have been in the first place.  Though there is plenty of drama here as per Sunshine routine, this time around it serves more as a companion to the quieter, sillier moments and the characters' interactions with one another. Because they no longer have to spend every waking second freaking out about their school potentially shutting down, the girls of Aquors are free to finally do their own thing and focus on their own future rather than that of the school's. What will happen to Aquors now that the third years are graduating and leaving the group? Is it worth continuing Aquors without the full nine present? Can Rea move forward on her own now that her partner and role model has graduated from Saint Snow? These questions are far more compelling, far more human than something as artificial as ""well, the school might be shutting down, so I guess we have to be as popular as we can or whatever and scream about shining every ten seconds or so.""  The result is that the drama hits, because it actually matters this time around. Though Over the Rainbow is still a bit too heavy for its own good (this is an anime about high school pop idols, after all...), the conclusions the characters come to feel like the natural destination for their story, and the bittersweet ending— the final concert in particular— carries a tinge of emotional weight similar to that of the original Love Live's ending. If you are easily moved, perhaps you might be on the verge of a tear or two, but in my case it was just too late to feel all that much.  The musical performances (and I do mean 'musical' musical, a la Grease or La La Land) are undoubtedly the high point of the movie; notably, the opening sequence near the train station, the girls gradually introducing themselves and speaking to the audience through lyric, was very cleverly choreographed and a catchy little song in itself. The animation is more of a mixed bag, as even with movie treatment the dances are mostly comprised of artificial-looking CG, not all too different from any typical episode of the TV series. The way the camera quickly zooms in and pans around is a lot more enthralling, however, and some of the stills and background shots (especially of the Italian cityscape) are stunning and on par with some of the best the industry has seen. But I guess Love Live has always been pretty palatable to the senses, hey?  So, if, like me, you were critical of Sunshine but enjoyed the original series, Over The Rainbow ain't too bad. It feels closer to the original, better balancing the drama with the comedy and focusing more on what the viewers want— music and girls— rather than trying to wax philosophical and change your life through the sheer force of melodrama.  If ever there is a third Love Live anime series, I'd like to see them do something slightly different. We've done this story twice now, identical format and all, so I can't really imagine a third time around would get people all that excited. Why not have all the girls start as first years together, so the story can run for longer instead of being reset every time a couple of the seniors inevitably graduate. Things could even continue beyond high school as they would all still be together. Heck, while we're at it, you could also lower the cast from nine down to five or six so that they all have more screen time and can get more fleshed-out. Just my ten cents.  But if the upcoming All Stars mobile game is any indication, the next iteration of Love Live characters look to be more of the same.  Not that it matters, I suppose, because I will play it, and I will enjoy it solely because there is Nico.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow;Azukano;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Azukano;5;"***SPOILER-FREE REVIEW***  Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow was an anticipated movie for many Love Live Sunshine fans. Using the same trope of ""Traveling Abroad"" just like the original Love Live series, they look to produce the same amount of closure in the franchise as well as the original did. However, this really wasn't the case sadly.  ______   STORY: LLS Movie is an extended epilogue of Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season. With the 3rd years graduating and the others merging in with another school, we look to see how they close the show. It started off nicely with the 1st and 2nd years struggling to find their way without 3 members missing. However, the switch to the ""3rd years missing in Italy"" arc was out of nowhere and the result of the arc was worthless other than to showcase the ""trip abroad"" trope that the original did. Nothing really was given to the characters rather than the ""Friends got our back in everything"" concept.  Then switching back to include Saint Snow's dilemma was rapid as well and didn't really help the main group of Aqours resolve their own problems until later on in the movie.  The ending did feature a touching way to end off the series, but everything preceding this was clumsily directed and filled with filler. But I'll get to that in the ""Enjoyment"" section of this review.  ______   ART: This movie showcased a vast improvement in it's art and animation compared to the 2nd season. The CG models of the girls performing are much better. Backdrops looked quite nice as well.   ______   SOUND: Just take the same OST you got from previous Love Live anime but add in a few new original songs and you get this movie's soundtrack. I personally liked all of the songs although listening to Aqours' singles, they sound quite similar and not so different from each other. Saint Snow's newest song was my standout pick for the soundtrack of the movie in my opinion.  ______   CHARACTER: As an extension of my thoughts on the story, the way the movie was paced and directed felt sloppy and really didn't do much for any of the individual characters at all. Even as a group which left a mixed feeling for me when finishing the movie. The characters did showcase the tropes that made us love them from the first 2 seasons cause they did have standout moments of comedy and great character chemistry. But seeing as this movie **should** be a defining conclusion to the LL: Sunshine franchise. This felt like filler and that's disappointing.   ______   ENJOYMENT: As per mentioned in the previous sections, my enjoyment of the movie was flawed due to the sloppy pacing of the story and underwhelming character growth mixed with the ""laugh out loud"" moments produced by the lovable girls of Love Live Sunshine. Seeing how they marketed this movie to be a ""crazy trip abroad"" type of movie and seeing the end result was disappointing in my opinion as the whole trip was pretty wasted potential.   ______   FINAL THOUGHTS: Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow was a overall fine movie. As an extended epilogue to the 2nd season of Sunshine, this was a pretty underwhelming experience. However, for hardcore Love Live fans, this will definitely satisfy you for the comedic moments and good songs that the movie offers. If you have seen the trailer for this movie, don't expect much from the abroad trip or even the movie as a whole. You'll be disappointed, like I was.  5/10";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;RiverRode;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RiverRode;10;"Love Live has come a long way. It’s difficult to imagine now, but when the first season of School Idol Project started back in 2013, idol anime as we know it today didn’t really exist. Just as µ's was the guiding light for the world of school idols, the franchise led the way for the genre, and by the time of the School Idol Movie, it really had become a global phenomenon. So when µ's retired and Aqours stepped forward to take its place, fans were understandably upset and worried that this new iteration would tarnish or override the franchise’s legacy. But it was never the goal for Aqours to replace its predecessor, and instead it told its own story about trying to live up to that legacy, and instead accomplishing far more.  While the first season of Sunshine adhered closely to the formula set by School Idol Project, the second season focused on the ways that Aqours was different. The new generation was never going to measure up against the audience’s nostalgia for µ's, and that was reflected in the story. Aqours struggles with challenges that µ's overcame easily, and there are times when they actually fail. These aren’t just failure by circumstance; they will have tried their best and it still wasn’t enough to succeed. We see these characters when they’re at their lowest points, and when they get back up and try again, it makes their victories all the sweeter. The writing is about as subtle as a brick, but it gets the emotions across.  Although, those feelings wouldn’t resonate so strongly if we weren’t so deeply invested the cast and their success. Sunshine relies more heavily on personal drama than its predecessor, and it works because their problems aren’t abstract and artificial walls, but genuine fears and worries to which we can relate. And instead of having to overcome these problems on their own, the other members of the group will reach out to provide support, which sells you on the idea that these characters are actually friends who care about each other’s well-being. It’s true that some members of the ensemble get better treatment than others, with one or two being reduced mainly to one-note gags, but overall the cast is so earnest that you can’t help but root for them.  The growth of the characters is also reflected in the performance scenes, which see the characters becoming gradually more comfortable with complex choreography and each other. For better or worse, CGI has always been a staple of the Love Live franchise, and it’s been getting better with every entry. Early performances looked garish and were plagued by unimaginative camerawork, but both technology and direction have improved vastly, and it’s finally reaching the point that CGI can compete with traditional animation. Performances now come alive with dancing in 3D spaces, and varied shot composition and camera effects make for a real spectacle. It also helps that the songs being performed are really good. Aqours has a diverse discography, ranging from traditional Japanese odori to Broadway show tunes. The soundtrack outside of the performances is excellent as well, effectively matching the tonal shifts over the course of the season. On its technical merits, Sunshine soars.  If I were to look at the anime alone, Sunshine is far from perfect. There’s a lot of valid criticisms that can and should be made, but since that’s not my focus, I’d recommend checking out Yuni’s review, which addresses a lot of them. But for this, rather than just looking at the show itself, I’m also including my own experience watching it, and I find that my enjoyment greatly outweighs any criticisms. For the past 13 weeks, it hasn’t just been the show that I’ve enjoyed, but also being a part of the community that surrounds it. That’s just my personal experience, so it will differ from person to person, but all I can say is that all of the tweets, fanart, and fanfiction that I saw definitely added to my enjoyment.  I’m going to miss this generation. It’s not quite over yet – there’s still the movie – but the end is rapidly approaching. I’ve always appreciated that the Love Live franchise ends stories conclusively; the dream of being a school idol is fleeting, but the lessons learned will last forever. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to love the next generation the same way I loved this one, but the future looks bright, and I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings.";Recommended
1;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;dadnaya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dadnaya;10;"Ok, Let's talk real now.  I didn't come to watch Love Live Sunshine because I looked for some intense and deep story that involves time traveling or... something like that.  I came here looking for cute idols singing, dancing, aiming high and getting there. And I got exactly what I was looking for.  In Season 2 we didn't really have a ""special"" story. It's pretty similar to School Idol Project, with the school being at risk, 3rd years leaving and such. But, it felt like it fit to give some background story so I liked it in the end. (7/10 for Story)  The animation and art was outstanding. The CGI dances were executed super well and I have enjoyed every moment watching it. Of course there were points where the art dropped off, but it was mostly consistent. (9/10 for Art)  Sound- Which includes Soundtrack/OP/ED/Insert songs. That was the real strength of Love Live Sunshine. These were amazing songs and I've enjoyed every single one of them, I listen to them every day because they were so good.  The soundtrack, too, fit quite well and was nice. (10/10 for Sound)  Well, we have 9 characters, which is a pretty nice amount. So it'll be hard not finding a girl to your liking. They were pretty diverse in their personalities yet so close (as they're all idols), the development between the cast as Aqours, or as one grade (Ex: Chemistry between 3rd years) and all the ""ships"" were quite outstanding. I found myself really bonding with the characters, and by the end of the anime there are no girls I hate. (10/10 for Character).  So in conclusion, this anime got a 10/10 from me. And I RECOMMEND IT. Even if you don't feel like going through the ""comedy to drama"" story, just listen and watch to the CGI Dances and songs, as they were too good.";Recommended
2;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;S_Scizor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/S_Scizor;10;"The following was written after the 1st episode stream: ------------------------------------------------ The new season of Love Live! Sunshine is here, and with it a new whole goal.  First of, the visual part was absolutely beautiful, word´s can´t describe how gorgeous the animation is, there´s no doubt that this is the peak of Love Live! animation, the opening sequence goes through various settings which all are detailed perfectly, accompanied by the new opening theme ""Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo"", which set the stage for a memorable season.  As for the story goes, you can see the development that the characters had in season one, but maintaining that ambitious nature of them that lets them keep moving forward.  Now there´s a new goal for the group, it isn´t just saving the school or winning Love Live! anymore, now they´re aiming to make an impact around the world, and do whatever it´s necessary to let a miracle happen.  Also, during the first episode of this season there are a lot of references from the first episode of the first season, but now changing Riko´s and Chika´s role for a moment.  The ending sequence was the most memorable thing to me, sharing a lot of similarities with the first Love Live! endings sequences, the song isn´t only amazing, but it´s also a nostalgia trip through all the franchise in less than 2 minutes.  The wait is over and it was worth it, this season will definitively teach us the meaning of hard work and believing in miracles, and the trip to reach to that point will be a total thrillride, let´s enjoy this moment together!  ------------------------------------------------  Now after 13 episodes has passed, I can safely say that this was the best written season of all Love Live!, they didn´t abused the drama but at the same time you can feel connected to the characters, their growth and personal goals, as well as the collective goals for Aqours, having their own unique approach, both as a group and individuals.  As for the insert songs, they can only be described as legendary, they will be remembered for years to come for the ones that got to enjoy this anime.  By the end of the season you can feel how everything from season 1 and this season was connected to give a satisfying conclusion for the ones that payed close attention to the development of each character.  Personally, I will cherish this season forever.";Recommended
3;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;KimiAl;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KimiAl;10;"This was an overdue review. Sorry.  Love Love has done so much for so many people, despite what you might think of the franchise.  The story isn't something out of a masterpiece. It is bland and simplistic and the characters have one dimensional personalities. Too bland. Too simple. Sometimes a little too simple.  We were thought to believe that compelling stories have to be meaningful, cathartic. Just like life itself. But we sometimes forget that life does not have to be cathartic. It can be simple. It does not have to be convoluted or complicated in order for it to work. Sometimes it clicks. Just like that.  Some things do not have to be complicated for them to work out just fine.  Chika Takami knew that. Her friends knew that.  She wanted to find something that made her life shine bright.  That is something very simplistic in the journey of self discovery.  It does not matter where you come from. What you do. What you believe in and who you find along the way. Sometimes things just click and nobody can take those experiences away from you. This is what the meaning of self discovery truly is. It is purely subjective. If you have learned from them it does not matter what other people think.  Love Live is just that. It clicks. In its simplicity it clicks and brings you along the way.  (And it might not, but it's still your own personal experience)  I met a twelve year old girl this past summer that got into Love Live thanks to a friend. We are fifteen years apart and we spent a whole afternoon talking about the story and characters.  I could have never been able to enjoy a conversation with this young girl if it was any other anime. It was an easy going conversation that to this day I cherish deeply, because it made me see something that I had not seen in myself. In order for things to work, I don't have to think too hard about them.  It does not matter if the story is not as perfect as you might think.  It is so important to remember that things don't always have to be difficult. They can be easy. As adults we constantly say ""It's difficult"". Sure, it is difficult, but it does not always have to be that way.  Love Live is a beautiful story about accepting the simple things about life, because way too often we don't. We just forget them somewhere in the back of our brains, until we go insane.  In my opinion, this is why Love Live is cherished and relatable amongst so many people, because it's about a simple group of teenagers with simple goals, looking to follow a common dream. Whether if it happens it does not matter. It is still the journey of self discovery.  It was the same for me. I started Love Live not knowing what it was and hearing so much hate about it. I almost thought I was going to hate it as well, yet I found myself compelled into an unexpected world that made me laugh and cry and that made me realize, things don't have to drive you mad in order to work. They just do. Go with the flow. If you can't control it don't control it.  I finally got myself to watch the last episode of this anime after a year of putting it off, knowing full-heartedly that there might not be another anime in this franchise. And I was not let down.  Love Live has made an impact on so many people. For bad or for good it doesn't really matter.  I am just so happy that I was there to see it happen.  (Now please don't kill me for writing this) -Peace";Recommended
4;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;Naneo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naneo;10;This is a sequel for the anime with same title. I reccomend you to watch the first season before this season, because this anime is an in-depth story about all the characters. So if you want an introduction story watch the first anime.  Story 10/10 Even though this is a music anime, it give you more than music. It will give you a heartwarming story and how all the character bond with each other. The story is so simple, about a school idol group that want to shine. They want to win. All the problem here is just a simple thing, but the pace is something. This anime will take us through the journey of how beautiful a friendship is. I just can't describe how wonderful it is. Beside from the story, they also got the comedy too. Usually first half of the episode is filled with a little bit of story and full of comedy. And the second half is vice versa.  Art 10/10 The art here is normal for an anime. Not the worst nor the best, just average. Its colorful and bright, which is good because this anime is mostly positive and happy. Also we can feel that they lived in seashore, because the atmosphere is really good. The background also give the same thing, its really beautiful and fit with the story. What i really love from this anime art is the fact that every characters design fit their personality really well.  Sound 10/10 All the VA here is doing a really great jobs, especially the 9 main characters VA. They are not only doing the VA, but the OP and ED song too. Heck, they even have an idol group in real life which we can see them live singing on stage. They also release a lot of song, you can listen to them in your favourite music platform. Me too sometimes enjoy their song while doing homework or when playing some games. VA talk aside, we also have the great BGM. The BGM is not always there. But when it come, you can clearly hear them and enjoy them. Fit really well with the situation.  Character 10/10 The fact that they can made 9 MC and make their personality different is already a big thumbs up. Like i said above. This anime is an in-depth story about the girls here. The only one that changing here is that they are more mature than before, i guess. They all have their own special episode and i really like it. Because we know more about their personality and all. They solve their problem more seriously as we progress through the anime. We can see all the girls here grew up. While yes they are now more mature and serious, they still have the silly side on them. Every episode start with a quick summary of the last episode. And the one that narrator it is the MC. Really, just watch the anime and you can see why i give their characters a 10 out of 10.  Enjoyment 10/10 I really really love this series. Its not only give me a show to watch but they also motivate me. I'm also enjoying all of their content from the anime, game, song, even the seiyuu livestream. I wish that someday i can see their live show. This series is so special for me, i'll definitely rewatch this in near future with dub. If you like the kind of anime that gives you a spirit to continue your life, feel free to watch this. It is helped me a lot during this hard time.  Thats all i can say about the anime. I really don't have a word to describe how amazing this anime is. You should really watch it yourself. They also have a game called LLSIFAS, in there you can read more of their stories if the anime doesn't enough for you to consume. The last thing i wanna say is thank you for reading my review.;Recommended
5;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;9;"0 to 1,1 to 100...  Love Live Sunshine's 2nd Season by the by gives us the conclusion to Aquors journey to the Love Live stage with all the hijinks and heartbreak all under the banner of fixing the mistakes of the original Love Live series and doing it well.  LA first thought that Sunshine's spinoff series was nothing but a pale imitation and meta joke to the original series, however by this second season, this season utterly changed what LA thought of Aquors and their goal.  The second season left off from the first, but this time more character development from the characters that ""kinda"" needed it. Let's start off with Dia essentially getting way more screentime and meme worthy scenes than ever before making her LA's second favorite character by the end of it. Riko and Yohane got a joint character development together and though LA liked Riko and Yohane's friendship and everything, their development was slightly off executed in terms of themes, but nonetheless Yohane continued to be LA's favorite character even through it all. Now the more interesting character developments came from RUBY of all people as well as their rival Saint Snow's Ria Kazuno. This is one of the first things LA noticed Sunshine's second season did better than the original series, that of showing that even rival idols have their own problems of their own in comparison to aRISE who were already famous and popular and knows how to solve everything. Together with Ruby, we get some great double sister sibling character development from Dia, Ruby, Ria and her older sister Seira at the same time. Lastly would be Chika herself and how she develops as both a leader and how she handles everything and trying to be the best to save her school.  -sigh- and even the second season won't give You a PROPER CHARACTER FOCUSED EPISODE...  Sunshine's 2nd season for LA at least showed that it wasn't trying to be a pale imitation of the original, this time, it was gonna fix the mistakes of the original.  From the aforementioned rivals being looked at a different light to the finale and eventual change of goal that Aqours goes through was a welcoming change even if this second season by in large was going at a slightly slower pace but the same flavour and personality it always had in the first season.  The animation done once again by Sunrise was typically of great quality, from the shiny character designs and beautiful backgrounds. The concert scenes by in large though it has Love lIve's typical CGI, like in the first season, it looked polished for the most part in terms of CGI, but the choreography and backgroundings for some of the concerts were GORGEOUS to look at some times. Seriously this might have been Sunrise trying to outdo themselves in the animation department.  In terms of voice acting, it was pretty much the same from the first season, with some highlights of Ai Furihata getting some limelight as Ruby to Aika Kobayashi doing her chunni thing as Yohane. However for LA, the best voice actor goes to Dia's voice actor, Arisa Komiya. Nonetheless the same old voice cast, but for LA, they honed in their character even more this season.  Sunshine's second season because of how it dealt with Aqours' problem head on with a few hijinks here and there, it was serious for the most part as to what kinds of leaps and bounds, constant trials and tribulations Aqours went through to the point, you can't help but root for these underdogs and maybe even make them want to win Love Live! after everything they have been through.  If Love Live Sunshine's 2nd Season did anything for it's finale was give a fulfilling conclusion that we all wanted and Sunshine gave it to us in spades. Yes something this second season outdid or something the original series never did give us was ""closure"". From giving us what the 9 members of Aqours is gonna do in the future to resolving all plot threads, making us root for these character and maybe Aqours might win and giving us actual closure on what happens to Aqours and the school, something not even the Love Live Movie or the original's second season never did.  From pale imitation of the original, to fixing the mistakes and improving of the original series' formula, Sunshine's Second Season was a great sendoff to the series with no loose plot threads, giving us characters to root for, character development *cough* cept You, seriously no You episode C'MON *cough* that help flesh out the majority of Aqours all under the typical Love Live personality and spunk it had in the original series.  Aqours really did shine by the end of it all...";Recommended
6;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;psyart;https://myanimelist.net/profile/psyart;9;The second season of Sunshine is truly something. In one way, it's absurd, because it just isn't real to have students be, for example, so loving and passionate for their school.. all the time. In another way, absolutely fantastic. Sunrise have done it again with a charming second season that I think gave me even more than expected, warmer & lingering feelings for Aqours. This might be my favorite LL entry.  There's not much to the plot-line in this season, very similar to the first series. Second Love Live is coming around, there are concerns about the 3rd years' graduation and what Aqours should do after, some more funny sequences and drama, though what Sunshine excels in is portraying the connection between Aqours better, gracing the fans with a rewarding experience and all the more feelings towards Aqours this time around and the whole series and the amount of drama is being kept at bay, not bland & not exaggerated at times at any point.  The artstyle is much better this time around, even the CGI. It didn't feel like a distraction and if you're particularly into idol stuff and cute girls singing and dancing you'll find this to be pretty fun to see actually.  The main girls and also Saint Snow have also gotten their well-deserved development and even though there isn't widely much of it, it's still a lot better and satisfying compared to what felt like a rush and rocky start in the first season. There's all the more reason to like & care for the girls.  The soundtrack of Love Live never decreases in quality. The music is awesome to listen to and the better CGI comes off as an enhancement to the experience. I find myself listening to MY Mai☆TONIGHT and Awaken the power often though since those tracks in particular are some that are of more appeal to my taste.  I don't know what to expect from the movie or even the future series, if there ever ends up being one again. Overall, Love Live is an entertaining franchise that's surely to get you in your feelings which depends on whether you enjoy a show like this or not in the first place. It has been an amazing run and i'm sure the movie's gonna be too.;Recommended

8;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;shoui2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shoui2;10;"Love Live! (ラブライブ！) is an absolute masterpiece of a series. The masters of otaku anime, Sunrise, makers of Gintama and this very series Love Live!, have truly perfected the formula of making an anime that fits the needs of an otaku, perfectly, to every last inch with no pieces missing. The characters, the things that are said (I know Japanese and watched this series without subtitles), the OST, the art, everything combines to together to make one solid anime. For the uninitiated, Love Live! is made as a 完全男性向けアニメ (Anime made entirely for males). There is no ecchi but there is also 0 male characters.  Even though I say all this, and even though Love Live! is OBVIOUSLY in a league of its own, haters are gonna hate, though.  ""What about the story bro?!""  ""Love Live! ain't got story!""  Who cares. Anime that you don't need to use your head or think to enjoy it is very important. This anime doesn't *need* a story. It is made for maximum rewatchability. The point is, you forget the ""plot"" that the anime brings forth. And you are infinitely rewatch the show to your heart's content. There are VERY FEW anime that provide this level of watchability, and VERY FEW anime where you can mindlessly watch it and think its the best thing in the world.  奇跡だ！奇跡を起こしたんだ…私たちは。This very show is a 奇跡。A line repeated over and over again. 奇跡。輝きたい。These very lines describe the anime very well. 奇跡だよ！";Recommended

Sunshine!! 2nd Season;AzusaNakanoLover;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AzusaNakanoLover;9;When I comes to the Love Live franchcise, all of them are pretty consistent however I feel that Love Live! Sunshine!! Stands out among them.  The story although follows roughly along the same line as LLSIP but I think it benefits it rather than ruins it. Since the stories paralell each other for most of the show but Aqours not seeing the support that µ's got. It talk chika and the others to, be themselves and that is the message that this anime conveys and it does it extremely well.  The art is good, and the CGI looked way better than past installments, however, nothing to brag about  The music has increased significantly with more consistent library of songs making me want to dive into every song the group has put out.  Characters who didn't get their deserved development, definitly got it this time around, Ria from saint snow has a character I didn't like in the first season as she came off cold and ignorant. However I completely went 180 on my opinion when I watch her character develop. It may not be perfect but it was definitly an improvement from the first season  Overall Love Live! does it again, Giving us an amazing group to watch the journey of!;Recommended
10;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;captjoe213;https://myanimelist.net/profile/captjoe213;8;Robert's Too Late Reviews back in action! Today's pertinent information includes the fact I'm working the dubbed version, and that I'm going on the premise that you are familiar with season one of Love Live! Sunshine!! I mean, if you're not, why start in the middle of the second season right? The short of it is that I found that this season the Aqours girls find their legs and really pull off a great tale. There is tension and drama and not everything goes the way one would expect, so I wholeheartedly recommend watching if you liked Sunshine!! season 1 or even if you were a little iffy on it. This season makes the girls shine. Let's break it down like a backup dancer on stage.  Of note, there will be some spoilers in this review, especially relating to the content of the previous season. I will try to keep it at a minimum but some things have to be covered to make sense.  Story: 9 In the opening we find out that not only did the girls NOT win Love Live! but they didn't even make the regional qualifiers. Not only that, but they were only able to drum up about 10 prospective students. This point is kind of a victory for them, as they wanted to change the zero into a one, and they did so, but it was nowhere near enough to save the school from the impending closing. So the small goal was met, though it didn't affect the overall dire situation, and of course the girls didn't just blast through Love Live! like it was nothing. There's a strong hint of grounding for most of this season. This is much less about winning the moon and stars, and much more about doing their personal best (rebwestey as Ruby might say).  So the issues they are facing are the same as season 1, firstly that they need to get more prospective students, and secondly that they want to achieve their dream of playing at, and winning, the Love Live! competition. Toss in the mix the antagonists from the previous season and the sudden twist their relationship with Aqours takes, and there's some compelling viewing. I felt like we really got to know the girls better this time around as their personalities shined through. Dia is still bitchy, but a softness is brought out in her. Mari is still overly optimistic but finds herself forced to face reality and come down out of the clouds. Each of the girls seemed to have moments like this.  I know in the season 1 review I declared my love for the girls of Muse, but this second season of Sunshine!! really ranks up there with the original set. In fact I think the cast is better presented and explored than in the Muse seasons. I don't remember knowing much about the shy girl in Muse, but I do feel like I know Ruby or You, or even Hanamaru whereas in Muse there was shy girl, cat girl, so forth. The interaction and chemistry in the show seems to be at a peak in this season. For this reason alone, I feel the show is worth viewing.  The original questions remain: will Aqours save their school? Will they win the Love Live! competition? Some of the answers might just surprise you. I was somewhat shocked to learn that not everything turns up roses for these girls, but that's okay, because by going against the expectations of the genre and its ubiquitous 'happy endings' they really caught my attention, and I was in a position of not being sure on what would and what wouldn't happen. This gives the show an edge to it, one that heightens the drama somewhat.  Art: 9 The girls still look good. I really adore the artwork on all of the Love Live! series. The distractions from last season about comparing Aqours to Muse have been obliterated as the girls' personalities helps keep everyone's appearances from being cookie cutters of Muse's girls, as I first had trouble with last season. The detail is superb, the girls are recognizable whether their in their school uniforms, workout clothes, or idol costumes. The idol costumes themselves are interesting and varied, and not overly busy. The art is very cutesy and colorful, befitting the tone and theme of the series. Love it!  Sound: 9 The opening and closing themes are as 'pop music' as they come, but they work and are a lot of fun. I didn't like the themes as well as I did Muse's, but they stand strong on their own. The voice acting is varied and interesting, ranging from a high pitched younger girl to a deep, mature sounding senior. The 'leader' of the group has a bright and bubbly voice, and the oddball comedic relief retains her dramatic flair. All the things I wrote in the review of season 1 of Sunshine!! apply. No changes in voice actors that I heard, and they all performed very well. I do believe Mari uses more Italian in this season than the last but the story explains that by pointing out she is moving to Italy for college after graduation. Helps to practice the language I guess.  If I had to give a few complaints, it would be Ruby the high pitched first year's voice, as it strayed near annoying at times, and her occasional flinging around of the term 'rubwestey' or whatever. She doesn't do this often, so it's not a huge thing. The other complaint would be that Mari is a little too bright and cheery sounding sometimes, which I could see getting on people's nerves. I didn't even mind Hanamaru and her continuing to say 'zura' after nearly every line.  There's a fair bit of songs performed and while they all kind of mesh into one if you're not huge on that music scene, they all sounded really good and had a toe tapping beat. They might not have been memorable by themselves, but they also weren't 'oh dear god make it stop' bad either.  Character: 8 The show shines in the characters as they are more fleshed out through this season. We see less 'movement' or growth, such as Mari's slapping Kanan in season 1, or Dia's whole overall attitude. But what we do see is that the girls hold very firm to the personas they presented in the first season. As I said there is a little growth, such as Dia softening a little, but for the most part we get the girls as they are, and their character traits seem to be far more solid than last season. They've all found their place and niche, and work all the better for it.  Each girl seems to get a good deal of screen time, and I didn't ever feel like they were leaving a girl out in the cold. Muse sometimes made me think the freshmen (shy girl and cat girl) were kind of skipped over, but Sunshine!! doesn't feature that. Every girl has their own well defined motivation, their defined personalities, and a stable overall interaction between all of them.  Enjoyment: 8 I found that I liked season 2 better than season one, even though there are some somber moments to be had, especially towards the end of the series. Because of the results of season 1's actions, I felt there was no guarantee on exactly what the girls were going to achieve, which helped pique my interest instead of just watching the girls sit back and basically conquer the world. The tension that maybe, just maybe, they wouldn't make all their goals held my attention.  The ending episode is pretty grand, and I really enjoyed it. It did well in wrapping up everyone's storyline in relation to the events of the show, and gives the emotional release that I enjoy. And I'm hard to please with endings!  Best Girl: Yoshiko a.k.a 'Yohane' once again. She's still up to her antics and silliness, though there are moments even she is scared, frustrated or upset. She's still hilarious though, and I love her for it.  I had a great time with the entire Love Live! series, so if you are into idol anime at all, then I think not only is Sunshine!! season 2 great, but the entire series is worth watching. Love Live! outclasses in many ways other shows such as the Idolmaster series, and comes close to standing equal to K-On, though I'd say K-On is less idol, more slice of life. Either way, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a great idol anime, and a lot of fun. Come, descend with me my little demons and watch this series!;Recommended
11;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;peh-soh-nah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/peh-soh-nah;7;"This show isn't for everyone. If you are annoyed by cheesy moments, lots of emotional and melodramatic moments, your probably not gonna like the show. But for me, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Sure it's cheesy, but it's overflowing with charm.  Story: Story is pretty ok. I really didn't like the ""saving the school"" plot of the last season but this season actually made it me care more about it without having the plot take up almost every episode. A step in the right direction but I still would've preferred it not be so plot-heavy  Art: The normal 2D art is acceptable but the CG has really made steps forward. The performances look great and a lot less distractingly cheap compared to LL: SIF  Sound: This is completely subjective but I really love Aqours' music. Like last time, every couple of episodes has an insert song and I really liked all of them. I definitely recommend the show to people who like their music if you haven't seen it already. The actual OST in the background is ok too.  Character: Characters get more moments and when they do, the show really shines. The best episodes in my opinion is when they focus on one or two characters with little plot, just letting them all do their thing. Though one issue I have that might annoy people is that sometimes when characters aren't in the spotlight they kind of resort to using their catchphrases a lot. It's like the writers wanted to recreate the success of nico nico nii but overdid it by a longshot. Also, some characters don't get as much screentime as others like You and Kanan.  Overall, this show is really flawed but something about it is really charming and light-hearted. I feel like the people I'd most recommend this to are people who like Slice of Life, definitely people who like idol and musical shows, and people who liked the original Love Live! (though which one they like better is up to the individual, I personally enjoyed this more despite the flaws). Watch Season 1 before this, its pretty good and it, and the show in general seemed to get better as it went on. This show is still going in my favs because, I'm biased to liking the music, and it definitely made me feel something in the end and get me really attached to the characters despite the flaws. Hoping the movie delivers.  TL;DR Yoshiko is best girl, puppet show is best episode in the whole franchise, Love Live memes are top tier, and enjoy idol hell!";Recommended
12;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;Antimeta;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Antimeta;8;"SPOILER FREE  That was the Rubesty, Zura!  Really though, Love Live Sunshine! has been really good. I'll be the first to say that the original grasped me more (as I'm a HUGE fan), but this was still amazing nonetheless! Love Live Sunshine has been a treat, full of smiles, songs as good as the original and improved CGI.  If you're a Love Live fan watch this season for sure, if you haven't seen it before, be sure to watch the original first i'd say (but this isn't a bad start either).  Won't bore you anymore with my fan-girling, now for the more analytic stuff;  Story: 8  Originally this score was lower because it seemed as though the plot was a carbon copy of the original. Then the added a slight twist (that I won't reveal to keep it spoiler free) that still had the similarities in the plots being more than the differences. But what won me over wasn't these little differences, it was the more meaningful interactions (such as with other idol groups) in the story that built on the plot. Sure the plot is similar to the first series, but that's hard to avoid when the whole basis is of ""school girls becoming idols and trying to win love live"". Slightly repetitive at this but a fun, and surprisingly emotional, story, that improved a lot from season 1 to season 2.  Art: 9  THE CGI LOOKS GREAT! Really happy to see these improvements as it now makes the performance scenes tonnes more enjoyable. Nice and easy on the eye, can't complain really.  Sound: 9  I'll be the first to say that some of the songs in season 2 have topped those of the previous season and the original. Aqours have great voices and the songs they sing all come together really well. Not quite Snow Halation good, but great in there own right.  Characters: 8  So the approach taken was, of course, to make characters that somewhat resemble someone from the original Love Live series. This approach was pretty weak in the first season as it felt like redoing what had been done. However this season, during the character development episodes we see our characters grow to be unique. These episodes really saved the day for these characters, making them more lovable and personal. What really won me over however is the interactions between characters. The clear bond between the girls in each year. It really was pleasant seeing Kanan treat Mari like a princess, or Hanamaru and Ruby bonding (or just seeing Hanamaru is general).  Enjoyment: 9  When watching this season, I didn't sit and binge like I do many other anime series. Instead I'd watch a couple at a time, saving the smiles and purity of Love Live for when I needed it. This season will make you laugh, smile and maybe even cry ( I know I did once). Could, and will, happily watch this season again in the future. Only reason it isn't a 10 is because it didn't have that wow factor that glues your eyes to the screen.  Overall: 8.5  How sad that I can't give this a higher score.. but it's just not the same. That said Love Live Sunshine! season 2 is another great season, with really pleasant episodes for the individual characters. The characters' growth as individuals, and as a group, sure makes it things enjoyable and helps make the plot shine. Love Live Sunshine! found it's radiance from my perspective and I would recommend watching this season to the end.";Recommended
13;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;AllLovesBlazing;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AllLovesBlazing;8;I want to write my impressions of Love Live Sunshine!! season 2 but don't feel like I have that much to say so I will just list what is on my mind.  In season one the characters, while enjoyable, felt like they relied too much on their gimmicks and would fall apart in a longer series. This season address that concern and actualizes many of the characters that felt too gimmicky, especially Ruby and Dia whose relationship is focused on in a later episode. Basically the gimmicks are already established, and still used, but this season spends more time making each girl feel like a real person, which is nice.  There was a great improvement in the musical performances in this season compared to the first with very good looking cg dances that were choreographed quite well. I particularly liked Miracle Wave which is performed at the end of episode 6. I don't know if they are using completely different software or if they just got better at the technique but all of the cg in the dances looks noticeably better.  The overall positive, emotional and passionate feel of Love Live Sunshine!! driven by Chika's desire to shine is carried by the entire cast of girls in this season so it feels motivating to watch. This season feels like the goal is for Aqours to make their mark on the world and to share their community, who throughout the seasons supports them in their performances for the Love Love. It's actually really endearing to se all fo the Uranohoshi girls supporting Aqours along with the girl's families.  Lastly, setting aside the seriousness this season continues to deliver on what I believe Sunshine season one did even better than the original Love Live, and that is having the girls engage in cute meaningless nonsense with all of their silly personalities. I think that is what Love Live as a series does best and it's always enjoyable to watch.  If you liked any of Love Live I would highly recommend going ahead and watching this season as it may be my favorite of all of them.;Recommended
14;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;brandotendie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brandotendie;8;"“You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.”  -Yoshihiro Togashi, Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 32  To bear dignity in defeat is a common mark of maturity, of respect. But to wholeheartedly accept that defeat, internalizing all of the lessons and experiencing of it, using it as a catalyst for a leap forward into your prospective future?  That's an entire level entirely, and that theme is heavily explored throughout every episode of Sunshine's 2nd season run.  As opposed to the first season, I felt that this season was less about Aqours finding themselves or working to become their very best, the entire season instead felt much more introspective, like a rebuild of efforts lost.  More importantly, the season really focused on how Chika and crew took every loss along the way, and turned it into a positive force.  Just like in season 1, it's heartbreaking to see their efforts go completely to waste. They completely failed to even come close to winning Love Live in the last season, and in this season, it's revealed from the first few episodes that their main goal in becoming idols in the first place isn't going to become a reality.  To put it simply, Aqours lost.  In contrast to Muse, I've commented that the starkest difference is that a big focus is put on how much Aqours grinds out of the ditch with their efforts. They struggle, they suffer, they grind harder than any of the girls in Muse do in those first two seasons.  So to see all of those efforts flushed down the toilet should be completely devastating, reflecting the first time they encounter defeat in the first season.  But that's where the season won for me. Despite some imbalance of its characterizations, its over the top humor (it goes full slapstick at some points, much worse than any of the previous seasons), and its heavier moments, this second season absolutely triumphs in its manifestation of its themes.  Of moving forward, no matter what, of lifting your head up no matter how much life just takes a FAT shit on you, of fighting towards your ""shine"" after you're crushed by darkness, after realizing you don't even KNOW what your ""shine"" is.  Despite its flaws, the season won me over with just how earnest it is in its delivery of its broad, larger than life strokes. It's not an approach that many can appreciate, and I can see why.  Characterization at some points is less refined and comparatively dull to the first season, and yes, pales in comparison to the seasons of the original seasons. But to that I counter that the growth and characterization of the group as a WHOLE is unrivaled. I did not expect things to turn out this way, for all of Aqours efforts to have been for nothing.  But as Chika realizes in the end of the show, was it all for nothing? Or were the experiences and relationships she forged along the way the true ""shine"" she set forward to find in the first place?  It's a very basic theme, sure, but Love Live has a surefire way of encapsulating larger than life themes, and injecting pure wholesome passion into my veins like nothing else, and for that, Sunshine triumphs.";Recommended
15;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;NecokeNii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NecokeNii;7;"I always knew about this franchise through memes and gifs, so two or three months ago, I decided to binge the whole series. Sunshine season one was a MASTERPIECE, I felt like that's how you should end a first season. I was so excited I binged the second season, but around the halfway point, the whole the school is closing down plot didn't really phase me anymore.  What I loved about the original series was I got a sense of WHY the girls loved their school to death and what saving it meant to them. However with the second season of sunshine, the only reason I could see everyone wanting to save the school was because they all met there. Now that's not a bad reason why, but since the girls always hanged out together and had a good amount of chances to save the school, I didn't get why they were so upset like they didn't make any progress or do anything at all. With mari, dia and kanan, I totally get why they felt so bad they couldn't save the school, they had the authority and some influence in the school, but for the first and second years, they could still ALL go to school together.  I love yohane and riko the most but what uspet me was instead of yohane actually improving as a character she remained the same. I expected once she talked to riko about why she had her complex and continues to use it, she'd either stop doing it as much or find some compromise with it but instead she just embraced it more for some odd reason. It felt like some characters had some development while others remained the same, it only bugged me because we had literally a whole segment where everyone said how being an idol changed them.  Ever since I finished sunshine season two, I've been hooked on the mobile game. Aquors has such good music, it always brightens my mood, my favorite song have to be zero to one, it really hits home. I really enjoyed season two of my new favorite franchise, but every time I think of the ending, I don't feel anything. I wanted to feel sad and excited for the movie based on the final episode but I had more of an ""oh, it's over now? mkay"" moment instead. Sunshine was a bright and sunny day then all of a sudden it became party cloudy with a high chance of rain for me, season one was everything I wanted. Season two felt like it pulled on my heartstrings a little too much for my taste.";Recommended
16;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;red-tomato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/red-tomato;7;"This is my first review so a few notes: • Will contain LIGHT SPOILERS (unrelated to the main plot or indirect as much as possible) • I don’t know much shit about analytically reviewing a show so if it’s a BUU BUU DESU WA feel free to tell me. • Not every point I made came from me. I didn’t have a SHINY revalation to suddenly think of such ideas. This is a disclaimer, so to speak.  Got through the cringe? Well there’s more:  Love Live is [the only] one of those shows for me to have such mixed opinions of. Basically it is a regular cute-girls-doing-cute-things show but *WITH DRAMA*. Now explaining how I am attached to this franchise would be too long and too hard, so to summarize: It started as a somewhat guilty pleasure which then developed into something I unironically adore. So it wouldn’t be a surprise that when this season came out I stayed until midnight just to see the latest episode. It was a fun ride, but personal enjoyment alone doesn't make a series great.  STORY: From the beginning of ‘Love Live! Sunshine!!’ , Aqours had a goal –“ to shine”. With how the story plays out, I can say they did. They even shined brighter than their predecessor, μ's. The way the series was handled is an improvement over the original. How they did it is through focusing and expanding on plot points that were pretty much ‘extras’ in the original School Idol Project. That’s not the only thing though. The most notable improvement you can see in the story is the change in one major aspect of the show. This change is mostly the reason that differentiates it from the original. But for something that is the defining aspect of the show, it had dragged on for too long. It is special, just not when its repeatedly shoved into your face until the end.  Now I did say Aqours achieved their goal to shine, but not actually entirely. Aqours’s main goal is really to “find their OWN radiance.” This is the series’ biggest flaw. It stops at improvement. It doesn’t go for anything new. I can understand that it wouldn’t be Love Live if did do so, but the premise, setting and charcters were already enough for that. Yet they just had to copy the plot and only decided change some aspects to make it seem new. Let me tell you, being new and being different are two separate things. LLS just settled on being a twist from the original. Aqours may have shined brighter, but the radiance didn’t start from them.   ART: Being a popular franchise in Japan, you can expect this to be high-budget. So with the privilege of having high production value, does the art really deliver? Yes and No. It was used where it mattered, and it really shows in the final product – from the CG, backgrounds(which perfectly resemble their real-life counterparts) and even the characters themselves. Where it does fail though is when the scenes don’t “matter” enough—the comedy and slice of life moments. Basically, if the scene is meaningful or dramatic, it is a pleasure for the eyes. If not, its crappy to the point that even memes were made out of it.  SOUND: Probably the best thing about to come out of LLS 2 are the songs. It’s amazing when an OP and ED can add so much to the story itself. The OP, with a more serious tone, prepares you for what’s going to happen and the ED gives you the theme of the show with the feelings of the characters themselves. As for the insert songs, they are the culmination of the growth of Love Live as a franchise. Ever since SIP the songs were already diverging from the normal idol-type songs. It is only in this season of Love Live that the songs are so diverse while also, again, meaningful and adding to the narrative.  But if the OP, ED or insert songs are not your thing, there is always the soundtrack for the shows. This includes, but is not limited to: melodramatic piano, “ZURAAAAA”, and “Dakara, Yohane yo!” There is, sadly, a decrease in “Shiny!” and “Buu Buu Desu Wa!” however that is made up for by lots and lots of “PIGIII!1!!1!” and “Kagayaiteru” to ensure there is never a dull moment throughout the show.  CHARACTERS: It wouldn’t be Aqours without its members, and it wouldn’t be Love Live without character-specific episodes. Yes, the franchise still suffers from giving a certain character a certain episode in order to highlight her charm and to create “character development”. But how do they showcase a character exactly? It’s really simple, honestly. First, you got to think of a catchphrase or a pose for her. Second, you basically turn her into a living meme. And when its finally her time to take the spotlight; you create a new problem totally unrelated to her character, make a whole episode revolving around it to show ‘development’ , then not actually fixing it by the end…ok, maybe that last part was pointed towards a specific character [ I can’t help it if it’s one of my best girls , can I? ] For a serious answer though, Aqours both as a group and each individual member(for better or worse) have come far since the first season. Of course, the character-specific episode remains, but some of it did help to advance the plot. The main problem is actually how the characters’ screentimes were balanced. For a show which aimed to promote each and every single girl, it failed to do so. Some were given too much screentime while others were barely noticeable throughout the season. I mean, a scene where the main character is chasing a non-existent gift could better be used for her best friend who was only showing up when giving a salute.  THEME: This is something I personally want to add since it is also what gives Love Live! Sunshine!! its identity. This is something SIP lacked, or atleast didn’t give focus to. THIS is what allowed everything—story, music, character— to connect to the viewer. At least for me it did. Its best to watch and interpret yourself, but if I had to put it in a few words:  Step! ZERO to ONE  ENJOYMENT & VERDICT: As a fan, there is no way I wouldn’t enjoy it. Nothing else to say there. I love it regardless of my viewing experience and my opinions on it. It was a fun, Thrilling One Way ride from start until the end. A solid 98/100 for me.  As for my verdict on the series, all I can say is that it is an improvement. If you look at it as the successor to μ's, it would be an 8/10. If you look at it as a series in general, it is a 7/10. Why? The reason why LLS is good is because it gets compared to SIP. If you look at it as just Love Live! In general, flaws will definitely be seen.  So is it worth a watch? Despite me shitting on it, YES. It is a show full of WONDERFUL STORIES and wonderful characters. It has beautiful character design with a story that is actually given an ending within only 2 seasons. But most of all, its a fucking lovable cancer show. If you appreciate the show for what even if at times it is devoid of logic, you’re gonna have an enjoyable experience.  What are you waiting for? Hop on this HAPPY PARTY TRAIN of hype and enter Idol Hell.";Recommended
17;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;Kanudelgruber;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kanudelgruber;7;"Love Live: Sunshine is an okay series but a disappointing follow-up, and its main issue is that it's much too derivative of the original series. While watching, I couldn't help but think about all the things that could have been done to make this a much more interesting sequel.  There are many good things about this series, of course. Visually, it looks much better than the original. I also enjoyed the character moments very much, my favorite being those focused on Ruby and Dia. During the first season I was worried that the characters might be too gimmicky and shallow, but most of them developed pretty nicely in the second season. I even ended up having some empathy for Yoshiko, who started off as my least favorite.  The main problem with Sunshine, as stated before, is that it follows the formula set by the first series too closely, which results in a story that's much weaker than the original series. I would have enjoyed Sunshine much more if it focused more on the struggle of being recognized after the success of μ's instead of retreading the same ground for most of the series. Sunshine ends up feeling like a story with a beginning and end but not much of a middle, which deflates a lot of the impact at the end of the series. Once I got to the end, I wasn't really emotionally invested as much as I was wondering, ""Is this really it?"". It felt as if I had skipped over the entire process of getting there.  I'm also disappointed because this sets a precedent for future installments in this franchise. I would like to see Love Live become a more varied and interesting franchise, but Sunshine shows me that the show's creators are very hesitant to deviate from the formula set by the first series.  tl;dr: If you liked Love Live for the story, you won't like Sunshine very much. If you liked it for the character spotlight episodes, the music, or some other reason, you'll probably enjoy it.";Recommended
0;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;BanjoTheBear;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BanjoTheBear;5;"(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)  Each sunrise brings sunshine. But, eventually, that sunshine must give way to a sunset.  The same similarly goes for Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season, a metaphorical sunset for the school-idol group Aquors and their hard-fought journey. While it does not sing nearly as loudly or as proudly as its prequel, a few rays of hope sneak in nonetheless.  STORY  Sunshine 2 (as it will be nicknamed from here on out) picks up almost right after Sunshine 1. The group still has its sights set on saving their school, banding together anew to tackle the Love Live gauntlet again. Not as separate ladies but as a unified unit with a more-than-zero mentality.  Having addressed its predecessor and its influence – in a thematic sense no less – within the prior season, this season attempts to carve a name out for itself and nobody else. Indeed, mentions, references, or allusions to the famous Greek-lettered group are practically non-existent (if not missing entirely). In doing so, the show breaks away from that looming glare of “they aren’t like them” and moves towards a proper stance of “they aren’t like them.”  This subtle difference appears as Sunshine 2 basks in slice-of-life goodness. Several episodes aim to highlight the quirks and the challenges of the girls in a less dramatic manner, such as episode four with Dia wanting to grow closer with the younger members or episode five with the doggy dispute between Yoshino and Riko.  Not that the series has never had its fair share of this type of content. However, these events align much more with exploring these characters and their situations rather than going for introductions or resemblances (which its first season already did).  Key to the Love-Live formula, Sunshine 2 also incorporates those team-related aspects. They collaborate to write songs. They stick with each other during melancholic happenings. They go on a road trip that solidifies their fortitude (and defies the laws of physics). Chika, Riko, You, Yoshiko, Hanamaru, Ruby, Kanan, Dia, and Mari may be a bunch of individuals, but, when together as one, this season proves they are Aquors first and foremost.  This last season also champions the same atmosphere, making sure not to lose sight of its Love Live origins outright. The mood of the anime maintains that comedic angle as always, and the ultra-optimism in-between, while maybe overbearing at times, continues to lend itself well to an uplifting experience.  But the narrative overall is a downgrade. Where their beginning is mired with loss and difficulty, their ending here stands in stark contrast as a meteoric rise to the top ensues. Granted, the Love Live spectacle itself isn’t really the point of the story being told, especially in this instance where it represents a spiritual win for all involved. Still, a weakened thematic presence and this missing drama reduces impact in the story.  Sunshine 2 tries to make up for that easier rise with its increased focus on the threat of the school closing, but it doesn’t always come through. This dilemma can sometimes get lost amidst its other interpersonal scenes, and their vehement need to keep it around isn’t exactly quantified or justified besides the notion of memories and attachment. Traits the audience do not see much of let alone can relate to.  To its credit, though, the bittersweet direction is interesting, both because of this franchise’s inherent optimism and because it once again chooses to move away from those that came before it. Thus, despite those narrative troubles, Aquors’s journey concludes in solid-enough fashion.  ART & ANIMATION  The interim between this season and the previous season is negligible, so the artistic vision for this next iteration remains practically the same. So, to keep it short and sweet, this sameness is a welcome return to likable form.  The proof is in the performance. For instance, the character designs remain collectively cute yet individually distinct among the lot. Their musical attire takes on a colorful and charismatic look per usual. Choreography for their dances is still easy to follow (CG or otherwise). Increased actual animation highlight the fun in their actions. Expressions contort into hilarious responses.  Sunshine 2 fails to have its settings and backgrounds reach the same level as these other visual elements, but that’s perhaps expected since (to reiterate) the artistic direction has been carried over into this sequel season. That also means that it reaches the same level of strength as before, so it’s certainly not a major problem.  CHARACTERS  In Sunshine 1, establishing the characters meant exploring their reasons and their struggles before joining on as an official member. Here in Sunshine 2, the anime explores other conflicts surrounding the ladies, but it also has a much tougher time juggling them in conjunction with the plot.  A few characters certainly have their moments. Ruby receives a large amount of attention as her relationship with Dia, her older sister, becomes a point of contention regarding maturity and “moving on” later in the season. The anime steps it up another level when it draws parallels between them and the sister duo of Saint Snow. And Chika herself earns some time as the prospect of failure challenges her determination and her resolve (in flip-like motion) not only for the sake of the rest of Aquors but also for her own sake, too.  Yet some characters seem woefully left out: Hanamaru, You, and Mari come to mind first. Phrasing it obtusely, they’re there but not there. Hanamaru seems reserved for comedic relief only. You sticks with mostly a supportive role. And Mari exists as the arbiter of the closing school and not much else. Arguably speaking, these characters had their problems already taken care of in Sunshine 1, but so did everyone, so it feels odd to leave a sizable chunk of the cast on the sidelines.  Sunshine 2 gets back on track when it enlarges the scope from their singular characters to the intrateam dynamic. For example, third-years Mari, Kanan, and Dia (Dia, as can be gleaned from this analysis, appears to be around the most) acknowledge their separation after graduation but likewise know that, at least in their hearts, they’ll be together forever.  More generally, they rally around each other as a group, solidifying their camaraderie as their shared reams become a reality. It happens a lot. Back in episode three, they initially split up to take care of two back-to-back events but eventually realize that their strength derives from their collective. Even the smaller pillow-fight scene before the big night in episode twelve helps to highlight the friendships they have fostered over the course of their whole adventure.  Yet other dynamics hit speedbumps as well. Chika and Riko’s relationship, despite being so vital in the first season, fizzles out to some extent. And, despite being around one another for so long now, the ladies rarely cross party lines, sticking with their year’s internal group for the most part rather than crossing over, missing out on jokes and possible bonds as a result.  In the end, Sunshine 2 simply doesn’t have as much to say about Aquors. Be it because of the strife they already went through last season or this season’s failure to really include everyone in the festivities, it leaves the nine girls in a precarious position.  MUSIC & SOUND  Per usual, the various parts of the audio within a music-centric anime like Sunshine 2 are held to a slightly higher standard. Unfortunately, this season succumbs to a middling rendition once again.  The opening track, “Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo”, has a similarly grand feel as last time, using bells, drums, pianos, and other brass instruments. But the first half or so of the song misses out on catchiness and intrigue as the buildup meanders. However, the second half swoops in with tons of passion as the vocals soar with that mandatory optimism.  As for “Yuuki wa Doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!”, this new ending track follows suit as well in a negative fashion. It’s an okay track with more of a fantastical feel, a neat little lyrical “reverb” part near the end, and many different takes done by different members of the cast. Sadly, though, okay just doesn’t cut it.  Especially so when the insert songs of Sunshine 2, at least a couple of them, demonstrate maturity and prowess in both the song writing and the musicality. A special shout-out goes to one such song: “Awaken the power”. While ironically not an exclusively Aquors song, it stands as one of the best the whole franchise has put together thanks to its changes in pacing, instrumentation, and vocal delivery.  Moving on, the original soundtrack also starts to grow on the listener. It was already pretty swell, but its main motif and poignant arrangement, found throughout several tracks, elicits even more emotion, either because the series is coming to a close itself or it has been lightly patting the audience on the back for the past twelve (twenty-four in total) episodes now.  And the voice-acting performances remain passable in execution. The women behind Aquors sound more comfortable in their roles when compared to the first season, and their experience in talking and singing moves ahead a bit. Again, while nothing special, their relative newbie status and their commitment to these quirky personalities deserves some props within Sunshine 2 for sure.  ENJOYMENT  I greatly liked the first season, so I selfishly expected the same here. It didn’t quite reach that same level of entertainment, but I can’t lie and say I didn’t find myself laughing or smiling or cheering during its run.  My favorite characters Yoshiko and Hanamaru were in full force with their silliness and their reactions. Sometimes they would team up for duo hilarity, and I liked them all the better for it. Kanan, one of my other favorites, wasn’t as prominent, but her “hug” line as she got scared of the dark was too cute to forget.  Of course, I still liked the rest of the cast as well. Riko dealing with her fears. Ruby and her “Rubesty!” catchphrase. Mari’s frequent English usage. You with her saluting as always. And Chika leading with happiness aplenty. Maybe oversaturation occurs with their signature jokes, such as Dia’s “wrong-answer” buzzing and definitely Yoshiko’s “It’s Yohane!” response. Nonetheless, they were all once again a likable troupe of idols who not only tried to the best of their ability but also created a heartwarming environment whatever they happened to be doing.  Lastly, the performances were often a spectacle as always. The meanings behind them and the concert-esque structure. So many colors and formations. So much winking and hand flourishing. Emotions for days. I’m a huge metalhead (e.g., black metal, death metal, and each subgenre therein), but I found myself grabbed by their setpieces for the last time.  And so, this chapter of the franchise concludes (save for whatever other films and song-releases they have on the horizon; announced or otherwise). It hasn’t been the most perfect or sensational follow-up to a beloved series, but this second season – and indeed this entire second iteration – has been a respectable outing regardless. I look forward to seeing where the (inevitable?) third iteration goes next.  Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season waves goodbye to Aquors but gives them a solid farewell tribute in the process. While most aspects of this season do not live up to the previous prequel, its unconventional plot direction, its nice production values, and its strong sense of entertainment make up for some of the woes in its character writing. But no worries. There’s always another sunrise right around the corner.  SUMMARY  Story: Fine, a bittersweet ending, slice-of-life segments, and the focus on group activities compete against missing narrative nuance and weak drama  Art & Animation: Good, following the footsteps of its immediate ancestor, the visuals alight with cool choreography for the dances, noticeable movement, and cute designs  Characters: Bad, while specific characters and dynamics vouch for some of the ladies, the cast members have a hard time either being relevant or establishing relationships for most of this finale  Music & Sound: Fine, the OP and the ED are another step down when compared to before, but the insert songs, the OST, and the VA performances do not go the same way without a fight  Enjoyment: Good, hilarious still, engaging in its routines, and a respectable sendoff of this second tale  Final Score: 5/10";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;Herr_Meister;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Herr_Meister;5;"So a second season of Aqours girls, I don't think it was that good. It had potential to be better, I liked the first season of Aqours, but I think I'm through with Love Live anime now. I had trouble finishing this season because it was so cringy and cheesy. At times I wanted to choke Chika because she was so irritating. Her constant babbling about mysterious shine of school idols was just bullsh*t to be honest. You love school idols, I get it, you want to shine like them ""kira kira blah blah blah"". Why that stuff was almost in every episode, I've had enough. Things like this and absurd overdone symbolic scenes like Flying van were so cringe-worthy, yes it's shiny, it's a joke and friendship is magic I get it. Ok that last one was from different franchise... my mistake.  Sure Love Live has always been about cute girls doing cute things with unnecessary drama. Maybe it was just that my personal quota of shiny school idols was filled and there was nothing wrong with this season of Love Live. But I think that style was also changed a bit. It was too damn serious at times, somehow slow and boring and jokes were not that great either. Stories were boring but overly dramatic making them extremely cheesy and awkward. Many times they also lacked common sense making plot holes shine brighter than school idols.  Sure there were good things as well. Loved the episode with the dog, sure it was a filler but it actually developed relationship of Yoshiko and Riko, or Yohane and Riri. Saint Snow episodes also developed Ruby a bit and I like her a bit more now, same with Saint Snow that actually developed far more than Aqours did during the entirety of two seasons. I didn't care about them in the first season but now they were more interesting than the main idol group for me. Something actually happened for them and they got over it.  Dia, my favorite, was also developed a bit, but in direction that I didn't like that much, she is now some sort of meme factory like Mari or Yoshiko/Yohane- Bzzzt- that's not the way to go.  I honestly didn't like this ""bzzzt""- thing, it was not needed, it reduced Dia to one meme-character. She was actually a good character, responsible, proud and bit of a perfectionist type, loving but strict big sister, president of student council, traditional but little too uptight. Sure she was a sort of the joke in the first season too, her secret love for school idols was not the thing in the game etc., but this ""Bzzzt""- thing feels like she was replaced with a meme button this season.  Aqours had so much potential, but I feel like this season failed to use it to make characters more interesting. I play Love Live SIF game and I feel like most characters are much better in the game- they are deeper and more interesting than their anime versions that tells a lot since they mainly just say same things when you tap them. And you still learn to love them more.  Story 5: Very poor continuation for Aqours. Spoiler: they win Love Live.... which happens offscreen (because they think you are more interested in Chika's thoughts obviously, too bad they are boring) Spoiler 2: Their school is still not going to be saved. This was actually a good thing, it would've been useless repetition of the same plot if the school would've been saved by school idols again. But the way this plot point is done is not really good. Resolution takes so long and all that angst for the loss of Uranohoshi school is taken so far I don't care anymore. Yeah it's sad. Let's mourn it a few episodes more it's not boring at all. Bzzzt wrong answer it IS boring.  Art 8: This anime sure looks good, visuals for the songs and all, that is not an issue.  Sound 8: This is not an issue either. Songs and voice acting are strong points. Some VA:s in Aqours are very talented. I especially want to praise Aika Kobayashi, for her voice work as Yoshiko and Yohane. She has these two different voices and she uses them so well. No problems with singing or acting, not complaining about that. This is still good and some songs are my favorites like My Mai Tonight.  Characters 5 : Aqours cast is perhaps even better than Muse in some ways, but this season didn't use it well. We mostly focus on Chika (sighs), a bit on Kurosawa sisters, some Riko and some Yoshiko. Mari does some things as well as Kanan but I don't remember anything special about them- they just are there. Same with Hanamaru, she is there and her home at the temple is shown, but I don't remember any focus being on her. I think that most seriously neglected character is You who is on the background but completely forgotten. Her jealousy of Chika and Riko was the source of drama in the first season but now that is dropped and instead there is useless drama between Chika and school, Chika and School idols, Chika and shining, Chika and mikan oranges. Yuri-baiting has been the best things in this show to be honest so this lack of it this season is very disappointing. We have that one dog episode that makes Yohariko (or Yohariri?) partially canon though. I am not expecting official material to go far with yuri-aspect in show like this, it is left for fans to speculate and find their own shippings (if that is your thing), but I feel like this season was especially boring for those expecting even some girly bonding as there was a lot of that during the first season.  We get to see some (pure) sisterly love with Ruby and Leah/Ria of Saint Snow wanting to show to their big sisters that they manage alone as well. That was actually quite touching and those episodes along with the Yohariri dog-episode were only ones that were somewhat entertaining for me.  Character development is minimal and mostly non-existent. Chika has to accept that school is going to be closed and that is so very very hard- so hard that she seriously expects people to enlist to their school in the middle of the night minutes before deadline. Hope is good thing to have for sure, but seriously that is pathetic lack of rationality even from this human-shaped mikan orange. Similar plot-holes are numerous this season. Like the episode in which they have to use mikan orange picking monorail (yay- mikan oranges- that is what Chika-chan has instead of personality or brain) to get in to their live show. And we have seen Chika's family has a van and yet no one even considers the possibility of using it.... no we have use unconventional method of transportation because mikan oranges in everyone's mouth make better memes.  Enjoyment 3: This anime was agony to watch at times. Constant face palms made my face (and palms) hurt.  Overall 5: Mediocre continuation for pretty promising first season. Mikan oranges were bitter and all that Chika's constant shining was so radioactive I fear I got the cancer. Not even Yohane could save me from this School Idol Hell.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;Yuni;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yuni;4;"*DISCLAIMER: A very unorganized and SOMEWHAT SPOILERY ""review"" of Sunshine s2 which might ruin your viewing experience, so I'll just say ""you're welcome"" in advance for saving your time.  The Love Live franchise has a knack for being the defier of expectations. Those who go into the series expecting nothing but cancer usually end up taking something positive from the experience. Those who go in expecting happy rainbows and sunshine only get slapped in the face with the cold reality that is School Idol Hell. Love Live Sunshine s2 is no exception to this rule, for what was set up to be potentially the greatest installment in the Love Live anime series ended up being one of the greatest disappointments I've yet to come across.  If Love Live Sunshine had one major step up from its predecessor, it would be how it utilizes subtlety. Very rarely does the show tell you how the characters have developed, and if it does, it gives a great presentation to back it up. Love Live Sunshine actually uses the performances of the girls as ways to show you how much the characters have improved: how the choreography slowly improves from performance to performance, how the amount of band aids Chika has increases from scene to scene. There was no need to state the obvious, or to show Chika getting injured: all of that was inferred through some great shots of Chika just trying her best.  Did I just give Love Live subtlety points? SORRY GOTTA TAKE THOSE RIGHT BACK because at the same time, Love Live falls back into its old habit of friendship speeches, slow motion eureka jumping moments, repeating the same cheesy lines over and over again, and other tactics to not so subtly remind you that this is a show about friendship!  Love live teaches you that you can't solve your problems by shouting into the distance or giving your computer screen your patented GLARE OF DETERMINATION! Instead, shit goes south. Chika goes through a massive identity crisis, hinted through her subtle mannerisms and facial expressions. How is it fixed?  By having the entire school yell at her! Through sentimental speeches thrown from floor to rooftop!  Do you see the problem? Love Live always sets up these plot points with so much potential: the subtle build up, psychological conflict, and with minimal exposition and drag. Only for it all to be resolved with the usual cheesy sentimental monologues or speeches that make you cringe. There are so many opportunities for these resolutions to occur through the same methods as the build up, but noooooo let's have people yelling their solutions while jumping in slow motion, or have the entire fucking school somehow spit out the entire solution to the problem! These cheap resolutions are buzzkills and lazy lazy lazy ways of resolving drama.  Oh course, I won't pretend that Love Live Sunshine s2 is the only installment in this series that has this problem: season 1 had plenty of it, and the OG series too. However, what the OG series did was leave room for potential and improvement, and it actually took the opportunity to improve on a lot of the flaws that it had. This was why season 2 of the original was a drastic improvement, and I can even full heartedly call it good. Love Live Sunshine set up the same opportunity for its sequel to do the same, if not even more. With the way it builds up, it seemed promising at first, but it just devolves back into the same exact thing that made people so critical of the series in the first place.  Changes in directorial styles are nice, but there needs to be some consistency. Love Live Sunshine was commonly criticized for being too similar to its predecessor, and while I agree to some extent, my greatest praise for Sunshine was always how Sunshine felt like a sequel to School Idol Project as much as School Idol Project felt like a prequel to Sunshine. To me, there is no one over the other, there is no battle between Aqours and Muse. They exist together under the Love Live banner, as they should. This was due to how the recycled plot points are used as ways to develop Aqours differently than Muse, and how even though both anime series tackle the same themes, each series usually prioritizes one over the other, or they tackle the theme a different way. For example, Sunshine has more emphasis on the girls actually trying to improve as idols, and this is actually expressed fairly well through the slow improvement of choreography presented in the concert scenes. This contrasts School Idol Project's emphasis on the girls bracing for when they have to disband, something that Sunshine still touches on but not as heavily as School Idol Project. While School Idol Project dedicated more episodes to the fate of Muse, Sunshine spent less time on that theme but featured more dynamic and hardcore methods of exploring that theme, featuring a FUCKING FLYING VAN, lots of cheesy group cheering and crying. Whilst School Idol Project took the more subtle approach on the passage of time by showing the girls doing slice of life shenanigans through timed events, Sunshine brought out the big guns immediately by making the girls taste failure and fly vehicles into the moon. Unfortunately, Sunshine s2 did this pretty poorly as flying vans and having the entire school chant Aqours over and over again isn't a very effective way to convey this message. When the hard hitting, tear inducing, heart pounding, and hope brimmed scenes actually make you laugh your ass off, you know that something is wrong.  The characters of Love Live are the defining factor and also hold the most potential for growth and change. And yet, some things never change. Yoshiko's comedic antics now are about as funny as they were back then (in other words, not at all.) Yoshiko also still had pitiful development. As you can probably tell, one of my biggest hopes for this season was for Yoshiko to finally get some satisfying development. Needless to say, I ain't satisfied. But some things do change, and they are pretty nice. Dia's arc about wanting to be called ""Dia-chan"" was light hearted and fun, no unneeded sappiness, just satisfying fluff. Hanamaru turned her sass level all the way up, she ain't holding back anymore. Ruby had an entire arc dedicated to her growing independence in a way that also contributed to the whole ""Aqours probs gonna disband"" plot point. Did this save her from being worst girl? Nah, but it was still a nice touch. Meanwhile, Kanan actually had some screen time this time around. Riko too gained a decent amount of screen time and her personality was more fleshed out. Chika changed from a happy go lucky ""I can do anything"" character to one with genuine psychological conflicts, similar to the change granted to Honoka.  But in order to grant these characters some quality of life buffs, some other characters gotta be gutted into the ground. Take Watanabe You for example. Formerly an irreplaceable asset and fan favorite of the Love Live Sunshine story line, she was demoted into legitimately the most useless character ever conceived. Even Umi, the sociopathic queen of underdevelopment can't hold a finger to just how absolutely useless You was during this season. If you took her out of the show, nothing would change. This just proves that Sunrise just has no respect for the best girl. An instant flunk! Love Live Sunshine s2, you get a 1/10 for FAILURE!  Is what I would say if they didn't give Sakurauchi Riko, the next best thing, a lot of fluff. The dog episode featuring our homie Sakurauchi Riko is not only the best episode of the season, but one of the best episodes of the entire franchise, rivaling the legendary episode 5 of Love Live School Idol Project s2. But one good episode isn't going to sway my consensus that is Love Live Sunshine s2 may be the worst season of love live to date, if not at least comparable to the mess that is season 1 of the original.  So how does Love Live's sound quality fair for this new installment? Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo is, in my opinion of course, the best OP that Love Live has to offer, not only on a song quality basis but on a directorial basis as well. It perfectly encapsulates the energetic yet melancholic strive to shine that defines Love Live Sunshine. The sparkling light in the beginning that shines down on the members of Aqours also fits the shooting star motif that's commonly brought up throughout the show. Similarly, the ED is definitely a top tier ED, but that is to be expected from Love Live EDs. The seiyuus are splendid as always: I'm a pretty big fan of the Love Live seiyuu scene, especially the Aqours members. I probably like them more than the series itself. When it comes to OST and insert songs, it's a pretty hit or miss experience. There is one piece in the soundtrack (you know the one) that is constantly played during the melodramatic scenes. While the piece by itself is pretty nice I guess, combined with the already over the top scenes in slow motion and tears that probably took half of the animation budget, it's safe to say that the OST played a big role as to why Sunshine is way too sappy. The insert songs hold a similar problem. Whether or not you like them is down to preference, but as I stated before: I liked how Sunshine used the concert scenes to show the improvement of Aqours when it came to choreography. What I didn't mention is how weirdly weaved in one particular piece of choreography was, that being the Chika cart wheel flip move. A whole episode of build up was dedicated to that one move, yet it was transitioned in so badly during the concert scene, it felt more anticlimactic than anything else, oddly placed with no satisfying transition into and out of the concert scene. Another prime example of decent build up with pitiful pay off. Yes, Chika is finally able to do the move, but her ability to do it was triggered by more friendship speeches and an unsatisfying transition. What does this have to do with the insert song? There was no good timing to insert the transition, and the song they used is somewhat at fault for that too.  You may be saying: Yuni, why are you subjecting this random idol anime to unnecessarily high standards and potential that you probably just made up on your own? No one told you to expect a masterpiece, and you shouldn't anally shreck an anime for not being what you expected!  I'm just sad that what could have been done right HAS been done right before in the past, so why not now when the possibilities are greater than ever?  Love Live is all about change and growth. Love Live Sunshine s2 achieves this change and growth but through the worst ways possible. There's literally an entire episode of build up where the 9 girls inner monologue how they have changed throughout the series. There's no implications, no subtlety, just the girls directly stating ""oh becoming an idol did this to me."" Similarly, the interactions between the girls evolved only very slightly, not at all, or only evolved heavily after major events and get reset somehow. The slight changes in character interactions where a measure to the development of the characters during the original series, and it's missing or played badly in Sunshine, which is a darn shame. Only a select few characters had a little bit of spice added to their interactions, like Zuramaru and Riko. Sure, this season may have delivered the growth that everyone wanted, but it was done in the least satisfying way possible, a sure cause for disappointment to me, the only one around who actually had such high hopes for a lowly idol anime called Love Live! Sunshine!!  Ah yes, and my updated order of Aqours members is:  *sigh* It's Pronounced ""Yoh"" > Rick > Hannah Mahroo > I wanna Dia > Yohane Sebastian Bach > Kanan you not? > Mary > Kan Kan Mikan’t > Gangstarooby";Not Recommended
1;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;MagicalMahou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MagicalMahou;4;"I need to write this.  I feel compelled to write this.  A single 'tags' box can't possibly contain all of my thoughts and feelings for this season.  So, before we get right to it, heavy spoilers, if there's anything worth spoiling anyway.  Ready? Okay.  Love Live Sunshine S2 is shit.  After S1 set the bar for what was, most likely, to be the best season of Love Live ever, maybe even surpassing the masterful S2, ended up being the corniest, most obnoxious, most mind-numbingly boring, most underwhelming experience I've ever had with a piece of entertainment. Yup, this thing is down there with Terminator Salvation and Bioshock 2. But, to be fair, it's not exactly Final Fantasy X-2. How do I say this? It's a piece of shit but not entirely.  Unlike the older seasons, it looks prettier. The soundtrack is nice. And the 3D animation is nice to look at, not like the awkward CG models they used in the original. The 2D animation is a lot slicker and more animated, allowing for a range of expressions in body language (which they didn't do at all). As for the girls themselves, DO YOU SEE THAT DETAIL? The amount of work they put into making the girls a lot prettier and flashier is impressive. As a training animator myself, I can just imagine the sweat and tears put into the lineart per frame.  Hm, what else... Yup, that's it for the positives, I think. Now let's tear this thing apart.  One of the key things that made Love Live so good was how they utilized drama. Whenever there was a situation the characters couldn't handle, it was always given due care, embracing an amount of subtlety or loudness that always fit the situation. Yes, even the massive outbreak scene in the original S1. The way they build up scenes with music, voice acting, blocking and camera angles manage to convey the emotions the characters are feeling. The other key thing was silence. The characters would only talk when they needed to, and convey what they needed to. This is true for the original and Sunshine S1. The scene where Chika expressed her disappointment and sadness over getting zero votes was masterful. It is a very good example of saying what you need to say: ""I'm disappointed, I'm disappointed"". Just from these lines alone, you could feel all the emotions pouring out from her, and the strength she lacks trying to cope with the situation. This is a scene I remember to this day, and I've only seen the whole season once, last year. It's masterful, and embraces what Love Live stands for - following your dreams and growing to become better.  See all those great thing I said about Love Live? THIS SEASON HAS NONE OF THAT.  The way drama is handled here is exactly what I expected of Love Live before I watched the original; corny, loud and meaningless. The school is shutting down, they failed to save the school but they have to get up and do Love Live anyway! How do they convey these set of events? In the laziest way possible. Chika is on the brink of losing hope, the group of schoolgirls can't convince her out of it. What saves the day? AN EVEN BIGGER GROUP OF SCHOOLGIRLS. Even at the ending, when they're closing up the school. This is the perfect moment for silence, letting the feeling sink in that 'this is the end and we need to move forward'. But NOPE! Gotta keep telling each other and letting the audience know that ""we'll be together foreeeveerrr *heart* *heart*"". The way they resolve every instance of drama is just plain lazy. I don't know, but they always feels set up, like it's just there just so something can happen or they say things just to consume empty space when there's no need to. The biggest thing I want to address is the Saint Snow arc. This could've been an amazing arc, rivaling the original S2's Rin and Nozomi episode. But nope, it was a rushed and inconsequential set of episodes about characters that had 0 to no buildup. Ruby is such a disappointing character. She was at least fun and felt involved around S1, but the way they utilized her for this arc, getting involved with Leah because she also had a sister and she was seemingly concerned, doesn't work for me AT ALL. As for Leah, her problem just felt plain shallow to me. Not that it wasn't. Losing the whole competition is something very demoralizing for the two of them. ... So why didn't they show that it was? This is another problem with the show: not putting in good buildup or drama when there was a dire need for it. This arc was in DIRE need for some good scenes, showing the tension between the two sisters, building up Ruby and Leah's friendship while developing the two in some way that it shows us who they are. The series tries, but it falls flat on its face because the scenes really just don't work for me and just feel empty without the proper backing. Ruby building up the confidence to make her own decisions? Great! Where's the part where you established that?? It really just doesn't work for me.  And while we're at the topic, let's talk about the characters. S1 built up these characters to have possibly amazing arcs because of how well established they were, and how their unity felt organic and something that could potentially create amazing and fun mini arcs for the group. But here we are with S2, where the main dilemma is the group's refusal to put -chan at the end of Dia's name. What happened to all the dynamic characterization in S1? You can't possibly tell me that all the things that made each character interesting somehow disappeared after S1? Where did You's confidence issues go? Dia's love for idols? Kanan's love for the sea? When did Aquors' determination to follow their dreams, be free to be themselves and shine yet keep asking themselves what it means to shine?? And turned the girls into uninteresting one-note characters that say the same things over and over (""Buu Buu desu wa"" is the most ear grating thing I've ever heard in my life)? Well, not entirely. I missed one positive thing about this season - the dog episode. The way they gave Yoshiko and Riko this fun and unlikely friendship over a dog and make them realize things about themselves and each other.To make things better, both subtlety and silence were present. How Yoshiko expressed how she didn't really believe in the occult but did it anyway because she felt something special from it and Riko receiving those words from her reminded me why I loved Love Live so much. And it gave me hope that maybe the series would go back to being good again, but nope it became boring the following episode. I honestly don't even remember what happened. What happened again? And what sucks is that they tossed away this relationship almost entirely after, turning Yoshiko back into a dry joke instead of bringing out her internal dilemma.  I feel a need to address the songs, because really, none of them were memorable for me. They sounded like the filler songs you'd play in SIF. None of them stuck with me at all. They felt cheesy, boring to listen to and I'd occasionally pause in the middle of them to get a drink.  It's relatively easy to get away with the phrase ""It's just an idol anime. What did you expect?"". It's hard to explain to people that the Love Live is a great series and could be a very meaningful experience. What this season is is precisely what people who haven't seen the show think the show is - just another cute girl anime. Just another corny, boring slice of life show with some music.  This show is an utter disappointment. And I seriously hope future installations strive to do better. But, to Sunrise, this season is probably a smash hit so I'll hope instead that a more competent director or writer comes around. Love Live set the bar high, and I seriously hope someone steps in and meets the quota next time around.";Not Recommended
2;Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season;justice_chip;https://myanimelist.net/profile/justice_chip;4;I had my score as a 6 for this show for a long time. It only took some reflection a few months later to realize how biased i am towards the LL franchise just because I adore the music. This show, especially this season, is bad. Just bad. It tries to be something it's not just because it feels as if it must live up to the original LLSIP. The original truly acts like a shackle to this new installment. In many ways, Sunshine trying to go out of its way to feel different from the original comes off as a reskinned idea, or simply uninspired. But enough about the first series, this show is bad on its own. It hits some fine emotional points in the first half, but my god that second half. I am truly convinced, the writers came up with the plot as they went on. It had no direction. Nothing served as thematic presence on its own, nor did it work to build up anything by itself. Most of the time, it felt like it was being emotional, just for the sake of being emotional. Love live sunshine season 2, is just kinda shit and I'll probably watch it again someday OMEGALUL;Not Recommended
0;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;7;"I had very mixed feelings when I heard Love Live would be starting again with a new cast of characters. Muse had finally gotten to the point where each member had earned their place, and while it made sense for their story to end, I always felt a desire for more. I wanted it to be the beginning rather than the ending.  Love Live Sunshine may not have been the beginning I wanted, but it is hardly a weak addition to the series. It does many of the things that made the original series so special, and more than justifies its own existence. I'm glad it exists, and am without any doubt looking forward to seeing more of Aquors.  But Sunshine isn't without issues. It follows the footprints of the original series a bit too closely-- the flaws and missteps of its first half included and ever more so apparent.  Sunshine, like the first season of the original, moves too fast and swims a bit too deep in the drama, rather than giving the audience the main thing they are looking for: reason to like and care for the girls. It sets a nice stage for the inevitable second season, but at the same time, it's hard to not feel a little bit bummed out when Sunshine starts with the same stumbles rather than learning from the original's excellent second season. If it sounds like I am being a harsh critic, you may be right, but part of that is because I have a strong attachment to the original series and want to see its successor reach the same highs. If it can't, wouldn't it be reasonable to lament that there is not just more Muse instead?  Sunshine actually does a pretty admirable job with its drama. It never aims to be something more or different from what it truly is, and what is there is handled with meaning and clarity-- even if its themes are something we have heard a hundred times before-- and its bittersweet and well-timed background music consistently amplifies its message. Sunshine's heart is in the right place. The problem is just that there is just too much of this drama, too soon. Assuming there is to be more of Aquors (and I will bet my non-existent heart that there will be), the climax of their story is not now, but then. This isn't the time to bring them on the big stage, but to prepare them for it. They aren't ready, and neither is their audience.  While Nico's ""Nico Nico-nii"" catchphrase was silly (and adorable), the original series did not ever attempt to paint that as a genuine part of her character; it was a joke even to herself, and entirely contrary to her personality. Yoshiko, and to a lesser extent, Mari and Hanamaru, are defined to varying extents by these sorts of catchphrases, without the same sort of depth or rationale to it that Nico's character had. Some may find Yoshiko's terminal autism to be amusing (and indeed it can be!), but these sorts of gimmicks do little else but make them feel somewhat artificial, at times even empty. And empty is the last thing a character from Love Live should be.  But nine main characters is a lot to deal with in only thirteen episodes. The original series had yet to accomplish the same by that point, so, I suppose, it is only fair to expect Sunshine will also start hitting those strides from here on. Most of the girls (particularly Ruby) are cute and interesting enough in their own right, even if they have done little yet to stand out from the more outgoing characters. I'm just worried that Sunshine has turned Yoshiko into such a joke that there may be no way of ever doing anything meaningful with her character. Making a serious character into a joke is an easy thing, but a joke into a real character is a much harder process.  Aquor's rival group, Saint Snow, is certainly more interesting than the original's counterpart. Ria and Seira aren't successful because they are 'perfect' idols, but rather because they have their own unique thing going on. There's a neat contrast between the traditional, idol-y nature of Aquors, and Saint Snow's more eclectic Babymetal leanings. Ria and Seira have reason to be hostile-- Aquors is the exact opposite of what they want to be.  If you were to ask me why I have spent so much time comparing Sunshine to the original series, rather than discussing it solely on its own merits, it is because Sunshine itself does so on a regular basis. It doesn't try or even want to disconnect itself, and instead recognises and pays respect to Muse. The girls of Aquors started their group precisely because they were fans of Muse. It's the appropriate turn to take the franchise; if it attempted to be entirely its own thing, never making a reference to the original, it would feel a bit distasteful, considering just how similar a road the two shows travel. The only troubling part of it all is that it makes you long for Muse all the more.  Sunshine continues the tradition of having some of the best music in the entire idol industry. I would argue that songs like ""Todokanai Hoshi datoshitemo"" and ""Kimi no Kokoro wa Kagaiyaiteru kai?"" are better than most of what real idol groups (Momoiro Clover et al.) produce. There may not be any real bangers like Start:Dash or Snow Halation, but I do find Aquors sneaking their way onto my playlist every now and then, too. Ruby's voice also may not be quite as lovely as Nico's or Kotori's, but she's still hella cute regardless.  If it weren't being compared to its predecessor, Love Live Sunshine would still be one of the better idol anime produced. I have no problem with it, stumbles and tumbles aside, and can see both Love Live fans and newcomers to the franchise having a great time with it.  Aquors just have yet to convince me that they are capable of standing on the same stage that Muse once did. I'm open to being convinced otherwise-- heck, I want, and I expect to be convinced otherwise. There are certainly worse ways to start.";Recommended
1;Love Live! Sunshine!!;imnoob92;https://myanimelist.net/profile/imnoob92;8;"Last year, we were told that μ's had come to an end and a PV of the new LL! idol group was shown. Their name is Aqours. They are going to continue on the μ's legacy and (try to) become more successful than μ's. They are namely, Chika, Riko, You, Ruby, Yoshiko (or Yohane whichever preferred), Hanamaru, Dia, Mari and Kanan. I had indifferent opinions about them at first. I didn't delve too deep like how I did during the μ's era to be honest. None of them interested me because the brand new LL!Sunshine!! project was too rushed, where μ's was still around and had their movie and their Final Live concert upcoming. While the news gave a slap to all the LL! fans, most of us started to worry if Aqours could do better than their predecessors.  Now that it comes to an end with its finale being aired last night. Let's go!  Story: 6/10  Note: In LL!, story, is NEVER ever the selling point. Same goes to LLSS!!.  Reusing and referencing the good ol' stuff from μ's isn't a bad thing if the series is executed well. As a fan of the original LL! I sincerely hope that LLSS!! is better, or at least on par, with the original. Surely, the beginning looked promising and didn't disappoint me, and the rest of the series didn't either. A good beginning makes a good ending, eh? Not happening in LLSS!!, unfortunately.  I am here just going to say, the ending... is not meant for everyone. The way the series ended was, not something I will rate 1/10 but still, bad. It could be done better but man, imagine you are sitting on the LLSS!! hype train all along the journey just to reach a cliff and everything goes downhill and bam.  Art: 10/10  One thing you can never complain in LL! and LLSS!! is their art. It's really good, and the art improves so much coming to LLSS!!. (tho the CG dance may be pretty annoying from time to time)  Sound: 8/10  For OP, OST and ED, they are really good. VAs did their amazing work too.  My only concern goes to the inserts. They ARE good, but not impacting enough in their respective episodes.  Character: 7/10  I have a mixed feeling about the characters itself. 3rd years' (Mari, Kanan, Dia) chemistry is great even though I am not a fan of either one of them. 1st years (Ruby, Hanamaru, Yoshiko) did a great job too though I never like Yoshiko (sorry but chuuni isn't to my liking). 2nd years (Chika, You, Riko) tho, they have the same problem as μ's (Kotori, Honoka, Umi) had. There's too much focus for them, and they aren't that great either.  Enjoyment: 7/10  I swear I really enjoy everything up to the 12th episode, but the finale is.... wew. Let's not talk about the weird skit which I think it's actually okay-ish, I am disappointed by the absence of ""Step ZERO to ONE"" after being referenced so much in the anime. The question ""Why do you not perform it and instead using a new song that doesn't give that much impact as a finale?"" will always be in my head from now on.  Overall: 7/10 (Revised score: 8/10)  The series is good, but nowhere better than the original LL! first season imo.  TL;DR: A good start, with a badly executed ending.";Recommended
2;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Avidreader123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Avidreader123;7;"Love Live is back with another fresh cast of characters who, let's be real here, are all waifu-worthy judging by their looks alone. I myself was skeptical at first, incredibly worried this may be a case of ""milking the cash cow"". Thankfully, no. Sunshine has even surpassed the first season of the original Love Live in my eyes. Honestly, I'm quite surprised with the outcome.  Sunshine starts off with a story that sounds undeniably similar to that of the original. Let me clarify-- it's not an exact story copy. I'd say only the base, its starting point, is the same. We won't, for instance, see our lovely Nico look-a-like in the same kind of situation as the real Nico. The girls of Aqours each have their own story to tell.  It certainly is hard to make a good anime with this many main characters in such a short amount of time. Love Live Sunshine is no different. Just like its predecessor, the girls did not receive an enormous amount of development. What do you expect from a show with nine main characters and just thirteen episodes? Things could've been handled differently. Sunshine, unfortunately, repeats the same mistakes. A future second season would set things straight, probably, though. Yes, again, similar to the original. Then, why did I give Sunshine a much higher rating? I'll get to that in a bit.  I don't blame anyone with a huge attachment to Muse to doubt the new series, with the introduction of complete new characters. Aware of that, though, I think they should still give Aqours a chance, a chance to shine. And, it sure did shine. Sunshine's cast is a whole lot more likeable and memorable than its predecessor. I had an easy time liking the characters, and even sympathized with them during emotional scenes-- even if I didn't like them one bit initially. Mari and You, just to note a few examples. The new girls are what made Sunshine so much better for me personally.  Talking a little about my favorites; Chika, pretty much an exact copy of Honoka, the side-ponytail being the only difference. I'm quite fond of her positiveness and leadership ability, and basically being the driving force of the group. Honoka was one of my personal favorites from Muse-- it wouldn't be that strange to have Chika as one of my favorite Aqours girl as well. Hanamaru, or rather Zuramaru as I like to call her, is a fun character, too. Not only is her lack of tech knowledge humorous, her zura's are also very charming. ""It's the future, zura!"" The girls each have their own quirks, some which may be irritating, and some that are genuinely fun. The one character with a disturbing amount of annoyance, though, is Yoshiko. She reminds me of that one Chuunibyou show I didn't like very much. Yoshiko comes over as obnoxious, and feels completely out of place. I'd much rather have a different girl in her stead. Oh well, it can't be helped.  What's more disappointing is the fact that a couple did not receive the screen time they deserved. And by that, I'm actually mostly referring to a certain blue haired, ponytailed goddess. She had so little screen time in the first half of the show, I was starting to question whether or not she'll become a member of Aqours later. I guess that beach episode made up for it... uh, just a little bit. Kanan is a fine-looking lady for sure!  Who is the real star of Aqours? The girl - who coincidentally looks a lot like Nico - with the gorgeous red twintails and aqua eyes, of course! Her name is Ruby, the one who invented cuteness and has the voice of an angel. She certainly stands out the most with her design, cute expressions and such. She made her debut in the first episode unlike the Nico. Ruby has already accumulated quite a reputation by just a couple scenes alone-- and now that I think about it, the show needed more of those. The more we got to the end, the less Ruby we got. Though, I was honestly not that upset about it. It indicates how much I actually liked Sunshine, even with the absence of Ruby in the latter episodes. Keep staying unbearably cute, it makes my life so much better. I am keeping this short, since I do not want this to turn into a Ruby love post. (I love her.)  Now, I do have to mention that none of the new characters have been able to completely fill the gap that's been left behind by Nico. Ruby, though, is the cutest in the whole wide world and tries her absolute ""Rubesty"" to make up for it. Her efforts, however, were in vain. I still missed hearing the phrase ""Nico-Nico nii,"" but, oh well, I guess ""Ganbaruby"" is a decent enough replacement. I kind of go a little crazy whenever Ruby says it.  Something that was quite bothersome was that there was no audition process of sorts going on. Chika was captivated by the beauty of this natural wonder, named Ruby. She got an invitation right on the spot. Apparently, looking gorgeous and cute is all that's needed for one to become a true school idol. Singing and dancing skills are irrelevant. Seriously though, this part has been ignored, yet again.  Notable are the outstanding visuals, a huge improvement over the original. The show is very colorful and the background sceneries are very pretty, especially the seaside ones. And yes, there's still the use of 3DCGI during live performances. However, in Sunshine, it's less distracting, more fluid, and should now be on a tolerable level, which makes it more enjoyable to watch.  The sound is what you would expect from the Love Live series. The musical performances are outstanding and definitely worthy of praise. The hardships the girls went through, following their dreams-- you can actually feel the emotions they put into their songs. Mirai Ticket, sung in the final episode, is especially a good example. The vocals are great and the voices of all Aqours girls fit well with each other, not to mention the regular voice acting is admirable, too. Have I already mentioned Ruby's angelic voice? Great background music as well.  If you had any doubts about Sunshine, I can assure you, there is little to worry about. It's certainly an enjoyable show for fans and newcomers alike. Just remember that Ruby is best. I'm very disappointed, though, that the anime did not learn from its past mistakes. Sunshine has the potential of being exceptionally good. And seeing as how popular the Love Live franchise is (especially in Japan!), it will surely get a second season in order to make that happen, and flesh out the characters a bit more. I look forward to the day I see my lovely Ruby animated again.  ""Let's change that zero into a one!""";Recommended
3;Love Live! Sunshine!!;SeibaaHomu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SeibaaHomu;10;Following up on such a well loved series is no simple task. Whether they're big fans of the original or never liked the series in the first place there's always going to be skeptics who throw around generic phrases like 'milking the cash cow' when an anime studio so much as thinks of continuing a popular series. Sometimes you can win them over, but most of the time they like to stubbornly stick by their viewpoints even it goes against all logical thinking. But regardless of how baffling I find the point of view that these people have, I'm not here to talk about them or the fan reaction to this series. I'm not here to make comparisons to the original series either. I'm here to talk about the series.  Love Live Sunshine is a continuation of the original series which I loved very much. But I think Sunshine has its own set of unique strengths. Some have even argued that these strengths make it a better series than the original. But what I find great about Sunshine is that its good points don't detract from what made the original series great. It's a fantastic series that stands out on its own merits. I feel like slovenly comparing the two in that way doesn't do either series justice. As such, I will refrain from making comparisons to the original unless I feel it's absolutely necessary.  Chika Takami is a normal girl wasting away her days going through the motions like any other high school girl. But she's no longer content with living that kind of life. When she sees µ's on the big screen of the UTX building in Akihabara (Which I've just recently found out is called the 'UDX' building in real life. Pretty cool huh?) something in her mind clicks. She's finally found a way to break the mould and escape her normal everyday life. That's the basic setup at least. Obviously their journey isn't as easy as it initially seems, but what makes Sunshine uniquely interesting is the nature of the potholes on their road to success. Pretty much everyone who heard µ's was on their side. It was just a matter of getting people to hear them out. As is natural for a series of that nature there are complications along the way but they're mostly irrelevant to how the people react to their music. The problems they faced were mostly either internal conflict or getting people to notice them. But when µ's put in their best effort and succeeded nearly every time. Sunshine does deal with those very same themes in its own way, but it also deals with heavily a theme that the original series never really touched upon. Rejection. People who heard what they had to say, considered where they were coming from and just said 'no'.  I'm honestly not sure if a theme like that would be a good fit in the original series. But this is a completely new series and Sunrise have taken this as an opportunity to try something completely new. While the show also deals with many of the same themes as the original, it does so in a very different way. The show initially lures you into believing that the impact µ's has had means their journey is gonna be a walk in the park. Right? Right? Wrong! Not only are they outright rejected on a number of occasions, but they have an even harder time getting people to hear them out. School idols are everywhere in this day and age so standing out from the crowd is a lot more difficult. Even their flashy Babymetal-esque rivals Saint Snow have difficulty getting people on their side. Plus unlike µ's, Aqours don't live in the heart of Tokyo and getting people to notice them out in the middle of nowhere is a very difficult task.  To put it simply, they're being brought down by circumstances completely out of their control. You can understand their frustration over being in this situation because these are all problems that everyone has to face at some point in their life. These themes aren't some super complex analysis of the human condition, but they're a perfect fit for the type of series that Love Live Sunshine is trying to be. Not only are the themes relatable to a lot of people regardless of cirmustance, but they're executed really well... at least for the most part. If I had to make a criticism (And I kinda do since this a review and not just a discussion of why I love the show) it's that it takes a while to get really stuck into the themes. The show is very deliberately paced and every episode is filled with great moments, but it's not until the final few episodes where the show really flourishes. That's not to say what comes before it is a waste of time. But even though I thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish its finest moments are definitely during the latter episodes. That being said this is admittedly a very weak criticism. I found the show as a whole to be fantastic and I can't imagine those last few episodes being anywhere near as impactful had it not been for everything that came before it.  A new series brings with it a new set of characters and I was really impressed with what they brought to the table this time around. They've all got their cute little quirks and catchphrases as expected but there's a little bit more to them once you get past all that. In terms of comedy the 9 girls all have a great dynamic and bounce off of each other really well when the show wants to make the viewer laugh. But they've also got a wide range of emotions as well as a number of flaws. It's nothing ultra complicated but there's enough to them so that they feel more human and believable than what some would argue (Looking at you Yamakan) is necessary in this kind of series.  When I read the character descriptions I was particularly worried about Yohane since Chuunibyou's are a very stale trope in anime. But the show does a fantastic job of justifying her reasons for being that way and her love of the occult. Ruby is often shy and scared but when the going gets tough she isn't afraid to get assertive. Hanamaru is kind and pleasant to a fault but she's also a goofball and an antisocial bookworm who has trouble making friends. I could go on to describe what makes each and every character great and how they evolve over the course of the series but I'm rambling enough as it is. Though I think what's most important in creating a strong show is a strong lead character and Chika certainly delivers. Chika always wants to do the best she can by her friends but she isn't without her flaws. As much as she tries she's not always capable of making a difference. But over the course of the series she becomes more understanding of her own limitations and more reliant on the people around her. Not only does this make her a likeable character, but a believable one too. And the same goes for the rest of the cast too.  Though there is an elephant in the room that I think is worth discussing. Kanan. All things considered she did get a good amount of attention in the later episodes and the buildup to that point was handled very well. But when you're watching the show weekly you just can't help but wonder 'Where's Kanan?'. Fortunately, the resolution to the conflict between the third years is probably one of the best moments in the entire show. Conflict between characters can make or break a series depending on how it's handled. In Love Live's Sunshine's case, it brings about some of the show's very best moments. The show's world is definitely an exaggerated version of reality but every problem they face arises naturally. They're problems that one can reasonably expect to occur in their situation and they're always solved in an emotionally satisfying way. Simply put, the characters and their interactions are probably Love Live Sunshine's greatest strength.  The animation in Love Live Sunshine is a definite strong point of the series but I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It's a very good looking show that definitely blows the vast majority of anime out of the water. That being said the production quality isn't on the same level as something like Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero or a KyoAni production. Just like the original series the show mixes 2D and 3D animation for its performance scenes and they're an absolute visual treat with a lot of great effects and some very memorable choreography. I've come to accept that the CG animation is an intentional design choice so I'm not going to criticise the show just because they use that style. However it definitely does look a bit wonky on occasions and even at its best it never looks as good as the 2D animation. But overall, when it comes to the visuals the positive far outweigh the positives.  Of course another important aspect in a show like this is the sound. I mean, it is an idol show right? The voice acting, the songs, the sound design, the background music, all of this is very important. The show isn't flawless in every regard but the way the show uses sound is definitely one of its strengths. The songs themselves are plentiful, diverse and very easy on the ears to say the least. The fast paced energy of the opening theme that gets you hyped for the episode, the infectious bouncy melody of Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, the pounding bass drum and soaring vocals in Mijuku Dreamer. Even if you were to detach the songs from the flashy choreography in the performance scenes there's a lot to talk about. Not every song is as awesome as Mijuku Dreamer, but they're all great for their own reasons and not one of them is a dud.  On the topic of sound, voice acting! While there are quite a few well known seiyuu playing side characters every single one of the 9 girls is played by a newbie. That being said, they've obviously been trained very well. The girls all sound distinctive and their acting is on point nailing both the light hearted comedy scenes and the more dramatic moments of the series. There are a few missed lip flaps and awkward line reads, but in the grand scheme of things these are relatively minor flaws. The seiyuu performances are a key aspect of any show like this and Love Live Sunshine does not disappoint. Just like its predecessor, Sunshine does indeed have an English dub. While NIS America handled the first series in conjunction with Bang Zoom, Love Live Sunshine is entirely a Funimation effort. Moving from Texas to LA means there's a whole new talent pool to work with and the dub uses this to its advantage with a good mix of newbies and veterans from the area. In an effort to remain consistent with the original series the English dub is directed by Caitlin Glass who played Maki in the original series. However, just like the Japanese version, there are no returning cast members. There's definitely some awkward line reads and questionable translation choices here and there but all things considered it's a very solid dub handled by a team of people who evidently enjoy working on the show. However in this case I have to say my preference is with the original Japanese version.  Overall, Love Live Sunshine was an unexpectedly great series that follows up on the original in a very big way. Rather than relying on what made the original series great, Sunshine (And Aqours) establishes itself as something uniquely amazing. I could go on forever talking about everything this show does right yet my issues with the show are relatively minor. It's obligatory that I mention the things that bothered me in a review, but honestly I could spend way longer talking about why I loved the show. It's very rare that a show elicits that kind of positive response out of me so obviously they've done something right. Love Live Sunshine is undeniably something special and I would be very surprised if anything else can take its place as my favourite anime of 2016.;Recommended
4;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Naneo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naneo;10;So i knew this anime from Love Live! School Idol Festival. LLSIF is a mobile rhythm game that feature all character from Love Live. I decided to watch the anime because the story there is great, so after a few weeks playing it i'm interested to watch the anime. And boy oh boy, i'm surprised that the story is more complicated in the anime.  Story 10/10 Since Love Live! Sunshine!! is the first that i watched in this franchise, i can't compare it to Love Live! School Idol Project. Some people say the story is same like LLSIP. So in here i will review the story based on this anime alone and didn't take previous anime to compare. Well as a person who got here from the game, i'm really surprised. I didn't expect it to be like this, i thought it will be like other Cute Girls Doing Cute Thing anime. But no, its more powerfull than that. It has taught me something. That something is never give up, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the problem is, just never give up. It'll done when it is the time.The story make us really feel how hard they work. But this anime isn't all about being a hardworker, this anime also contain about friendship. Not only that, it also has has an emotional episode that will make your heart touched because their wholesomeness.  Art 10/10 I really like this artstyle. Its so colorful and because of that it also bring happiness and cheerfulness mood. Which is good, because almost all the song they sing match with the mood. A bonus point for their uniform, now i like sailor uniform because this anime. Sometimes they make a really weird but funny faces, and it became a memes. The background art is really beautiful because the anime take place in a shore area. They draw all of it really good, from the sea to the hill. The animation is also really smooth. The girls here like to jump everytime something happy occuring and they jump so fluidly. Oh yeah they also have CGI, but it didn't really a big thing because they only use CGI when they are singing.  Sound 10/10 This is a music anime, of course the sound must be good. I already like their music since i was playing LLSIF. And now i knew the story behind the music i was listened, i love them even more. I can't really describe the music, you should watch the anime to feel it. I also have some of their music in my playlist. Beside from the music, the SFX is also really good. I don't think it has problem with SFX.  Character 10/10 They really do a great job making all the 9 main characters here a different personality. Not to mention they really consistent with it. Like their personality never change. So if you want to choose your perfect waifu maybe you can pick one from here. Now we're talk about the side character. In the early episode they just give the spotlight to the first 3 main characters. And the side characters feel so plain because we barely hear anyone talk beside the main character. But as this show progressively move, the side characters is actually as important as main character. They even can make someone personality that didn't appear in the anime, which mean we can't see them but we can feel them.  Enjoyment 10/10 Thanks to this anime, now i'm inside idol hell and can't get out. But i'm not regretting it, even a little bit. I don't think other anime fans will like it, especially that didn't really got into this type of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, because this anime is a little bit over dramatic about almost everything. Even though this anime is like that, it doesn't stop me from rewatching this series in dub. I'll definitely remember this series as 'that school idol anime'. It just so iconic. Oh yeah the group also exist in real life, so you can really enjoy it to the fullest.  If you are wondering why i'm surprised when i watch the anime. It is because the story in the game is so simple, short, funny, and cheerful. While the anime is serious, tense, and more in depth story. But not all the episode like that, usually the first half is filled with comedy and the second half is focused to the story. So yeah, thank you for reading my review.;Recommended
5;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Arcanon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arcanon;9;"The second anime installment to the hit music/idol franchise Love Live!, Sunshine follows the story of second year high school student Takami Chika as she chases her dream.  All of her life, Chika has always been normal.  ""To have been absorbed in something you love. To have a dream of what you want to become... I never had that.""  Chika thought that she had to be special to be like that. But that changed when she saw µ's for the first time.  ""Even though they were normal high schoolers like me, they were shining!""  Chika was moved. She realized the wonders of school idols, and decided to do it with her friends. She wanted to have a goal, and she wanted to work hard for it. She wants to shine.  Being the most anticipated anime for Summer 2016, many are quick to hate on it. You'll often hear claims that it's just a rehash of the first series, that the plot is the same for both. But what makes up a plot, anyways? Is it how things go, the events that happen; or is it the reason, the ""why"", to the things that happen? I'll let you decide for your self.  As this is the second anime series under the Love Live franchise, you'd expect it to more or less have the same strengths and weaknesses in the overall animation. Like the clean character designs, and the god awful 3DCG when dancing. Surprisingly, though, Sunshine is all strengths. Sunrise (the animators) delivered an overwhelming upgrade to its aesthetics. The art is really detailed and clean. Characters are refined, and the scenery and background are really spectacular. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the 3DCG now fits into the sequencing with better motion and design. Also, the water is really really marvelous. It resembles more the School Idol Movie than it does the original series.  The sound is understandably outstanding. The voice acting fits the characters personalities, and feels natural to listen to. The sound effects are consistent and doesn't overpower the main dialogue, and the ambient sounds pay close attention to detail. There's always the low and soft sound of water moving and waves crashing when they're near a body of water, and there are random seagull squawks every now and then, as expected of a seaside town. It makes you feel like you''re genuinely there. The background music fits with the atmosphere, and carries the many emotions of the show. As for the songs, you can expect it to be great. The opening and ending themes are catchy and tells the story of them as they start out. The songs are good as it is, but gets even better with the emphasis they put on them.  The concept for the story is pretty straightforward, and that is good for a fun show about girls following their dreams and having fun. This isn't meant to be a deep and complex story. The pacing is perfect. Events happen and change at a decently slow speed, which gives more time for the characters to interact, and for their feelings to show and intentions to take shape. With this, the development of each character is clear. Also, Sunshine goes to great lengths and makes excellent use of its elements in emphasizing their characters struggles and accomplishments, creating these beautiful and touching moments unexpected to the viewer, making it that much more of an enjoyable and memorable show.  I loved the first series, and I went into Sunshine knowing that I would also love it. It could have just been me being biased, or it could have just been them riding the immense wave of popularity left by µ's, so I wondering if they could really do it. But I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. It's been breaking a lot of my expectations, and I have high hopes for this series. I want to see the heights they'll take this golden opportunity to and make a name for themselves. Already, they are shining, but I believe they'll become greater and brighter.";Recommended
6;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Ritinal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ritinal;9;"Spoiler-Lite Review:  This started and progressed way past my expectations for a idol/CGDCT type of show. The first episode was super well laid out and showed that it was going to be a lot different than its pseudo-predecessor and I really love that shift in tone, it added a lot of depth and sincerity the genre needed. Chika as a main character is a very self-aware and earnest main character and the rest of the group were very detailed and shaped in such a way as to give lots of similarities and parallels to other known characters in the series.  My favorite narrative tool they used was the ""Fabled Legend"" where you use the previous installment or story that had elements of uniqueness, as a pillar to hold the current story towards and contrast in specific ways. A lot of characters had different levels of familiarity to Muse and the show used these differences to make interesting dilemmas and themes on the idea of purpose and being unique amongst the crowd.  In terms of animation and directing, it was a step up above your standard idol/CGDCT shows. Using really fluid 3D animations in the dancing choreography, alongside great shot composition and narrative structure make for a very enjoyable experience delving into 9 different people's backstories. As a stickler for ""good"" 3D animation, this is my cup of tea. It felt almost like it was shot as a drama instead of a funny comedic idol show. It gave the much needed sincerity to each character and made their persona shine even more.  Other than the ending, my only negative critique would be how disconnected some of the song/performances felt. Even though they had the right preparation and setting, without some more ""leading up to"" scenes, they felt out of place. They themselves were done very well though, just didn't feel right in context/in the moment.  As for the ending, I wished it was a little more concrete in its resolution and its progress. It felt as though it was written with having a season 2 in mind, but I would have wished they had written a more standalone ending that you can jump off the back of for another season. What we did get didn't feel very rewarding, compared to all the work they did in changing their motivations and delving into the true reasons for becoming school idols.  Would have rated it higher if the ending was better.";Recommended
7;Love Live! Sunshine!!;BluetearsX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BluetearsX;9;"First of all, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a show that needs you to pay attention and to understand it, which is kind of interesting considering most of these types of shows are pretty straightforward, but this one needs you to understand the message it starts building up at the very beginning and that it concludes really well. Hopefully this will erase all the misconceptions about this show that you might have seen anywhere else on the internet. I'll have a TL;DR section at the end if any of you wishes to skip the explicit content.  Also, it is not completely necessary to watch the predecessor series, Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven't. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :)    STORY: 8/10  Contrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven.   It follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...?   The story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I'm so tired of the ""Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse"" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it's been driving me nuts, so let's just get that out of the way first.  Sunshine!! CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project's setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that ""Aqours is not Muse, and they'll never be"", and ""Be Yourself"". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12.   ""Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that"" you ask? Because the purpose of this show never was to show us Aqours journey right after it is created with all 9 members, but rather to have a season where the torch of the Love Live franchise would be passed from the first generation to the second (done symbolically in episode 12 with Chika catching the feather) and to form the bonds of the members of Aqours. The last shot in episode 13 tells us that the TRUE story of Aqours is beginning now (in the really probable second season and onwards), since the shot replicates the picture that marked the beginning of Love Live! Sunshine!! and Aqours as a multimedia project back in 2015. So, this is the message that the show conveys to us, that they are different, the reasons why they are different, that is important to be yourself and that you can still be influenced by someone but you can walk your own path.  This is a huge misconception in the franchise so I wanted to get it out of the way first, that Aqours and Sunshine are just blatant carbon copies of its predecessors, trust me, they are not. The show consciously draws this parallels and breaks all the expectations they created in the first half of the show by showing us that they are indeed really different (I'll talk about the characters in the later part). That is the reason why I say this show needs you to pay attention and understand it. This plot point can be seen building up since episode 1, and then reaching its breaking point at a certain episode, which is a complete turning point to the series.  This first season servers as a set-up season to kick off with Aqours' Love Live story in the future.    ART: 8/10  There's not much to talk about here, an obvious improvement in terms of animation and art compared to the previous TV Anime seasons and that holds a resemblance with the art used on the movie which is just as good. Granted better budget, more to spend on animation and art, but the experience of the animation team clearly shows here too. Art is subjective indeed, so you can like it or dislike it depending on your standards, but it is clean and crisp.    SOUND: 9/10  Kind of the same as the art, another improvement which is to be expected since the team has now experience and a bigger budget. The OST has some quite nice tracks that can convey emotions really well.  One thing to note is how the series captures the sounds of a small and silent seaside town. The squawk of the seagulls, the sound of the waves hitting the shore, it really helps to the immersion and it sounds clean.  In terms of Music and insert songs, is subjective. I like my idol music, so I enjoyed all of the songs, not only here, but on the franchise as a whole. However, Aqours has a distinguishing feature, and is that their singing voices blend together really well and they harmonize a lot.  Coupled with the music and insert songs is the fact that the musical performances are usually linked to character development and plot progression, which is a constant of Love Live that we've seen in previous seasons. So, if you haven't seen it or you thought of them being out of place, I'd recommend you to watch them with subs or look for the lyrics of those songs, since they usually work as an extension or conclusion to a certain topic.    CHARACTER: 8/10  This. This section is probably the most important besides ""Story"".  Love Live! Sunshine!! is the successor to Love Live! School Idol Project, and Aqours is the successor to Muse, they are part of the same franchise and as such, Dengeki G's Magazine, Sunrise and Lantis need brand continuity to ensure continued profitability and success. This and the fact that they still have the same artist lets us know why are some of the girls similar in design. Is the same as other brands, for example, how the leader of a Power Ranger's team is always a really strong guy, and he becomes the red ranger, this applies the same way here. Similar character archetype and design, yet definitely different characters.  The girls are intended to be mirrors and reflections of the girls in Muse so people can remember that even though it is a new season, with a new group, it is still Love Live, it is the same franchise, thus, if you come into it looking for similarities in their characters' personalities and design, you will find them on the surface.  HOWEVER, that's all you get, since the show draws parallels between the current cast and the past cast, again, to move past them and then break those expectations and start developing them even further, to the point where they are completely different characters, yet working as a reflection of their predecessors, which is really hard to achieve. And all of them actually have reasons to act how they do which are shown in each girl's character development episodes.  Character development, although there is just a little bit because, again, this is a set-up season, is clean and easy to relate, the drama is well handled and is not forced since all of it has a proper build up, and the character interactions feel natural (except for two characters). Something that helps to this is how the relationships are formed within this group. We have childhood friends in almost every year group, and even between them. We have a pair of sisters as well, etc. All of them, except for Riko, are connected to at least one of the members even before the creation of their group, and it makes sense since they live in a small seaside town, you know that unlike in the big cities, is more likely that most of the population of a small town gets to know each other.    ENJOYMENT: 9/10  This kind of story was really enjoyable to me, giving such a nice message of ""Be Yourself"", with a cast of funny eccentric characters while still making them relatable due to the realistic and harsh situations they are put in that will most likely make us cheer for them or feel sympathy towards them if we had experienced it before. If Sunshine was your first entry into the Love Live franchise, I'd kinda bet that you may have enjoyed it as well.    OVERALL: 9/10  Love Live! Sunshine!! is a very underated show because it comes after the juggernaut that Muse was (and still is of course), and the huge popularity that they and School Idol Project attained, thus making quite a number of people not wanting to understand it and care for it.  However, that is no reason to just blindly hate on it and give it an unfair, superficial judgement. Its story is sweet and simple, yet it has a really deep meaning to it. Its characters are very lovely, enjoyable and relatable, once you get to know them well on the inside, you can see all the development they go through. The music is on point, the drama is very well handled, and my only complaint with the series would be that they wasted a big chunk of the last episode and how it kept forcing Chika and Riko in our faces, overshadowing and throwing aside the rest of the cast, but it still had some nice touching scenes and musical performances.  Looking and analyzing at how it was handled and executed, Sunshine surpasses School Idol Project S1 in almost every aspect, and that's not a bad thing, fellow fans, that's how it should be. With the extra experience and capital the production team has, they are now able to provide better storytelling, better art and animation, better production values on the whole. If they hadn't grow and learn from their mistakes in the past and improved this second time around, it would have been a big failure for the franchise.  This doesn't mean that you must enjoy one more than the other because it is better made in terms of production, enjoy whatever you want, both series are similar yet different with its own charm, and both are really, really enjoyable. But you should at least acknowledge the effort put into this series to take the anime adaptations of the franchise to a higher level.      TL;DR: Don't trust all the negative bias and superficial judgement this series has. It shows a story of self-discovery and self-appreciation with characters that are enjoyable, lovely and very different from their predecessors when you get to know them. It is by no means a carbon copy as some call it out to be, and the series shows this with facts throughout its run, addressing this openly and honestly, drawing parallels to its predecessor to then break them all and develop their cast and plot even further, and get past those comparisons as the series advances.";Recommended
8;Love Live! Sunshine!!;AndyKyrielight;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AndyKyrielight;9;Love Live! Sunshine!! is a slice of life musical anime, about nine high school girls trying their hand at becoming school idols, competing with many other schools nationwide in Love Live! Inspired by their favorite and first school idol Love Live winners, μ's, they work hard to become this years best school idol group!  Love Live! Sunshine!! While is very similar to it's original Love Live! School Idol Project anime, still manages to be just as entertaining and charming in this spin-off. The nine girls are again, all lovable in their own way, overflowing with charm and quirkiness. The humor here is even more zany and witty, while still allowing each girl to have their own development and desires that set them apart. Myself personally while I love both School Idol Project's μ's group, and Sunshine's Aqours. I love the Aqours here in Sunshine ever so slightly more, but would still highly recommend both respective Love Live anime.  Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place on a remote coast in Japan, where our girls come together from a small town to share their love of school idols together, hoping to be recognized like the more popular groups in more populated areas, and ultimately winning the Love Live competition.  The character cast is rather interesting and by that I mostly mean Saint Snow, Aqours' rival group. Since you could say they are the counterpart to A-RISE in the first season, compared to them, Ria and Seira don't start out as the biggest idol group and are the performers or characters you'd expect them to be if you know what A-RISE is like. Though Aqours faces the same issue as in the first season of the first series, I find them to be quite lovable and special on their own subjectively.  As expected, Sunshine continues to milk out outstanding idol music that's another reason to why I find Aqours to be special on their own. ''Snow Halation'' and ''Start:Dash'' have been quite the songs but I listen to a lot of Guilty Kiss (I have been doing so way before I got into LL actually) and as I go by more episodes, I can see Aqours clawing themselves in my playlist here and there.  I find myself to be comparing the first Love Live! to Sunshine a lot but it's not like the series isn't doing so itself. It isn't disconnecting itself by any means and, as a matter of fact, the series pays homage to μ's often and, to be precise, from the character standpoint, Aqours.  This doesn't exactly appeal to every audience but if you're willing to give Love Live! a try, watch the first series + the movie and come back here. If you want to see more from the series then certainly watch this!;Recommended
9;Love Live! Sunshine!!;kokusu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kokusu;9;Idol anime aren't really something I've seen too much of, even though I love watching musicals in general. The original Love Live was actually the first idol anime I have seen, so there isn't much of a reference for me on if this actually was any good or not, besides my personal enjoyment of things, so my rating for Sunshine comes mostly from that personal point of view on what makes the show enjoyable for me.  Story (7/10): The story might be the biggest weakness of Sunshine. Too much of the time is about trying to follow the nine muses of the original and catch the shining light of them. Most of the time it's about trying the same things in a different setting and only near the end, they finally try to go their own way.  Art (8/10): There isn't much negative to say about the look of Sunshine. The 3d stuff finally better and the rest is great to look at anyway, so I would have only prefered less of the 3d stuff in the dance numbers, but it's still really good.  Sound (9/10): I actually liked most of the songs and the voice actors did a great job. Nothing really to say here.  Characters (9/10): I believe that the characters are what makes Sunshine better to me. Yes, they don't seem like more than the original girls, but their interactions and reactions to things feel better to me. While µ's always had their happy-go-lucky charm, which made them pretty much win anything, Aquors has it much harder and actually loses at most things. They are sad, they cry, but together they never give up. Fitting the title of the show, the girls shine thanks to their faults and instead of going for the top, they are just happy with turning that 0 into a 1. To me this makes Chika a better leader and her group into something I want to follow and see develop. That's also where most of my enjoyment comes from. Yes there is more drama, but it's always used to have the characters grow and try to become better. It's not about being the best school idol group, but about being best friends.  Overall (9/10): While I would have prefered the story to be more of its own thing, it's actually used in the end to have the characters grow into their own kind of school idol and I'm looking forward to more of that in Season 2. For now I think that this was just slightly worse than Season 2 of the original, but I was definitely happy with what I got.;Recommended
10;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Yohane01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yohane01;10;"Now I know that this is a pretty high review for an idol show. But this little show really changed a lot for me. My attitude, my opinion on certain things, and of course my music taste! I've never watched many inspirational anime before, so this one was pretty new to me. The story of a bunch of girls trying to save their school seems like a pretty simple one. But this was a truly sweet show. It really helped me out in my personal life, as before I watched it I was a really dark person. But it quickly brought me out of all that negativity and gave me a more positive world to look at.  After watching this show, I knew I had found my favorite anime. I'll always look back fondly on some moments like when riko and yohane had to take care of a stray dog they found. Or the third years finally making up from a fight; that left them apart for almost two years. And if you wanna cry, then there's plenty of tear jerking scenes in this show.  The shows graphics are really good, with all the girls looking extra kawaii. If you've heard the music then I'm sure you can agree that the songs sound great. And the enjoyment for it is never ending really, there's basically a whole love live universe to emerse yourself in if you want. They've got games, (that unfortunately take up a lot of space on your phone.) two movies, three shows, music to jam too, and a ton of merch to choose from. A lot of people like the original show, while there's nothing at all wrong with it. I prefer Sunshine's characters over theirs any day. I've fell in love with the likes of kanan, Mari, and my favorite riko.  Riko's been my favorite waifu of all for a long time now. All in all this show is amazing, and if your ever feeling down then definitely give this a watch. Theirs a whole inspirational idol universe to drag yourself down into. Come on down to idol hell with us, the waters fine.";Recommended
11;Love Live! Sunshine!!;superp2222;https://myanimelist.net/profile/superp2222;9;"After having a chunk of my soul firmly ripped out by the ending of the Love Live Movie, I heavily debated whether or not I would be able to bear the pain of knowing that the µ's we had come to know and love over these past 24 something episodes and a movie would no longer be the group we follow. After several hours on Reddit, I ultimately decided to continue, I haven't looked back since.  Story Love Live Sunshine depicts a similar story in a different setting, with familiar aspects making returns while new ones arise. We start with a core trio in their second year of high school, with one of them having been inspired to become a School Idol, she quickly gathers her other friends and starts recruiting, along the way, the core trio helps the first years overcome their nervousness, while helping the third years atone for their past mistakes. A conflict of interest inevitably comes up, as well as the risk of the school closing down. The first concert is inevitably one of the more memorable ones, no matter how well it does, and the crew's choreography and song composition inevitably climbs from there. From an outsider's perspective, it would inevitably seem that the Studio itself is clinging to the legacy µ's left behind, as the characters introduced, the sequence of events, and the plotline all paralleled events that µ's went through as a group, until it didn't. It should also be noted that while these events parallel the things µ's went through, they certainly did not parallel the depth of each event. Aquors experienced way more hardship along the way compared to what µ's did, even doing really badly at their first concerts, but eventually slowly climbing their way all the way to the top of the leaderboards. While the majority of the season was basically a carbon copy, around 2/3 of the way through, our new idol group, now affectionately named Aquors, realizes that they aren't µ's, and will no way match what µ's made into a legacy, instead, they split away from the carbon copy plotline to form their own. This obvious copied plotline splitting into a new one makes for an oddly stunning realization to the viewer that that plotline is exactly what their train of thought is. We all started this series pleading for any chance to see µ's again, but we slowly come to know and love each and every member of Aquors. Well Played.  Art and Sound From the first moment the OP played, it became clear that Aquors was its own thing, while the animation style remained the same, because, duh, its from the same studio. There was an interesting shift of atmosphere. Not because this time the story's set in a coastal town, but because of the namesake. Everything done in this season reflects the name ""Sunshine"". Everything's brighter, and I mean everything. Of course, you can't have an idol anime without its music, and this is where Aquors truly shines in its individuality. Their songs are notably brighter, happier, and perhaps shinier than µ's tracks. It makes sense on a physical level, considering that many of the voice actors in Aquors have higher voice registers or know how to sing higher than most members of µ's, but also because of the namesake once again, While µ's specialized in dreamy, sparkling music, Aquors bursts in with such an overwhelming amount of positivity I would honest-to-god recommend their tracks to the more pessimistic people in life. A comparison between the two season's OPs also proves my point. µ's Bokura wa Ima no Naka de is an absolute banger, however, when you hear Aquors's Aozora Jumping Heart, you are instantly filled with more determination than Honoka's ever had in her time spent with µ's. It shows how serious Aquors is about setting their own legacy and how much skill they have to back it up.  Characters The characters of Aquors and µ's share a lot of similar traits like, a TON of similarities. Here's a few I noticed before diving into the specifics of each character. A few of the similarities were shuffled between characters, possibly to mix things up a bit, but ultimately they show up in both groups - An extremely upbeat, overly hyper orange haired protagonist - A grey haired second year who's the protagonist's lifelong friend - A second year who sacrificed time at her other club to be at the School Idol Club - An overly shy 1st year - The best friend of the overly shy 1st year with a signature catchphrase - A third wheeling 1st year who everyone also likes - A foreigner 3rd year with a signature catchphrase in their mother tongue - Another 3rd year who tried starting their own School Idol Group but failed for whatever reason - A 3rd year who's the Student Council President - A pianist who serves as the composer for the group  Those were just a few of the similarities the groups have, of course, these listed traits have been shuffled from person to person, but it still bears an undeniable similarity to µ's and therefore an even bigger reason for that hole in your heart to open back up.  Overall, I feel that despite being basically a carbon copy of the original Love Live with some uniqueness to them, it still feels reasonable and not bad. The explanation behind this makes sense too, that Aquors is simply trying to find their own path, what makes them different from µ's, and their own unique musical style. It keeps that hole in your heart open, but at the same time also seals it. Its refreshing knowing that the group that inspired us also inspired them, and I can't wait to see what this group will do";Recommended
12;Love Live! Sunshine!!;jc9622;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jc9622;8;"We all know that Love Live! is an economically successful franchise. I admit, I've also sinked some of my money on Love Live! 'cause I'm a big fan of the franchise. So it's no surprise that this got a spin off. I was really hyped for Sunshine and now that I finished the series, did it live up to my expectations?  (This review will contain SPOILERS)  [Story] When Sunshine got announced, I got really excited because I wanted to see more Love Live!. I was skeptical though because when I saw the 10 minutes character introduction PV for LL Sunshine, not only do some characters of this new group look like the original cast from Love Live! (You and Kotori, Mari and Eli, and etc.) but also, some of the characters' personalities are alike. They basically show you the bio of the new characters in the video and that's how I learned about their personalities.  Just like the 1st Season of Love Live!, the story here is relatively simple and fairly similar to the 1st Season of LL. The difference here is Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place about 5 years after µ's disbanded and now focuses on a new group called ""Aquors"" (pronounced as Aqua) which consists of 9 girls aspiring to become the next famous school idol like µ's. Just like the previous seasons of Love Live though, I don't really give a shit about the story since the school idols are the main focus of the series and the songs.  The aspect that I found a bit annoying, but nothing major, in Sunshine is the constant references of µ's and callbacks. Yes, I get it. They won Love Live and they're very famous but I just found it really annoying that the show constantly mentions µ's this and that. For example, the episode that introduced us to Hanamaru. I got really irritated at the end of the episode because of how much they were focusing on Rin's shot. I get it, she's relating herself to Rin but it was too much. Now, there's a reason why I didn't exactly dislike the said aspect that much.  In the first 7 episodes, Chika was basically following µ's' footsteps and thinking that if she does exactly what µ's did, she and her group would become just as popular as µ's. I'm glad that the 8th episode completely blew my conception of Sunshine being just a ""blatant rip-off of Love Live!"". I really love the 8th episode because it was reality slapping Chika's face. Aquors got 0 points in the preliminaries and she realizes that ever since µ's won Love Live, the idol competition has become way more competitive than before and she also realized that simply copying µ's won't get them to where they want to go. Man, I am loving this ""From nothing to something"" concept that I've been seeing in anime lately. Aquors' song ""Step!Zero to One!"" now makes perfect sense. Btw, that song is really good.  Love Live Sunshine is also aware of the fact that Aquors is copying µ's and that's the reason why I mostly changed my mind about the constant references and callbacks of µ's in earlier parts of the series. In the 12th episode, Chika realized how µ's exactly got successful and also realized that she needs to stop copying µ's, be their own selves and forge a new path, breaking away from µ's. This whole season is basically about Aquors forming and learning about who they truly are. I'm quite excited for the 2nd Season, now that Aquors is heading on their own path towards success. ______________________________________________________________ [Art/Animation]: (9.5/10) The art style of the original Love Live was decent, at best and the character designs looked good but was too moe, for my taste, but I got used to it. Also, just like everyone else, I hated the use of CGI in µ's Live Shows. However, in Love Live Sunshine, every aspect of the show's visuals and animation is significantly improved. The art style looks better, the visuals and backgrounds is more superior than the predecessor and the character designs looks like more work was put into it. The Live Shows, for once, doesn't burn my eyes. It's looks like Sunrise learned how to utilize and blend the CGI and 2D Animation perfectly. Seriously, watching Aquors' CGI performance was a lot more bearable than watching µ's CGI performance. ______________________________________________________________ [Sound]: (10/10) As a µ's fan, I'm sorry for betraying µ's by saying this but Aquors' songs sounds A LOT better than most µ's songs. Aquors songs sounds more energetic and lively as opposed to µ's dramatic-tune and sometimes melancholic but with a touch of happiness (That's the best I can explain µ's songs). In LL 1st Season, the only songs that I liked was START:DASH and Susume Tommorow. In Sunshine, I love almost every song. Some examples are Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu (which completely shits on almost every µ's song that I've listened to in the past few years), Omoi yo hitotsu ni nare, and more because you get what I'm trying say here. I just wished that they used ""Step!Zero to One"" in the last episode because it would have fit the show's context.  The OP theme song is ""Aozora Jumping Heart"" by Aquors. I really love this OP the same reason I love the mentioned songs earlier. It's better than the 1st OP of Love Live but it's on par with the 2nd OP of Love Live. The ED theme song is ""Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou "" by Aquors. Just like the first OP, I also love this song but if I have to be more specific, I love the version where only Chika and Riko were singing. I think this is better than the 1st ED of Love Live! but the 2nd ED of Love Live! is still better than Sunshine's ED.  I watched the show in English Dub and Subs but I'm only going to review the Japanese's VA's singing talent. Chika, Riko and You's singing voices are godlike and they're 50% of the reason why Aquors' songs are great. Hell, that's the reason why I think ""Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu"" is better than most µ's songs. Their voices are just absolutely amazing and I'd prefer if Chika, Riko and You have their own subunit. I still don't know why one of Aquors' official subunit comprises of Chika, You and Ruby. It should have been Riko instead of Ruby :/ ______________________________________________________________ [Characters]: (8/10) Despite all the good things that I've been saying about Aquors, I still like the members of µ's more than the members of Aquors. It's not because Aquors is uninteresting. It's because the characters from Love Live! has way more screentime and character development than Aquors at the moment. Once Sunshine gets 2nd Season and a movie then I'll love Aquors just as much as I love µ's.  Like the original Love Live!, Sunshine has 9 characters and evenly split into 3 girls per grade. I just want to say that the difference between Aquors having 9 members and µ's having 9 members is that µ's 9 members group had meaning into it and makes perfect sense because of the name of their group while Aquors' amount of members is just....umm..yea.....Who cares, right? Gotta stick with the winning formula and I'm not complaining. Anyways, the first years are Ruby Kurosawa, Hanamaru Kunikida and Yoshiko Tsushima (Yohane). Ruby is Dia's younger sister and she's shy and bit of an introvert girl. To make it more simpler, she's like Hanayo except I found Ruby to be a lot more cuter but Hanayo's extreme love for rice was what made her more likable. Hanamaru is Ruby's best friend and she loves to read books and she has little to no knowledge when it comes to technology since she lives at a temple. She says ""zura"" at the end of her sentence all the time. To make it more simpler, she's like Rin except she's a bookworm and she doesn't get on my goddamn nerves. Then there's Yoshiko, a chuunibyou girl who thinks she's the ""fallen angel"" and she prefers to be called by her persona ""Yohane"". Honestly, I still prefer Nico over her but I can't help but love her ""Yohane"" persona. I wouldn't mind sacrificing myself to become her little demon.  Then there's the second years Chika Takami, You Watanabe and Riko Sakurauchi. You (Pronounced as Yo) is Chika's longtime childhood friend and has a habit of dressing up in a sailor suit since she's a marine enthusiast. You is currently my best girl of the series. Judging by her appearance, you'd think she's like Kotori except she's not. Besides her designing Aquors' costumes, hers and Kotori's personality are nothing alike. You is more lively and her voice doesn't make my ears bleed while Kotori is the cute girl but with an ear-piercing voice. As much as I want to make a You pun right now, I don't want to because I love ""you"" and I really don't want to break ""you"" 're heart by making all these terrible puns xD. Chika is the enthusiastic leader of Aquors. I just want to mention that Chika got way more character development than Honoka did in the 1st Season of LL. In the original LL, it wasn't until the 2nd Season where Honoka got a character development. Even so, Chika's character development is already more impressive than Honoka so even though both characters' enthusiasm and determination to reach their goals are the same, I still prefer Chika over Honoka. Riko is a transfer student from Otonokizaka High (µ's school) and a girl who plays the piano. Riko is like a mixture of Umi and Maki and I really like her Maki side. In other words, I like it when Riko gets all flattered over something.  Then there's the third years Dia Kurosawa, Mari Ohara, and Kanan Matsura. Dia (Pronounced as ""Daya"" or as in Diamond) is the student council president. She's mostly like Eli, in terms of her being stubborn at times and the way she acts as a student council president. The similarities are there. The difference here is Dia has a legitimate reason for rejecting Chika's application sheet to form a school idol club. I mean, Eli has a legitimate reason too but both of their reasons are completely different. Mari is a rich girl who decided to come back to Uranohoshi after hearing about someone forming a school idol. I really thought Mari was going to be either Nozomi or Eli but boy, was I wrong. I mean, the only similarities between Mari and Nozomi is they both like to grope someone's breast but other than that, their personalities are completely different. I also love Mari's ""Engrish"" catchphrases. Especially her ""It's joke"" quote and my most favourite is her ""Oh My God!"" quote. Fun fact: Mari's ""It's joke"" quote was kept in the English Dub version but almost every one of her Engrish quotes was changed to an Italian accent. Kanan is that almost non-existent character who barely made an appearance in the first half of the series but had more screentime in the second half. I started liking Kanan more when the third years were getting more focus on the early 2nd half of the series. ______________________________________________________________ [Enjoyment]: (8.5/10) Face it people, µ's time is over and it's Aquors' time to shine. The sooner you accept that, the more you'll enjoy this show like I did. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Chika and her determination to never give up even though she got cornered but managed to got herself out of the position. Plus, the songs are better than most songs from µ's. Currently, my Aquors-created playlist in my phone is now at over 13 songs and counting. ______________________________________________________________ [VERDICT] When Love Live Sunshine and Aquors first got introduced, I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought they wouldn't live up to µ's' greatness. Now that I finished Sunshine, the series blew away my expectations. As of right now, µ's is still better but Aquors has a lot of potential to overtake µ's and as time grows on, they'll either be on par with them or end up being better than them. I mean, most of Aquors' songs are already better than what the 1st Season of LL offered. The story is recycled but I kind-of saw this coming since the 2nd Season of LL did the same shit. Also, the µ's references and callbacks were a bit dragged out. The character is where it's at though. The character development for the third years and the 2nd year, especially Chika were really good but just like the 2nd Season of LL, their character development will definitely get better (and hopefully more character development for the first years) once Sunshine gets 2nd Season.   [OVERALL]: (8.5/10)   Pros: +Aquors turned out to be a very lovable idol group at the end of the series +Aquors' songs are great and better than µ's songs from 1st and 2nd Season +Enjoyable characters with amazing character dynamics between two or three Aquors members +Great character development for Chika and the 3rd years +Visually Appealing Animation +CGI in Live Shows is significantly improved  Cons: -Constant references and callback to µ's got a bit annoying";Recommended
13;Love Live! Sunshine!!;MagicalMahou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MagicalMahou;8;"What does it mean to shine?  In lieu of the mainstream media and audiences embracing 'dark and mature' storytelling in favor of 'childish junk' catered towards 12 year olds, this question shouldn't even be relevant in today's world. Yet here it is, in all of its glory. And for the past six years, only one franchise dared to ever raise that question in the 2010s.  Love Live has enjoyed worldwide popularity, and not just because it has cute girls and really nice songs. If such were the case, then that would mean stuff like Show by Rock! would be popular. Sunrise doesn't just take what it sees and rolls with it, adding irrelevant junk and catering to '""realistic"", cute-girls-need-to-suffer fags' and 'wish-fulfillment' like IM@S does, but instead, takes the whole package; by creating story about girls striving to shine, and really, that's all it needs to be. ""So, how different, then, is it from other idol shit like Aikatsu?"" I'll tell you why.  Because Love Live succeeds at it. Especially Sunshine.  I'll be the first to admit that I was downright skeptical when this was first announced. I was worried it was going to be a copy of the first season, making the same formulaic recruitment episodes and drama, and the mistakes that plagued it. And oh boy was I wrong. I mentioned earlier that Sunrise takes the 'whole package', so what exactly is in it? It's everything about idols. From the way they dress, what they sing down to the girl's personalities and the struggles of adolescence. However, they didn't always succeed at using it. Let's date back to the first Love Live season. While superb in its own way, there were things that prevented perfect enjoyment, such as issues with characterization and drama, as well as circumstances that made little to no sense on the part of some character arcs. All of these problems were whisked away with the advent of Love Live S2, which is probably the most inspiring piece of media I have ever watched. No teen melodrama or action-induced fantasy isekai story is able to say ""go do something better with your life"" better than this particular second season has, filled to the brim with sad and happy moments that touch my heart deeply. And after just one year after Muse ended their story, Sunshine arrived. Seeing as it'd be another first season, you could understand my fear. But Sunshine does more than just correct the mistakes of the first season. It takes the very concept of creating a school idol group and makes it its own. Sure, the entire ordeal is formulaic on paper, but the way it blossoms is just so spectacular and uplifting, its as though its not Love Live at all. Yet at the same time, it is.  At first glance, the character designs look about the same, with some copied tropes from the previous series (e.g. student council president, the clumsy one, the shy one, the ""futsu no onna"" one, the groper etc.). I'm not gonna surprise you by saying ""OH! BUT THEYRE DIFFERENT!"", no. Essentially, they are different takes on the trope, and this is necessary if Sunshine really wants to tell a new kind of story. What makes these characters stand out and shine on their own is the way they are characterized, and this has a lot to do with the involvement of Muse. It's actually amazing how much influence a group of characters that aren't even there have on the story. In Sunshine, Muse have moved on from singing school girls to living, breathing gods. From the way they're only seen through posters to the way the characters talk about them with revere and divinity. Heck, in one of the episodes, one of the girls sends a fan letter to Honoka (from the first 2 seasons) but it sounds more like a fucking prayer than fan mail. Essentially, Idol anime are character stories, taking the viewer through the journey of a girl to become the number one star. And while some anime require about a hundred episodes to make a story whole, some only need as few as 13. Sunshine is rich with flavorful characterization, often using visual directing to do most of the talking rather than outright telling. The use of common/cheesy phrases and emphasis of tone help bring out what these girls are, pulling away from the idea that every teenage girl is a dark, wild and emo Chloe Moretz and instead giving the audience something very different. They give them dreams; desires, none poisonous, but awfully human and representative of who the girls are inside and out. From painful outbursts to soft-spoken sympathy, Sunshine embraces the use of imagery and dialogue to tell us who these characters really are without (mostly) words. A girl seeking acceptance taking a stray hand, a girl who hasn't once dreamed of breaking out of her shell witnessing it on a magazine cover, the desire to shine brighter than diamonds with everyone you've met; there are simply so many things to take from these characters, and in only 13 episodes. Sure, it can be lacking at times, but what the series delivered was more than enough. I'm not going to say what exactly was developed and how; that's for you to experience yourself. Side-characters were also great, but a bit underused. Of course, with idols, you're always going to have competition and just from simply existing, Saint Snow captures that feeling of intimidation almost perfectly. From their music, to the way they walk, they were certainly very captivating, not only in terms of fear for the main cast, but in their outright beauty. The rest of the cast were your supportive sisters and classmates, and were utilized well if to help the series lose that feeling of insularity.  Going technical, Sunshine not only looks better, is animated better or sounds better. It also FEELS better. It's taken the spirit of Love Live and turned it into something so engrossing and captivating to watch. The short moments on stage are always spectacular, showcasing lots of fluid choreography and outstanding cinematography that puts the original series' efforts to dirt. . While newcomers will be engulfed by the simply beautiful direction of these sequences, old time fans will be welcomed again by the feelings and passionate emotion present in the film or even, dare I say, the Final Live. The music is also fantastic. Every track resembled what was happening at the moment of the series and creates a wholly immersive experience when listening to the tune and lyrics. The best example I can give is Saint Snow's performance, 「Self Control」. It was certainly the most memorable moment in the series, not only in introducing Saint Snow as an idol group or a threat, but as professionals; a pair that knew exactly what they were doing and knew how to do it good. The backdrop work and animating are nothing short of ecstatic. There is more fluidity in the character and mouth movements, use of lighting and colors are beautifully done and the sound quality is great. There is simply no reason not to watch this in 1080p, if only to get the full experience of the series. On part of directing outside of character drama, there is a whole slew of hilarious moments. Some great, some just okay but nothing ever a bad joke. The timing of the jokes and delivery are a lot better than in previous seasons, where it was usually out of nowhere or just downright unfunny at times. Slice of Life moments had great presentation, making use of attractive sea-like colors for reflection and energy of the scene, to drive out the boredom. This is money very well spent on Sunrise's part.  Love Live! Sunshine!! recaptures the beauty of the original series through different lens and delivers something that exceeded all of my expectations. It is the second series this year that's made me feel so emotionally captivated, enough to make me shed tears. 2016 wasn't so great but with gems like these, any year can be truly memorable. I look forward to whatever Sunrise has in store for the franchise next, or if we're ever getting that Yohane spin-off that's in high demand right now.  8/10";Recommended
14;Love Live! Sunshine!!;KuroKagami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KuroKagami;8;"As a big fan of Love Live I was really expecting Love Live Sunshine this summer. Most of the Love Live fanbase was trying so much to hate this anime since Aquors was replacing µ's and most of them were trying to hate the new girls. I always thought Sunshine would make a fresh new start in the series and would make us like the new girls in a different way we loved µ's. Sadly, Love Live Sunshine didn't live up on my expectations, but still it is a very enjoyable anime.  Story 5/10  Even though I started liking the story, the writing becomes repetitive. Most of the ideas were taken out from the first anime: Start:Dash moment, school is closing again, some characters were retired idols. While I feel like µ's spent too much time practicing and worrying about Love Live, Aquors like to hang out and eat ice cream. During the final episodes, Chika wants to practice a lot, but still, it seems like the anime focuses more on ""cute girls doing cute things"".  Character 7/10  I'm not disappointed with the character writing, but I don't feel overwhelmed neither. Most of the characters were already written in Love Live. Chika is a Honoka clone: it's the exact same character with no actual reason to become school idol except ""I want to shine"". We have Ruby, a Hanayo-like character who is cute and loves idols. Dia is the student council president that doesn't want Chika to become an idol at first, exactly like Eli. Mari is a Nozomi like character who says english stuff combined with japanese, she also rubs everyone's breasts...uhh. Then we have Riko, who is an Um -like character combined with Maki's abilities, she serves as the protagonist main love interest and best friend (I'm not kidding here). Kanan is a gloomy character that becomes more like Eli as time passes. Yoshiko is probably one of my favorite characters, even though her character has been done a lot of times; she delivers fun like Nico in a Chunii way, but Nico is probably funnier, and I don't like Nico a lot. I feel like Hanamaru and You are the best characters here. You is a girl with a lot of security but she's kind of jealous, she is always smiling and cheering people up; she isn't a Kotori, since Kotori is always trying to accept everyone's opinions, even when hers are being rejected. Hanamaru is a Rin-like character, except she isn't Rin; she always says ""zura"" except of ""nya"", but she has a lot of character development and I can understand her character a lot.  Art and Sound 10/10  As always, Love Live delivers colorful art along with beautiful music. The animation is fine, thanks to Sunrise. All performances look gorgeous and the girls look pretty.  Enjoyment 8/10  The anime is pretty dramatic and funny, so you will always get a lot of laughs and tears. There aren't many plot twists, so it loses a lot of Enjoyment, since you know the girls are going to make it eventually.  Overall 8/10  With repetitive characters, mediocre story writing, but beautiful music and sound, Love Live Sunshine!! will be loved by LoveLivers but it lacks the spirit the first anime had.";Recommended
15;Love Live! Sunshine!!;bbmitsuri;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bbmitsuri;9;Love Live is my all time favorite anime.  It's story was way more exciting than what I expected from an idol anime.  Next to the wonderful music, there's a game too!  The art is very interesting and pleasing to the eye.  The main character, Chika, is very similar to Honoka, bubbly yet her mood can be easily changed. That's the only bad thing I can say about LL.  This is a 10/10 in my eyes but i needed to look through a perspective where I coincided all the plot problems and what could have been changed.  All in all, amazing anime.

17;Love Live! Sunshine!!;captjoe213;https://myanimelist.net/profile/captjoe213;8;Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! We find ourselves once again in idol territory and what a good time it's been! As always we're working from the dubbed version (sorry guys, I don't dislike subs by any means, I just default out to dub if there's a version available) and this will be dealing with season 1 only. The quick of things is while Sunshine is slightly inferior to the original Love Live! (you never forget your first loves I guess) it's still more than worth your time to watch. Let's see how brightly we can all shine!  Note: instead of constantly referring to seasons, I'm going to break this down reference-wise to dealing with the idol group names. I'll refer to seasons 1 and 2 as Muse, this season as Aqours. Saves me some writing, you some reading, and hopefully keeps the confusion to a minimum.  Story: 7 There's an immediate and obvious knock against the story, that being the group is so much similar to Muse in looks, behaviors, and such that it was hard for me to keep up at first with who was who in Aqours. Every time I saw gray haired You in Aqours I had immediate expectations for her to be the airhead of the group, the same as Kotori from Muse. Of course there is a world of difference in character between the two, but because appearances are somewhat similar, early on, I kept associating Aqours members with their Muse lookalikes. This was dispelled fairly quickly, but was somewhat irksome at first. It doesn't help when there are characters like Aqour's Chika who even in motivation and personality resembles Muse's Honoka. An expected complaint I'm sure, but still one worth noting.  The big knock for me on the story was the ever-present plot device of 'omg our school will close down if we're not successful!' How many times do we have to beat this dead horse in anime? Is there a single anime school that *isn't* on the verge of closure and reorganization? It's a tired trope that I'm frankly just sick of. And in this story it's even more irritating as Muse had to deal with the same problem in their story as well. So we do have similar looking characters, some with similar personality traits, with the same total members by the end of the show's run (9), and once again the school is facing closure. This loops back around on my 'too similar' complaint. But please, anime creators who I know troll through MAL's review section reading reviews with only a few 'likes', drop the school closing act. We've been there, done that too many times.  While once we accept the plot device and move on with the story, we find a nice little tale of the girls coming together and working hard to fulfill their dreams. This is another well worn idea, but is still fun and inspiring when done right, and Aqours mostly gets it right. They are also more realistic than Muse in their goals, deciding that making Love Live! competition is enough, and that instead of saving the school, they just want to see an increase in applicants, see that their efforts has inspired others. Sure, shoot for the moon, but understanding one's limitations can be important too. They also score a victory in getting the 3rd year girls on stage after they miss an important opportunity in their freshman year. Winning Love Live! would surely be an acceptable outcome, of course, but part of their victory is just getting there, and getting attention for their cause.  The story in this first season of Aqour's story wraps up nicely, and we can see they were obviously planning a sequel because they leave the story open ended. They do give us strong clues to the resolution of the plot points, but also leave inroads for further adventures with the girls. It's really hard to find a good balance between closing out a storyline in a way that is acceptable just in case there's no sequel season, and leaving the story open enough not to feel forced if there is. Aqours does this perfectly. Just enough satisfaction to leave me pleased, but enough mystery to make me want to see more.  There is however, another huge problem we have this time around, and its the same as last time: the opening theme. While the theme is in place for the entire series, we have characters that are openly hostile to the idol program at first singing and dancing in full costume in the opening number. Its a very self-spoiling thing. There's a point where a character basically is saying there's no way in hell she'd become a school idol, yet there she is at the beginning of the episode in full costume dancing and singing onstage. This irked the hell out of me, though I must say Muse's first season did the same thing.  Otherwise we get exactly what we're expecting to get from this story. If you liked Muse, you'll be right at home, as the concepts are so similar, the characters are likable, and the slice of life parts of their coming together are fun. If you've not seen Muse's story, I would recommend starting with them, however, even though Aqours is a strong entry, I still feel Muse slightly edges them out of the top spot. Again we get singing and dancing teen girls laying down sugary sweet J-pop type tunes and just being overall silly yet coming together and working hard for their goals. Felt like slipping into comfortable grooves yet new enough to make it fun.  Art: 9 The art is gorgeous but that's to be expected. Muse looked damn good, and these girls do too. Lots of nice detail in the art, and the girls are cute as buttons. The costumes are intricate, and perhaps border on too busy at moments, but I think they pulled it off without going too far over that line. The girls are all recognizable whether in their idol costumes, their workout clothes, or their school uniforms. The eyes are beautiful done in this series and little details are attended to nicely. I personally love the look of this entire series a great deal.  Sound: 9 Again we have several songs in the show, as is expected from the idol genre. There's not as many as there is in other shows, thinking of the Idolmaster series in particular, but there's more than say, K-On. The music that is played is lighthearted and fun, and fits the girls and the group perfectly. The opening theme is almost as good as Muse's, which is high praise, as I'll listen to Muse's opening in my general playlist. The closer is really great as well, and I found myself humming along many times.  The dub voice actors are all pretty well chosen, none of them knocking too close to annoying. There is a few quirks among the group, including a country girl who says 'zura' nearly every sentence. At least no one 'nyans' in the series. From what I understand, the 'zura' girl doesn't say that with any conscious thought, that its kind of like saying 'yall' for us Southerners, we often forget we're even saying it unless someone points it out. In fact, 'zura' girl actually asks another girl to poke her and remind her to quit saying it while they are in Tokyo, visiting the big city. So I think it's a rural thing, this 'zura' saying, and that makes it a bit more understandable than the aforementioned annoying meowing cat girls.  Character: 8 There are some very interesting characters this time around, especially as we get used to the new lineup for Aqours. The primary 'leader' girl is kind of what you would expect, the hard working, determined type, but that's natural I think, as that's the type that usually *is* the leader in these situations. The 3rd years are all extremely well played, Dia standing out really well in my mind. There are moments between the 3rd years when shocking secrets come out, and a couple of 'holy shit, did she really just do that!?' moments to be had as well. In this regard I think they actually played it up better than Muse did. Muse had it's share of twists and turns, but they were rather softball pitches, and not as attention grabbing as some of the private moments between the 3rd years this time around.  The rest of the girls are well played, if a little stereotypical. There's the shy girl of course, and the rich girl, though moneybags isn't pointed out anywhere near as often as Muse's was. This time around we even get sisters in the group, and their dynamic is pretty interesting. There's also relationship issues in Aqours that didn't exist in Muse, at least not in the same context. These new takes on how the girls related to each other is another thing that does set the show apart from its predecessor.  There is an awesome comic relief girl that is even more attached to an alternate personality than Nico was in Muse. This girl goes around saying she's a fallen angel and carrying on in this silly supernatural/occult manner, speaking of demons and falling from heavens and calling on dark powers to aid her and all. So we do get some nice variety between the personalities we are served up.  Enjoyment: 8 I did really like Aqours' journey towards the Love Live! competition, and I'm eager to see where the next season is going to go with their story. The show is a lot of fun, whether the girls are fixing thousand dollar plates of food at the snack bar they run on the beach (rich people and wasting money, argh) or if they are gasping in awe as they go around the big city and take in life from the fast lane. Their adventures never got stale, the music was good, and the personalities featured played well off of each other.  If you have watched Muse's story, just be ready to realign your brain around the Aqours members varying personalities. The gray-haired girl is no longer the airhead, the blonde isn't the hardass, the purple-haired 3rd year is no longer the sage source of wisdom for the group. Once you can get everyone sorted in your mind, you're going have a great time, I believe.  Best Girl: Tsushima Yoshiko, or as she's known in her 'fallen angel' persona, Yohane. If I can't have a tsundere girl, give me the weirdo every time. With Yoshiko's insistence on being a fallen angel rising from the ashes or falling from grace or what have you, I just couldn't help but be smitten. She's also the primary comedic relief for the group, and is always pulling antics that made me laugh out loud. Dark forces, I call upon you to protect my beloved Yohane!  Again, I think Muse is the better idol group, but only by a hair. Aqours is very close on their heels. I found this to be a wonderful show with lots of flair and style. This one does beat out Muse in the drama department, and the secrets of the past that the 3rd years carry isn't life shattering, but they do put enough of a twist on things to really demand attention. As long as you can put up with the whole 'school closure' thing, I think you'll be entertained as you watch the girls rise up and chase their dreams. No new RTLR pictures as I'm basically out of space now, but Yoshiko is making the shelves of little demon figures. So rise from the underworld, oh ye servants of darkness, and help me thumbs up Love Live! Sunshine!;Recommended
18;Love Live! Sunshine!!;BasedGodgers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BasedGodgers;8;"Love Live Sunshine is the second installment of the very popular Love Live franchise. There were people when this anime was announced were unhappy this even existed and couldn't come to grasp that Muse was officially over. The anime has officially wrapped up so the question is, does it live up the expectations set by its predecessor?  MINOR SPOILER WARNING  Story: 8 One of the bigger complaints when this anime was first announced and what was shown in the first few episodes is the copy/paste of the plot from the original Love Live. Such moments include the student council president forbidding a school idol club, a girl who's good at the piano but initially refuses to be a part of the idol group, the ""Start Dash"" moment of the first performance, etc. The main ideas of those plot points are in there but are executed differently. For example, Dia's reason for not allowing a school idol club makes sense (although selfish) instead of Eli's reasoning of trying to save the school her way and not something as silly as a school idol club. In all honesty, I think the story was one of the better parts as they handled the plot portion better and there didn't feel as if there was forced drama. Now let me explain. In the original Love Live, most of the story was just forming the group, practicing, having some cute moments and preparing for Love Live. Somewhere down the line Sunrise figured they needed to add in a drama part so the last 3-4 episodes involved Kotori's decision on going to Los Angeles for fashion. In Sunshine, the drama involved the past of Kanon, Dia, and Mari and why Kanon/Dia were against school idols which was a sub plot up until episode 9 when the full group is formed. Other characters had their drama moments but this was the ""big"" one of the season which I liked.  Overall, I felt that even with the plot points of the original present, the full plot was executed better.  Art: 10  The CGI looks lots better here. The 2D art makes the girls look really cute and the CGI makes them look really pretty (the performances are probably one of the high points of this show). The scenery and other characters look really well drawn and a pleasant treat for the eyes. Probably one of the best parts of this show for me.  Sound: 8  Now one of the big things about an anime about music is...having good music. The music here is good but it lacks the ""wow"" factor of the original (granted the original Love Live existed for 3 years prior to the anime so they had a selection of music available) but none of the music in Sunshine compared to listening to Bokura wa Ima no Naka de or No Brand Girls for me. Having said that, Young Dreamer is probably my favorite song from Sunshine. Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (the ED sang by various combonations of Aqours) is pretty good too.  Character: 8  The best parts of the Love Live franchise are the music and characters. I feel that, compared to the original, the characters here are worse (I do not like Kanon at all) but they're still enjoyable overall. They kind of fill the cliche's from the original (leader, loyal best friend, girl who thinks she doesn't fit as a school idol, shy girl) but how they act and interact with each other is enjoyable. Just like the original, you will probably find a character you really enjoy and take part in the waifu wars for Sunshine.  Enjoyment 8:  This was the one anime I was looking forward to this season so when the weekend came I was ready to watch Sunshine. I liked the anime and enjoyed watching the ups and downs the characters faced in the show and the adventure they went on to become school idols.  Overall 8:  Sunshine's story is better executed and the art looks better than the original but the music and characters are less enjoyable than the original. Having said that, the girls of Aqours are a good replacement to Muse and can only expect good things in the future from them. Yosoro!";Recommended
19;Love Live! Sunshine!!;AoiYukihira004;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AoiYukihira004;9;"I give this 9 ? Really ? A school idol story with being shadow by u's and i give it 9 ? Here my opinion about this series :  1. Story Protagonist, Chika, willing to form a school idol group in her shool because she like u's and want to be them. Following then with same problem with series before, school will be closed out because not many student come to study in their school. After all, Chika get 8 other girls and form Aqours to compete in Love Live.  Well, the story itself make you wonder ""is it copy paste from first Love Live series ?"". But, they make good story in this series. The school closed case give more logic in this series, because they're live in small city and many family want their child to study in prestige school. Their recruit system also good, not forced like in First Love Live. And what are supposed they do ? They compete in Love Live like we know, but hey the result was not good. And they're not give up (like Honoka, sorry to mock you but i still hate you), still doing their job to getting better and paid off in the end. I also love their passion, not to win Love Live for first, but just get 1 vote and enjoying their performances.  Standard but good story telling after all.  2. Art For first impression (not in anime), I'm not like it. The first love live had more good looking girl like Umi, Maki, and Kotori. But after one episode, i'm getting used to the art, and make me like it more. Art style was same like first love live, but sunshine's art feels more real for me.  3. Sound Soundtrack was great, i like all the song.  4. Character I love all character. Chika being the great leader is most improvement from this series. And other character was lovely too. They even often make a joke about other member, like Yoshiko and Riko antics. I hope i can see Hanamaru read a book again if they plan to make 2nd season.  5. Enjoyment This series is my most beloved from Summer 2016. I can't describe my enjoyment waiting one week just to watch this series. It's kinda sad I couldn't see Yohane any more now.  Overall, this series was my great pleasure. They are embodied that title ""Sunshine"", they are bright like a sunshine and keep thier enjoying life.";Recommended
0;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Geddon616;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Geddon616;5;Great historical sequel , great music and a worthy continuation to love live highschool is what i would have loved to have been saying but cant. Am i too absorbed by the older generation maybe but it doesnt hide the fact that this anime was good in its own way but lacking in some.  That they created a new story in the same world as love live was great it was something i looked forward to watch and that the anime did well. They also brought forward what was great about the school idols through the different characters. So in that was enjoyable enoug  So i wrote that what did i feel was lacking and why did i not give it the review many thinks it deserves. Well to be honest the consept might be what to be expected of the anime but it still doesnt hide that they did almost the exact same thing as what came before it. The character might have been original in their own ways but thats about that. The pace of the story felt rushed and jumbled and at times it felt that there wouldnt be any progress with it. I did like the music to a certain regard but i didnt enjoy as i have had with other idol animes excluding the previous love live series. The songs felt ordinary and i just couldnt say that this was great. The only song i found myself liking was the one that their rivals created while the main characters songs sounded like normal idol songs with nothing special about them.  What i advice the ones that read this is that they watch this with an open mind and also without thinking much about what came before since maybe that would help you like it alot more but even as an individual anime i wouldnt give it any better than what i gave it. Its easy on the eye its fun at times to watch but it feels too much as if i had seen it all before. It has its moments of good but it also has it downs which i wont gloss over and say that was nothing.;Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Kanudelgruber;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kanudelgruber;6;"Compared to the original series, Love Live Sunshine felt very rushed and unfocused. The original had a conflict established in the very first episode and gave us much more time to get to know the characters, but while I was watching Sunshine I never really cared about the cast or felt like I knew them.  During the original Love Live I was entertained throughout, but Love Live Sunshine just didn't appeal to me as much. A lot of the characters in Sunshine feel very gimmicky compared to the original series, especially Yohane. To be fair, there were a few characters in the original series that I didn't grow to like until the second season, but even in the first season there were a lot of fun scenes that let me get to know and like the cast. Nico alone was entertaining enough to make the whole series worth it. There aren't really any characters that appeal to me as much in Sunshine.  I mean, Mari can be pretty entertaining, but she barely even shows up for half the show and most of the time she's just filling the role of this show's Nozomi equivalent. Her fun moments are very sparse and short. Wooby and Zuramaru are qt, but not enough to keep me invested in the show. Sunshine was just tiring to sit through, because I didn't get enough time to get to know the characters before they became idols, there weren't enough fun character moments to keep me entertained, and there wasn't enough interesting conflict to keep me interested in their rise as idols.  Aqours' rise in popularity overall feels too sudden. It just doesn't feel as significant as in the original series. By the time Aqours has entered the preliminaries, we've only seen them actually perform in the ""real world"" of the show twice, and in their first performance they were able to fill a whole gym, unlike μ's, who barely got anyone to come at all. Even though within the show we're told that things have gotten much more competitive since μ's competed, the fact that we don't really see the struggle as much makes Aqours' rise in popularity seem much easier and less significant as an audience member.  One thing I will say is very good about Sunshine is the art. Everything in this show is very pretty looking, with the exception of a few of the 3D dance shots, which were a bit jarring in the original as well. However, good visuals can't make up for lack of interest in the characters and conflict of a show, so I can't say that I enjoyed Sunshine overall.";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Lord_Lamington;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lord_Lamington;6;I'm not sure if my tastes have changed or if this was actually better than the original. Love Live Sunshine wasn't anything great, but it was still enjoyable.  The only downfall of this show would have to be the story. The story felt a bit too similar to the original. It was the same as the original but with different people. Also, muse was mentioned waaaay too much in this. It felt like Sunshine was just a cheap spin off of the original instead of being its own show. It would have been much more enjoyable if they had a different motivation to become school idols and they never mentioned muse. The lack of an original story really takes away from the overall enjoyment of the show.  Although most people will be watching this for cute girls and nice music, which this show nails. The main cast are all cute and have their own quirks, making it hard to choose a favourite. The songs are also great and choreography is animated well.  Overall, if your just looking for a show with nice songs and cute girls i would highly recommend it. The story is very cut and paste from the original though and takes away from the enjoyment in my opinion. If you weren't a fan of the first one you should probably just pass on this. Its enjoyable but not anything special.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Dabage1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dabage1;6;Love Live! is a pretty household name in Japan and pretty well known internationally due to brilliant marketing and overall rather great songs. Sunrise knew how to market the girls of Muse through anime, and it shows. Muse is now one of the popular idol groups in Japan, at the same level of even AKB48.  So now, why was Love Live! Sunshine!! so badly marketed? It seems as if Sunrise didn't know how to sell Aquors. The anime doesn't help either. It is almost a REQUIREMENT to watch the first 2 seasons of Love Live! to understand several references and jokes that the girls make in the show. Girls are like carbon copies of Muse, with the exception of You. Sunrise didn't have a direction for this show, and it tried to pander to fans and ignore the masses. They have a great concept, and I wish they can do better if a 2nd season is green lit.  Sunshine!! isn't really an anime to begin in the franchise. For fans, its an ok show with ok humor and rather great songs. It's disappointing, but the first season of Muse was like this, so I have high hopes that the girls of Aquors are something that can become likable.;Mixed Feelings
4;Love Live! Sunshine!!;peh-soh-nah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/peh-soh-nah;6;"Love Live! Sunshine!! struggled with its first season, at least mostly for the first half. The first half of this season is all over the place. It starts off promising enough but gets really confused with what it wants to be. It obviously wants to be a good successor to the original Love Live! So much so that they mention how great µ's is so many times you'll get sick of it after Episode 6. It's as if the writers thought that if they didn't keep bringing up µ's, it would alienate original fans and get them mad, but it really takes a toll on the early episodes. Personally, I think all the µ's praise could've been left in the first episode or two and slightly mentioned later. There are sometimes it actually helps the story to mention µ's like the hilarious intercom scene with Dia, but it mostly hampers the show. Great character moments are not only limited by all the ""µ's is so great"" speeches but by the plot which felt like it was sometimes just forced sometimes just to add tension where there wasn't any needed. I'm talking about a specific plot they add a bit towards the mid of the 1st half (you'll know when you see it). It's lazily done and the show would've been improved with less plot, which was the least fun part of the previous Love Live! too. The first half of the season isn't unwatchable thanks to the fun characters but it will turn a lot of people off and almost turned me off of the show if it weren't for the previously mentioned characters and music.  What is fun about Love Live! is the characters and the music. And where Love Live! Sunshine!! completely fails at story (at least at first), it succeeds in making lovable characters you care for and really great and catchy musical numbers. The characters and the music really carried me through the first half. As for the second half, this is where things get better and the reason why I didn't give story a 1. It seems halfway through the show the writers remembered how to do pacing and after the really good Episode 7 and 8, Love Live! Sunshine!! slows down for once to give us more character-focused episodes and fun moments that let the members really shine and it's because of these moments that I was still able to enjoy the show a lot (Yohane is best girl).  Anyway, in conclusion, Love Live! Sunshine!! starts out rough but if you stick through it, you'll find a really enjoyable show that gets better as it continues. Season 2 isn't finished yet but it has already surpassed my expectations and is turning out to be as good, if not better, than the original Love Live! Season 2 so I'll leave it to you but I'd still recommend it to people who like slice of life, character-centric shows, with good music.";Mixed Feelings
5;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Fishymonster_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fishymonster_;6;Basically just a slightly worse carbon copy of school idol project. Honestly not worth watching if you've seen school idol project, but as a stand-alone it isn't bad. It definitely made me realize I don't really want to watch any more shows in this universe, even though I liked school idol project a lot. The characters are extremely similar to School Idol project, and some of them even have the same one-note personality traits. If this one had a different premise or number of girls or personality of those said girls, I would have given this a higher score. In the end, however, its nothing more than a worse version of the original.;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Kururi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kururi;4;Love Live Sunshine is the successor to the popular Love Live, which recently ended with a movie. This continuation to the series really got me excited, since love live is one those anime that I don’t get tired or re-watching (I probably re-watch it twice a year or so.) and also at some point I religiously played the mobile game every single day. But still, in the end, little by little I got disappointed of the show throughout the season. Spoilers ahead for those who haven't finish them yet.  The dialogue of the characters isn’t well thought out. It’s basically them spouting memes non-stop hoping that some of them will stick as much as the infamous nico nico nii. Seriously,Hanamaru went from somewhat shy bookworm to just simply saying zura and mirai most of her dialogue. There’s also the part where she’s just stuffing her face with the noppo bread in the background most of the time just to fill the advertisement quota.  The way they recruit their members feels forced, this got painful for me to watch when Yoshiko joined in specific. The setting is somewhat a rehash to the first LL the way I see it. There’s too many to point out but the point is that they basically just used the same plot points, which seems like lazy writing. The only part where it felt original was the third year drama.  The most annoying part that really irked me is the constant mention of μ’s. I feel like they mention them too much, mentioning them a few times is okay and all but mentioning them literally all episodes except the last one is a little bit too much.  Should you watch it because you’re a Love Live fan? Sure why not. Overall it’s not that bad of a show, I still enjoyed watching it on time every week, but I felt like they could do better, since the characters and the songs are pretty solid. But I guess to me this feels like more a last minute cashgrab to pander to the hardcore love live fans.;Not Recommended
1;Love Live! Sunshine!!;LunaticYuno;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LunaticYuno;3;"--- SPOILER FREE ---  Have you seen Love Live? Well, then you've seen Love Live Sunshine too, without even knowing.  - Plot: The plot is badly copied from the first Love Live. Sunshine is made basically just to milk the cow and to make fanboys scream of joy cause now they can ship more idols and make more memes about it. The story is often slow-paced when nothing is happening and it's light speed fast when it comes to interesting moments. Indeed it's like everything happens behind the scenes while you're not watching and along the anime you're probably gonna ask yourself ""How?"" more often than you would expect. Also, most of the useless and casual stuff that happen is very predictable and cliché. In general it feels like creators had in mind how cool moments should have happened but they didn't know how to arrive to them.  - Characters: Generally characters have no defined personality, like if they ran out of stereotypes so they made them as plain and vague as possible just to make everyone happy. Rather than taking the opportunity to do something good, events that should help you knowing the characters a bit deeper happen in dumb funny ways.  - Animation and art: Characters pretty much look as if they were from μ's but with different hair and eye colors. The animation is decent even if there's still CGI in some parts of dancing scenes, like in Love Live.  - Sound: I really like μ'sic and I pretty much like Aqours songs too, it's the only good point of this anime.";Not Recommended
2;Love Live! Sunshine!!;DubstepKazoo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DubstepKazoo;4;"It would have been so easy for them to make this anime good. However, Sunshine takes what made the original series so magical and throws it out the window. If you've seen the original Love Live series, you probably shouldn't watch Sunshine. If you haven't... maybe you'll find something enjoyable in it? This review will contain spoilers for the original series, though, as you're supposed to have seen it already.  First, I should admit that the animation is amazing. It's definitely a step up from the original series, and you can see proof of that in the very first episode. That doesn't stop it from having CGI dance sequences, though. The only one that was fully hand-drawn was the performance by the ""rival"" idol group that is only relevant for about one episode.  The music is also amazing. As much as I love Muse, Aqours just has better singers. However, some songs do tend to bleed together. Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai sounds very similar to Mijuku DREAMER, for example. However, there is a fatal problem related to the music, which I'll go into in a little bit.  Now that I've talked about the good aspects of this series, it's time to talk about what killed it: the writing. Unlike in the original series, the MC here has no particular reason for becoming a school idol - whereas Honoka wanted to save the school, Chika wanted to be an idol for its own sake (a realization that took Honoka a long time to have). I have no problem with this - though it does make Kimeta yo Hand in Hand (the Susume->Tomorrow of Sunshine) lose a lot of impact.  But wait! There is a reason! Several episodes in, we learn that - *gasp* - the school is in danger. And this is when the problems with this series start to really show themselves. Simply put, Aqours is a bunch of Muse fangirls. They could hardly go a single episode without making a reference to them, and they were even HAPPY when they heard the bad news about their school - because now they could be more like Muse. This series lives in Muse's shadow and never really steps out of it.  Speaking of Muse, let's take a moment and remember why we loved that series. The original Love Live anime was a story of nine girls pouring in blood, sweat, and tears to protect the school that their families have been attending for generations. Then they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to be the best idols they could be. Then, once they were standing on top of the world, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to ensure that school idols would live on forever.  Notice how much I said ""blood, sweat, and tears."" There were countless scenes of the characters practicing their dancing, worrying about costumes, asking Eli to coach them, and so on. We saw all the effort they put into their activities, which made their successes all the more rewarding. Sunshine has... maybe two practice scenes? There was one in episode eleven, and I think there might have been one or two brief ones earlier. The original series used the practice scenes for character development (and the performances, which I'll get to in a second), while Sunshine does character development in other ways. Which is fine, but we still need to see the girls practice. When their performances happen, they don't feel believable. It doesn't feel like they've earned it.  AND speaking of the performances, let's talk about why the ones in Sunshine were disappointing. In the original series, most of the performances (not quite all, but nearly all) were situated within the context of the anime. It was ""okay, we're going to perform now,"" and then they performed. In season one, the only one that wasn't like this was Susume->Tomorrow. Since context was given for these performances, we knew that they were actually happening. We could focus on the lyrics - which were ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, as they often served to summarize or even develop the characters' feelings up until that moment. Who can forget the moment when Honoka, Umi, and Kotori performed START:DASH!! in an empty auditorium? Who can forget the moment when Rin led the team in performing Love wing bell? Not only did we see the characters earn their performances (as discussed above), but we also saw how their performances affected them.  In Sunshine, three of the six insert songs are just kinda... shoved in there. With no context. Even the movie had little segues into Hello, Hoshi wo Kazoete and ?<-HEARTBEAT. But Sunshine just plops the characters into stage outfits and shows them performing in some random place. We have no way of knowing if they're actually happening in-universe. How, then, are we supposed to take them seriously? Why are we supposed to care?  To be fair, episode eleven of Sunshine is good. We see the girls practice, we see their feelings develop over the course of the episode, and the insert song is rooted in the context of the story. Plus, its lyrics are extremely relevant to the characters' feelings. It felt like classic Love Live. It made me wish we'd been getting that all season.  Oh, I haven't even gotten to the writing yet. The writing is... man, I wish I could say it was good. But it wasn't. I talked earlier about the ""save the school"" plot being reused. I can't say I'm entirely opposed to it, but I feel like it would only have worked if they had been up-front about it. Bring it up in episode one. Don't fake us out and make us think you might be doing something different. But anyway! The constant references to Muse get old really quick. They happened so often that I thought they were set-up for a ""we need to step out of their shadow and be our own group"" realization, but that never happened.  And then there's the third-year subplot. This permeates the first half of the series, eventually being resolved in episode nine, and the tone is unreal. It feels very gloomy and depressing - very strange for Love Live. The rest of the time, the show's tone is exactly what you'd expect from a Love Live anime, and the juxtaposition is jarring and rough. It feels like the plot to a late-night drama got mixed into the happy, fun idol show. And when this subplot does get resolved, the reasoning behind the offending character's actions is very flimsy, hard to believe, and - frankly - insulting. When it was first revealed, my reaction was, ""They expect me to buy this?"" It left a lot of actions unexplained, it blatantly contradicted plenty of other scenes we'd seen in earlier episodes, and it just reeked of bad writing. And then, in the very next episode, Chika does the exact thing that this subplot condemned - and gets rewarded for it!  Oh, and let's not forget the yuribait. It was very heavy. In fact, I'm not sure it can even be called ""bait."" It was just plain old yuri (that never ended up going anywhere). Don't get me wrong - I love yuri. I own eight NicoMaki doujinshi. But it didn't add anything to Sunshine. The involved characters didn't gain any development, and the yuri never went beyond one line at the end of episode ten. A line that, might I add, would be the precursor to a romantic subplot in just about any other anime. It felt like they were trying to pander to fudanshi in the same way that they were pandering to Muse nostalgia for the rest of the series. I was, again, kind of insulted that they thought we'd buy it if they splashed a little yuri in there somewhere.  Then good things spontaneously start happening for our characters for no reason, as they'd only canonically had two performances so far (one of which was a local event, the other of which was a flop). And half of episode thirteen is dedicated to a recap of the season. No, seriously. And this recap illustrates all the things I've been talking about. They never really earned any of the popularity they got at any point in the series. There never really was a good reason for Yohane to join the group - they even glossed over it in the recap. And there never really was any reason to care about the group's successes and failures.  I really wanted to like this anime. At first, I figured it could never live up to the legacy of the original series, but I decided to give it a fair chance. And I realized that my original misgivings were right on the money. Sunshine was plagued by bad writing, meaningless performances, and nervous desperation as it tried to simultaneously lean on Muse for support and ignore the secrets to Muse's success.  My final rating for Love Live! School idol project Sunshine!! is a four out of ten.  Oh dear lord this review is long. If you've read this far, thanks.";Not Recommended
3;Love Live! Sunshine!!;j15cailipan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/j15cailipan;4;"This was honestly one of the most painful anime -no, TV show experiences I've ever had. Sunshine to me is just a much lazier copy of the first series, except with more forced emotional scenes. That's really my only problem with Sunshine: the story and the ""drama"". The animation? Great. The Characters? Pretty good. The music? Bangers. Sunshine had all the elements it needed to be great - but it wasted them. There was so much unnecessary drama. From episode 3 or so, it felt like somebody cried/sobbed/teared up at least once per episode. The third-year subplot is the worst offender here. All they did was cry about the past and their friendship and chasing their dreams and blah blah blah. It worked in the first Love Live series because we got to know those characters first before it decided to get emotional. But, in Sunshine? I don't know jack about Mari. ""Haha funny anime girl speaks engrish and touches boobies"" is all I get from her. Dia at least gets more character time, so I can kind of feel bad for her. And then there's Kanan, who's just gone for most of the season. They really expected me to care about these girls when I hardly know them? On the topic of the characters: I like them all. Some are more boring/basic than others, but I like that they aren't (individually) exact copies of Muse, save maybe Chika. We see different personalities getting mixed with different tendencies and habits. I genuinely like Aqours as individual characters and as a school idol group. Their songs are great and their singing voices are overall a step above Muse, though nobody can ever beat Rin's or Honoka's voices in my opinion. But, my goodness, this show takes itself way too seriously. All it needed to do is relax on the emotions and ease up on drama. This might seem like a small nitpick, but, trust me, every single episode is filled with it. Sunshine is the first anime I've seen since Fairy Tail that I refuse to continue after episode 13. It hurts me to give this anime a 4. I wanted to like Sunshine, but I just couldn't. If you're really THAT interested in the Love Live universe, fine, go watch this. Otherwise, you're better off not watching Sunshine. Chances are you'll probably find a 10-minute video on YouTube with all of the good moments anyways.";Not Recommended
4;Love Live! Sunshine!!;Certified_Rat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Certified_Rat;4;"[DISCLAIMER: This review is written on the assumption that you've already watched ""Love Live! School Idol Project"", ""Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season"" and ""Love Live! The School Idol Movie""]  I was really let down by this one, I was expecting more from the continuation of Love Live.  The story feels like a carbon copy. The events are almost the same, with a few tweaks here and there. All the events that occurred with μ's, somehow came back to happen again in Love Live Sunshine. This made it extremely boring to re-watch what had already happened. They could've continued it with Honoka and Er's younger sisters. Maybe how they feel like they have to live up to μ's expectations or something like that.  The art is an improvement from Love Live. The 3D animation was a world of a difference. I have to give credit where credit is due because the art went a step up and the style was (in my opinion) cuter.  The songs were still good, and so were the voice actors but nothing out of the world.  Along the same lines as to how the story felt almost the same as Love Live so did the characters. The girl who doesn't feel like she's cut out to be a school idol, the upbeat center protagonist that originally had the idea of school idols, the girl with prior knowledge of dance, etc etc. Once you're re-watching the same character with essentially only the design is different. Like, please get some creativity.  I genuinely don't know how I got through the anime, for the sole reason that it was so similar to the original anime. I would recommend to not ruin your view on the anime and stop at the movie.";Not Recommended

In short, it wasn't even worth watching. If you want a summary just watch any other generic cute girl show and imagine them saying ""Zura"" at the end of every fucking sentence. It was very slow moving, the characters were mostly pretty dull, and it was frequently annoying. The dance portions were somewhat well done, so I can recommend looking them up on youtube instead of bothering to watch the rest of the show. Since I didn't watch the original show, it was infuriating to hear them never shut up about the ""Mu's"". Why not try to make your show stand on its own? Definitely skip this show.";Not Recommended
6;Love Live! Sunshine!!;bananapotato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bananapotato;4;"Please note that the original Love Live! School Idol Project will be referred as Love Live/ original and Love Live Sunshine will just be called Sunshine in this review.  I'm sorry to say but this was garbage compared to Love Live! School Idol Project.  Let's start with the story: The show is about a girl who decided to become a school idol in order to stop her school from closing down. Sounds familiar? Well yes, it's the same fucking plot of the original  There was absolutely nothing new. They tried to create drama and tension when Riko's piano recital coincidentally happened to be on the same day of the Love Live Qualifiers but even that did nothing to splash some excitement. They even tossed in a lesbian fanservice ""suki suki moe moe daisuki"" that did absolutely nothing for the anime.  This show is trying so hard to become Love Live and they are not even trying to hide it.  The story doesn't grip you. I remember on the original, when Muse first had their live and no one showed up and when all of them sang Start Dash together for the first time. There were goosebumps, there was joy. And when their classmates helped them get in time for their performance in the middle of a snow storm so they can can sing Snow Halation. I felt a lot of emotions unlike while I'm watching Sunshine.  Also, what the FUCK was that cringey monologue at the end? If you were going to monologue the entire story on the last episode then I shouldn't have bothered wasting my time on episodes 1-12!  Moving on to characters, like the fucking story it was a copy cat. The character designer could have made characters with more original features. Chika is Honoka, You looks like Hanayo, Riko is obviously Maki, Mari is Alice chan and Eli, Dia is a mix of Umi and Eli's personality. Aside from that, the characters failed to make the viewer (ME) give a shit about them. There was no emotional attachment to these characters what so ever. They were very dull and unrelatable. Overall the characters are flat flat flat!  Lastly, the music. Now, I'll be honest, I'm not really musically inclined. But, Sunshine's soundtrack didn't really stay with me unlike Love Live. The lyrics were not very good and it felt like it didn't fit with the melody. Speaking of melody, their music was not catchy at all. I didn't find myself repeating the songs in my head. I was so disappointed because the music was one of my favorite part about Love Live.  Overall, Sunshine was a pathetic copy cat of the original that was made to milk in more money from the die hard Love Live fans.";Not Recommended
0;Love Live! School Idol Project: μ's →NEXT LoveLive! 2014 - Endless Parade Encore Animation;Kurokero;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kurokero;9;"Pretty much a short video with all nine members doing something that anyone who is a fan of them will enjoy. Not much else to this video. Think of it as a small treat or ""thank you"" for buying the LIVE blu-ray.   There is no story to this, its just an ""encore"" video. They interact with each other in the beginning, and then each member has a ""solo"" screen time where they say something.  Sound, art, and character are what you would expect from the two seasons, which is nice for consistency.  To be honest, the main reason I gave this a 9 is because of Umi's phrase. That alone made this video almost near perfect.  Anyone who is a fan of Love Live will enjoy this and will not be let down. Go watch it!";Recommended
0;Love Live! School Idol Project OVA;Buuubbblesss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Buuubbblesss;5;"Well, considering no one has written a review of this, I might as well. The Love Live! School Idol Project OVA is a 15 minute descent into madness that was bundled with the sixth single of the anime's μ's idol group and aired on November 27, 2013. Why do I call it a descent into madness? Because the story of this OVA is complete nonsense. There's something about being in a dream, Maki's piano not working, tiny Maki scaring normal Maki for no real reason which is never brought up again, Ayase forgetting a textbook and then chasing after a shadow, it suddenly being nighttime, Maki being a child for....some reason, and a fireworks show. Oh, and apparently the entire thing is a dream. Whose dream? I don't know! The show never tells us. I'm assuming it's Maki's, but it's never really explained. Maki as a child tells us that they are indeed inside of a dream, and that it is a ""never-ending party"", whatever that means. After that, Maki abruptly turns back into her usual teenage self via some sort of alien abduction or divine act of god, and then tells the other girls that she has always liked them.  That is roughly the first 10 minutes. The remaining 5 minutes is devoted to a musical number, a song called ""Music S.T.A.R.T!!."" If you liked the music in Love Live, it would probably be worth it to you to watch this OVA just for the song. I don't particularly enjoy Idol music, but the same quality of music and animation in the show is clearly present here (for better or worse), so if you're into that go ahead and give it a watch.  Also worth noting: I don't grade OVAs or specials; MAL forces you to pick an overall score to attach to your review. The score I gave this does not mean anything.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! School Idol Project OVA;Robberator;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Robberator;6;Look, this is something, that you'll watch if you're a fan of the show, but should basically steer away from in any other case. We have a story about Maki being in a dream with everyone. Subtle, I know. Anyway, she admits, that she loved everyone else, even from before they turned idols, big whoop. This is a really materielistic OVA. What you'll get: a new music video, Maki in loli form and the characters interacting. You won't miss out on anything, if you just leave this one be, but it's not offensively bad, or anything. It's just a vaste of an OVA. But since the series has an abundance of those, I'm not really heartbroken. This was the first I saw though, so that's kind of lame, but that is really the worst I can say about it. In the future, please just release the music video and leave out all the rest.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! School Idol Project OVA;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;"I've discussed the Love Live franchise quite a bit. And we're going to do it again. This little OVA was bundled with the group's sixth single. It's only fifteen minutes. So, we'll see how it goes.   Story:  We open with Maki having a nightmare where she's being chased by hooded figures. She finishes telling Hanayo about it. Which scares Hanayo, likely making it necessary for her to take solace between Rin's legs. The next day Maki's not at school and the rest of our cast decides to go visit her, leading to a slightly trippy sequence followed by a musical number. So, the ""story"" is basically build up for the music video.   The issue is that the build up is awkward. It's a bit surreal and has some magical realism shit going on that doesn't really go with the rest of the franchise. It doesn't help that a lot of it is stretches of a character running and it's not that interesting.   I will say, it does have a few cute moments. Nico's face when they decide to visit Maki along with Nozomi's narration. That's cute. Little baby Maki telling the rest of the girls that she's always really liked them. That's cute. I also do like the music video bit.   Characters:  The regular μ's cast is all there. The OVA doesn't give us anything new but it is nice to see the group doing their thing. Even in a short OVA.   Art:   The OVA looks much like the series proper. About the worst I can say about it is that the running scenes are a little lazy in terms of their backgrounds just staying pretty much the same throughout. Other than that it all looks good. It's well put together. The music video is very much what we're used to from the franchise. With the costumes, choreography, lights and bright colours.   Sound:  The acting in this franchise has always been well done. The music portion features a really good song in terms of its performance. If you're a fan of that type of idol music, you'll enjoy hearing the song.   Ho-yay:  It's almost like Sunrise was pandering to me specifically with this one. There's a lot of homo-eroticism in the music video. The girls' idea of a party is, apparently, getting in sleepwear, cuddling up to one another and staring at each other longingly. This isn't a Never-ending party, it's a never-ending Sapphic sleepover. Which is much better. And you might think ""But Ktulu, you wouldn't be allowed into a never-ending Sapphic sleepover."" Which is true, but I don't go to parties either. The most people I'll be in a room with is about seven other people for D&D.   Areas of Improvement:  1.Less surrealism in the build up.   2. Fewer and shorter scenes of running.   3. Maybe just lose the dream angle in favour of something that suits the franchise better. Like a Sapphic sleepover.  Final Thoughts:   Is this OVA as good as the series proper? No. Is it going to be enjoyable if you're not a fan of the series proper? No. If you're a fan of the series, will you enjoy it? Very likely, yes. It has its cute moments and the music video portion is great. So, if you're a fan of the franchise, you should probably watch it. If you're someone who likes the music but doesn't care much for the rest, watch the last five minutes. If you aren't sure whether you'd like the series, watch the regular anime first. For myself, I'm giving it a 6/10. The mediocre build up combined with the great music video makes for a decent viewing experience. ";Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! School Idol Project OVA;DaddyDubs;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DaddyDubs;6;This OVA is...weird. It leaves me with a feeling I can't seem to forget about. I'm not sure exactly why this exists, maybe they wanted to include a storyline for the music video (although it doesn't fit together very well). Regardless, it's quite an odd experience. If you're a fan of Love Live I do recommend giving it a watch but just be aware that you're in for a wild ride.  (Spoilers)  So the plot revolves around Maki being sick and the rest of Muse going to check on her. However, Eli stops when she sees loli Maki and decides to chase her down. Eventually the girls all meet up again and loli Maki tells muse she's always loved them even before they were school idols together (I think I get what they were trying to go for here with the symbolism and the loli Maki but it's just kind of confusing to follow and they never really explain much so you have to make your own inferences). After that she's transformed into teenage Maki and they realize they're all having a dream together (I think they should have told us this from the beginning, it would have made the plot way easier to follow). The episode ends with the music video for Music:Start. I don't know that I would say this episode doesn't deserve to exist because the surrealism is kind of beautiful, it's a nice contrast to the typical feel of the show and I like how it does, in fact, feel like a dream. But it's hard to follow and just gets a little too weird. So at the end of the day, I feel 6/10 is an appropriate rating for it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;9;"If there have been any worries about the future of the idol genre, Love Live 2 has dispelled them.  It's hard to deny that the first season of Love Live began with a rocky start. There wasn't much to set itself apart from other idol shows (especially with the likes of Idolmaster and Aikatsu dominating the genre) and it fell prone to melodrama far more than it should have. But, much like K-ON's mediocre first season and excellent second season, Love Live 2 has managed to do more than improve upon its predecessor - it has genuinely become an amazing anime.  I won't lie, I was no fan of the franchise when the TV series made its debut in early 2013. I dropped it after the first episode aired and wondered later on what people saw in the series. But now having finished the second season, Love Live has become one of my favourite anime franchises.  Certainly it is not an anime that will test the mind or change anyone's life. It is simply a story of nine teenage girls forming an idol group together. However, it would be an insult to describe Love Live as yet another ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime, as it is a far more meaningful experience. The drama feels genuine this time around, and by the end it is hard to prevent the tears from rolling when the story of μ's reaches its end.  From the very first episode of the second season, it is clear that Sunrise has made a significant effort to improve the series. It looks better, sounds better, feels better and is far more fun to watch. Most importantly, the girls of μ's all feel like genuine characters now. Honoka's passion makes her truly seem like the leader and centre of the group, whereas the first season didn't have much reason beyond ""well, somebody had to be the leader, right?"" Even the characters who were given little to no screen-time in the first season (Rin, Eli, Nozomi and Hanayo) are fleshed and given their own episode to shine. It is finally a story about the nine of them.  Considering there have only been twenty-six episodes to develop a cast of nine characters, Sunrise has done a commendable job of doing so without neglecting the story in return. Perhaps the characters could have benefited from another season of episodes, but they hardly feel lacking by the end. The addition of a rival idol group (A-RISE) also makes the story feel less insular. It is no longer confined to the school itself, and with the school's closure no longer being an issue, the girls can finally focus on performing as idols do.  Nico is easily one of the show's greatest assets. Sure, her ""nico nico-nii"" catchphrase is cute and all (I go a little bit crazy whenever she utters it), but Nico's presence accomplishes far more than simply being a vehicle for the cute. Of all the character-focused episodes, Nico's is the greatest. It shows that she really, truly cares about the group and is not simply in it for pride and ego. The idol industry is Nico's life, the act of being an idol her most treasured dream. She cares deeply for her siblings and performs primarily to make them smile. She's a kind person inside- contrary to her rough behaviour with the rest of μ's. Perhaps that behaviour may make her somewhat unsuitable for the role of an idol, but she's more serious about it than anyone else. Nico may not be idealised as idols usually are, but that flawed, genuinely human side of her makes her makes her all the more loveable, I think. Even if she does not resonate with you as a character, it's hard to deny that she at least provides an interesting contrast with the rest of μ's. It would not be anywhere near as interesting without her.  The story peaks in the last four episodes. With the graduation of the third-years quickly drawing closer, a tear-filled goodbye seems inevitable. It is very similar to the final episodes of K-ON's second season. With the prospect of Nico leaving and μ's potentially being disbanded after graduation, I could not help but feel my chest tighten a bit. And then the final episode really drove those feelings home. Perhaps they'll join together once again and find careers as professional idols. I doubt it is the end for Nico, Eli and Honoka.  Like most idol anime, Love Live has a fantastic soundtrack. All the songs the girls perform carry their own theme and message, and none of them (aside from the opening and ending) are used more than once in the anime. Each song represents a new stage for μ's, another step forward as performers and as people. The music peaks with the performance of ""Snow Halation"" in the ninth episode, a rising, sad yet uplifting piece that showcases the appeal of μ's. It is probably one of the best vocal tracks I have heard in an anime to date. There is also a really cool scene at the end of the 12th episode that I won't spoil. Everything with the music sorts of 'clicks' in that moment.  It should be noted though that the ninth episode does blunder a bit with its choice of music. As the second-years traverse through a snowstorm, there is an incredibly melodramatic, orchestral piece blasting in the background that would feel more appropriate were demons from hell rising up and setting Earth on fire or something. The second season has improved so much that it is frustrating to see it regress to the first season's melodrama, even for just a brief moment.  As for the visuals, Love Live looks well above average. The CGI during the performances can be a little bit distracting (and I know some people despise CGI of any form) but between that and low frame-rate, off-model animation, I would gladly take the CGI. It certainly looks better than Aikatsu's CGI, anyway. The rest of the visuals on the other hand holds up reasonably well. There are scenes here and there where lazy, static shots are used for longer than necessary, and while it certainly is no Attack on Titan, Love Live looks just fine.  Love Live has come a long way from its slow beginnings. While it will hardly convert anyone who detests the 'moe' art style, those who have even the slightest inkling of interest in the series will likely find the second season to be at the very top of the idol (and perhaps even music) genre. An anime can be both cute and a genuinely great story, as is demonstrated here.  Now, where's my Nico spin-off?";Recommended
1;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;BullSmit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BullSmit;9;"After finishing 1st Season of Love Live: School Idol Project, I must say, Season 2 sure stepped up it's game. I enjoyed Season 1 a lot too, but Season 2 has just been something else for me.  For those of you who don't know, Love Live: School Idol Project is based off of a real live idol group called Nine Muses. They all go by different names in the anime itself, but it's a pretty neat concept. Their goal in Season 1 is to keep the school from shutting down by forming an idol group.  In Season 2, their goal is to make the Love Live, and win it all, this will be the last chance for them to do this together as members of the group are graduating after their third year.  -----------------------  Simply, I don't like many music/idol animes. They stray too far away from the main plot. Often times, they become too focused on being cute, and adorable, much like K-On! did, and steer away from the story as a whole, and for me that's a complete turnoff. With Love Live: School Idol Project, I have not had to worry about that at all. The story is not really comedic in any form, which in turn makes the quality that much better as it truly focuses on it being a slice of life anime, rather then throwing little ""hilarious"" moments all over the place.  In Season 2, we see a lot more drama, heartache, and realization. After eating through all 13 episodes, it's been nothing short of emotional, and I love it. The theme stays the same, where they're all dedicated to making the best of their school idol group while they can, and they continue to have a goal in mind that they can strive for together.  The art is once again fantastic, other than, in my opinion the 3D they use for their performances. I dislike 3D animation, but that's my preference. Other than that, I thought it was really good. I love the costumes they wear during their performances as well.  The sound, well, if you're watching an anime about school idols, I'm pretty sure you expect good music, and this is nothing short of that. Snow Halation, one of the songs they perform in this season, was just phenomenal (And it's a real song by Nine Muse's, check it out!). I personally enjoy the music they sing, and the BGM is well placed.  Characters, well, there's nine of them, so I'm not going to run through each one as I'd probably do a messy job anyways. I'll just say that each one of these characters, Nico, Nozomi, Eli, Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Rin, Hayano, and Maki are all unique characters in their group. They all have had struggles (As seen in season 1) and coming into season 2 that's no different, however, they have developed incredibly over the span of this season. They've all conquered certain issues with themselves, and they've done this together as a group. That's one of the huge striking points for me, is that no matter what situation they're in, they figure it out together, and they're all there for one another whenever it's called for. Easily the characters are the strongest point within this anime.  ------------------------------  Quite honestly, I've never really enjoyed an anime that's been centred around music much like Love Live. This has been such a fun ride for myself, and while I don't think this anime is for everyone, I'd fully recommend you at least give it a try. I'm pretty sure you'll connect with the characters in one way or another, and that's one of the many reasons this anime is so special.  I don't think I've ever cried such happy tears before. Best choice I made watching this series, all because of a Nico-Ni .gif.";Recommended
2;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;Glacialis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Glacialis;9;"When Love Live! School Idol Project first aired in Japan, it became a hit sensation, captivating the hearts of many. The show was surprisingly good, with an enjoyable cast, entertaining songs, and a solid story. It was a massive success, and with its popularity came a second season. This might make some people feel anxious, thinking this to be a sell out for more money, but their worries can be put to ease; regardless of its intentions, I believe this second season to be even greater than the first time around.  Spoilers for the first season to follow.  Love Live! School Idol Project Second Season follows μ’s as they get a second chance at the Love Live idol competition after their withdrawal from the first. Beyond that however, the girls are forced to look farther ahead and contemplate the future of μ’s as the third year’s graduation begins to rapidly approach. The story isn’t anything too original, but that’s overshadowed by the fact that it’s done well. Love Live!’s second season will make you laugh and feel good, but at the same time it can bring you to tears. There is a lot of emotion packed into its later episodes, and when the season comes to a close, you won’t want to see them go. The story is brought to a finish with an ending that wraps everything up nicely, making it a satisfying journey from beginning to end.  μ’s brings multiple main characters to the table, so there’s a guarantee you’ll love at least one of them, if not all of them. From genki girl Honoka to narcissistic Nico, there’s a lot of variety to be had. More important than that, however, is that the show still manages to bring some depth and development to these characters despite there being so many. The spotlight is given to the girls who weren’t featured during the first season, such as Nico and Rin, but development still continues for the others, such as in Honoka and Umi. Add to that some nice side characters like all the imoutos, as well as some actual presence from the rival idol group A-RISE, not to mention those amazing alpacas, and it is clear that the show does a wonderful job with its loveable cast.  Of course, this being an idol show and all, the music is a major component of this show, and I feel it doesn’t fail in this regard. The OP and ED are pretty good, matching the feel of the series quite well. The insert songs are really the standout though, with a mood and lyrics that depict the moments of the show magnificently. My favorite of the bunch definitely has to be “Snow Halation”; when it is being sung, I had shivers going down my spine. Of course, the rest of the bunch is great too, such as “Aishteru Banzai”, “Love & Peace”, and even a return of the opening of the first season, which is tied in nicely. The soundtrack is pretty great as well fitting the mood nicely and bringing the tension and emotion when it needs to be brought. Overall, the music of the series is great, as it should be.  The character designs are all nice to look at, and there’s probably going to be a design that you love because of the massive cast. The animation runs smoothly for the most part, and can be pretty beautiful at times as well, such as during the performance of the aforementioned “Snow Halation”. One problem that I did have with this show, however, is the CG that is used during the song performances. It is pretty jarring and takes away from what would otherwise be beautiful scenes. Thankfully, the usage of the CG has decreased and the quality has increased slightly from the last season, so it wasn’t as bad as before, but I still wasn’t a big fan of it. Other than that though, this is quite a beautiful show to look at.  All in all, this was a very entertaining show to watch. Even with the bothersome CG, watching the girls of μ’s working to win the Love Live and performing their songs was a wonderful experience. This second season made me fall in love with μ’s even more than the first season had. Anyone who liked the first season will definitely love this; even if you didn’t, I feel as though the second season was a great step up from the first, so you might still enjoy it. While the story is brought to a close for now, I can’t wait to see what the Love Live! series has in store for us next.  Ready?  μ’s music start!!";Recommended

School Idol Project 2nd Season  Love Live! have a simple story, it tells us about 9 girls that competing in a School Idol Competition. Well, if we look deeply to the main idea of the story, Love Live does not have an originality. Although not having an originality, the story is full of excitement, the plot have a great balance between the main story and the fillers.  As for the art, we have a clear and beautiful animation, despite having a CG during dancing and stage performing, Love Live! have a well-produced animation.  What can I say about the sound? Is wonderful in my opinion, the seiyuu did an excellent job to bring such character to the screen, everyone have a decent voice and brings uniqueness to the characters. The songs in the series are very good indeed.  With a slice of life genre in hands, a development is the strongest body of this anime. Each character has their own story/ problem, it makes the developments successfully makes a deep character. Each of them has a unique personality itself.  Besides that, Love Live is not for everyone, the main attraction of the series is aimed to the male audience. Some of the female viewers maybe not really enjoy the series, there are also people that don't like idols founds out Love Live not interesting. As for myself, I enjoy the series although not fully enjoying it. It is fully recommended to those who seeks an idol genre.;Recommended

School Idol Project Season 2 - Recommend of read a review or watch season 1 before reading this.  Love Live! is a Comedy, Idol anime co-created by music label Lantis and animation studio Sunrise, with it's second season was release in April of 2014. It continues from the end of season 1 (Which i also reviewed), where Honoka Kōsaka and her friends in the school idol group μ's (Muse) tries to enter the second Love live, a school idol tournament that has changed because of success of the first one, has become national wide as idol groups from around Japan compete to be the best school idol group.

The animation has improved aswel with the song/dance scenes have more fluid motions and the facial animation look better and look more believably than before. The songs for this season are as catchy as they was in season 1 and the voice acting is still great as each voice still fits it's character like in season 1. The topics used has better impact than season 1 because most of the episode shows how much work they put into Love Live contest. Lasty is my opinion. Season 2 of Love Live! is a improvement i terms of presentation and story, Sunrise impress me again with their story writing as it keep you interested and animation design as the song/dance scenes are more beautiful than they was in season 1. The amount of work and love put in the anime really shows even better in this season. I enjoyed this season more than the last season and i said in my review of season 1 it was one my favorites, and season 2 joins that list. Now the Verdict. Season 2 of Love Live! is a great improvement over season 1 in every way with time spend on improving the visuals and animation. The songs/dance scenes are great to watch and the art style look more better than ever. So with that said, i recommend you give Love Live! Season 2 a watch if you watch season 1 as it very enjoyable and the songs/dances are great to see as the animation looks lovely created. Love Live! season 2 is one of the best animes release in the last year so you should give it a watch.;Recommended
5;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;MagicalMahou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MagicalMahou;10;"Success stories have always had a spirit that the Academy and many others have deemed inextinguishable. The soul and passion of the fight to victory has always had an undeniable effect on us humans, who have always had the hidden spirit of desire; the very desire to go the extra mile and make it to the top. And it is in these stories where we see this undeniable burning human passion. We see it in Daniel's eyes in his final match in the Karate Kid. We see it in Rocky, prepared to fight Apollo Creed with everything he has. We see it in Drumline, as the monolithic stage overshadows our heroes. We see it in Alan Turing in his struggle to break Enigma in the Imitation Game.  We see it in μ's, in their fight to the Love Live Championships.  Love Live Season Two is an anime that has been described by most as 'better than season one' or 'the best idol anime ever' but the series has gone above and beyond those simple standards and has become one of the most inspiring success stories I've seen in a very long time. The story is as simple as it can get, with nine girls aiming to winning the School Idol competition known as Love Live. Though it's hard not to admit the faults of season one, the difference between the two seasons is interstellar. As I stated, the burning passion and struggles from films like Rocky or the Karate Kid is very evident here as we see, finally, what makes idols so special. Before seeing this series, I had always thought idols to be like generic pop singers only with a cutesy side to them. You can tell how obviously wrong I was. From what I've seen, idols have a very distinct nature and goal, to shower emotion over the audience in their own unique spectacle. This is what I learned from Love Live and from no one else, as the girls of μ's struggle against themselves and each other. As the curtains come to a close and story of μ's nears its end, we're welcomed with one of the most powerful finales of all time. You've felt this sensation before. When your little brother made that game winning goal? Or when you aced your exams? Or when you got your crush to like you? It is the spirit of achievement and reflection that make this anime truly an inspiring experience.  Now, I have nothing against stereotypes. And when they're utilized correctly, they can do great things. In the first season of Love Live, we were introduced to, well, about nine archetypes that had adequate development to become a bit more three-dimensional. But the godly characterization of the series in only 26 episodes has turned our girls almost human. We're introduced to feelings and thoughts we never thought these characters could have, underneath their stereotypical exterior that truly defines their character as a whole. An example is Rin who expresses a very self-defeating nature, the same we see in people who suffer insecurity, in her arc which, I have to say, does extremely well to develop her character and features one of my most favorite μ's songs of all time (LOVE WIIIING. LOVE WIIIING). Honoka also gets a share of this, exceeding the 'genkiest is the leader' stereotype to a more definitive reason as to why she is the leader at all, allowing her characterization to truly define her as the one and only leader of μ's. But by far the best arc belongs to Nozomi, as, not only is her character expanded to degrees above and beyond, but it develops more the special relationship the girls have as μ's, the special feelings they share and why their separation would mean the end of it all. With all the characters given godly characterization, it's now not a story about Honoka, but about all of them.  Now, I can't end this review without going technical. The music of Love Live is one of its main appeals, as a lot of the fans came from playing the musical game on their phones. The best thing about it is how distinct each track is in terms of delivery and emotion. The rhythm endowed that matches each story perfectly really emulates how in-tie music is with the series, unlike some others that like to just play random songs for the heck of it (K-On anyone?). The animation is also above average which is to be expected coming from Gundam-Printing company Sunrise. The design is stellar and gives these different girls a sort of unique flare that gives them distinction and makes them special. If it were not for the blonde hair, the ponytail and the baby blue eyes, Eli would not be my waifu today.  If there were any way to describe this series, it would be inspiring. Being able to correlate both characters and story to the spirit of achievement, boiling with human desire and passion, in a way that is almost Grammy worthy makes this series truly amazing. Despite the somewhat flaky season one, season two is able to craft a story with meaning, emotion and passion.  With top-notch characterization, a definitive success story and roaring emotion, I can proudly say that Love Live Season Two is one of the best of the best.

6;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;IzashiNakamura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IzashiNakamura;10;Review contains some spoilers:  Let me start out by saying that this will be a review of both seasons of Love Live: School Idol Project. There is almost no reason to separate the two seeing as Season 2 is a direct continuation.  After being recommended this anime by a plethora of friends and already being a fan of slice of life shows such as K-On I decided to give Love Live a shot. It far exceeded my expectations in every way possible. While I enjoyed the most of the first season more than the second season, it still had a huge impact on me by the ending. So, without further ado lets break this down shall we?  Story/Character: When it comes to Love Live you might immediately think to yourself that the music has to be the strongest point of this show. I mean, it's an Idol show right and nothing more? That's where you would be painfully wrong. The way this show ties together these 9 girls is flawlessly executed. All of them come from not so much a troubled past, but all have problems many of us faced throughout the course of High School. Their common goal brings them together putting them through numerous hardships and triumphs ultimately leading to their success in saving their school. On the other hand, they did not make it to Love Live the first time showing us the common principle that you can't win everything. On that note, the only thing I did not like about the show was how forced the second season felt. I could have guessed that they would be able to perform at Love Live, but I expected more of a time skip between the two competitions. All of that aside I still found myself engrossed in Season 2 by the heart wrenching end. The three 3rd year girls graduating and leaving the group hit me really hard. Leaving High School and abandoning all of your friends has to be one of the hardest things I have endured personally, and seeing these characters grow together and inevitably parting ways in the end was heart breaking.  Music/Art: The music was of course fantastic seeing as we are watching a show about idols here. If poppy upbeat music isn't your thing however you might find yourself loathing most of the soundtrack and dance sequences. The art was very bright and vivid leaving me with no complaints in that department as well.  Overall: At the end of the day this anime has a lot of tropes that are probably going to spike negativity in some reviews , but for me the way that they tied these characters together was beautiful. I always found myself laughing, smiling, or even tearing up throughout the series and I can't wait to watch the movie for more fun to come!;Recommended
7;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;tsuki_shiro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tsuki_shiro;10;"Ok,so I have done watching LL S2 and I have two words: truly amazing. In terms of school idol, if anyone want's a recommendation, I'm totally recommend Love Live. Amazing,satisfying, the feels, and many more are there in LL.  The anime continue from the first season which is after they save their school from closing. After they know that Love Live tournament will begin, they set their new goal which is to enter and win the tournament since they withdraw from previous LL. I would say, LL S2 really make an impact in terms of story. The balance between story and other character backstory is impaccable and that's one of the reason I really like about LL. They know how to focus each character backstory and combine it with main plot.  For animation, I can see some improvement in their choreography, 3D CGI and background scenery/building. The synchronization between them in dancing makes the CGI looks nice and satisfying. For music and OST, awesome, nuff said. The songs including OP and ED keeps getting better including their performance in dancing. Goosebump? Yeah, LL S2 also gives you more goosebump and jaw dropping performance when they start their concert.  Verdict: So, what can I say about Love Live School Idol Project S2 is the anime really did a good job showing me about school idol. Maybe not in reality or not as good as other school idol anime such as Idolmaster but LL totally makes me want to see them perform again altough they can't(you will know if you watch it). Also, prepare some tissues or pillow since ninja onion will come not once but twice(maybe thrice) when you watch it(again,you will know if you watch). From season 1 to season 2, from 3 members to 9 members, their jokes never cease to amuse me and their smile,laugh and sad moments always makes me happy and cry(man tears you know). Last but not least, thank you who create this, it was an amazing ride with tears and joy. Not many anime that makes me throb after finishing the series but LL already did that to me. For that, I give them 11/10. ""Muse - A story achieved together"".";Recommended
8;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;thekatelynn;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thekatelynn;9;Story: 8/10  Love Live season 2 has a great story following the first season. I only have two problems with the story. Firstly, getting into season two seems contrived as a second love live festival just happens to be held so Muse can participate. I don’t mind because we got a second season, but it still seemed forced. Secondly, I hated the Halloween episode as it was an excuse for fanservice and the insert song wasn’t very good.  Characters: 10/10  This shows best points are the characters. Each character is well fleshed out and well rounded. Every major character gets screen time and a chance to develop. None of the characters fit into one troupe and I like that about them. The designs are also really nice and character interactions and developing friendships are nice to see.  Music: 8/10  I personally like the music in Love Live but feel that it’s an acquired taste as all the songs are the standard candy j-pop that idol groups tend to sing. Another reason for the rating is because not all the songs are memorable. Snow Halation was the big one for this season, but the rest of them, while enjoyable, don’t have a lasting impression.  Animation: 9.5/10  This would be a 10 had it not been for the 3D used during performances. The animation overall in Love Live is incredible and is very high quality. Animation breakdowns are near impossible to find in the series and character designs are very nice. Dance scenes are beautifully drawn but at some points 3D rendering is used and it honestly looks terrible. Although these moments are rare, they do bring the overall quality down.  Overall Opinion: 9/10  Season two did a magnificent job of holding onto the energy of season one and the slice of life genre while still have plot progression and a range of moments that make you laugh and cry. Overall, highly recommended.;Recommended
9;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;AndyKyrielight;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AndyKyrielight;9;"Love Live! School Idol Project is a slice of life musical anime, about nine high school girls joining together in a hit new craze, becoming school idols! Eventually they will compete with many other schools nationwide in Love Live, to see which idol group is the best of them all. It's not all for fun though, for the main goal of competing in Love Live for out girls is to become popular enough to get more registered students for the school or have the school be closed down next year.  Love Live! School Idol Project's nine girls are all lovable in their own way, and of course by the end of your time watching it, you might have a ""best girl"" of your choice. The girls when on stage are well animated with great songs and dance choreography to really shine on stage. Off the stage each girl continue their days of high school youth, whether it's at practice, home, out for fun, or any other matter of activity.  The girls are overflowing with charm and lovable quirks, with also some witty humor spread out through the whole anime. It is one of the few musical focused pieces of media that I can recommend to people and adore in my own way, the biggest strength of the entire experience of course being the well fleshed out personalities of each girl, with their own struggles they wish to overcome in hopes of achieving their dream. To be not just school idols, but true idols, for the world, friends, family, and each other.  Love Live! School Idol Project takes place within Tokyo, and our nine girls compete against many other schools in the area for the chance to be winners in the Love Live competition. There is however another group of girls out on a remote coast, who will soon gather together to compete in Love Live! 5 years later... Love Live! Sunshine!! Most of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we're given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn't get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member's influence on one another. Whether it's to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.  It's this strong focus on µ's as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they're not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that—into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone. Rivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of µ's to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it's proof that µ's has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.  From the uplifting yet melancholic ""Snow Halation"" to the rosy ""Aishiteru Banzai!"", Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I'm sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it's the same adorable art that I've grown to love, and I don't think that needs to change.  When I reflect back on my journey with µ's and School Idol Project, I really couldn't have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I'm their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give µ's a listen.  Many music and memories are awaiting you!";Recommended
10;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;superp2222;https://myanimelist.net/profile/superp2222;9;The second part of Love Live explores the developments µ's as they continue to grow and mature after the aftermath of the first Love Live competition and their rebounding. After quickly getting hooked on by their songs and the hilarious antics that goes on within µ's, I was delighted to find the second season one-upping its prequel and going above and beyond with µ's performances in the second Love Live tournament.  Story Compared to last season, the story is way better, although its the same premise, the group entered in smarter and wiser. Something this season did do differently from its prequel was focus more on the songs, but more on that later. As the story progresses, the team starts to deal with the inevitable truth that their group can only last so long, and through this, the story places an emphasis on the 2nd year trio, being caught directly in the centre of the dilemma. Because of the emotional connection the anime previously established with their first season, the second season went above and beyond to use that emotional connection to create a captivating story and ultimately a very meaningful and heavy ending. The climb to the climax is also extremely well done and had me firmly on the edge of my seat. Not only because the songs are such absolute bangers, but because of how much the characters matured throughout the journey.  Characters Comparing to last season, the character developments are much better, and when combined with the developments made in the previous season, makes the entire cast feel like a real group of girls singing their hearts out. Honoka has now become the Student Council President. A role presumably bestowed upon her by previous president Eli because she is graduating. While this sudden decision had most of us completely baffled, her new leadership role ultimately becomes beneficial for the team because it forces her to mature and step into a leadership role, something that she didn't do much last season. This ultimately gives us firm markers to see just how much she's come since the day she proposed to form µ's. While the other 2nd years didn't receive as much development compared to last year, the show still obliged by giving us a small arc with Umi, Kotori, and Maki suffering from an Artist's Block during the team's training camp. Rin became one of the more definite highlights in character development, as we dive deep into her opinions on her outer image. This has been touched on by the previous season, but not fully developed. However, in this season, the anime fully put Rin in the spotlight by forcing her onto a position she wants, but she doesn't admit she does. We get to see Rin beneath all her nya~'s and see her mature and grow. Hanayo also, in turn, develops as Rin's best friend, this time taking a leadership role instead of being pushed around to do things to help her best friend express her true feelings. The focus in the 3rd years this season revolves around Nozomi and Nico. With Nico's arc we see a predictable yet surprising side of her, but also a side of her that we never even seen before. With the introduction of her younger siblings and how she's juggling Idol duties and responsibility of being the eldest sister, we see Nico in a new light, and ultimately makes us respect her signature Nico Nico Nii just a bit more. Nozomi's arc, despite being a tad bit rushed, still gives us insight into her motives. Despite not seeing a new side of her, we get further insight into the current side of Nozomi we all know. Why she gave µ's their name, why she joined, and just how much Nozomi planned to make sure her friend Eli could lighten up and learn the value of friendship.  Art and Sound If anyone's ever listened to µ's music, they will know that the second season has the best tracks that the entire Love Live series has ever known. However, there are a few I'd like to place a highlight on. First, the undisputed most popular song µ's has ever released, Snow Halation. As mentioned in the anime, Snow Halation is µ's first attempt at a love song, comprised of lyrics written by the entire group. When they performed it, the animation was at its peak. The passive lighting the blue gates give to the group, their dance choreography, and even the way the actors sang. It stayed true to its lyrics, simultaneously driving a knife in our hearts and warming it past its boiling point. Second is Bokura Wa Ima No Naka De, which many may recognize as the Season One OP. When they made the callback to this song by performing it in the Love Live competition, I was completely floored, suddenly, everything the group did up to that point made sense, as the OP suddenly took on a new meaning as the epitome, the peak, the highest point µ's has ever achieved. Callbacks to original season OPs aren't a new concept, but the way Love Live pulled it off made it that much more special.  Overall, season 2 went above and beyond, driving the group up past the highest point. it was extremely pleasing to see them grow so high, and ultimately, make the results that much more worth it.;Recommended
11;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;RoryBurrows;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RoryBurrows;7;"Ambition – the driving force of a goal. There’s no doubt that season 1 of Love Live is a truly weak series. There was a lack of detail to characterization; the flow of the plot was all over the place: Shoving cute girls and memes down your throat and then ending on some of the worst melodrama present in anime at the end. It would be easy to pass off the second season as equally irresponsible as the first; but oddly enough the second season of Love Live works wonders. This improvement in quality it ascends Love Live from being a trashy meme-fest into something of true emotion even if contrived at many points.  Go for glory; the goal set in mind for the group. After saving their school and realising the little time they have left as a group with the third year students graduating; the nine girls of Muse up the ante by setting out to win Love Live! A simple plot really, but what makes this concept work so well is the structure of this season. Character based episodes and moments of bonding help flesh out the cast well enough while still building the story up to its climax. The fun notion and diverse story of each episode and improved comedy makes the ride endearing; episodes centred on the girls watching romantic films; Honoka and Hanayo losing weight and other quirky concepts that make the show constantly engaging; even if to poke fun at. These episodes are mostly comprised of interaction between the nine main characters; and whilst still conceivably stereotypical, they enhance the overall enjoyment of the show. Achieving a much better structure than what the first season achieved.  This season also manages to be quite emotional with reminiscence of the journey the members of the group embarked on, the daunting realisation the girls feel as their final concert together as Muse draws near; all of it feels so content. The dedication; the journey, everything the anime throws at you has you rooting for the girls in one way or another. By the end of the anime there’s enough development into each area of the show; that you may be able to look back in joy and appreciation at the story as a whole, and the bonds with each member of the group. Sure there are many times where elements of the show become questionable and writing feels weak; such as certain road-blocks for the group, seemingly dumb character actions, and a focus too heavily oriented on appealing as a Slice of Life oriented series; but that feeling of bitter-sweet progression for the group through this season make this a wonderful and whole-rounded experience.   Of course the story wouldn’t receive this much praise if it was not for the development the characters received this season. In Season 1, many of the cast was under-developed with not much attention onto each characters ambitions and what holds the group together. In this season we’re shown brighter, memorable captivating versions of the group. With more attention to their ambitions; their relationships and bonds as the group “Muse.”   Honoka receives some of the nicest development in this season compared to her personality in season 1; she’s still quite obnoxious, ditsy and dumb. But her role as the leader of Muse becomes more important this time round, with the new-found position of student council president she matures slightly and ditches all hesitation: Leading the members of Muse on their path to victory while still managing activities brought on by being president. She’s not a character worthy of much praise in the grand scheme of things, but her drive and aspirations to win Love Live not only for herself but for those around her who have helped her get this far is touching.  Rin is the most noteworthy example of Love Live doing character development correctly. From an un-important side character from season 1; Rin evolves into a character that learns to stop doubting herself and breaks out of her shell. Improving confidence of her character and the rest of the cast is necessary to strengthen the bond between Muse; this leads to the group’s journey feeling more genuine, benefiting the show and Rin’s capability and likeability. Her development isn’t that special but the care into developing the cast members to create a more whole experience makes the show much more praise-worthy.  Eli is my favourite character in this show; and probably my favourite anime girl in the entire medium. I don’t think she is a great character overall. But, her appearance, and caring; knowledgeable and sweet personality make her special to me. Her character had great development in season 1, but this season it focuses on a different section of her character; her relationship with Nozomi.  In some-what of a yuri manner, the bond between these two characters is very close and they bounce of each other very well. Both clearly have a very strong relationship together; after spending a lot of time in the student-council. They are both a source of motivation for one another: as explored in Nozomi’s back-story of how they met and the affection they both share. It’s very sweet to see these characters interactions and tight bond with each other. They care for the group equally; especially Nozomi due to the loneliness she feels living on her own. Both are heavily endearing characters and are mature and beautiful.  To be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Nico: A fan-favourite of the first season; Nico develops even further from her character arc in the first season. A display of her Narcissistic, self-centred attitude wishing to be praised by her family, after feeling desolation for two years from a lack of being able to find those with the same interests as her. This character arc leads to some quite charming and funny moments with the members of her family introduced, and Nico continues being as expressive as ever with her existential catchphrase ""Nico Nico Nii.""  Regarding the rest of the cast; most of their development took place in season 1, in which they maintain their personalities throughout the shows run. Kotori and Umi support Honoka in her aspirations and are quite pleasing characters, without any heavy development centred on them; same goes for the first years: Hanayo and Maki. While not serving super important roles into Love Live’s structure or development; they complement the series very well.   As much as these characters do not contain much depth to them; this should not be a sign of them being bad. There’s probably gropes you can have with certain characters. But for the most part the cast serve the show well for what it is: A fun display of the idol dream coming to life with a quirky roster of school students.   As animation goes for Love Live; it remains pretty generic and remains quite standard through its run-time, although this is an obvious improvement from season 1. It still doesn’t reach excel in style outside of the dance segments. While the face designs between characters aren’t very different from each-other; one area that works well for the show is the facial expressions: The over-exaggerated nature of these works extremely well with comedic impact. Love Live definitely doesn’t handle the switch between traditional and CG very well; something it has achieved later on in the franchise but at this point is still incredibly weak. While the dance scenes have pretty nice choreography and the scenes presented in the traditional animation style look wonderful the contrast between the two is quite jarring: The models being quite laggy and not blending in with surroundings very well.   Much like the first season the song choices included aren’t exactly the best of what the music front of Love Live has to offer; the most memorable and emotional song of this season is “Snow Halation.” A song that has quite a bit of history on the internet; and one that is quite peaceful yet exciting to listen to at the same time. Another good inclusion is “Aishteruze Banzai” which is sadly cut short in run-time from its true potential impact as a song, leaving in un-memorable. For the other songs of the show, the opening and ending are similar to that of season 1: Complementing the genre well but not being too heavily impressive. Much is the case with many other songs in this season; the general preference in songs seems to be those catering to the generic ideal style of idol songs rather than more emotional and expressive songs.   Love Live is a heavily captivating show; and it’s obvious how it got to the high point of success it did. Season 2 pumps out a lot of improvements to the characters, story and overall presentation making it a heavily enjoyable ride and something that will stick with me for a long-time. Watching the cast members grow is moving; the comedy is constantly hilarious. Therefore making Love Live Season 2 a show I wholeheartedly think is good even with its visible flaws.";Recommended

14;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;peco-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/peco-sama;9;"This review will go for both the first and second season, it seems kind of pointless to review them separately. Honestly I don't even know where to begin with this anime outside of the word spectacular. I realize I am slightly behind the curve but it must have slipped through the cracks for me when it aired. Regardless, this anime was absolutely incredible.  Story - 9: My only gripe with the story is the ending of the first season. No spoilers but it was the weakest area of the anime and the only reason I cannot award it a perfect 10. As much as I would like to add it to my exclusive list of 10s, I just can't. Outside of this blemish in the middle of the series the story was phenomenal and went in the direction that just felt so right. The ending of the second season and thus the anime was perfect. With feels that hit in just right way and a big finish to end an anime that did things BIG, it was perfect.  Art - 10: The art in the first season was awesome. Each character is drawn well in her own distinct way, the scenery is very nice and pleasing to the eye. The second season began and this became a whole new animal. The art was on par with best of any anime I have watched, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking, the detail in everything from surroundings to clothing to subtle facial features was beautifully done. The performances by Muse were also beautifully done, wile they cut to a 3D at times I deemed it necessary as well as pleasing to the eye. With all of these elements done so well art-wise, it was the art during the performances that put this anime over the top into the category of one of the best artistic shows I have watched.  Sound - 10 (11): The music featured in this anime could possibly be the best I have experienced. If not the best, top 5 for sure. The score is masterfully written and used so well. It follows the scenes perfectly and sets the mood in a way that is matched by few. When the feels hit you, they hit hard thanks to a beautiful oboe piece. When the girls are being mischievous or having some fun, you can feel those feelings thanks to this magical score. The score however is just one element of the sound featured in this anime. As a school idol anime it features of course pop idol performances along with song. The songs sung by Muse and A-RISE alike are just great. This could depend on your taste in music, but for me as a J-Pop fan they were awesome.  Character - 10: There are anime that run for literally years that do not develop characters as well as Love Live did. The show took nine girls and made me feel like each one could've been the main character in her own way. They visibly grew as people, friends, a band, and even performers. You could see actual improvement in their shows from performance to performance, it was nothing short of brilliant. The members of muse even after the beautiful art ad captivating music had to be what I'd say kept me wanting more.  Enjoyment 10: I have not enjoyed an anime this much in a long time. Even when the writing seemed poor for a brief period I enjoyed the anime because of how much it made me care for the characters. Throughout I was on the edge of my seat, saying ""awwww"", and maybe crying a liiiittle bit. It did everything well and I enjoyed it from episode 1-26.  So as badly as I want to give this anime a 10 I have to give it a 9 because of the one hiccup season one. I have to keep the 10 rating for literally perfect anime or else the line blurs pretty hard. With that being said Love Live is an asymptote to a masterpiece. It is absolutely recommended at a 9/10. Thank you for reading!";Recommended
15;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;9;Not too long ago I looked at Love Live. The anime portion of a multi-media project. It was an enjoyable series. The first series introduced us to µ's (pronounced Muse.) µ's formed with three members in order to gain interest in their school to prevent it shutting down. We saw the original three gradually grow into nine. We saw the nine girls coming together as friends & comrades, doing live shows and getting really, really, really homo-erotic with one another. So, our heroines managed to save their school in the end. Where are they going to go from there?  Story:  We open with Honoka giving a speech as the brand new student council President. Turns out Eri recommended her for the position. Hanayo is interrupted at practice by the news that they're doing another Love Live competition. Most members of µ's are excited by the prospect and eager to enter but Honoka is strangely uninterested, saying that things are fine as they are. The girls are able to persuade her that µ's should enter by pointing out that this will be Nozomi, Eri & Nico's last chance to compete in the competition since they're graduating shortly after. They're also able to ascertain why Honoka hesitated. The story follows µ's and their endeavour to win the competition, their coming to terms with the third years graduating and them just having fun and being yurirrific.  The biggest problem with the narrative in this series is that the main arc surrounding the competition is really predictable. You can pretty easily guess where it's going to go just from the set up, without watching a single episode of the series. The series does do a lot well, though. The comedy in this is really effective. The first series was pretty entertaining and had some good comedic moments, but this one elevates it to a completely different level. There are also some really good moments in the main narrative, in spite of its general predictability and there is some effective tension surrounding the graduation and the question of where µ's is going to go from there. The ending is a bit bitter-sweet but it's really effective.  Characters:  The girls get to develop further as characters than they did in the first series. There are several episodes primarily dedicated to developing them as characters and adding depth to the archetypes. Rin and Nozomi both get really good ones. I will also give this series credit over the first, Nozomi's bad touch habit is virtually non-existent in this one. She gropes another girl without permission once. Which is still completely not okay, but at least it's not a regular thing like it was in the first series. I bet Eri threatened to break up with her if she kept groping other girls. Either way, the combination of that getting toned significantly down and her focus episode combine to transform Nozomi into a really good character. The characters are still a lot of fun and there are still really good interactions, including some with the rival idol group, A-Rise.  Art:  Much like the first series, this one has really good costumes and dance numbers. The characters are still basically missing their noses, though. I think this art style was designed by someone with rhinophobia. That would explain so much. In spite of that, the art and animation are good.  Sound:  The cast is excellent. Love Live has singers who are also excellent in their roles. See, Ice, it is possible to have people who can do both. The music is superb. Both series of Love Live have really mazing soundtracks.  Ho-yay:  It's easy to see why yuri fans gravitate towards this franchise. The les-yay levels are massive. Really, any potential pairing would make sense but there are some that come across more strongly than others. Rin and Hanyo continue to be really adorable. We've also got Nozomi and Eri, who also get quite a bit of les-yay with both Maki and Nico. Honoka, Umi and Kotori are all really homo-erotic with one another.  Final Thoughts:  Love Live series 2 is a definite improvement over the first. The characters are strengthened. The comedy is more effective and the story, overall, has more going for it. It's not perfect, but it's well worth watching. My final rating on it is going to be a 9/10. The first series was good. This one is excellent. Next week I'll look at Solty Rei.;Recommended
16;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;OVERPOWERED99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OVERPOWERED99;9;"STORY - 9 ART - 9 SOUND - 10 CHARACTER - 9 ENJOYMENT - 9  Honestly, it's not easy to concisely describe just how vivid the second season of School Idol Project is. A beautiful outburst of the soul. A melodic magic that lifts the heart. A lyrical expression full of emotions. These words are close enough to express how I feel but really, it's better if you listen to µ's (""Muse"") once more. Because as the saying goes:  ""Where words fail, music speaks.""  Every journey will always have a start and an end; and within it, there will always be a story. The story of µ's began as a school-saving solution, and through the passing of time, their journey is reshaped into a sincerity that speaks of passionate wonders, of incredible friendship, and of valued memories. The second season is a continuation of that. With the third-years' graduation quickly drawing near, the end of µ's seems nigh, but it doesn't stop them from making sure their last experience is a meaningful one. The next destination is the second Love Live! contest, and they will make sure to give everything they can to reach that grand stage.  This is the culmination of their experience together as a school idol group.  Most of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we're given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn't get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member's influence on one another. Whether it's to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.  It's this strong focus on µ's as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they're not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that—into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.  Rivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of µ's to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it's proof that µ's has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.  From the uplifting yet melancholic ""Snow Halation"" to the rosy ""Aishiteru Banzai!"", Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I'm sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it's the same adorable art that I've grown to love, and I don't think that needs to change.  When I reflect back on my journey with µ's and School Idol Project, I really couldn't have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I'm their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give µ's a listen.  Many music and memories are awaiting you.";Recommended
17;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"Singing in front of people isn’t easy. Just picture yourself in front of an audience or in an arena of over 10,000 people looking at you and perhaps almost always judging you on your performance. It’s both a thrilling and nerve wrecking experience, especially for idols. But for Muse, this is exactly what they are aiming for – to perform and captivate the audience with their talent in the art of singing. Love Live School Idol Project returns for a second season starring Muse members are they find their way with music.  μ's (pronounced as Muse), makes its anticipated return with all its members back. One particular attribute that stands out for this group is the fact that Honoka, its group leader, has also became the school council president. The sequel insightfully shows how she is able to lead her group to stardom. It’s not easy given the intense competition such as popular idol group, Arise whom stands a firm obstacle in their way. Nonetheless, Honoka takes the stage and does her best to captivate the audience with her skills.  While the first season introduced Muse’s members on the surface level, the second season goes beyond that and focuses more on some of its specific characters. In retrospect, more noticeable characters such as Nico, Rin, and Nozomi all get some of spotlight. Some even get parts of their past revealed in an honest way to show the audience their journey to whom they are now. The sequel does a solid job by evoking thoughts to appreciate the person they are today. And of course, that would be taking on the role of an idol as part of Muse. It takes a group of nine girls yet each of them deliver a special charm. In one particular episode, each of them describe their condition and purpose in just one yet solidifying word. These words are honest feelings with distinctive moments to focus on an aim to success.  Even as an underrated group, Muse continues to make a dominant presence throughout the show. The paramount of their dream comes to a climatic moment when they perform their signature song in front of the audience. Also known for their spirit and determination, Muse is an inspiring group that seeks out their dreams, chases after it, and never ceases to let it go. Win, tie, or loss, the group wants to not just aim for success but also give the audience what they want. And that, is entertainment. The majority of the sequel is built-up but the final few episodes details the fruits of their efforts. In fact, the story is fairly simple. It’s about an idol group of girls aiming for success with their dreams. The catch is what happens afterwards? The sequel depicts a short yet memorable journey as their distinction could change these girls’ lives forever. It also makes us wonder what happens afterwards. As the show nears its end, the girls realizes that nothing lasts forever with tearful moments to induce hardcore feelings of sorrow.  Responsibility and teamwork are also prominent ideas incorporated to this sequel. In fact, one particular member is made temporary leader on the spot as result of special circumstances. Luckily, this adapts with teamwork as she is able to hold everything together not just by herself but with her fellow idols. By presenting itself with this direction, it creates feelings of inspiration and can be relatable when you find yourself needing a helping hand. This is especially true earlier on in the series when the girls faces the hardship of writing music by pressure. And that’s what Muse really is, not just an idol group but a group of girls who shares a deep bond for music and their powerful friendship.  Despite the premise and setup, the show does suffer a bit with some pacing issues. Some episodes feels fillerish including a trollish beach scenario. We also get some gimmicky storyline craftsmanship when it comes to execution with subplots like going on a diet habit. Also, it’s somewhat noticeable that some similar scenarios and scenes are reused; not entirely trace by trace but has familiarity. The recycled ideas becomes a bit of a pin-down and in essence doesn’t strongly recreate memorable moments. And despite being character focused, the series does omit highlights for some characters. The main point is that the sequel anticipates their performance in a festival against other prominent idol groups. The most developed rivalry is against the 3-girl group ARISE, who makes Muse look like an underdog. The rivalry is tense but ultimately isn’t anything too explicit or made into mainstream as a main event. Rather, it trifle on the event for Muse to become superstars with predictable outcomes.  Artwork remains standard with Sunrise being charge of the production. Characters are designed with charm, innocence, and with the passion for music. Although not supermodels, the girls have their own qualities and portrays with a beautiful grace. The decorative outfits they wear in front of the world are not just flamboyant, attractive, but also become an image of their dream. Body gestures and their dance moves also inspire creativity with no movement being wasted. It’s hands down attractive not by appearance but with style, class, and inspiration.  When talking about the soundtrack, the music would obviously be a key and in my respect, the sequel nails this right away. Although the OP song isn’t something home write about, music shown and performed in this show is colorful. Lyrics are detailed with energy and enthusiasm. Prominent songs from the original project makes their way with alternate edits to deliver a symbol of Love Live. The choreography is excellent with a down-to-earth style yet remains resilient with its smooth setting. Some of the songs also shows symbolism as the animators decorates it with background gags. Additionally, the characters all have distinctive voice mannerism to reflect their personalities. The bottom line is that they are able to command attention and deliver a stellar performance in connection with the songs.  The show itself isn’t a masterpiece but it should be appreciable with this sequel. It’s not easy being an idol but with friends, anything is possible. The way Love Live can inspire is something to take notice of as the director and animators takes advantage of its directional story. Through characterization and focus, we see different sides of characters as they take on obstacles. And although the story isn’t complex or entirely thought provoking, it’s honest with great comedy. Just be aware that not all the songs can be something you’d enjoy, especially when compared to its original source. Yet, this sequel came, delivered, and leaves the building with endearing moments.";Recommended
18;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;Nadimi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nadimi;9;The only times I ever binge-watch anime is when I'm either extremely bored or the series is extremely entertaining. Although the 2nd season of Love Live! School Idol Project is far from being a masterpiece or one of my all-time favorite shows, it's oddly addicting and, most importantly, far better than the first season.  Despite being turned off by the many problems the first season had, the positive reviews and the amazing art made me want to continue watching this show. Luckily, I was not disappointed.  Although the music is still a bit too generic and immature for my personal taste, there are lots of fun new songs and dance sequences. The dance sequences seem to have definitely improved as the CG is either used less or in a more subtle way (or maybe I've just become used to it). As such, all of the performances are seriously striking and make you wish you were up on stage dancing with μ's, too.  Additionally, the art is as gorgeous as ever (if not more so) and features some of the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in anime. The voice acting does not disappoint either, and the girls quickly transition from sounding slightly annoying to actually sounding kind of cute.  Most importantly, however, the story itself is far more interesting. Although the girls are still trying to participate in the Love Live! Contest and face many problems along the way, their struggles now seem far more believable and even relate-able, specially for fellow girls (after all, who has never dealt with the horrors of gaining weight, feeling awkward when wearing cute outfits and enduring painful workouts and diets?)  As if that wasn't enough, there is far more emphasis on the girls as individuals with their own fears and ambitions rather than simple singing blobs that all love each other for no apparent reason. By showing more of their family, childhood memories, and personal problems, it is easier to see them as real human beings that try really hard to fulfill their dreams. Unsurprisingly, their relationships also benefit greatly from this and allow for far more genuine interactions.  Overall, this is a surprisingly enjoyable show that, while slightly cheesy and juvenile, portrays human relationships, struggles, failures and successes in a way that is both beautiful and believable.;Recommended
19;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;psyart;https://myanimelist.net/profile/psyart;9;This review will cover the second season of LLSIP. I'll probably make some comparisons here and there to the first season but if you're interested in what I've had to say for the first season, please see the review I wrote for it beforehand.  Love Live, for me, is one of those series that, before watching, I thought I wouldn't like a bit, but after actually heading into it, I ended up loving it. Also, I honestly can't believe I've missed it all this time.  Having said a lot in my review of the first season already, I feel like there isn't much to add here. The second season of Love Live tops the first one, which had a rather rocky start, in all aspects.  If you didn't enjoy the first season as much but still like the show enough to make you want to see more from it, I can be certain when I say that you will feel rewarded at the end of another ~260 minute run. It looks better, feels better, is better in general and more fun to watch.  The characters, who I've had an objective issue with in the first season, actually felt like genuine characters this time around. There is definitely an amount of care put into handling them which can be noticed as you take your time through the season but that can also be seen in the plot as well. A matching pace this time around, rewarding plot-line and, overall, experience.  I don't really talk about the artstyle unless it's too hideous or fascinating to note, but improvements can be seen there as well. The enviroment and characters just look better, I'd say they had more life in them compared to the first season. Love Live looks just fine in general, though some might find the CGI to be somewhat distracting.  This should be a given, but Love Live has an amazing soundtrack, being an idol anime. It makes a return and finds its way to stay of on-point quality, appeal as each song showcases a new stage for µ's and as an advancement route for the group as performers and people. I find the peak of music in LLSIP to be ''Snow Halation'', a track that showcases µ's and their appeal. It is an absolutely amazing uplifting albeit sad vocal piece that I have a special place for both subjectively and objectively.  The amount of passion & hype that surrounded Love Live all this time is something I never really understood, until now. I think it will manage to claw itself in as one of the franchises I am most emotionally engaged with and I can't wait to see more from it.;Recommended
0;Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season;ratchet573;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ratchet573;5;"Love Live School Idol Project is not meant for me. Reviewing a show this girly and happy is pretty much impossible based on my age, sex, and what I enjoy watching. The reason I don’t review Pretty Cure? I’m not a ten year old girl. The reason I review Love Live? Despite obviously being a show for ten year old girls it’s got a raging male fanbase that’s about my age.  A year ago I wrote a review for the first season that I feel, now, complains about all the wrong things. It doesn’t at all hit the nail on the head for how to approach this series. It also complains a lot about Nico. I don’t know why considering she’s my favorite girl in the series….  Since that review the Love Live mobile game was released in May and, I won’t lie, I play it every once in a while when I need a time-waster. Also a second season was released early last year that I neglected till now because that seems to be the way I operate.  The second season of Love Live has the girls of Muse participating in another Love Live tournament. As it will be the last chance for the seniors to win the tournament, there’s a lot of pressure on Honoka and the others to perform as well as possible. They’re forced to face off against their biggest rival, A-Rise and from there battle the best school idols in Japan.  The start of this season beats around the bush so much I was nearly going to quit it. I didn’t remember the first season being quite so silly and pointless (but, that said, I barely remember much of anything about the first season in the first place). There’s a lot of exploration of the different characters as well as a really crappy storyline about writing a new song for the Love Live tournament. This episode, in which they go to one of Maki’s summer homes to get some peace, should have shown the comradeship of the girls and how they go about writing songs. What we get instead is a stupid, disjointed episode where, for some reason, they think it’s a good idea to write the lyrics and the music separately.  What? So if the beat of the music doesn’t match the lyrics that’s okay?  Two character episodes are actually somewhat interesting and fun. The Nico episode in which we get to see some of her family is pretty cute and the Rin episode where she’s trying to act like the girl she feels she is makes you d’aww.  But after the slow start and the somewhat interesting character exploration, we’re presented with a lot of forced drama. The focus isn’t that much on the Love Live or the music; unlike the first season which I commended for having a lot of catchy songs (I still remember Start;Dash a year later). But this season’s music is lacking any sort of staying power and it feels like it’s put on the backburner to make room for a ton of tears.  The final few episodes are like…Ano Hana level of crying. It’s sad, definitely, to see the seniors go but it’s not so sad I need a whole episode dedicated to them bawling their eyes out. This is episode eleven, which is cute in execution and idea, but ends with so much forced crying that I wanted to laugh instead. It’s okay to be sad and express it but don’t be overexpressive. Especially on something as small as the seniors leaving.  Then episode twelve is the concert of the Love Live. Be prepared for more cheesiness.  And the last episode is the overlong epilogue that further drags out how sad it is the seniors are leaving then ends by…teaching us not to let go of people who are moving on? I didn’t understand the end at all.  How come you guys can’t hang out after they go to college? Can’t you continue to be an idol group that focuses on larger stages? Doesn’t winning the Love Live mean you could do that sort of thing?  Combine the over-dramatic and weak storytelling with the sheer girliness and you will be laughing your ass off. My God is this show cheesy with themes of friendship and love and following your dreams. The group stands together and screams things into the sky, people stand and clap for no reason, everyone acts like best friends. Oh, and don’t forget the cute little exultations that come every time that the girls see something mildly amusing. I like to call these “anime sounds” because in no other medium have I ever seen people go “uguu” over lights.  The writing in the show is pretty lame as well. The character’s are all easily identifiable by their two dimensional traits but the things they say can really make you laugh. At one point Honoka is staring at the city with her friends and talking about how bright the lights are. There’s a huge Zen moment that makes no sense coming from a bunch of teenagers. They talk about the lights belonging to people and not knowing those people…like, what the fuck? And this is followed by them all screaming at the city, completely ruining the somber, thoughtful tone. For the most part, the show if funny if only because of the crappy script.  Regardless of these complaints the show is cute as hell and still manages a laugh or two every episode that’s not courtesy of being shitty.  The animation is alright. Just like the first season is resorts to MMD-style during musical numbers that makes everything look awkward. There’s a huge amount of close-up shots of the girls’ faces which can be scary as fuck (from afar you girls are moe but up close you’re freaking aliens). Otherwise it’s not impressive by any stretch.  And the music, as I said, is weaker than season one. There’s a great variety of music during the show but the actual performances aren’t memorable at all.  Oh, do you hear that sound? It’s time to play BEST GIRL!  9. Honoka- I believe it was Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones who said the best way to keep an annoying bitch quiet is to put your genitals in her mouth. Honoka is the most annoying group leader of anything ever. Someone put their genitals in her mouth. 8. Hanayo- Moeblob von No Character. I could give a fuck less. 7.Umi- It’s so cute when you get mad. Too bad you’re boring otherwise! 6. Kotori- Boooooooooring. But moe as hell. 5.Eli- Cute but definitely not exciting. 4.Rin- Good development in this season. The writers need to quit overusing the “Nyan” thing though because it’s really awkward. 3.Nozomi- Really cute and probably the most mature of the characters. Also has a good gimmick. 2.Maki- Tsundere rich lesbian is cool. 1. Nico- May be a self-centered bitch at times but is only trying to live her dream and enjoy her passion. Totally the most adorable and best girl.  Season 2 of Love Live might be good for younger girls or guys with nothing better to masturbate to, but for me, despite a few silly and cute moments, it was pretty forgettable.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! School Idol Project;Pietru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pietru;9;When asked, a lot of people don't like idol anime or anything similar, or in other words, anime based on music and stuff. I'm one of these people. I don't usually watch idol anime, but I wanted to try this out because of the outstanding art that this anime offers.  At first I was really hesitant, even to the point where I removed it off my PTW list because I would feel embarrassed having watched something like this. Sure this anime might be targeted towards children rather than teens/adults, but it doesn't mean that teens/adults wouldn't enjoy this. This anime taught to me that hard work actually does pay off, that if you try your hardest, you will eventually arrive to your destination point.  There are a lot of things I liked about this anime, but the thing I liked most was probably the art. Yes, I'm a very picky person when it comes to art, and this anime reached my expectations when it came to the art. All the characters were nicely designed and all of the 9 girls are cute. In other words, the art was what some people call it, flawless.  The only thing I disliked about this anime was the fact that they were taking too long to prepare for the live shows and stuff like that. The producers should have shown the girls in action more (I don't literally mean in action, I meant that they should probably have shown more of their songs).  In terms of characters, all of them are easily likable, none of them are really that bland. There are 3 main characters in this anime, Honoka, who is seriously hyper and energetic, Umi who is very shy and was reluctant to become a school idol at first, and Kotori who is a very calm, and a little shy.  We have these 3 main characters make an school idol group in order to save the school from closing (because they aren't reaching the applicant quota). They name this school idol group 'Muse' (sorry I don't want to look all over the internet just for a greek character). Eventually they reach 9 members by around episode 6-9, forgot. That's basically it for the story since I don't want to spoil a lot.  The sound is the second thing I enjoyed a lot in this anime. The opening was just straight up amazing, I almost watched it every episode. I don't usually watch endings because they're usually dull and boring, but I really loved the ending song this time, I ended up watching it every episode. The insert songs were amazing too, I ended up downloading that 'Dash' song too (it was that good :>).  I could probably say that I felt embarrassed inside while watching the first few episodes due to this being my first idol anime, but eventually I got used to the feeling and I opened myself up to this anime. All in all I could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot for my first idol anime, and I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an idol anime.  Thanks for reading :> - Peten00b;Recommended
1;Love Live! School Idol Project;TrashyPandas;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TrashyPandas;10;"Trashy Pandas Love Live! School Idol Project Review May 22, 2014  *THIS ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST SEASON I WILL EVENTUALLY GET AROUND TO WRITING THE REVIEW FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES BUT SCHOOL IS TAKING UP ALL OF MY TIME*  “Datte kanosei kanjitanda. Sou da susume. Kokai shitaku nai me no mae ni bokura no michi ga aru.” “I feel we have a chance. Yes let's push forward. I don't want to regret it later. Our future lies right ahead.” from the song Susume by Muse. Hope. Desires. Goals. Perseverance. Friendship. Love. Music. The girls of the school idol group Muse share all of these wonderful things as they give it their all to be a part of the most popular event for high school idol groups: Love Live. The nine girls strive to save their school from closing by trying to attract perspective students through the formation of a school idol group that, they hope, will one day be a part of Love Live. Honoka Kousaka leads her group of eight other cute, talented high school friends towards Love Live. The anime Love Live! School Idol Project has become my #1 favorite anime because of the wonderful, loveable, and memorable characters, the outstanding animation style, and, most importantly, the best, most addictive, and energetic soundtrack, which all culminate into one amazing story of friendship, love, hope, and music.  I Plot The plot for Love Live! Is very straight forward, easy to follow, and enjoyable. The story goes as anyone would expect after watching the first episode: the main character and her friends work to save their school from closing by trying to attract new students by gaining popularity through the formation of a school idol group which becomes known as “Muse”. This formula is followed for most of the story, however there are several complications that are not expected and some twists. I'm not going to spoil it, even though this is a review. While being not very complex, the plot forms a solid foundation for the anime, is consistently present, and keeps the story progressing. There is not much else to say without spoiling the twists and turns. The plot fits well and proves fairly interesting.  II Romance? There are no “official” romances in Love Live!, however, there are subtle and clear hints at possible relationships that could be. My favorite of the possible romances is Honoka x Maki. Honoka is the energetic, lively leader of Muse while Maki is very level-headed and reserved. I love the contrast that would make their relationship work like a charm. Other than this, there are no relationships to expand on, you just get enjoyment from shipping the girls together.  III Theme The main theme of Love Live! Is never give up despite how impossible the road ahead may seem and always remember that your friends are there with you every step of the way. Friends are there to stick with you through thick and thin, good and bad weather, shit storms and double rainbows. Also, be aware of your friends and their feelings. Another key part of the theme is to never give up on your dreams. No matter how many setbacks and roadblocks are in the way, the prize at the end of the road is worth the experiences that are encompassed by the journey. The theme is not much more complex than this.  IV Animation and Art Style The animation for Love Live! Is mind-blowingly amazing. For the most part, the animation and art is in 2D, but when the girls put on their performances, the animation switches over to 3D character models for exciting, energetic dance routines. Starting with the 2D aspect, the girls have extremely cute, distinguishing physical appearances. I love the designs for the girls' eyes; the eyes are realistically proportioned and detailed. The girls' bodies are realistic and resemble what actual high school girls would look like, i.e. they don't have obnoxiously large breasts and overly exaggerated sexual features except Nozomi, who has large breasts but not to the point that it's the only thing the viewer cares about or notices. I love that the girls aren't sexualized like in a lot of anime such as Sekirei or High School DxD; I feel the anime would have been totally different if that were the case. As for the surroundings and environment, it's pretty standard. NOW, for the 3D animation. Wow, wow, this hits it out of the ballpark: 3D song and dance routines that will make you sit in awe while watching these amazingly cute girls have the time of their lives. I wish that there were a lot more of these, but I highly doubt the animation budget could have incorporated them. Still, I digress, the 3D animation makes a massive impact on the viewers and is just spectacular.  V Characters The characters in Love Live! Are some of my favorite characters of all time because of how unique, well designed, and beautiful they are. Honoka Kousaka, the protagonist, is an extremely lively, spontaneous, and strong willed girl who will do anything to achieve her dreams. Honoka forms Muse with her friends, Umi and Kotori before reaching out to get more girls to help with reaching their goal. Honoka is so lovable; she is so determined to do everything she can to keep her school from being closed down. There isn't anything bad to say about her. Umi Sonoda, one of Honoka's best friends from childhood, is a very calm, sensible, and serious girl who does archery at the high school while being a part of Muse. Umi is very talented with poetry and has superb writing skills; she writes mostly all of the lyrics for Muse's songs. Umi is just as determined as Honoka, but a lot more forceful when it comes to accomplishing things. She is a very lovable and is attractive in as a strong female character. Kotori Minami, who is my favorite character and my #1 waifu, is probably THE most adorable character I've ever seen. I love her hairstyle; it's a champagne blonde color, sort of more ash colored (I don't know how to adequately describe the various shades of hair color). The way she wears it is straight down in the back with a shoulder length pony tail that is combined into a folding thing. I don't know how to describe it, but it's absolutely adorable (look it up on google images). Kotori is a very shy girl who loves her friends, and the members of Muse, more than anything. The other members of Muse are Eri Ayase, Nico Yazawa, Nozomi Tojo, Maki Nishikino, Hanayo Koizumi, and Rin Hoshizora. Eri is the leader of the high school's student council; she was apposed to the idea of Muse, but ended up joining and loving the experience. Eri is very kind, hardworking, earnest, and the best dancer in Muse. Nico Yazawa was the head of the School Idol Research Club at the school, who had previously been a part of the school's former idol group. She is extremely passionate about the group's success and wants more than anything for Muse to be a part of Love Live. She is a very tsundere-esque character but has a very sweet side that makes up for the annoying side. Nozomi Tojo is the manipulative student council vice president who indirectly helps Honoka form Muse. Nozomi also gives Muse it's name. Nozomi is very rational and the most caring member of the group; she sees deep into the other characters' feelings and does whatever she can to help them out. But she loves boobs, a lot... she grabs the other characters' breasts all the time. Maki, is the beautiful girl with dark red hair whose musical talent exceeds anything that I could ever hope to do. She is an amazing composer and does most of the work to set Umi's lyrics to a dynamic, lively tune. Similar to Umi, she is very reserved and has a lot of trouble being open with the other girls of Muse. Maki is a genius whose family wants her to become a medical doctor and inherit the family's hospital. Hanayo Koizumi is one of the three first years who is Muse's biggest fan before she joins the group. She is the most shy girl of them all who share's Nico's obsession with school idols and Love Live. Hanayo has a very kind heart, but I don't think she has a whole lot of depth from what I remember. Rin Hoshizora is the last first year and Hanayo's best friend from their childhood. Rin has the same liveliness as Honoka and has that cat-like cuteness that some anime characters have: the cute cat smile, high pitched and playful voice. Again she doesn't have a ton of depth but I still love her character as much as all of the others'.  VI Music The soundtrack for Love Live! Is just... I... I don't have a large enough, or refined enough vocabulary to do the music justice. Spirited, lively, energetic, peppy, bubbly, and beautiful is the best way for me to explain the music. I'm not a musical expert, I play bass guitar a little bit, and I love the music. The girls have the most gorgeous, beautiful, resonant voices that I've ever heard and I can't get enough of hearing all nine of these adorable girls sing. Each song is so full of energy that I want to start dancing with them, even though I'm a guy. On another note, I mainly listen to heavy metal, thrash metal, metalcore, hard rock, and classic rock but I love Muse's songs just as much as I love AC/DC, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed. If that doesn't say something about how amazing these girls are, then I don't know what does. The lyrics aren't as shallow as I thought they would be. The lyrics aren't very deep at the same time, but it's not easy to have deep lyrics for a peppy school idol group and keep the songs and performance entertaining and lively, now is it. I regret my lack of musical expertise and knowledge of musical jargon; I can't give Muse's musical talent the justice it deserves, so please go and check out the songs available on YouTube or watch the anime yourself so you can experience this amazing work of art.  Conclusion I give Love Live! School Idol Project an 11/10 for its beyond outstanding ability to spread cheerfulness, the amazing and lovable characters, the jaw dropping animation sequences and the spectacular music. Love Live! Receives the Pandas Seal of Approval, a gold medal, and the #1 spot on my top ten favorite anime list. I would highly recommend this to anyone, of any age, because of how open it is to everyone. The second season is currently airing and episode 8 is scheduled to be released within the upcoming week.";Recommended
2;Love Live! School Idol Project;Hamelin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hamelin;9;"""Love Live! School Idol Project"", I have never fully watched any idol series before, so this one was my first, and I ended up enjoying it a lot. I've tried to watch IdolM@ster when it first aired, but I just couldn't get into it. I watched Love Live after it was finished airing. I honestly don't know why I decided to watch Love Live, but I'm so glad I did.  Story There was a clear story, which was good. School is gonna get shut down if they don't get enough students, Honoka (main character) decides to become school idols to stop the school from closing. The story was simple, and I didn't have any problems with the pacing. Throughout the show, they include showing what the characters need to endure to become idols which include stamina, vocal, and dance training. I thought that this was a nice toutch to include and helped with character development quite well  Art/Animation I liked the overall art style, which fit the mood of this series, it was bright and colorful. But the one thing that I didn't like was the CG's. Luckily, they were only used during the insert songs and in the opening. They didn't use CG's for the whole song either, it switched between several times, sometimes, the CG wasn't too noticeable, which is why I didn't mind it too much. The animation looked smooth and was very well executed. No complaints about animation. I loved the choreography during the songs, sometimes, I had to rewatch one of the performances twice. Once to focus on the song, and another to look at the choreography.  Sound/Music Being an idol anime, I guess I kinda expected good music. I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. All of the songs were catchy, memorable and fit the situation very well. Even the background music stood out to me (in a good way). It always fit with the events that happened and set the tone of whats gonna happen. The opening song was amazing, I never skipped it, not a single time. The ending song was the same, never wanted to skip it.  Characters Each character had a very different personality and were all likeable in their own way. There weren't any characters that I hated. I found that I could summarize the personalities of the characters in just a few words, which isn't necessarily bad. The characters had a very human like mindset in my opinion, which enhanced the drama scenes in the show.  Conclusion I really liked this anime and am glad that I gave it a go. I have never fully watched an idol anime before this one. When I was watching, I was completely immersed in the show. I never felt bored or wanted to skip over a scene during the show. The music was amazing, I cannot stress that enough. If you haven't watched this, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.";Recommended
3;Love Live! School Idol Project;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;7;"So, you want to become a superstar?  It's not easy. In fact, it takes more than just skill. It takes the will, determination, support, technique, integrity, and a little bit of luck to reach success. In fact, reaching that point of success is especially hard when there's competition. Among other things, being an idol also means to shine and make yourself a name in the industry. You have to embrace what you do and no matter what, always aim for success.  At least, that's what the girls at Otonokizaka High School wishes to do...  Alright, this series known as Love Live! School Idol Project is actually an anime project co-produced with the music company Lantis Co., Ltd and studio Sunrise being involved. Not many people may know of the franchise but it already has achieved success in other fields of music CDS. Well, success doesn't come easy like I mentioned before and in this series, it definitely is something that's hard to achieve.  At first I was skeptical whether to check out this series or not. I mean, there are so many idol themed series already in the anime industry. Hell, even this Winter season of 2013, there is not one (Akb4OO8 Next Stage) but two (Akitasu) ongoing series involving music and idols. In fact, I sometimes get bored of watching this stuff because initially, I thought the show would just be about cute girls doing cute things. I wasn't too wrong either especially with our main female protagonist, Honoka Kosaka.  Just look at her, she's a cute little button with a cute little bang on the side of her head along with that bubbly personality.  However, beyond that outer image is a girl who is determined to prevent the shutdown of her beloved school. How? Form an idol group of course! But that's a lot easier said than done in reality. The series takes this idea and transform it into a more of a slice-of-life story in the beginning. At first, there's Honoka. Then later comes the rest of the characters, or rather girls who all becomes associated with the group. Oh and the group is called Muse represented by the ""μ's"" symbol. Obviously, it's a reflection of what the group stands for – a music ensemble of girls who wishes to show the world who they are and make a name for themselves while at the same time to prevent the destruction of their beloved school.  Thus, their journey begins...  The initial episodes (first half of the series) makes prominent highlights of some of the other girls in the series. Among these girls, they all have different personalities. There's the timid girl with the stage freight (Umi Sonoda), the cool chick (Nozomi), the tomboy (Rin Hoshizora), the cold heart (Eli), the gentle girl (Kotori Minami), and the childish (Niko Yazawa). Of course, I'm not naming all the characters here but you get the idea. From the initial premise of becoming superstars, these girls come together. However, I find the first of the episodes in this series to be dull and not done right. In fact, I find most of the girls' backgrounds to be stale and lacks any real characterization besides who they are. Perhaps the lack of a general background with the girls is the weakness here but regardless, the first half of the series is a bit mediocre in my book. Well, thanks to Niko, I did have some fun and enjoyed part of her performance. NIKO-NIKO smile~  However, the series becomes more lively later on especially with Honoka. I will say right now that her mood brightens this series quite a bit and can easily bring a smile to a viewer's eyes. If you're having a bad day, just watch her and that cloud of grayness will brighten. That's probably a weak analogy but her enthusiasm is what unites the group she works so hard to create. In fact, as the unanimous leader of the group, it is up to Honoka to save the school and make a name for themselves with the face of music. Perhaps, I feel she tries too hard though. I mean, in one episode, she particularly puts her own life at risk. It's how hard she tries to bring their ranks together especially when going up against competition. That' s the thing too because when you become a superstar, expect media attention and rivals heading your way. It's a tough, tough world Honoka-chan.  The story of the series remains weak but simple. It's about a group of girls coming together united as a music group to bring media attention. By becoming idols/superstars, they can spread their names and hopefully with what they can achieve will save their school. As simple as it is though, it is VERY easy to guess who will join Muse. It's not even foreshadowing but rather given directly with the opening song and poster. The series also doesn't avoid the typical ""beach episode"" that seemingly becomes one of those relaxing break. Furthermore, the seemingly focus on the idols themselves rather than what they hope to achieve becomes a backstabber in my opinion to the initial premise. Also, it seems that the competition isn't as intense as it originally looked.  Despite this though, I find the series to be a fun and entertaining watch with a cherry atmosphere. It's nice to see the girls tries so hard on a profession that is extremely difficult to make a name for. But what they're doing it for is not only for themselves but to save their beloved school. Now that my friends is what I call good-hearted. The performance themselves are also quite real and done well. In fact, some of the songs played in many of the episodes has that idol-like feeling. With those cute outfits, personalities, and outfits, these girls really do have what it takes.  In terms of visuals, Sunrise does them. And hey, who knew, they actually pulled a nice one out of their hats this time. From the outfits, character designs, and the way the girls dances, the visuals almost feel like they are coming to life at many occasions. I find this to be quite pleasing and interactive to watch as opposed to some CGI movements or forced movements. No, it's natural and the girls are putting on a live show.  The soundtrack, music, and voice acting is perhaps the most prominent feature of this series. After all, music is the main feature and premise of Love Live! The sound director, Yukio Nagasaki puts effort through and it's easy to hear and visualize what it's there. Of course, the performance that I mentioned before are also done beautifully. It looks natural, realistic, and the girls have fun doing it. At some occasions, viewers may wish they were right there with them on the stage. Then opening song, ""Bokura wa Ima no Naka de"" by μ's is performed by the idol group themselves and shows to the audience that they're serious about what they do. The many ED songs brings together a collage of various fun tunes featuring different mood settings. It's beautiful~  Overall, this underrated series is worth some time to invest into. In my opinion, this show is charming and so is Muse. Although its initial episodes were like a chore to watch, it later makes it up with the enthusiasm of the group along with the all cheerful Honoka-chan. It's also fun to watch the girls perform and hope that they succeed especially when they see some results on what they worked so hard for. Yup, they are aiming for success but at the same time having fun while doing it. Well, I hope you have fun while you relax, sit back, and enjoy what Muse do their best:  Entertain you.";Recommended
4;Love Live! School Idol Project;LeikoHaran;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LeikoHaran;9;"I know what you're thinking...And stop it. Recently I've been on a sort of 'binge watch' of anime; but not just any anime, I'm talking about the type with no plot, high school girls doing crazy things, minor fan service, why? Because after a tough day of college the LAST thing I want to do is put on an episode of Serial Experiments Lain, right?  But what if I told you that there exists a moe idol show with so much more to offer than meets the eye? A show with so much heart, passion and hard work put into it, that it has actually bustled its way into my shortlist of favorite anime of all time? Well, such an anime does exist, Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, my review, of 'Love Live: School Idol Project' as well as it's second season.  Story - 8/10: A lot of people like to compare this anime to a little known anime known as K-On! , but in reality, Love Live is so much more. Our main character, Honoka Kousaka, finds out that her beloved high school will be shut down next semester due to poor application rates, and discovers the reason for this is because of a brand new high school called 'ITX' which is home to Japan's biggest school idol group known as 'A-RISE'. Naturally, Honoka sets herself with the goal of creating her own idol group, not to rival the behemoth that is A-RISE, but to simply keep her school relevant for another year. From then on, we journey with Honoka through the trials and tribulations, hard work, and sad moments everyone must go through to finally see their goals come to light. Personally, my only 'problem' with the pacing of K-On! Was just how seamlessly quick and easy a group of moe blob ditzy girls became a famous girl band, no emotion, nothing. On the other hand, even the latter third of Love Live's 3rd episode comes filled with sadness, helping you understand what it is you're getting into, and for that, I am thankful.  Art - 10/10: I just... Okay, it's pretty much standard fare that every idol has to look vastly different to the others in order to check off the anime girl stereotype check list and appeal to as many fetishes as possible - I'm not into that. What I AM into is great ANIMATION, and Love Live does not let me down on that part! You can expect some sort of high production value from a studio like Sunrise but this was just ridiculous. Each and every scene looks beautifully colorful, vibrant, and all round pleasant to look at, but where the animation goes above and beyond is during the performance scenes; masterfully executed scenes of CGI inter-spliced in between animated frames make the choreography look unbelievable, arguably the best and most appropriate use of CG in any anime ever.  Sound - 10/10: As I stated in my previous review, I'm fluent in both English and Japanese; and therefore I can give a more accurate viewpoint on the dub than others who don't blah blah blah. We'll start off with the voice acting. As it stands, there is no English dub, and for a show like this, I don't think there will ever be one, every character is voiced by their real life counterpart which I thought was a nice touch, and so I don't think anyone can criticize the choice of voice acting. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, the music, ah yes, the music! My god. Basically, all you NEED to know is that the singles they used for the anime was perfection, and each song kicks major ass, a song is rarely ever repeated in the same season which means you get fresh off the batch music nearly all the time.  Character - 10/10: NICO NICO NII~ The series has a mere 26 episodes to fully develop and extract emotion from 9 whole main characters, which averages out at less than 3 episodes per character, but you know what? Even though characters like Hanayo and Rin don't even get that many episodes, their stories are all beautifully executed, some even managing to force a tear from me. The one character that I felt wasn't developed as well as I would have liked was that of my favorite girl in anime, Nico Yazawa. You see, you see small flashbacks of how tough her life has been, such as a brief 5 second time skip of all of her club members leaving her to be alone for the entirety of her high school life, and I'm sure some of us here know how tough THAT is. I wish some things were better explained, but what we did get was beautiful, and managing to do what they did with such a large cast was a masterstroke.  Overall - 9/10: This show caught me off guard, I wasn't expecting to got what I got at all, a show with so much more than it's genre will let off, a show that leaves pretty much every other music-based anime in the dust. What Love Live accomplishes is a heart-warming story of friendship, hard work, failure, perseverance and most importantly, passion. The characters aren't just cardboard cut-outs, however some of the things they do and say can be somewhat cheesy. This show is not perfection, however. As I mentioned, the story is very basic, and while it does expand upon it's initial goal, I still feel like there is more to come, and more that could have been done, in a story with 9 girls who successfully played with my emotions. Watch it. Love it. Never regret it.";Recommended
5;Love Live! School Idol Project;Nivo3041;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nivo3041;10;"I'm a big fan of the Love Live franchise, so I'm sorry if I look like a mired person or with bad judgment, but the truth is that I like all seasons of Love Live (including Sunshine and the movie). But that does not stop me from wanting to give my opinion about this anime.  History: Love Live is an anime that does not have a deep, ingenious or innovative story. This does not make this point weak or anything like that, the series creates a simple story for the characters to ""develop"" the way they see fit. The story is developed based on training and training until you can perfect a choreography. The story is not more than that, a day by day of 9 girls who give their best effort to achieve a goal, but it is more than that, the events that arise in history make it good in my opinion.  There are moments like the first concert they do that showed me how serious the girls were, the story does not want them to be the best ones singing automatically or because they are school idols stand out in a first concert, that's why the first concert was a total disaster (although Star Dash is one of the favortias songs of the fans), because it has to be, a group of idols is not done from one day to the next, that would be totally illogical. Although the time spent in choreography, costumes and calling people for the concert was totally useless they did not give up, they had a credible goal and an ""answer"" to their problem also credible, it was admiracion and hard work, it has not but, at no time I find it strange that being school idols was something stupid or irrational, the world that presents Love Live makes it totally clear that school idols of that age are very normal and attract public, being a school idol is simply something that would assure (for Honoka) attract public, under that point of vsita it sounds very credible that she has been serious about being a school idol and convince her friends to do it, because that way the chances of saving the school increase significantly and, something that I consider important even in real life, they could turn their responsibilities into something special and very comfortable for them. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters: The characters (along with the music) is what gives Love Live the essence, since the main objective of Love Live was always to produce good music and create very ""beautiful and tender"" characters to make the aesthetics of music have cohesion and so make both components are in a way that the public likes and can make any of the 9 girls in the group are liked by someone. And the 9 girls together form the group u's  The Love Live characters share the same goal or main objectives as the others, this is something that is obvious taking into account that all live in the same school and that same school will close.  Honoka Kousaka: she is a character who has the character of a boss, not because of being bossy or being a kind of drastic boss, she is simply determined and cheerful, which I like, is like what I said before; she transforms her responsibility into a way to get closer to her friends and a way to have fun. Honoka is the typical person who is always happy and knows how to make her group happy, and there is the grace of the characters, to take types of people to make a group of idols more diverse and with different and at the same time similar personalities. Honoka works very well as head of the group, I do not have much more to say about her; She is friendly, kind, often funny and very determined to fulfill her goals (although in a certain part of the Honoka series she became very depressed and left the group for a while). Simply a character with good function of boss and who manages to become more responsible in the second season to be president of the student council, so she learned to tormase more seriously their responsibilities.  Umi Sonoda: is the typical girl who is good at sports and academically, Umi is the childhood friend of Honoka and Kotori, so their closeness with both characters is very present in the series, Umi despite being another type of common girl in animes does not take away the merit, this is due to his participation in the group and his way of helping the group. Umi is a very shy girl who dislikes wearing mini skirts for concerts, but due to the insistence of her best friends she decides to put on the clothes she thought was shameful, Umi demonstrates in the first instance to be a good friend and shows it With all the other girls that join the group, Umi is a character that is distinguished from the other characters because of how indecent finds things like kisses or that indole, this causes pretty funny moments in the series (like when they are watching a novel), Umi has a very strong personality and fulfills his goal of trying to be different from the other characters (although it looks like Maki, they turn out to be very different), it shows the love that has Honoka and Kotori for be childhood friends,and Umi likes to practice archery.   Kotori Minami: she is in charge of the creation of the costumes for all the concerts, so it can be said that she is one of the most important in the series. Kotori shows (just like Umi) the affection she has for Honoka, I emphasize this because it is very important, it would not make sense if they are friends from childhood and they do not show a credible friendship for what they have been together, their friendship It has to be made credible, this is achieved through their friendly dialogues and the memories they have of their childhood (especially the one that show a time when they climb a tree and Kotori and Umi scares them), I consider the friendships of these 3 girls very well achieved, many people may say that cliche, but that is irrelevant, taking into account that the story tells the day to day of a group of idols and adding the fact that they are normal people is a cliche well implemented, is that they simply showed their relationship in a simple way as people in their day to day, the moment that Kotori has to go proves it even more, Honoka gives all their effort to convince Kotori to stay in Japan , And it is Kotori has other motivations besides saving the school, she wants to be a designer, that would give her reasons to join the group of idols. Kotori is the personage of the series that demonstrates to have more motivations in addition to saving the school and it is possible to appreciate his great friendship with Umi and (especially) with Honoka. despite that she does not have a personality ""as"" marked as the other girls, Kotori is more responsible and somewhat more shy than the others (she is almost as responsible as Umi), but what differentiates her from the others are her goals and things what she does (make the wardrobe, want to be a professional designer and be a kind of ""maid"" in a local).  Rin Hoshizora: Rin is a first year at the Otonokizaka academy, it is one of the smallest members of the group, it is often childish (but without falling into stupidity imensa). Rin is quite extravaganten his mania to finish his sentences with ""nya"" also comes to be a type of girl known in Japan (come on, the typical ""Neko girls""), so they did the right thing by making Rin the most childish member and the smallest of the group, because although it is unnatural to listen to someone finish the sentences with nya, the series wants this to go more unnoticed and not feel forced, this because the series does not give emphasis to its strange mania to say nya, so if someone came to dislike it would be very easy to ignore. Rin is also one of the members of the most sensitive group (only surpassed by Hanayo) and that is noticeable since she was little, because she was annoyed to look like a man, which caused a constant denial when talking about her beauty, even saying that She was not pretty enough to be able to enter a group of idols, it's not a traumatic past or anything like that, it just caused her great insecurity, the bad thing is that it may seem quite exaggerated. Rin manages a good relationship with almost everything (if not all) the group, this is because she always tries to have fun and it feels good to have that support in the group, it is as if she often raised spirits (despite the fact that she often gets sad), but she proves to be mature when she has to be mature (especially when she had to be the center in a song).In spite of everything, it takes time for Rin to find a real reason to belong to the group, since she joined the group only because Hanayo did it.  Hanayo Koizumi: she is the most timid member, that is the basis of her main charm, we must give special emphasis on her shyness, because that is what stands out the most. Hanayo has several good relationships with Maki and Rin (those of her school year), Hanayo had a great affection for school idols, even she was one of the few that came face to face in the first concert of the u's (since all the others were hidden). Hanayo is a friend of Rin since they are small, that is why they are always together and that several times they meet together, often both find themselves progressing to be better school idols, but that is not why Hanayo does not have good relations with the others members, Maki is someone who can hit Hanayo a lot in terms of personality, but that does not distance them or anything like that, both, being first year, they get along very well, it is natural that in Love Live the members that belong to the same year get along, because they have the same class in common, but outside the school, Hanayo still gets along well with Rin and Maki, Hanayo being shy does not speak much, but with Maki and Rin speaks a lot, that She already says a lot about her relationship as friends. After a while, when Hanayo gets used to doing concerts, she changes her attitude and does not feel ashamed to sing and dance in front of many people, on the contrary, seeing things from her in stores is joyful and emotional, so in the story could leave his shyness aside  Maki Nishikino: she is very mature, has different hobbies than other members since she knows how to play the piano and is often busy as a resource to make songs, Maki is intelligent, but despite that she believes in things that are childish at her age (Maki believes in Santa), but that does not make her silly, obviously. Maki is the daughter of a millionaire father, although this does not have much relevance in the series it has to be said that at a certain moment the u's go to the summer house of Maki's parents to spend some time (it must be said that in that part they occur many fun moments). Maki also has a great relationship with (besides her school year) Nico, Maki often has funny conversations with Nico because she can turn out to be very crazy, is how Rin, despite that Maki never says he dislikes being with Nico and Len at certain times are treated very well as friends, Maki manages good control of their friendships. a very remarkable attitude of Maki is that it seems ""tsundere"" and in a moment even Nozomi tells him a comment of that type to laugh at her for a while. This attitude causes that Maki often reacts of graceful form or that says phrase that, at least the fans, consider memorable  Eli Ayase: is the president of the student council and one of her first actions in the series is to ban the group that Honoka was planning to do, and at the beginning Eli demonstrates an absolute denial of the formation of the idols club, but through the story advances and due to the determination shown by Honoka, Eli decides to help the group so that they can dance well, Eli changes her mind in a way that is well constructed, she simply decided to help the last hope of her high school (since she was the president then logically it was the most worried). Eli has a very good relationship of friendship with Nozomi, the viscepresident of the student council, Eli knows Nozomi since they are small and in short, it happens the same as with the other members, when they know each other since childhood their friendship is very well achieved and demonstrates in a very credible way, especially by the way they help at certain times. Eli also has a more firm and responsible personality, she is not strict (the strict one of the group is Umi), but she often shows her great concern for the group, even though at the beginning she wanted to prohibit the club of idols  Nozomi Tojo: is undoubtedly the wisest and smartest member of a group, even before joining the group of idols she helped giving advice, as I said, Nozomi has a close relationship of friendship with Eli since they are small, but all members of u's have a lot of respect for Nozomi, that's not why they have a more formal relationship, but they do estimate it a lot (in a chapter Maki finds out about Nozomi's past and feels that she can get along better with her). Nozomi also has a very strong personality, as already mentioned is wise, but besides that she likes to joke with the members of the group, thus playing a good role of ""counselor"" and how a very good friend to have fun. Nozomi, has a past that is not the big thing or something deep, but it serves to better understand the reason that gets along so well with Eli, Love Live in general stands out for the relationships formed by the characters and how they are shown Throughout the series, with Nozomi they chose to use another flashback to demonstrate the beginning of their relationship. Nozomi also has the habit of grabbing other people's chest, it's weird, but when he used that it gave me grace  Nico Yazawa: Nico is the member of u that most admired by the school idols has, at first part hating the group of idols saying they are mediocre, but then he has to give the club to Honoka, Nico felt the same as Eli, he disliked the fact that there was an idol club, but for totally different reasons. Nico had previously formed a group of idols that had come far and Nico was emotionally excited by the fact that his dream was becoming reality, but the other members left, because of that she denies the fact that there is another group of school idols. Nico has a more than justifiable motivation to join the group of idols, she admires the idols in the same way that Hanayo does, that is precisely why Nico and Hanayo become good friends, Nico is the most open member to express herself , she does not feel ashamed when it comes to being idols and that is noticeable when she makes her ""Nico Nico Nii"" to show that she ""knows"" to be an idol. Nico in general is more similar to Rin, both are very crazy and funny, but Nico takes his idol job very seriously.  Being Love Live a series that focuses a lot on the charm of the characters is normal to try to make them more distanced in terms of design is concerned (and if it does not do so by personality). This is an excellent factor taken by the series, since, regardless of whether his personality is distinctive or not of the character, his design will make him feel more detached and special. In Love Live the designs of the 9 girls is done in a very good way, they did not try to make the designs very strange, they put an exact amount of intonation to the colors to make the hair and the eyes of a color neither realistic nor unreal. It is also worth mentioning that the characters are also distinguished by the excellent work of the dubbing actors (or seiyuus) that make the voice feel different from the other members (which was to be considered taking into account the budget behind it). ). In my opinion as far as designs are concerned, Love Live did it very well, knew how to create a nice design for the view and knew how to take advantage of the lyrics or ""aesthetics"" of their songs to make characters that in my opinion are very charismatic and distanced from others, very good characters. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Rhythm and events of the story: Leaving aside that which I just told about the ed u's members, it is also worth mentioning how to develop the story based on them, they constantly have scenes that demonstrate their passion for what they do and their bonds of friendship achieved with time together. Such ephemeral scenes as the flash-backs that have until more transcendental moments like when the u's present their first concert, all those parts are important for the plot, not only because they cause a change in the way of training or to see the work of being idol, but also because you can get to emphasize more with all the members of the group, that's why they have so many different hobbies and they get to know each other throughout the series. With everything said then you can see a very good convinacion or ""synergy"" on the part of the members demonstrating that although the work of idol is difficult, they continue to strive and continue to advance naturally, they simply combine with each other, all are different, but try to fit for the same goal, become school idols  Events happen at a good speed for what is normally offered by a series that presents the day to day of a group of idols. The series is well accompanied by moments where the u's make concerts, making the soundtrack good and the series is not monotonous, there will always be a song to raise the mood at certain times. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ animation and soundtrack: How I mentioned the soundtrack is very good in the series due to how the series makes the u's have a workout and then a dance, try to make the different songs, the soundtrack of Love Live is good because that's what the series is based on, music. The animation is in CGI due to the difficulty to animate dance movements, but the scenarios in which the dances take place, the same dances that make tune with the music make it something remarkable, it is not at all an easy job to animate dances and final does not end badly. Animation is well achieved for how complex it is. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Enjoyment: I enjoyed the series very much, it calms me a lot listening to the songs of the u's are songs presented in the anime or not, hopefully someone feels the same as I feel with this series, I do not want to sound dramatic, but it generates mixed feelings. Undoubtedly enjoy them, you will especially like if you disriutas the music and you like the characters that go more to the ""cute and tender"" than anything else, but for me no doubt Love Live fulfilled its goal";Recommended
6;Love Live! School Idol Project;suikashoujo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/suikashoujo;10;"I have to admit that when I first started watching this show, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I decided to give it a try because I had recently gotten hooked on the mobile app, but I figured that it would be little more than a feelgood story about some friends getting together and singing some catchy songs. Nothing groundbreaking, and definitely nothing too serious. Which is probably why I was so impressed by what it ended up being.  Story: 10/10  What I appreciated the most about Love Live was that it didn't try to pretend that the girls would be able to get up right away and become the top school idols in the nation. Rather than using the typical ""Character gets by on sheer luck and natural talent"" plotline, it's made entirely obvious that μ's is starting from the very bottom- The group isn't even fully formed until more than halfway through the series. The initial founding trio is shown multiple times at the beginning of the show running up and down stairs and stretching, just so that they can be in shape enough to perform. The road they take to reach their goals is a long one filled with physical, mental, and emotional hardships, and even if it's obvious to most viewers that everything will ultimately turn out well for them, it's still tear-jerking to watch them in their darker moments- and even more satisfying to watch as they gain their first fans, put on their first live performance, and slowly but steadily watching them grow not just as performers, but as a team.  Art: 10/10  The art style in this anime fits the overall tone perfectly- There are a LOT of bright colors, and the girls' eyes are almost constantly sparkling. The animation is generally pretty beautiful to look at. The normal, everyday scenes are above average, but nothing overly special. But whenever there is a performance by μ's (this includes the OP theme), the show upgrades its animation to a more 3D-type style in order to more fluidly portray the dancing and expressions. Those bits are absolutely stunning, even if they take a bit of getting used to.  Sound: 9/10  Of course, as an anime centered around a (school) idol group, there are bound to be some catchy songs, and Love Live doesn't disappoint on that front. Of course there's the bright OP song ""Bokura wa Ima no Naka de"" and the upbeat ED ""Kitto Seishun ga Kikoeru,"" but each episode usually has at least one insert song that μ's performs as part of the story. They're all about the same in terms of quality, which is to say that they're all really good. I'm not a big enough fan of the style to listen to them on a regular basis outside of watching the show, but none of them are annoying to listen to, and they're all fitting for the mood of the show- that is to say, incredibly optimistic and, for the most part, upbeat.  Character: 8/10  For the most part, I absolutely loved the characters in Love Live. I have a soft spot for first-year member Hanayo, the soft-spoken girl who is extremely shy until she starts talking about her incredible, lifelong passion for idols (her best friend, the ever-energetic first-year Rin- another favorite of mine- comments that she's an entirely different person when someone brings up idols). The other first-year, Maki, was okay, but she never stood out to me as much more than a standard tsundere. The second year trio- arguably the main characters, seeing as they were the initial founders of μ's- were generally pretty likable as well. Honoka was cheerful through the majority of the series (barring one of the more dramatic episodes toward the end), Umi started off a bit frigid but quickly warmed up into one of the more well-rounded characters, and Kotori was usually pretty happy, but didn't play a very critical role until the end. As for the third years, well... they were probably some of my least favorite characters. Nico was a bit annoying (basically a second tsundere, albeit a much LOUDER tsundere than Maki), Nozomi was just sort of bland, although she did grow on me, and Eri, the student council president who is initially opposed to the very existence of μ's, was undoubtedly my least favorite character in the series. Even after she joined the group and mellowed out a bit (This isn't a spoiler, as the OP shows all nine girls together from the very first episode), I just couldn't find it in me to like her.  Basically, I don't think any of the characters are particularly strong on their own. But I still gave them an 8/10, because I loved the way that they all complemented each other, and they all showed at least a little bit of growth at the end of the series.  Enjoyment: 10/10  Based on the scores I gave this anime, I think it should be fairly obvious that I enjoyed it. The sad scenes are only sad for long enough to make the mood upswing that much more satisfying, and the happy scenes are strong because after a while, it's impossible NOT to feel something for the hardworking characters. It's an emotional roller coaster, and it's so much more satisfying than it seems like it's going to be.  Overall: 10/10  Like I said at the beginning, I got a whole lot more out of this anime than I ever expected. I would recommend giving it a watch, even if it doesn't look all that special or interesting at first glance- before I watched Love Live, I had absolutely no interest in idol-themed anime. The music bored me, and I expected it to be yet another ""cute girls doing cute things"" slice-of-life show. But it's SO much more than that, and I've found a new favorite anime to add to my list.";Recommended
7;Love Live! School Idol Project;xDiablo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xDiablo;7;This show is a sad guilty pleasure of mine. I shouldn't like this, but I did.  It shows what hard work can really achieve. Especially with so much competition out there. It can really motivates you to be successful. With all that aside the show is very shallow and simple.  Cute girls dancing and singing to save their beloved school.  Story: Based around nine girls working to become idols and save their school. The initial story is okay, but nothing ever goes past that. The plot is weak and suffers from this, but what can you expect from a 13 episode series. The story can only be comparable when you take a slice-of-life. Each episode itself has it's own story. Don't expect much from it. I simply watched it for fun, nothing more or less.  Put aside potential flaws it gave a calming and easygoing atmosphere. This made the show feel comfortable. Like laying in your bed at night, nothing really changes, but it doesn't ever feel uncertain. Sorry fans of this show but I'm going to give the story a 6.  Art: It wasn't bad at all. I didn't even know sunrise could make this high of quality. All aspects of the girls stage, and clothing were unique and changed often. This kept me waiting to see the next outfit. Watching in HD i could tell some of the drawings during performances almost looked 3d. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. At times it got weird to watch and i almost wished it would just stay 2d. It was more likely done because of budget. Much better than other shows *cough cough* . Art is an 8.  Sound: I can't say much since i watched it in subbed and not many emotions were expressed through the characters. Other than that as far I could tell they fit the characters, nothing oddball my ears could hear. Who could forget about the music. Most of the songs picked were very catchy and often found myself bobbing my head. This deserves an 8.  Character: This is where the show failed to deliver on. For the first couple of episodes I didn't even know Kitori's mom was the principle. By this time almost the whole group had been already established. when looking back at it most of the group was very 2 dimensional. Backgrounds never spoken, wondering even if some of the girls said a word after wanting to join Muse. Although the ones that were shown some light had different personalities. All these differences make them very lovable. You could basically read all these characters, like the back of your hand. This was very traumatizing to characters, and made it almost boring. What could be more wrong? The fact that not once did they develop really in much of a way. -The over dramatic sad scene at the end didn't prove anything. Character, gets a 5.  Enjoyment: Like i said i really enjoyed this. Probably much more than I should have. Just the cuteness of everything kept me going. What does that say about me? I am a sucker for cute girls dancing in cute costumes. Hell Yeah! A 7 for enjoyment.  Overall: Don't set goals high, at best don't set any. With that type of thinking you might like it. Their are many shows of this variety, that said the originality is near zero. I don't recommend this if you look for deep plot inducing anime. I am forewarning you that their is not one guy in this. The rest is your choice at this point, is it worth watching or not? I would respond with yes. My hormones kept me going. I conclude my official first review with a 7.;Recommended
8;Love Live! School Idol Project;ILikeReviewing;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ILikeReviewing;10;"This is my first review, so please bear with me.  Story: 9/10 The story is easy to understand. School closing down due to a lack of applicants, and three girls decide to form a school idol group to gain popularity. They name this idol group ""μ's"" and eventually end up with nine members in total. I had no problems with pacing of the story - it wasn't too slow or fast - and found each episode very interesting, making me want to watch more.  Art: 8/10 The art is, in a word, flawless. The characters, although looking very different from one another, are all cute. In fact, I was once asked ""Who do you think is the prettiest member of μ's?"". I couldn't choose. They were all beautiful in their own special ways. The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the CG used when songs were performed, but I got used to it later on.  Sound: 9/10 Because this is an idol anime, there'll have to be lots of music, right? The songs in this anime were amazing, especially the opening, ""Bokura wa Ima no Naka de"". Normally, I would skip openings, but I didn't skip this one. Not once. The other songs were amazing too, my personal favourite being ""START: DASH"". The songs are catchy and upbeat; it's next to impossible to dislike them.  Character: 9/10 There are nine members of μ's. Each of them had their own personality - and they were all lovable personalities.  Honoka Kousaka: The protagonist. The one who decided to start μ's. An optimistic person who isn't scared to take risks, and her determination is what makes her lovable. Seriously, though. When she was happy, I was happy. When she was upset, I was upset. She made a perfect main character.  Eli Ayase: The Student Council president who seems a little antagonistic at first, but as you watch more, you find out that she has her own reasons for seeming like this. She, at first, was against Honoka's idea of creating an idol group, but later on became the 8th member of μ's.  Kotori Minami: Honoka and Umi's childhood friend. She is very caring, and has a hard time expressing her feelings because she is thinking about others as well. It took me a while to like her, because I found her weak at first, but I started liking her more after realising how kind she is, because she takes other people's feelings into consideration.  Umi Sonoda: Honoka and Kotori's childhood friend and μ's lyricist. A shy girl who is always thinking logically. She is extremely modest, and isn't a fan of short skirts, but gets used to them later on. She also has a strong will. She is my personal favourite because I adore both her shyness and her strong will.  Rin Hoshizora: An energetic tomboy who is a little self-conscious when it comes to wearing skirts, as she was made fun of for wearing them as a child. Rin is, in a word, adorable. Like Honoka, she is always looking at the bright side of things. She can be a little idiotic at times, but she is still lovable. How can anyone hate her?  Maki Nishikino: A tsundere who is μ's composer. I normally dislike tsunderes, but not Maki. Maki is a little stubborn, but also finds it hard to admit her true feelings. She's talented at playing the piano, and is also described as being beautiful. I am someone who usually hates tsunderes, but Maki was different to all the other tsunderes I've ever seen in anime.  Nozomi Toujou: Nozomi is the Student Council Vice-President and Eli's best friend, although her personality is very different to Eli's. She helped μ's, even when she wasn't a member of the group. She's kind and wise, which is one of the reasons why I love her as a character.  Hanayo Koizumi: Rin's childhood friend who had a passion for idols for a long time. However, being very shy and reserved, it took her a while to gather up the courage to join the group. Hanayo is one of the cutest members of μ's in my opinion. Her two personalities - her shy one and her ""ohmygodIloveidolssomuch"" one - are both very lovable.  Nico Yazawa: Like Hanayo, Nico has a passion for idols. She is also a bit stubborn like Maki, but she is also very caring. I honestly don't see how this character can be disliked. She is definitely one of my favourites.  Enjoyment: 10/10 I enjoyed this anime a lot. The characters were all unique and special, the art was beautiful, and the songs and story were just fabulous.  Overall: 10/10 I can easily say that this is one of the best anime I have ever watched. Seriously, the worst thing about the anime was probably the CG - and they weren't even that bad! This anime is a must watch.";Recommended

After see how popular school idols are, decides to create a idol group called μ's (Muse) with her friends to attract new students and save the school. So that the plot of Love Live, as i normal don't write spoilers, all i can say that the writing and flow of the story is very well done as every episode is interesting and funny. Now on the characters, there is nine girls that make up the idol group μ, so i only going to be brief about them.

She is μ's wardrobe supervisor with Kotori. That is all nine characters out of the way, next is presentation. Love Live! is a very colorful and brimming with life. The art style is well designed with attention to detail with it's character design. The animation is beautiful created especially the song scenes which as been designed in a different animation style to make it look more better. the character animations and facial expressions are well made and look very believable. The voice acting is great and singing is well done as seems that they had a lot of work put into them and it shows wonderfully. The music is beautifully created and some are very catchy. The topics used in the anime are well as they fit the story and don't seem out of place. Lastly, my opinion. Love Live! is one of those animes that can bring a smile to my face. i love how Sunrise has created a wonderful story what captures your attention and makes you fall in love with the characters with me loving Nozomi because how funny she is and of course her hair. The songs really makes this anime, one of my favorites to watch and i really enjoy. The animation itself shows me how much hard work has been put into this and i like to say it probably one the best looking animes i ever seen. Now for the Verdict. Love Live! is a wonderful created animes that shows you that you don't need over the top story to make a great story. The art design is beautiful created and the songs will make you fall in love with it as they have been created with a lot of care. Love Live! is one anime i can recommend anyone to watch as it can be enjoyed by all and i say one of the best animes out there.;Recommended
10;Love Live! School Idol Project;Waldy565;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Waldy565;10;Now, people are gonna think I'm biased, and yes, all reviews are biased, so... I'll try to be fair as possible, but I'll start off with a quite possibly outlandish statement - this is my favourite anime. If you check my list, you may be surprised this is my favourite - but then again, there are a few I'm watching and a few on-hold... I'll get back to them, ANYWAYS.. STORY - Not the best, not the worst. *MINOR SPOILERS* The story revolves mainly around three girls, 2nd years in high school, who want to save there school from closing, as people just aren't applying. Hakone, the main protagonist, loves idols, and sees idols are attracting students to other schools. So she, along with her cute friends, the energetic Kotori and shy Umi, after a bit of convincing on Umi's side, make an idol group. They find out from the school council that there is all ready an idol club, and so convince the only remaining member of the club, Yazawa, to let them join. It's safe to say all goes well, but that's the general gist, I'll leave the non-viewers to experience. ART - I love the art. It's clean and sharp, and very bright and colourful. Some people don't like CGI, but you can't argue with the picture it creates. It's all very beautiful. SOUND - The sound is outstanding. I mean, it's a musical anime anyway, with it being about idol's and everything, but just listen to the intro theme. That is literally on my phone for the sole reason of being my alarm! And the ending theme! And all the songs in between! CHARACTER - The characters in this are very personal to me. They are introduced at a reasonable pace, with the 3 main characters being the only 3 of the club for about half the anime, so you get used to them, and the others being recruited for various reasons (previous acting, infuated by idols looks etc). But the 3 main characters remind me, a male, of me and my 3 childhood friends. Sure, that makes 4, but it's still very, very personal, and anyone who is in the same boat as me will understand! OVERALL/ENJOYMENT - As I stated at the beggining, this is totally my favourite anime, and it comes down to two things: The personal characters and the awesome music. I won't go on any long, but will end with my score, I can't give it anything more than a 10/10.;Recommended
11;Love Live! School Idol Project;iSuckAtWriting;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iSuckAtWriting;9;"My time with Love Live! is much like the few members of its nine strong cast who were reluctant about being school idols. I wonder how a pushy, narrow sighted girl managed to rope me into this crazy gig, and then I wonder if this idiot turned friend will drag me to another adventure that was more fun than I ever thought possible. The nine strong cast is μ's (pronounced ‘Muse’), named for the Nine Goddesses of Music. Gods don’t die, and neither can my love for their antics, their struggles, and their story.  But Umi Sonoda would suggest I explain everything before acting sentimental, and I wouldn’t expect less from little miss ‘modesty and logic will hopefully win the day (or at least try to guide it).’ She’s the kind of person who tries to keep others on track, sometimes a bit too much when her friends would rather relax at the beach. Thankfully, her sense of discipline is never misguided, as she’ll often pick up her friends after they fall from a mistake. She doesn’t move past being the voice of reason, but she is a major reason μ's goes far.  μ's itself is lead by Honoka Kousaka, whose motive for being a school idol is as crazy as it sounds. Her school is close to closing down due to the lack of new students, and the juniors before her will be the last new students the school accepts. After a chance glimpse at how a concert from a school idol group has brought attention to their school, she has the idea of being a school idol to hopefully attract new students to her school. Enough students to the point where her school won’t close down. Surely such an impulsive idea won’t be where the story takes off from, right?  Well, the story starts there but it doesn’t take off until three episodes into the first season. Reality hits Honoka as her first concert fails, and from that point on the story really begins. Much of season one is about our lively lyrical leader bringing other students to her cause. Despite this, the story doesn’t get serious but doesn’t lack for purpose either. One of the main strengths of Love Live! is an unbridled sense of fun that never loses sight of its story. There’s enough stage practice to make the lead up into every concert believable, but even the antics outside that are always meaningful.  From the change into crazy costumes to reinvent their image for fear of growing stale, to the beach episode that brings Maki Nishikino out of her shell in more ways than one, to the odd responsibility shared by Honoka, Umi, and Kotori Minami in season two, every moment is more than its humor. Despite the fun, there are still times when the story gets serious, and it’s almost never unfounded as even things mentioned in passing come to show their importance later on.  It especially shows with Kotori, whose story deals with the issue of what it means to contribute to a team through humorous bouts of ‘writer’s block.’ Kotori herself hasn’t a single aggressive bone in her body, but that doesn’t mean a sweet and cheerful persona is all she is. She has her doubts and worries, and her reticence at one point truly tests the friendship between herself, Umi, and Honoka. Her story implies the question of what it means to chase a dream, and whether the chase can make someone lose sight of what’s around them.  And for third year student Nico Yazawa, being a part of μ's is another chance to chase her dream. There’s a good, if prideful, reason she wants to become a school idol, and her over the top ‘cute’ persona shows that dedication. In truth, she’s very smug and cynical, but not without good reason. In every jaded person is an optimist waiting to let loose, and Nico does quite enjoy herself as the series goes on, however smug she still acts. Her vast array of idol stuff like concert DVDs also shows her dedication to the art, even before going into her backstory. Much to the pleasure of first year student Hanayo Koizumi.  Hanayo is the old case of how passion can call out an entirely different side to someone. At a glance, she’s timid, and her joining μ's is partly thanks to a small push from her friend Rin Hoshizora and classmate Maki. But from that point on, she’s often energetic, especially in the presence of idols and being an idol fan herself, and of course during μ's concerts. There’s a kernel of truth to how her interests and hobbies suddenly bring out such an involved side to her, but it isn’t over the top to the point of unbelievable.  Then again, the only unbelievable—and weak link by extension—part of the story is Rin. She’s mostly ‘just there’ in season one, while season two messily develops her with an issue that’s never brought up or hinted at save for early in season one. Her time in the spotlight involves being the temporary leader of μ's for…some reason, and wearing an outfit that’s not her style just because. Though still a quite likable tomboy with a penchant for cat speak, the brief change to that other side of her is largely unfounded to the point where likability is all she has going for her.  Compare this to Maki, who doesn’t lack for believability and likability. Despite being as young as Hanayo and Rin, she carries herself with a senior like demeanor to speak level even with third years Eli Ayase and Nozomi Tojo. At the same time, her true self often shows whether she’s flustered or just being a little more open around Nico and Nozomi, and everyone else. And yet, her want to hide her feelings is less about any one of her friends and more about being truly reticent despite her apparent sharpness. Maki is well developed, and not just for her body as Nozomi learns firsthand(s).  For the curious, the big chested Nozomi has a small running joke throughout the series where she gropes the girls of μ's. Nozomi herself is often in the background, but due to her role and reason for being in μ's, it makes sense. Her role is someone who watches over these girls (especially Eli), her reason more than just wanting to watch over them as she befriends them. Mischievous and motherly, Nozomi looks after μ's as if it was her own creation, and the creation of her own person isn’t lacking despite (or maybe even because of?) her lack of screentime.  Of course, her friend Eli isn’t open to μ's being a thing at all. Not at first. Her doubt towards them is rooted in her past success, and doesn’t think they’ll do anything for the school’s future. She has an interesting parallel with Honoka for much of season one, in that despite thinking differently about school idols, they both want to save the school. As student council president, though, Eli works behind the scenes as μ's grows in numbers, ever tempted to let it go and just have fun with them. Her struggle between her duty and desire, despite her pedigree, makes her nothing short of compelling.  But even as Eli becomes a kind of second leader in season two, it’s still Honoka at the heart of μ's. Honoka herself is emotion personified, the sheer range of her facial expressions communicating what dialog can’t. A melancholic gaze, a smile that triumphs over her tears, a crossed scowl, an indifferent but thoughtful gaze, an infectiously energetic smile, and many more faces all serve to perfectly round out her persona. That doesn’t mean she’s without her faults, as she can be focused to the point of losing sight of what’s around her, something that comes up toward the end of season one and the start of season two.  It’s during the second season that Honoka tries to stay aware of what’s around her, partly due to a personal incident in season one, partly from an extra duty as student council president in season two. Yeah. I don’t know how she became student council president either. The best guess among viewers is, after the school was saved, nobody was better fit to be student council president than the school’s savior. Yeah. I don’t know how rallying school idols translates to running a kind of government either.  Thankfully, Honoka eventually, if reluctantly, grows into the role of student council president, and never misses a step as part of μ's as they look to compete at the Love Live! event. During season one, they learned about the Love Live! being a chance for school idols to really show off what they can do. Unfortunately, they had to drop out at the last minute, but they got enough attention anyway to the point where the school was saved. So why would μ's still want to compete at the next Love Live! event?  To which I answer: why must there be a deeper reason to want to do something? Does it matter if passion starts from duty? If they’ve made it this far, why let that effort go to waste? With the introduction of its nine strong cast being largely finished in season one, season two changes the focus from ‘Honoka and the rest of μ's’ to ‘here is μ's as a group of equals.’ Not just Honoka, but all of μ's wants to compete in and win the Love Live! event. Their time in the spotlight much more even, each girl no less passionate than the next. But with their sights set on Love Live!, rival school idol group A-Rise has their sights set on them.  In many ways, A-Rise is the antithesis to μ's. The latter starts as a group of three with Honoka, Umi, and Kotori, and blossoms into nine great performers, while the former is only the trio of Tsubasa Kira, Erena Todo, and Anju Yuki. For how alike these six look respectively, they still take on their own identities, μ's donning frills and youthful vigor while A-Rise sports sleek smooth sensuality in their wardrobe and dance moves. In a refreshing change of pace, though, A-Rise isn’t a conniving group trying to sabotage the main cast. They simply want to win the Love Live!, and truly look forward to facing μ's. There’s mutual respect between both groups.  But as μ's gets closer to the big event, the story becomes less about the actual competition and more about the looming finale they can’t avoid. This plays perfectly into why Nozomi is part of μ's, as the story of nine comes full circle before she, Eli, and Nico are to graduate after the Love Live! event. The thought weighs on their minds, but the show must go on and they rightfully cherish every moment together. Every misadventure, every squabble, every concert teaches them to accept the bitter with the sweet.  Unfortunately, the concerts during season one are mostly nothing sweet to look at. It often looks like a smile plastered on a dancing doll. Thankfully, season two greatly improves the animation during these scenes, blending the 2D and 3D work into a cohesive showcase. The coloring and design makes for vivid variation. Even the darker colors of A-Rise shine brightly, and the thematic unity across costumes still have subtle differences to reflect each person, such as Anju being A-Rise’s only wearer of frills, or Umi’s outfit in one concert rocking shorts instead of a skirt.  So the show looks great, but it also knows HOW to look great. The series knows its girls are the cover attraction to itself, but thankfully it doesn’t overplay its hand. It forgoes sexualizing its cast for an emotional connection through personality and appearance. It’s flattery that induces a star struck state, without objectifying the cast in any negative fashion. Even the swimsuit episode is fairly harmless, while Nozomi’s groping antics miraculously avoid falling into the suggestive moans that are prone to happen in other shows. Early concert scenes aside, I see no reason to call the visuals nothing short of excellent.  Now, no amount of outstanding outfits or lovely lighting will do anything without music. And indeed, Love Live!’s soundtrack is far and away its strongest aesthetic element. There’s music for every occasion, from the quick tempo of a chase scene, to an over the top piece for a joke, to the slow piano keys for matching melancholy, and even the revitalizing recap music at the start of each of episode, all compliment the mood to great effect. And the few moments where music is absent are well chosen, and stand out that much more for it.  But while the instrumentals are good, the real reason Love Live! is a musical treat are the actual songs, which it never lacks. ‘Private Wars’ and ‘Shocking Party’ play hard, fast, and clean, capturing the aura of coolness about A-Rise. ‘Advance Tomorrow’ reflects the spirit of the show, being loud and fun but starting from genuinely heartfelt intentions through a soprano style voice. And of course, the two opening numbers, ‘We’re All In This Moment’ and ‘That Is Our Miracle’ carry lyrical significance with what happens in the story. This isn’t music that’s just a joy to listen to, but pieces that say something more when listening closely.  One of the two songs this is most exemplified in is ‘Start;Dash.’ Unlike much of μ's other songs, it starts with an almost melancholic feeling, starts singing in a defiant fashion, and ends in a manner that says ‘we’re down, but not out.’ It’s the piece Honoka, Umi, and Kotori sing at their first concert, and the piece μ's sings at the end of season one. The other song is the unforgettable ‘Snow Halation,’ testifying to the heights people can reach as they work together and understand one another’s feelings; words do no justice to the power of this track.  There are still more songs than these, from ‘No Brand Girls,’ to ‘Our LIVE, Our LIFE with you,’ to ‘Wonder Zone,’ to ‘The Door To Our Dreams’; the sheer number of great songs, well done instrumentals, and amount of story significance on each piece, makes the soundtrack of Love Live! nothing but a musical masterpiece. And yes, I’m only counting the music the show itself had, tempted as I am to talk about ‘Love Marginal’ among others.  What I DO want to talk about, is how hard it is for me to discuss Love Live! in any critical manner. It’s a series that caught me completely off guard when I was just looking for something to pass the time. It’s a show that makes me wonder just how much aesthetics matter to the viewing experience. It’s a story that forces me to see that even the simplest looking things can be more than meets the eye. And it’s a tale of gung ho dream chasing that’s infectiously optimistic.  Now, some people will surely have problems with the ending, and it’s usually not the kind of finale I go for either. Then again, every rule has exceptions. For those people who’ve already seen both seasons of Love Live!, let me say that I can overlook season two’s ending because I’m not expecting another adventure.  I just want an encore.";Recommended
12;Love Live! School Idol Project;Hiirokaze;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hiirokaze;10;"Love Live! is fun and lighthearted, but most of the appeal comes from getting invested in the community (seiyuus, the mobile: “game school idol festival”, and the fandom in general).  The school idol tournament “Love Live” and the plot of the school shutting down are not interesting by themselves, and so the show focuses on the characters. However, there are too many characters to develop so none of them end up getting developed anyway. Of the nine main cast members, Rin and Hanayo are forgettable, Maki, Kotori, Nico and Nozomi are one-dimensional, Umi and Eli are decent and the main character, Honoka, is basically just a shonen protagonist shoved into an idol show. Honoka is a complete airhead and just preaches loudly about friendship and idols. For a character-driven show, the characters are poorly developed and do not contribute much to the plot. Although the show is objectively bad due to the (essentially) nonexistent plot and weak characters, I really enjoyed it! It was still a fun show to watch and made me laugh a lot.  Overall, the production quality is good. Despite being poorly written, the characters are cute and quirky with colorful animation to support them, and at least have interesting visual designs. The music is above average, and the seiyuus did a good job singing and voicing the characters.  TLDR; Love Live! is a fun show to watch if you’re bored, and I would recommend it to new anime watchers if you’re into shows that aren’t too plot-heavy and focus more on entertainment. I wouldn’t watch it again but I don’t regret watching it either.";Recommended
13;Love Live! School Idol Project;ThatGuyLalo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatGuyLalo;10;So what did I think of School Idol Project... well to be perfectly honest it was surprisingly enjoyable. When I decided to watch the anime I thought of it only as a filler in between my seasonal anime grind. But on my was I mistaken. I was into the show and the Idols performances! Whenever they where getting hyped for a show I felt that same energy! I wanted to grace the stage with Honoka, Rin, You (my fav and the BEST obviously) and all the other Idols. The art and story were not the best but for me it's all how the anime makes me feel and wow did this anime make me feel great! Also, I listen to all there music on Spotify and YouTube soooooooo yeah.  On a side note, I play all the games and love all of them! On a side side note, Roselia is the best group and I know I'm right.;Recommended
14;Love Live! School Idol Project;deathdjentcore;https://myanimelist.net/profile/deathdjentcore;10;"*THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW, SO PLEASE BE NICE! :D*  (TL;DR version at the bottom)  I stopped watching anime a long time ago (when death note came out and everyone was fonboying about it everywhere, it made me sick) and I though I wouldn't ever watch anime again. A friend of mine told me a couple of months ago ""you don't have the amount of kawaii in your life you really need, kinda like Love live"" so I decided to watch it.  I went into it knowing perfectly well that this was an idol anime, mainly aimed to teen audiences and fully aware of what kind of music I should expect. To put things into perspective, if you haven't guessed by my user name I'm mainly a fan of deathcore, hardcore, all genres of metal and hardcore music basically.  I then started the first chapter at around 11pm in the night. What follows is the total actual truth: next day I went to the office where I work at and watched the whole first season as soon as I arrived.  The story is simple, yet gripping, the school is about to close and the only solution seemingly possible is to start a school idol group to bring more students to the school and stop its closure. What is gripping of this plot is all that the girls involved in the group have to endure to get to their prime and make it so they get their name known to others and bring some joy and happiness to people while being happy themselves.  Each song has a meaning in how the plot has developed so far, and each song has its own unique sound and lyrics that all make sense and leave you thinking on what they mean and what they teach you. A total of 28 songs are played across all seasons/movie and you'll remember each and everyone of them, all the lyrics and you'll end up downloading the songs and having them wether on your smartphone or music player of preference and playing them over and over again (they actually have around 60+ songs, not counting the sub-units songs and they're all amazing).  Now, the characters, they all have their own distinct personalities and artistic direction. Their voices and ways of acting all make you love them more and more (fyi, Rin/Honoka best waifus <3). Some songs have a ""main"" singer for them which is related to what happened in the episode and you'll say ""this is honoka's song"" or ""this is umi's song"". All characters have hilarious reactions when the funny moments happen as well as their own emotional responses when the anime goes into feels land.  You never watched an idols/musical anime? Watch this, and none other will match it after doing so. It's not just a story of 9 girls trying to save their school from closing, it's a story about fighting for your dreams, a story about finding hope and strength when all is against you, it's about not letting anything get in your way and pummel through all the bad reputation, naysayers and making your dreams come true. I watched Clannad, Clannad:AS, Kanon, Angel Beats, etc. and as much as they have taught me valuable lessons, nothing comes close to what Love Live has taught me and what it has done to my life and my way of getting through each day. Perseverance, following your dreams, never back down and above all, love life and enjoy every second of it, wether it is doing what you like or fighting against all odds, cause in the end it's all worth it.  TL;DR version:  (watched LLSIP, LLSIP 2nd season and LLSIP Movie)  The music is impeccable, each song sounds different from each other and the dance routines for each of them will make you learn the lyrics in no time even if you don't know any japanese. The characters are all loveable and not one of them feels out of place (Rin-chan/Honoka-chan best waifus!) as they all have their own stories that are developed during the whole anime. A simple yet convincing and gripping story on how fighting against all odds to make your dreams come true can take you to the top and make your life what you always wanted it to be. Truly a masterpiece that makes your heart warm and happy all the time and leaves you with a beautiful life lesson after finishing it. Don't miss it even if you're not used to SOL animes, to tell you the truth I wasn't into them either, and Love Live! got me into them in an instant. My only complaint: the 3D is kinda shitty at some points.";Recommended
15;Love Live! School Idol Project;YU3LE;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YU3LE;10;I swear to god, when I tell you this anime changed my life I mean it. It quite literally opened my mind to finding out who I am, introduced me to idol culture, made me realize I was a lesbian, and allowed me to get into a workout regimen all at once. Outstanding writing, character arcs, relatable cast, and adorable character design. Although some of the choreography is kinda lazy, I don’t even care. Such a good anime, 10/10, would recommend even to someone that doesn’t like this genre. Now, although I love this anime, there is but one flaw. The Nico stans that came from it. I swear to god those bitches are the most annoying ass fucks. I was watching a lyrics video for a love live song and they were talking about how cute the characters looked in the outfits and this guy has the audacity to come out of his greasy otaku cave and say “But Nico-Nii san is the most kawaii-desu of them all!” now I do not give a flying fuck if this guy was joking or not, it still made me cringe so hard I was sent into the 4th dimension. Also, they ALWAYS have to bring up Nico wether or not the conversations about her. Anyways, let’s get to the point. The point is, although it may have some annoying ass fans, it’s still an incredible, heart-wrenching, fun, funny, emotional rollercoaster of an anime. Please watch it if you haven’t already. - Parker, signing off.;Recommended

17;Love Live! School Idol Project;BasT94;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BasT94;9;"Just as much as we need a gateway anime to hook us up into this little world of colorful fights and beautiful blood rain, there comes a time when we have to watch something to remind us why we still like these things. And even if a series like Love Live, whose selling point isn't gore or a super addictive plot, isn't what we expected to end up watching when we started (I think my teenage me would frown If I told him I saw an anime about a bunch of cute girls singing in a stage), I think it has a lot of qualities that we don't usually find in anime in general. The problem is that its cover fits a profile that most people (myself included) would deem stupid, either for prejudice or for having actual experience with a show that looks similar to this one. But even though it shares some of the questionable tendencies of other series from a similar ilk (the so called ""moe"" genre), one needs to call out the fact that this one actually manages to avoid crippling itself with its own clichés and tropes.  Cute girls, sure. But is it as meaningless as the others? We'll see.  -Story: The story is what you read in the synopsis. There'll be tropes and conventions you've seen before, even clichés sometimes, but it actually tells something. It progresses. It doesn't get stuck in: ""Yo, gurl, it's so fun being in a club! All we do is sit an' talk shit, and be cute. No need to practice or deal with life issues. Sure being a teenage girl is a-ma-zing.""  The thing's not written to make you go: ""what a badass plot twist"", but it takes itself seriously enough to follow a logical path to get things done, and there's the feeling that they're actually starting things from scratch and fighting for them, instead of, you know, succes brought forth by magic. This is actually surprising, at least to me, because when I see a title like this the only thing that crosses my mind is ""K-On! again"", which, for acknowledged people, means that the series will ""preserve the flow of everyday life forever"", or, in more common terms, focus in unbelievably trivial daily stuff and no character progression. It's hard to tell wheter that situation will suit a specific series or not, but the case being that this format can cause from idle entertainment to hellish boredom, seeing an idol show about idols actually doing idol stuff is refreshing. And when it's handled in a way where it gets its points across: laughter when you have to laugh and emotion when it needs emotion, then there's no way you can deny its quality.  But if all in all you still can't find the story compelling (or you just like to nitpick a lot, like me), at least the humor should make up for it.  -Characters: In a genre where airhead MCs are the norm (and usually its curse), I believe this is the first time I can say: she's actually useful! Honoka might still be an airhead, but out of all the characters of the show, she does suit the role of the engine that moves the whole team, and she does it perfectly. She even gets proper character development, something that would seem otrageous in many shows like this.  The rest of the cast isn't bad either. It is true that is full of archetypes we've already seen a zillion times, but the writers manage to put a fresh feeling into them, and exploit their inherent qualities. You can complain that compared to other kinds of shows they're really not that fleshed out, but I find it hard to name many shows of this type that actually do this. The only bad thing is that some characters lose the spotlight as the show progresses (and thus become easy to forget), but it at least makes them likeable enough to not get annoyed at their presence.  -Art: I wouldn't call it great (just cute faces everywhere), but it's very good. I'm not sure if there's a difference between the TV version and the DVDs, but from what I watched the animation is pretty solid, and the character expressions don't suddenly turn into eldritch abominations for a lack of budget. There's also CGI to help smooth things out when they dance and need a more 3D approach to their movements, and it looks good enough. Overall, I think the best animated parts are the ones when they're dancing, which is a HUGE plus considering this is an idol anime.  -Sound: Opening, ending and insert songs are all pop (which means that if you like pop, you'll probably like them as well). This isn't a surprise considering what the series is about, but the actual OST of the show is also very fitting and highlights the moments in a timely manner. There's even some fantastic piano in some parts, which I couldn't help to like. The seiyuus also do a great job at portraying their characters, all with their incredibly high-pitched voices and token tsunderism in some of them.  -Enjoyment: This is odd. After watching things like K-On! and other series of a similar ilk, seeing a DVD cover featuring a bunch of cute girls would usually cause me to go ""nope, don't want it"", not because I didn't like the previous ones (which I probably did), but because I've found myself unable to like more. It might come with age, but these kind of shows, whether they're comedies, club-based stories, or the most ridiculously simple slice of life, become more and more tedious to watch as you get by, and finding something that you can even praise for its actual effort in improving the genre's quality is quite the thing. Personally, I loved it. It was really fun, and all that ""cuteness"" crap was finally subordinated to the freaking plot.  So, would I recommend it?  Totally.  Have fun!";Recommended
18;Love Live!

After finished watching first season, I question myself ""why i did'nt watch this anime earlier?"". This, my friend is one of the most amazing idol anime,of course there are many more idol anime such as AKB0048, Wake up Girls, Idolmaster and many more. But, LL gives me something that makes me want to jump and clapping after they finished their songs.  Love Live School Ido Project start with main character,Honoka who adore idol since it was awesome but the happy moment did'nt stay long after hearing her school gonna shut down. With determination, she and her other two friend,Kotori and Umi decide to create school idol to save school from close. Their fun,sad moment goes on as they reqruit more member and create more songs. I would say, to protect-school-from-close story was not the strong point of this anime but the member of ""muse""(their team name) since each of them have different personality with their own backstory.  For animation, I did'nt really sceptical about it and I find it pretty much satisfying seeing them dance and sing with full energetic. The producers did a good job handling 3D CGI when they dance and other scene which are fluid and nice. For music and OST, since this is school idol anime, I'm expecting it more energetic song and it did'nt dissappoint me. Moreover, it keeps getting better and more charater songs keep getting produce until now. One more thing, I recommend to watch with speaker or earphones to feel the music to the max.  Verdict: I would recommended this anime for those who want to watch some freaking cute and beautiful girls dance and sing in stage. To tell the truth, their dance and songs did gives me goosebump and speechless especially episode 3(trust me,you will feel that). For the rating, it easily get 10/10.";Recommended
19;Love Live! School Idol Project;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;7;Love Live School Idol Project is a multimedia project. There were a lot of different companies behind this. ASCII Media Works, Lantis, Dengeki G's Magazine and Sunrise. The overall project included games, music, manga, light novels an anime series and an anime film. Today we'll be looking at series one of the anime brought to us by Sunrise in 2013.  Story:  Our heroines happily attend Otonokizaka Academy when they get some bad news. Due to a lack of interest in the school, it's slated to close with their current first years being the last class. The student council President and Vice President, Eri and Nozomi, are determined to find a way to gain interest, but have no idea how to go about it. Meanwhile, second year student Honoka is also trying o think of a way when she happens to pass a very popular school and notices something. One of their big draws is that they have a popular school idol group attending. Honoka decides that the best thing to do would e to form a school idol group for Otonokizaka and gets her best friends, Kotori and Umi to join her in the endeavour.  On the downside, the anime delves into artificial sources of tension overmuch. What do I mean by that?Well, they'll introduce a character and make a production about whether or not that character is going to join Honoka's idol group, μ's (pronounce Muse). And this is something they do thrice. Well, I saw that character with the group in the opening sequence but maybe that actually isn't going to happen said no one ever. To be fair, this is the first series and it is important to show how these girls all get involved in μ's. The problem is the pomp over whether or not they will. There are a lot of things done well in the series too. The pacing is really good and I like that the girls are allowed to actually fail at a few points. Which does create some genuine tension that actually really works. The story is simple, but it's effectively executed and it ends with a good note.  Characters:  The characters are pretty archetypical. I will say, to the series' credit, that several of them are allowed to develop and grow over the course of the series. I will also say that, in all fairness, they aren't poorly done archetypes, the execution does work in the context of a series like this. The characters are a lot of fun and there are some really good interactions. My biggest issue is with the character of Nozomi. To be specific, with her tendency to go into bad touch mode. She gropes the other girls without their permission on several occasions. The worst part is that most of them would probably totally allow it if she asked properly. I don't think Rin would since she only seems to have eyes for Hanayo, but the rest probably would, assuming she asked nicely. Even if they wouldn't, that would still be inexcusable behaviour.  Art:  To the series' credit, the costume and character designs are really well done. It's also really good at doing the lighting and dance numbers during μ's lives. The backgrounds are also nicely detailed. My only real complaint is that this is one of those series where noses don't exist. It may be a stylistic choice, but it's a really head-scratching one.  Sound:  The casting in this is really good. Due to the nature of the series, they needed ladies who were good singers and actresses. As such, we have the singer Hori Eriko (stage name Pile), Tokui Sora, Kusuda Aina, Mimori Suzuko, Nanjo Yoshino, Uchida Aya, Nitta Emi, Kubo Yurika, & Iida Riho. Most of whom gravitate more towards singing and don't really have many acting credits. Still, they all do well in their roles. The music and singing are both really good.  Ho-yay:  There's a lot of les-yay in this. It might just be on the level of Yuru Yuri. We've got Honoka with most of the other girls, particularly Umi, Kotori, Eri, & Maki. There's also the dynamic between Rin and Hanayo. Which is incessantly adorable. We've also got Nozomi and Eri, who come across as a couple who have been together for several years. There's also Nozomi in general with her totally uncool bad touch tendencies. Incidentally, she's another shrine maiden yuri girl.  Final Thoughts:  Love Live School Idol Project is an enjoyable series. The story is well done. The characters are mostly good. The music and acting are impeccable and the art is good. If you enjoy musical school anime, give it a go. My final rating for it is going to be a 7/10. In future, I'll look at the second series. But next week is going to be Divergence Eve.;Recommended
0;Love Live! School Idol Project;bmoore07;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bmoore07;5;"“You can’t fool television viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights” - Bob Barker  If there’s any pop culture entity that can dispute Mr. Barker’s claim, it is the idol genre. Prizing style over substance, flair over functionality, and pizazz over practicality, titles within the idol genre have discovered success time after time by appealing to its fanbase more than anything else. Unfulfilled character arcs, glacial pacing, stale voice acting, and even gaping plot holes can all be negated by the lavish concerts and energetic score from your standard idol anime. That’s not to mention the miracles that a moe pop idol can conjure; there are few tactics with greater financial success than inserting as many cute anime chicks into your show as possible. The idol genre has proven again and again that you really can fool viewers with dancing girls and flashing lights.  It is in this genre that Love Live has established a name for itself. Produced by Sunrise (Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass), Love Live (or “LL” for short) has developed into the biggest and brightest star of the idol genre, its massive fan base and overwhelming merchandise serving as major influences for its fame. Love Live is widely considered to be the greatest anime of its particular category, if not necessarily a critical darling. However, Love Live’s lofty status raises a few interesting conundrums: if titles within the idol genre are, by and large, bereft of depth and meaning, then how is one supposed to properly determine which is the greatest? Why should Love Love be considered the ideal representative of the idol genre? Do Love Live’s characters display more elaborate dances than that of Aikatsu? Does LL possess a greater sense of humor than The Idolmaster? I figured that actually watching Love Live would answer my questions so that’s what I did. To be perfectly honest, I harbored a few misgivings about Love Live, mainly that it's nothing more than meme fodder. However, the optimist in me believed that Love Live would be far more than that. With its charming story, LL would not only soothe my heart but inspire me to espouse its virtues as well.  While Love Live didn’t exactly confirm my worst fears, it is hardly a series that I’d recommend. My opposition to LL doesn’t stem from hatred or disappointment; rather, it is generated from the show’s lackluster execution of its most basic requirements. I’m more than willing to condone a mishap or two in the visual department but a grocery list of logical fallacies, one after the other, is something else entirely. For example, your show might have a problem when your story struggles to formulate a raison d'etre. Love Live is focused on three friends (Honoka, Umi, and Kotori) that desire to prevent their school from closing down but, beyond their adoration for it, they never clarify why they want to save it. If our protagonists are unaware of their cause for concern, why should I be invested in what they’re doing? Anywho, the trio agree that forming a school idol group is the best course of action (because why should you start donations and petitions when you can sing for a great cause?) but first they have to be approved by Eli Ayase, the Student Council President that’s overly harsh towards our aspiring heroines.  Will our main trio find a concrete purpose for saving their school? Will Ayase change her dastardly ways? Will Love Live start caring about itself?  These questions will be answered right after Love Live exposes you to the umpteenth shot of Honoka’s butt.  At its core, Love Live is a show that panders like no show has ever pandered before. Not only is there an obligatory beach/swimsuit episode but there’s also the rampant fanservice (especially early on), as well as an unbearable “chest grab” gag (it has to be seen to be believed). Couple that with Love Live’s excessive moe aesthetic (the sparkly eyes, the constant blushing, and the unnatural wiggling/squirming) and top it all off with the bizarre scene in episode 11 where a friend of Honoka’s rubs her head and scratches her chin like Honoka is some sort of dog. What you’ll get is one phenomenal crowd-pleaser of a show, a show that prefers to satisfy fetishes rather than concern itself with storytelling. The flimsily constructed plot accomplishes little beyond serving as an elaborate excuse to showcase the cuteness of Love Live’s characters; the cast is nothing but a hodgepodge of stereotypes. Outside of Honoka, Umi, Kotori, and Ayase, there’s the athletic one (Rin and her “nya”s), the intense rival (Nico and her ridiculous poses), the shy one (Hanayo and her idol obsession), the tsundere (Maki)..... and Nozomi, the Student Council Vice President that perpetrates the aforementioned “chest grab” gag (I’ve never seen a VP constantly undermine the President quite like Nozomi does in LL).  It will be of little surprise to you when I say that most of Love Live’s characters are inessential. Ayase and Kotori, however, are crucial to a certain extent but it’s Honoka and Umi that are the true outliers. Honoka is Love Live’s protagonist, a spontaneous do-gooder cut from the cloth of the spunky girl trope. What truly defines Honoka as a character are her over-the-top speeches (those bits of dialogue are downright painful in the amount of vapid positivity they exude) and her overwhelming ego (we’ll get to that later). Umi, on the other hand, is Honoka’s foil; she’s literally the only LL character with common sense, a realistic approach, and a complex personality. As Honoka’s best friend, Umi desires to aid her friend in achieving her dream but is, at first, adamantly against Honoka’s idea of an idol group because Umi rightfully doubts the effort that Honoka applied to it. Over time, Umi softens her stance on Honoka’s idea and of idol groups on general, even to the point where she valiantly defends the existence of idols in a climatic scene. On a surface level, Umi appears to be the stereotypical “quiet one”, that and nothing more, but she quickly endears herself as she wages war against her anxiety, her timidity, and the mob mentality that is an all-encompassing presence in Love Live.  Honoka lords over Love Live with an iron fist; there isn’t a single character in any medium, animated or not, that wields as much creative control as Honoka. If there’s one thing that you simply must know about Love Live, it’s that this show is gravitated entirely towards what Honoka desires and anyone that deviates from it is severely punished. Honoka advertises her viewpoints as essential for success and for the betterment of others but it’s obvious that she's only massaging her ego. For example, Umi wants to perform in concerts with a knee-length skirt (for several logical reasons) and, while any true friend would respect Umi’s wishes, Honoka, with Kotori’s help, secretly created skirts of shorter length. When Umi discovers this act of treachery, she's understandably upset but Love Live more or less remains loyal to Honoka’s scheme. It’s all very sickening; Honoka is this lionized ringleader of debauchery and deceit with the overarching narrative and Kotori as her partners in crime (Kotori is the ideal yes-man for Honoka; she possesses very, very few individual thoughts or opinions, existing only to blindly support Honoka). The in-universe benefits that Honoka receives from LL are simply absurd; she’s hailed as the idol group’s leader despite not proving herself as one, she’s praised for her unreasonable badgering of potential members, and her excessive pettiness is rarely admonished. The moments where Honoka is called out on her BS, like Ayase pointing out her arrogance or Nico questioning Honoka’s leadership, are so, so refreshing but they are few and far between. Is it too much to expect LL to treat its characters with fairness and rationality?  Buried deep within Love Live’s framework, beneath Honoka’s ego trip, beneath the gratuitous pandering, beneath the shallow characterization, is a redeemable project. It’s LL’s soundtrack that possesses most of this show's promise; soothing and refined, the OST is stunning in its versatility. Not only does Love Live’s score contain acoustic guitar songs and piano solos but there are also big band pieces as well. Although LL tends to utilize the same five or six songs over and over, the music is still a joy to listen to. However, when you’re not enchanted by Love Live’s score, you're left in awe by the artificiality of it all. Like a bouquet of silk flowers, there is very little authenticity in Love Live; its worldview is far too picturesque, too quixotic, for its own good. In the world of Love Live, conflicts are resolved entirely through dogged persistence, flashbacks galore, BS logic, and the power of friendship. Any chemistry issue within the idol group is negated by the characters constantly complimenting one another. “You’re the best!” “No. I’m not that special. YOU’RE the best.” NO; YOU’RE THE BEST!” I’m almost positive that roughly 70 percent of Love Live’s script is composed of exchanges like that.  When Honoka’s idol group wish to compete in the School Idol Tournament, the school director allows them to do so, no questions asked. She doesn't explain to them the financial costs of this decision to them nor does she schedule a meeting with their parents and teachers to determine whether or not this course of action is wise. If you thought that was an egregious example of a show bypassing logic for the sake of moving the plot forward, then, boy, do I have news for you. Love Live managed to land the jackpot in logical fallacies twice during the same episode. The first was the aforementioned example with the school director. The second? Well, allow me to explain. The director has permitted Honoka’s group to participate in the School Idol Tournament only if everyone within the group lands a passing grade on an upcoming test. Because of this, everyone is diligently preparing for the big day, with Umi, Kotori, Maki, Hanayo, and Nozomi tutoring the academically challenged members of the group, specifically Honoka (she possesses the intellect of a second grader despite being in high school because of anime logic). After everyone finishes their test, the idol group members convene to share their scores with one another. They quickly discover that every member passed; however, Honoka hasn’t shared her score with anyone. As the group begs her to reveal her grade, a few members express regret that their efforts will be worthless if Honoka failed. It is right then and there that Honoka dramatically unveils the graded test that was concealed behind her back. With the inspiring orchestral strings blaring in the background and a larger-than-life grin plastered on Honoka’s face, her graded test is revealed…. to have a score of 53.  I would like to note that, in Japan, a 53 is a failing grade, just like it is in the rest of the world.  As far as acts of stupidity are concerned, this was simply breathtaking. That Love Live treated Honoka’s score like some sort of grandiose achievement is not only absolutely hilarious but it’s quite perplexing as well.  What was the criteria for passing? To answer correctly more than half of the questions? Did the teachers accept Honoka’s test as a passing grade because he/she pitied Honoka? Was the teacher bribed by Honoka’s parents to pass her?  Now that I’m thinking about it, I know exactly why Honoka passed: because Honoka is Love Live’s protagonist and presenting her with a challenging obstacle is far beyond LL’s capabilities.  During Love Live’s final three episodes, the narrative attempted something new, gravitating towards poorly handled melodrama like a moth being drawn towards a burning candle. The result was the nadir of a thoroughly average title; Love Live’s emo phase flopped because it was overbearing (especially with the histrionic soap opera that was episode 12), because it was extremely jarring (completely antithetical to a series that, up to this point, was directed towards maid cafes and pillow fights), and because it disappeared the instant that Nico ordered Honoka to stop being angsty. Amidst all of the melodrama, Love Live’s finale introduced us to the highlight of the entire series, a truly beautiful scene with Honoka and Umi reminiscing on the stage of their first concert. It reminded me of what the underrated western Justified used to excel at, simply placing two characters in a given setting and allowing its masterful script to take it from there. With the aforementioned scene in Love Live, there was no overpowering song in the background, no special effects, and no unnecessary camera angles. It was just Honoka and Umi shooting the breeze. As I was watching all of this unfold, I thought to myself, “Why couldn’t Love Live bother to do something like this before?”  If Love Live really is the best that the idol genre has to offer, then I certainly won't expose myself to more of its ilk. Yes, Love Live possesses an excellent soundtrack, a lovable character in Umi, and a spark of untapped potential or two. However, that is hardly enough to deliver it from my wrath. Not only does this show have a repulsive love affair with its protagonist but it treats every other character with the utmost contempt. Not only does this show appeal to the lowest common denominator but it also insults your intelligence. Not only does this show enrage with its wasted potential but it also shoots itself in the foot with its constant tonal shifts. Vapid yet infuriating, erratic yet meandering, bewildering yet unenticing, Love Live is a jack of many trades and a master of wasting your time. Dancing girls and flashing lights cannot redeem this scrap heap of mediocrity.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! School Idol Project;LIQfilms;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LIQfilms;5;"Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably taken note of the rising popularity and plethora of idol related anime in the last few years. Any time I dare venture out to any anime convention that just so happens to be taking place within my proximity, I’m bound to be met with an onslaught of idol related merchandise from body pillows, those strange mouse pads that also have a pair of breasts on them, figures, CDs and even several cosplayers too – it’s inescapable! However, it’s not necessarily hard to understand why such shows garner such popularity, as they seem to be almost designed to be as marketable as possible. They feature an ensemble of cute girls, of various body types, whether that be the small loli (remember to tell the FBI that she is just a drawing when they come knocking down your door!) all the way to the plump and voluptuous, all the while having distinct personality types to appeal to every demographic of anime fan imaginable. Combine that with the fact that the girls are often made to wear skimpy and risqué outfits with incredibly small miniskirts, and sing generic, catchy pop-songs with their cute mannerisms, makes for a cultural phenomenon! Out of all the various idol anime out there, easily the most prolific and popular is Love Live; a franchise so popular over in Japan that in 2016 it was the highest grossing media franchise of that year, passing One Piece! (Damn, that’s a lot of scantily clad body pillows sold!) Over the last few days, me and a couple of other reviewer friendos decided to watch the entire series (for the most part anyway) all together, and while it was a very enjoyable experience to do so, even if we spent most of the time making fun of the show, I seem to have been left with rather severe PTSD, so much so, that every time I go to close my eyes to sleep at night, visions of each of the girls as they smile and dance appear in front of me. At first, it’s tranquil; calm, but as time moves along the girls become fierce and terrifying, laughing manically as I am trapped in this existential horrific nightmare in which even my own screams of pain and anguish cannot awaken me from the horrors that lay before me. I desperately want to run, to run from the visions, but I’m stuck; frozen in place as the idols slowly consume me and every fibre of my being…  Anywho, with that all said and done, and instead of contacting my closest therapist immediately, let’s form our own idol group, dress up in some revealing clothes whilst dancing and singing on stage, and dive into the world of Love Live!  Otonokizaku High School is on the verge of closing, due a lack of students wanting to partake in studies there, and is set to shut down after the current first year students graduate. As such, our main protagonist, Honoka, in an attempt to prevent the school closing down at all costs, decides to create an idol group, as a way to attract new students into attending said school, thus preventing it from its inevitable closure. The rest of the series sees Honoka recruit new members, as they all practice harder and harder to become great idols, intermixed with a touch of drama here and there. At the very least, Love Live’s set-up allows for some semblance of narrative stakes as the failure of the newly formed idol group, by the name of Muse, will bring an end to the school (even though we know as an audience from the get-go that the characters will succeed since there is nothing presented in the narrative that would suggest otherwise) and it also provides some kind of motivation and drive for the characters in the story. My main criticism of Love Live’s narrative is just how incredibly predictable and safe the entire journey is. It’s the most standard narrative structure one could possibly expect to see, and has been done so many times in so many other shows, that I can guarantee you that you would be able to identify each story beat and event that transpires in the show just by simply reading the plot synopsis presented on MAL. It genuinely feels like that whoever was writing the show, was simply ticking boxes off of things to include within the show. A hyper and energetic girl with good intentions who ropes everyone in and inspires them to try their hardest? TICK. An obligatory beach episode which is used for the purpose of training and seeing each of the girls in skimpy bathing suits? TICK. Drama that is introduced late into the narrative and is used more so to try and make the show seem more emotional than it is, whilst trying to manipulate the audience into feeling something for the characters, which will be ultimately resolved by the final episode leaving in a happy conclusion? TICK. As such, the narrative of Love Live feels tiering; a chore to sit through, as in my head I could easily map out the series and each one of the events that would transpire. It feels less like a journey you embark on with these girls as they try to save their school, and more so like a lecture in which you already know all the content the lecturer is going to go over, and you’re just listing them off in your head, waiting for them to get to the next point.  As I mentioned before, the show does have its share of drama, which I imagine was implemented into the narrative as a way to spice things up; to try and make things interesting, but it just comes across more so forced and trite than anything else, and the juxtaposition between the light-hearted hijinks an episode before, and scenes where everyone is yelling and fighting comes across as so damn jarring! Again, just like the complaints I talked about above about the narrative’s predictability, the drama in the show is foreshadowed in such a way that ignores the very notion of subtlety. After both Umi, Honoka’s friend, and Honoka’s little sister warn her not to overwork herself as she may fall ill, she then decides to go running in the pouring rain like an idiot, develops a fever, and ends up ruining everybody’s hard work as a result. The show expects me to feel sorry for Honoka, since the very reason as to why she developed this fever was because she was working so hard to prevent the school from closing down, but I simply can’t, as the character itself isn’t strong enough to illicit such emotions in me, especially since it’s so typical of these types of shows to go down this route that it leaves no impact on me! There’s even a scene in the show where the drama reaches a point in which Honoka gets bitch-slapped into the Shadow Realm after proclaiming her leaving of the group, whereupon I promptly laughed my ass off for a good ten minutes because I’m an immature dumbass. But, this disconnect from what the show expects me to feel, that is, emotional and probably shock from seeing one of the girls resort to physical violence towards her friend, against what I felt, that is, laughter at a moment where it obviously wasn’t warranted is the reason why I feel nothing for any of the drama they try and throw in the show, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the characters are simply not strong enough to carry it. There’s just nothing really to sink your teeth into in this show in regards to the story, and, despite what some people may tell you, such as the entire show being inside one of the character’s heads (which would actually be kind of interesting as an idea now that I think about it) there’s nothing really of any substantial merit here (then again, the person who told me that has Eli as his favourite girl, so therefore his claim lacks any weight automatically).  Now, I’ve complained a fair bit about the narrative and why it feels so tiresome and dull, but this mode of storytelling is not necessarily a game breaker for me. I can forgive an anime in regards to its lack of overall narrative, as long as the characters, and the interactions between them are good; it’s the main reason why I liked Azumanga Diaoh after all. In that show, the narrative is simply about a bunch of high school girls whom progress through three years of high school, with them eventually graduating at the end, but the characters are all very likeable, to the point in which we grow attached to them as actual people, and the comedy in the show is strong enough to carry the entire experience. For me, the most important thing in most cases are the characters, since they hold the key to whether or not I care about anything the show prevents me with, and I think if the characters in Love Live were stronger, I could be more forgiving of the narrative and the whole show at large.  Much like in regards to the story, it felt like the writer constructed the characters in the most safe and predictable way possible, with two exceptions however. I’ve already somewhat alluded to Honoka’s character earlier in the review; she is the girl whom has the most energy, and acts as the driving force for pushing the story forward with her optimistic outlook to any situation and is the one that gathers everyone together, acting as the inspiration for the group through her hardworking attitude. She is not necessarily a bad character, just one that is not that interesting as a whole. As previously mentioned, she does run into some drama near the end of the series, but the small amount of development she embarks on, and character arc in general is still nothing remarkable as a whole. Umi, along with Kotori are best friends with Honoka and we see little snips of their past as children, which gives their characters a little more depth, although, and, again, is nothing to remarkable. They more so play the voice of rationality to Honoka in the series, with Umi being the shy and reserved type, but ultimately firm when the time calls, and Kotori…just being an airhead I guess. Whilst in the latter part of the series, she has to make a decision regarding her future, that being whether to move to America to study costume design, or to stay being a worthless school idol, which then cultivates in some more of that lovely, forced D R A M A that I adore, it feels inconsequential in the long run, since it’s pretty obvious that she will decide to stay with her friends since shows like this have practically programmed me to think as such.  Hanoyo and Rin add very little to the overall show and to be perfectly honest, I kind of forgot they were even there half the time. Rin joins the idol group just because Hanoyo does, and while Hanoyo’s reasoning for joining, that being because she wants to grow in confidence is a fine motivation to have, it’s barely developed or explored. Maki serves somewhat more to the overall story, as she can actually play the piano and sing rather well, which is then used for writing music for the group, and her Tsundere-esque personality can actually be kind of cute sometimes. Eli has somewhat more of a backstory than the rest of the girls, being that she was actually a ballet dancer in the past, which is then used to help the rest of the group and Noizoimi is one of the better characters, being as she has the most voluptuous body, and sexually harasses the other girls by grabbing their tits (if that’s not a well crafted character, then I don’t know what is). Nozomi takes on more of a mother role in the series, often dishing out random nuggets of wisdom to the girls whenever they’re in need of some, and that’s it as a whole. The characters in Love Live, for the most part, are extremely weak and cookie-cutter, so much so, that I’m struggling to even find anything to say about them. The only fun character in the entire show is Nico, and, yes, I understand at this point she is one giant meme, but she is the only character who has some semblance of a personality. She is an aspiring wannabe ideal, constantly switching between her idol persona, that being the adorably sweet Nico, with the catchphrase “NICO NICO NII!!” which me and everyone repeated so much during our watch that my PTSD is triggered every time I hear it. She’s like an antagonist in a way; the various things she does to try and prove that she is better than everyone else at various idol related things always blows up in her face, leading to some of the more entertaining aspects of the show (I also like to imagine to myself that Nico is a trap; a thought that brings me nothing but happiness).  The characters and their interactions are just fine as a whole. There are times when the chemistry between them does work, most strongest being during the beach episode I made fun of earlier since the girls are just messing around with each other (and Nico gets hit right in the goddam face with a beach ball so that’s always a plus), leading into some genuinely charming and funny scenes, particularly thanks to Nico as I just mentioned before, but the show really needed a stronger cast of characters to really pull itself together. That’s not to say that the entire show is without merit however. There were some scenes that I felt were kinda alright, such as in episode three, when, after the girls put all their efforts into practising for their first idol performance, and when the curtains go up to perform, they are greeted with only a few people rather than the full room like they were expecting, but despite that, they perform on anyway. Some of the facial expressions can also be pretty funny and charming too, such as when we’re first introduced to Maki after she finishes playing her song, she looks over at the door to see Honoka clapping profusely, all the while being cross-eyed; it’s a shot that never fails to make me laugh just because of how stupid it looks. As a whole, Love Live is just really bland and nothing of that much interest really happens as a whole.  In terms of animation, it’s overall pretty solid, with each girl appearing to be pretty damn cute with rather thicc thighs. I only mention the latter part due to the fact that the show has a tendency to have low camera angles, perfectly emphasising their thighs and butts (hey, I’m not a pervert for noticing this stuff, it’s the SHOWS fault for storyboarding it as such!) It does utilise CGI however during the performances scenes, which, to be perfectly fair, actually looks pretty good for CGI standards, but my main criticism is that they cut constantly between the CGI models and close-ups of with the traditional animation, and as a result, it ends up coming across as jarring; breaking the flow of both the dancing and my immersion. The music, as expected of a show all about music does the job, although I wouldn’t call it anything great as a whole. It’s generic, catchy pop that will forget about by the time the next generic, catchy pop songs comes on. Probably the only track that I really liked was Start; dash, mainly because some twat kept singing it during the Discord chat – what a strange guy that was…  In conclusion Love Live is just an incredibly bland show, and, despite a few moments here and there, is mostly devoid of anything of any substantial merit. I admit that I did enjoy myself whilst watching the show, but much of that enjoyment was indicative of watching it with everyone else. I’m sure if I watched this by myself, as I did with the last three episodes, I would be bored to tears! And this is coming from someone who typically enjoys cute girls doing cute things types of shows, but Love Live’s characters are just simply not strong enough, nor are their character interactions fun enough to hold the entire show together and becomes more so a chore to watch than anything else. I think now would be a good time to clarify that I do not begrudge anyone for enjoying this show, as the tone of this review may suggest otherwise, and, if anything, I’m envious. Envious of the fact that you could find so much enjoyment in something I found to be bland at best; envious that you can genuinely get excited whenever the girls begin any of their performances. As it stands, Love Live’s popularity confuses me, and I understand that I am critiquing an entire franchise with this statement consisting of a second season (which I’ve been told is much better than this) a movie, as well a spin-off series that also has its own sequel, but as an opening to the entire franchise, it’s incredibly weak, and doesn’t inspire much desire to go off and watch the rest of the series. At best Love Live is incredibly mediocre; at worst it gave me aids.";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! School Idol Project;SunlitSonata;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SunlitSonata;5;What does it mean to sell out? For many, this term is often used in a negative light, to suggest giving up artistic integrity for the sake of appealing to the fans and getting all the profits. The sad fact is that in this day and age, more auteur products that try to tell different stories from the norm don’t sell well, and that the mainstream is cluttered with copies banking on past trends for the sake of appeal. This applies to movies, TV, and even anime. Sure, there are exceptions to this, as there always are, but more often than not, I feel like those are the products that get extremely popular, regardless of what substance lies behind them.  Which brings me to Love Live. If you’re familiar with Japan’s anime culture post 2013, you’ve likely seen this franchise EVERYWHERE. It’s a continuous fad really, cute girls in costumes singing pop songs. In America, you’ve probably seen Love Live lines up at anime conventions all over, with tons and tons of merchandise (even incredibly creepy head masks of the girls). The franchise collectively took up THREE spots in the Top 9 of Japan’s most recent Top 100 anime poll, and even the spinoff series was voted higher than Cowboy freakin Bebop! Hell, one person I know in my personal anime club doesn’t even like the anime but plays the phone game to upgrade her idols like crazy!  As for me, I’ve always been hesitant about Love Live. While sometimes I am proven wrong with stuff like Konosuba or Madoka Magica, most anime tend to be exactly what’s on their cover, and the cover for Love Live looked overly bright, and relying on excess cute girl appeal with the name “Project” attached to the show basically saying “yup, we’re making this specifically to merchandise”, much like K Project which I have similar feelings on. LL just didn’t interest me, but I did like K-On, so when I finally went to check it out alongside many other anime reviewers, hoping it wouldn’t be a sellout series, I was....not entirely let down, but still given exactly what I expected. A show trying to push current trends, having writing on the level of your average Disney sitcom, and all and all just being incredibly basic in every department. While I could enjoy different parts of Love Live, and the production behind it is generally great, the show itself never rose above follower entertainment.  Some spoilers below:  It begins a young teenage girl named Honoka, finding out that GASP! Her school is going to close down! One day, when going to see her sister’s school, she sees a famous idol group, and dramatically DROPS EVERYTHING to want to be an idol just like them. She then pushes her two friends, and then overtime slowly convinces new members to follow the idol path, because maybe being idols will be enough to save their school, to the chagrin of the student council President. That’s the general synopsis, and if you’re familiar with this type of “save the school” storyline, you’re probably aware of exactly what to expect and go in knowing. Inevitably, idols will be preached, naysayers will be disproven, and the school will be saved, with everyone in the OP becoming an idol by the end. However, being predictable isn’t immediately a crime, as even great shows can be predictable, and sometimes unpredictable shows can have haphazard plot structure or nonsensical plot twists in hindsight.  So what does Love Live add to it beyond exactly what you’d expect to add some depth to the image? Mixed results. There are some moments to this stock premise that feel like things actually add to the story. While Honoka’s motivation is as simplistic as it gets, a few of the other girls have pretty solid backdrops to want or not want to be idols in how it affects their character arcs. The name “Muse” they chose for their group was a clever choice in hindsight, including after a little revelation of how it was there. Another plus is the fact that the idols have to practice being idols, and some of the ideas behind this were kind of fun to see, like the whole “smile while you push up” thing, or the idea of holding poses for long amounts of time. They make it clear there is definitely some struggle and people who will crack at them. Despite this though, almost all of it feels montaged through. While the effort is definitely there, perhaps seeing more of it actually happening rather than saying it happened would’ve worked better for the overall narrative, instead of saving it all for the showcases where they seem to do it perfectly in their robotic CGI sometimes bodies. This even hurts some of the comedy. One episode revolves around the infamous NicoNico trying to prove how hard certain tasks of singing, dancing and personal appeal are to the other girls, but they just feel like they do it with no problem at all to Nico’s chagrin. And we don’t see any of it. It makes it feel like the show saying that Nico’s persistence led to her whole group getting disbanded harder to believe.  Aside from that, most of what you get from Love Live is extremely vanilla and safe. After all, that’s what people have approved in the past, why change that image if you’ll make profits from it? Of course everyone sees the errors of their ways if they don’t want to be idols. Of course there’s a beach episode. Of course the girls dress up in cafe maid costumes, there’s merch to be sold of that! Of course some of the girls have surprisingly low IQ for high schoolers, not knowing what 5 squared is and randomly forgetting basically grammatical structure in one scene only for it to never come up prior or after, we need tests! And of course, having your boobs squeezed as punishment, which was probably a low point for me in regards to running gags that weren’t funny the first time.  In contrast, the drama actually feels like the opposite. It’s not something spread out throughout the show, but rather, mostly transplanted entirely in the final episodes for the sake of it.  First off, it is only in the episode 11, the day of their festival, that it is stated where certain clubs are positioned is due to lottery. Such a thing was never stated before and feels inserted for the sake of cheap drama and about two minutes of crying. And then, immediately after, Honoka, in practicing, decides to do so alone, on a cold, dark, rainy night, gets a fever and collapses midway through the show because of it. Again, it makes it hard to care for the show’s drama when it feels so forced. Then, following that, more drama pours salt into the wound, and rather than thinking about a sub member, like many actual bands, Honoka decides to QUIT IDOLS FOREVER?! Jezz lousie....Thankfully the slap that follows felt incredibly satisfying in consequence, but everything at the end felt needlessly heavy in contrast to so much to bring something apart only to bring it together at the very end. The ending is admittedly nice and sweet, if a bit predictable, but the ride there was...to put it simply milquetoast up the hill and bumpy down the uptake partly both at its best and worst when it focused on character interactions.  The characters, in general, contribute to the vanilla feeling of the show by feeling like they were designed specifically to be merchandised, but there were some bright spots to ultimately make a passable bunch.  Starting with the lead, Honoka, she’s basically the self-proclaimed Red Ranger of the group, the one who brings the passion, cuteness, pushiness, and forced drama at the end. She could have a few likable moments as the lead character, though I feel like she needed to do more in terms of actual contribution. There’s an episode dedicated to who should lead the group, and Honoka, who WAS the leader, wins out because of how much she cared. Hooray. Also, to put it simply she’s....not very bright. Somehow not knowing what 5 squared is in 10th grade, and getting a 53 on her final exam WITH excessive studying. You could argue that justifies some of her decisions, but it did not make her incredible tendency to push everyone along for things that much less irritating, nor the fact that she’s rewarded in the end for being selfish. She’s cute and marketable though, so I guess Sunrise succeeded somewhere.  Umi, her closest friend, is probably one of the best characters for being generally level headed and being the Only Sane Girl in a lot of cases, and her moment near the end in calling out Honoka was a highlight, but aside from a miniskirt line that reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist, not much about her really stood out with me.  Kotori is mostly passable. She has two separate dramas, both of which are pulled out of nowhere and resolved quite cleanly. Not much of an issue the first time, very much so the second. Seeing her pursue her own passion and not be led back by Honoka’s selfish one would’ve been a more interesting setup for a possible season 2, but her character is generally fine.  Rin and Hanayo are basically pretty decoration (also merchandise). They get one episode of their own, which wasn’t bad, but then disappear completely. Rin also has the shy girl thing Kotori already covered. Moving on.....  To cover both Maki and Eli at the same time, both of them were against the whole idea of idol performances at first, and had me worrying that they would be seen as Strawmen. For those who don’t know, a Strawman is someone so steadfast in being wrong that they can easily be defeated by our protagonists. But in actuality, they actually had some of the best character growth of the bunch. Maki especially, the ending of Episode 10 was another highlight for the series thanks to her revelation. Eli annoyed me a lot at first in how much she seemed to be against them, and while her reason for developing felt a bit too convenient yet separate from idol-ing, her being a more big sister coach near the end was a bright spot and she was tied up well.  Nico, despite being infamous for her annoying meme catchphrase, was probably one of the better characters overall. She had a strong personality, and her point on memorable personas was pretty solid, even if it (and hiding in public) never amounted to anything of consequence. Props to Erica Mendez in the dub for giving her a lot of expression.  Ending off with my least favorite, Nozomi. She was by far the hardest to like. Not for being a stealth mentor, that’s something I can buy, but for basically being a gag machine. One gag. Specifically. That being, squeezing boobs of the girls as punishment. It became her only character thing for a while and the One Squeeze gag was not funny the first time yet was consistently repeated to my annoyance. Gotta have that fanservice right?  Everyone else was basically there to preach idolism, whenever it called for it. It was a solid effort to try and develop so many main characters, but I don’t think it paid off, as with some exceptions most show as pretty faces on toys more than anything else.  However, speaking of pretty, gosh darn it this show can look great in the best of times. Mecha oriented Studio Sunrise took the reins for an idol series, and when it wants to, the show really shines. Lots of bright colors, polished character designs, a large variety of different outfits, some gorgeous view shots and even the CGI used for the dancing is relatively high quality. Only real catch with the visuals, basic character designs being a minor thing, is the constant switch between 2D to 3D during the idol performances. I didn’t like when Luck & Logic did the switches for no reason and I’m not a fan of it here either. It’s jarring, and plays a weird eye trick on me when they change back and forth. Still though, great animation and pretty colors, adds to the image.  What’s more disappointing is the soundtrack. I get that I’m not really an idol fan, but aside from the OP, no particular showcase track really stood out at all. Maybe I’d have to relisten to them, but even Kyoukai no Kanata’s 1 idol song was more memorable than any of these. They weren’t bad, they did their job, just didn’t leave a strong impression which is disappointing for a music anime. The ED is perfectly fine and listenable, same for the background music. As for the dub, we have some solid performances from Erica Lindbeck as Eli, who brings an air of maturity to the role, Caitlin Glass as Maki, and even though I could be annoyed with Honoka’s character at times, relative newbie Marieve Herington captures just enough energy to make her cute in the best of times. Again, special mention to Erica Mendez for capturing the personality in Nico’s character. Everyone else did fine, nothing exceptional but nothing outright bad.  Conclusion  So, after all of this, would I consider Love Live a sellout? In some ways yes. The plot is incredibly shallow and sometimes forced, it relies a lot on pushing current trends to be a follower and the characters aren’t too much to show for, but I can’t deny that, once in a while, the show had an honest to god sweet moment, a moment where I excepted depth comes into play, or a charming scene. Despite how simplistic everything was, my enjoyment was decently high for a while. Then when the end drama sprouted its way into the final three episodes, I became annoyed more than anything else. Annoyed with what I saw unfold, creating substantial pathos before quickly having it brushed aside. It became a lot harder to emphasize with Honoka, and it didn’t end well for me despite the ending being sweet. Love Live has earnest effort, at times I can see that, but with exception to some moments and characters, feels misguided, perfectly in the norm, and hard to distinguish otherwise. It’s a show that failed to have me engaged and sadly fell too close to the disinterest that kept me away from it for so long.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! School Idol Project;ratchet573;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ratchet573;6;"Love Live is everything you think it is from the outset. It’s a high school drama centered on a group of adorable girls becoming idols. It’s nothing new, it doesn’t strive to change the game; yet it still manages to beat the competition as far as I’m concerned. And I’m not familiar with all the competition because I’m not a huge fan of this slice of life/music genre that seems to have cropped up after the success of that one episode of Haruhi Suzumiya and the massive success of K-On. All I know of is the first season of K-On, which is massively hyped up. I reviewed it pretty decently though and in retrospect…I think it’s because I’m a sucker for this moe garbage. I fall for the cute girls just as easily as the rest and even when reviewing some titles I seem to relax my rating because I enjoyed following the cute girls as they do cute things. I’m pathetic, I know.  Why am I admitting my being a moe blob? Because that’s how I get caught up in these types of anime. My thinking that Azusa was adorable got me watching K-On. My thinking Nico was cute got me watching Love Live. And while Azusa was my favorite character from K-On, Nico is actually not my favorite character from Love Live because she’s kind of a bitch. But that’s beside the point…  Love Live has the same type of set-up as many of these high school drama-y anime. Just like K-On, we follow an idealistic, loud, clumsy, and annoying girl. In Love Live, she decides to start an idol group due to the popularity of these groups around Japan. It’s all a last ditch effort to save her high school which could possibly shut down. She recruits her two best friends, a very boring moe girl named Kotori and the super shy girl, Umi. Umi doesn’t want to perform in a short skirt because that’s embarrassing. Meanwhile, she wears the school’s uniform skirt that, in reality, would be as effective a piece of clothing as not wearing a skirt at all.  They face all kinds of obstacles such as a really unsavory girl named Nico and a student council president who keeps pushing them aside.  Story-wise, it’s nothing new. The only real plus I can give the story is the fact that the girls actually practice. There are lots of parts that have nothing to do with practicing but the sheer fact that we are given a group of competent girls that are actually trying to succeed at what they are doing makes the anime more enjoyable and gives the audience more reason to invest themselves in the group and hope to see them succeed.  That being said, this is a music anime and I believe that every music anime I’ve ever reviewed I’ve stated one thing:  NOT ENOUGH MUSIC!  This is the exception. Love Live contains a surprising amount of music. This is an equivalent to America’s High School Musical so it better well have some goddam music. But unlike High School Musical, we’re not subjected to Ashley Tisdale’s nose, which makes this anime a big plus in my book. We’re also not subjected to understandable lyrics, which is probably why I enjoy the music of these types of shows. Let’s face it; the music in Love Live is garbage. It’s bubblegum pop, the kind of stuff you’d expect teenaged girls to write. The meaningless lyrics and nonsensical English words or phrases thrown in are a staple of these types of songs. But it’s what you’d expect from sixteen year old girls and I guess that makes it alright. Start: Dash is pretty catchy and while none of the music may be memorable, at least there is enough of it going around that you get excited for the next piece.  That being said, the music is accompanied by an idol performance most of the time. The animation of this show is usually pretty good with very adorable girls, great backgrounds, and good movement. But the issue comes with these dance performances that become very shoddy CGI mixed with traditional animation sequences. While the animation looks good, the sudden use of something akin to Miku Miku Dance is frustratingly out of place and gaudy. I don’t know who decided to change the style, but fire that person for season two. Please. No more computer animation.  Even with a big cast of really likeable and adorable characters it still fails to impress with anything new. Every character is a stereotypical something-or-other. You have the tomboy, the tsundere (really two of them), the well-to-do upper classman, the pervert, the ditzy leader, the shy and fraidy-cat friend, and the girl with very little personality. Working together, these characters are fun despite some having very little depth. The show does give most of them a good amount of focus and fleshes them out a bit, but they’re, once again, typical. The development they’re given is the usual.  Now for some smaller tidbits of hate: Why do all Russian girls in anime and manga have to be ballerinas? I’m looking at you Black Lagoon, Love Live, and Gunslinger Girl. Also, why the beach episode? If one episode contributed nothing to the anime as a whole it was the beach episode. Also, the drama at the end regarding Kotori was forced and very predictable. The entire outcome was extremely easy to see from a mile away because the same plot device has been used before to the same effects.  So where does that leave Love Live? Despite the story’s predictability, the characters predictability, and the MMD style dancing, it’s still highly enjoyable. Watching this band of girls come together and work hard to attain a dream is actually kind of heart-warming. The pacing is a little rough and the music isn’t the best but there’s a good amount of music and a good amount of fun to be had. It’s not an anime to be taken seriously, you hop on this ride to meet some new friends and enjoy their interactions and triumphs. It’s no masterpiece by any stretch, but for what it is, it’s a good, though flawed, anime.";Mixed Feelings
4;Love Live! School Idol Project;Richard-kun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Richard-kun;5;"I finished watching this anime with a friend on new year's eve, and while she liked it, I was less impressed. Before Christmas I had just finished watching Sword Art Online II and Akame Ga Kill, so after Christmas I was still at a high from those two amazing anime. So maybe it's because I'm comparing it too heavily to other anime, but 'Love Live! School Idol Project' did not impress me very much.  Story - The story was clear and concise. Save the school from closing down by starting a school idol group as a publicity stunt. While it was easy to follow, it was also easy to predict. The show gave little in surprises or excitement and was just too basic for my liking. But I must commend them for staying on track. A short anime like this has to stay on track, because they don't have time for fillers and side stories. While the story was basic for my liking, I must admit there were times when I enjoyed the simplicity, when I knew what was going to happen, and it happened, it was kind of refreshing and I could sit back and enjoy the show.  Art - The art in this show is beautiful. 'Love Live! School Idol Project' is a slice of life anime, and therefore you can't expect real artistic spectacles like unique settings or amazingly detailed weapons or spaceships. It is standard for this genre; school, arcades, modern towns and students. The show is detailed though, and you don't get any faceless people in the crowd which is nice. The only place this anime really stands out in terms of art is the character design. I am not going to hide it, I thought the girls were stunning! They all had lovely hair and each girl had a different colour which distinguished the members of the group nicely. It was also clear that they were drawn with the purpose of being attractive, that typical pretty school girl look you get in a lot of slice of life anime. I would also like to commend the show's artists and directors for omitting panty shots, this show manages to avoid fanservice and for that I thank them. It really is unnecessary.  Sound - There isn't much to say on this. I watched the subbed version, and so the Japanese voices were the same old voices you get in anime. The girls all sounded fairly similar, young and cute and girly with few exceptions. The voice acting was on par, and I have no complaints there. The music was pretty good, not to my taste, but if you like the genre of music, idol music, then you'll probably like this. Personally I preferred the music in shows like Kids On The Slope and K-On! but hey that's just me. The music was catchy and upbeat and so no complaints there either.  Character - I rated the characters a 5 because I felt they were way too shallow. Love Live! is only a 13 episode anime, so maybe that was the reason, but I felt they could have developed the characters further. I feel like I hardly know them. Not a single character had back story and the only way we got to know them was through their interactions with the other members of the Idol group during the course of the anime.  Enjoyment - It was alright. Like I said in my introduction, I wasn't very impressed. I would only recommend this show to people who had expressed to me that they like idols or are really into music anime. But other than that, there's no reason to watch this show. It was a fun ride, with a few laughs here and there and the way the girls smiled throughout most of the anime had me smiling as well. Those damn contagious smiles :D  Overall - I am rating the show a 5 for mediocre. It's nothing special, but also it does do it's job. It's an idol show, and so people who like idols and the music that goes with it probably don't care that the story is generic and the characters are shallow.";Mixed Feelings
5;Love Live! School Idol Project;TheAnimeXpert;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAnimeXpert;6;"A review about a GREAT anime. Recommend reading the whole review.  When I first heard about Love Live! School Idol Project, the name got me going. Is it a romance anime or a idol anime (maybe even both). Turns out it's just a idol anime.  Story: 3 I got into the anime very quickly after the first two episodes. They were what kept me watching, they were definitely not boring and didn't lack of many attributes that keep the audience from getting bored. Mainly the anime's structure was definitely strong in an interesting way. Love live didn't have an amazing story line as it fell off near the middle of the anime drastically and went nowhere but somethings kept me from watching it. The idol group (Muse) kept pursuing their dreams and becoming better while recruiting more members to their group. Muse's goal is to become popular, famous and successful, and hopefully one day surpass Arise (idol group) in the ranking ladder. Just that thought in mind was really exiting and i couldn't wait to watch every other episode.  Art: 7 The art is not so unique that you can recognize too easily from other anime's. What makes an anime's art work good is when it's original. I just feel like this art-style is being overused. Doesn't go too much into details.   Sound: 9 Sound is the strongest part of this anime. Stunning! Obviously, it's an idol anime. But this takes a step further from other idol. When the characters sing, it's so good it gives me the goose bumps! The reason i gave it a 9 was sometimes, the characters sound a little over-exaggerated and doesn't fit all too well with a certain character, but rarely. I really have not much to say other than ""great!"".  Character: 6 The characters are very unique from each other. Giving the anime a lot more space of room to toy with because there are 9 different characters! The main important characters are Honoka, Kotori, and Umi. The rest are more of a side character but are each a big contribution to the idol group and the series with each character being important in an episode.  Enjoyment: 7 Enjoyable in two different aspects, comedy and singing. Love live gives me a smile in my face when i'm watching because in each episode there is something funny and not all anime's have that. The Singing is a big factor when reviewing this anime because it is an idol based anime. Each music is great, and they really mean a lot when singing.   OVERALL: 6.4 Didn't read because it was too long? Summary: -Story:3. Had a good start but fell off in the middle of the series. Didn't have a good an original goal.  - Art:7. Was good but wasn't original. It was good when it transitioned into 3d models when performing concerts but didn't have too much shading, effects...etc.  -Sound:9. Obviously an idol anime would put itself in a good position when graded with sound. Really good and i can't get enough of their sound tracks!  -Character:6. Each character part-took a good role in each episode leaving no characters mysterious and successfully gave each characters a good personality. Lacked of giving character with more time.  Enjoyment:7. Love live gave one more thing just than an idol singing. Comedy. Each end of an episode would leave me with a good smile and wanting to watch more.";Mixed Feelings
6;Love Live! School Idol Project;Yuni;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yuni;6;"Disclaimers: Spoilers, this review covers the Love Live! School Idol Project anime series, which means season 1, 2, and the movie, and this review will be a bit more personal than your typical review. This review is also long as fuck, and there will be a spoiler free TL;DR at the end.  Love Live sucks major balls.  Upon viewing my profile, one would probably witness a few Love Live memes here and there, a shit ton of Love Live characters in my favorites list, and possibly a Love Live profile picture, although I constantly change it so it depends. Seems like a typical Love Live fag to most people. However, believe it or not, I think Love Live is pretty god damn bad. Or at least, I thought. If anything, the only things that I actively like about it are the characters, usually because they are extremely entertaining, endearing, and lovable (with the exception of one character, which I will get to later.) The story of Love Live is mediocre at best, and one could argue that the story is completely garbage. With cliche and cringey moments, overly sappy melodrama, and with uneven character development to boot, one shouldn’t watch Love Live for a quality story. I can’t really say anything about the music of Love Live, since music is like the most subjective thing in the world, but I don’t like most idol music. There are only a few songs that I can listen to multiple times, but most of the time, I can barely sit through the songs even once. The art and animation are subpar as well, especially when the camera zooms out and the characters become barely recognizable sketches. So why do I still like Love Live so much, despite all the shit that it has?  After a VERY lackluster first season, I sat down and reflected on the past 4 hours that I wasted on this show and thought to myself: holy shit, I had a good time. Why is it that such a flawed story is able to leave me in such a satisfied state? No way is it because “it’s so bad that it’s good,” nor is it because “you’re a dirty memer Yuni, and Love Live is full of dirty memes.” I came to the conclusion that it’s because of how memorable Love Live as a franchise is. Despite my cringey experience watching the first season, I found myself thinking about Love Live constantly afterwards, and not about how bad the drama was handled or how gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but of how catchy that one song I actually liked was or how… gimmicky and cliche the characters were, but in a good way! I would then get flashbacks to a random scene, such as Kotori acting like a foreigner, Nozomi fondling little boobs, or Honk Honk doing the seal clap in episode one. Little scenes like that, although usually just comedic skits or filler, gave me such great satisfaction that I felt like it was worth sitting through Honoka dying on stage for no reason. Even so, I still wasn’t ready to say that I liked Love Live at the time. I simply liked a few of the scenes, a few of the characters, and a few of the songs. Everything else was still meh.  Then Season 2 reared it’s ugly head and that’s when my heart felt all the doki dokis. When it comes to “sequels that drastically improve the franchise’s quality,” people always think of Clannad After Story, or maybe Little Busters Refrain. I’d like to add Love Live 2nd Season to that list, for I never knew a sequel could change my opinion of a franchise so quickly. Not only was the drama much more tolerable, but it made me fall in love with the cast so hard, that even the ones I borderline hated during season 1 were perfect angels in my eyes. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever loved a cast this much since Aria. And I fucking adore Aria. Then there was the movie, which not only depicted Manhattan pretty goddamn well (I’m a New Yorker), but it also sent off μ's the same way they were introduced to us: with a long drawn out bang.  Story:  Love Live seems like your typical “AH! Dire situations and sparks of inspiration cause me to drag my friends into something out of the ordinary, something that causes us to start out as underdogs as well slowly rise to the top through the power of friendship!” kind of story, and that’s basically what it is at the surface level. However, by the end of the story, the viewer doesn’t give a fuck about whether or not μ's is gonna succeed in their next concert, instead, they are desperately holding on to their doki doki-ing hearts in anticipation and preparing themselves for the inevitable: Honk Honk, here comes the feels train! This is what causes Love Live to be labeled as a completely clone of K-On, a show where a group of girls are in a similar situation: they want to do something out of the ordinary and strive to improve, however the story really isn’t about that life. It’s all about the passage of time, and Love Live makes it extremely apparent in its narrative that time is not only limited, but running out FAST! This is what separates Love Live from the other passage of time anime, as while K-On and Aria are taking their time sipping tea and rowing gondolas, Love Live is dancing along at a breakneck speed. The thing about passage of time anime is that it’s really only effective if you love the characters. Both K-On and Aria start out with their characters in a very friendly environment, with all of the characters being lovable from the start and the only conflict resulting from the natural clashes between their personalities, such as Azu-nyan being put off by Yui’s laziness, or Alice being mad at Akari’s lack of IQ. Also keep in mind that passage of time anime usually have a manageable cast of main characters, with K On having 5 and Aria having 3 (4 if you count Alicia, and 6 if you count the other fairies).  However, Love Live has a massive 9 main characters, some of which were outright hostile cockblockers during their introduction. You would think it would be impossible for a story to take 9 characters, some of which are shown to be bitches, and somehow make them lovable by the end. That’s what I thought too at the end of season 1, where I was only fond of a select few characters. This is a big reason why season 1 was a fairly lackluster season, it failed to properly show that appeal of some of the characters. This isn’t solely due to the fact that some characters were prioritized over others, it also has to do with how poorly the drama was handled. The words that come to mind are: overly exaggerated, sappy, bullshit. The realism in Love Live is non existent, but that is to be expected. Anyone who expects realism in a show like Love Live needs to get a reality check. That doesn’t change how unnecessarily over the top some of the drama during the first season was, as well as how unbelievable some of the drama was resolved. Even if realism is limited, it still has to be believable, or at least, not bullshit.  What the 1st season does correctly is a few instances of character drama surrounding a few particular characters, those being Honk, Kotori, Nico, and Eli. For Honk, her extremely typical main character attitude actually works against her in scenarios that other anime would write as beneficial. For example, her focus on competing in Love Live actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends instead of strengthening them, and while some events surrounding this drama and the resolution are iffy, it still gets the job done. Kotori also breaks the mold when she goes against what her character trope would normally do: hurt her best friend. Usually depicted as the typical friendly deredere, Kotori was revealed to actually be a very conflicted character whose problems end up hurting those she loves, which is contradictory to her normal character. Both Nico and Eli are also fleshed out as characters who chased their dreams and failed, which shapes them into the hostile characters that they were introduced as, and while Nico's hostility was shown to just be natural, Eli's hostility was much deeper, albeit the resolution was stupid. Love Live's major problem in season 1 is that the drama is there, and for the most part it isn't exactly bad drama, but it has absolutely no idea how to either execute or resolve it in a believable way.  Hmm, it would appear that Honoka is very ill and not exactly in a good state to sing and dance. What do? The overly protective Kotori and the wiser Umi would stop Honoka from over exerting herself, causing the performance to be cancelled, the fans to be disappointed, and Honoka would learn her lesson and taste what disappointing her fans would be like. That would be some nice development for her character! But wait, that’s not what actually happens. What actually happens is that Honoka insists on performing, so she does. Honk has run out of PP for her dance moves! Honk used Struggle! Honk hurt herself in recoil. Honk fainted. And that leads to Honk being a depressed crybaby, μ's dropping out of Love Live, Honk nearly quitting the school idol thing, only to get bitch slapped by Umi, which leads to Honk not being a crybaby, which leads to literally no one learning anything and Honk continues to do stupid shit cause why not.  So Season 1 ends with μ's saving the school, and μ's miss their chance to compete in Love Live. Oh well, beggers can’t be choosers right? At least they completed their initial goal! As a result of her efforts, Season 2 starts with Honk being chosen to be the student council president. While this seemed like an unnecessary thing to do, this was the beginning of Love Live’s redemption! It’s all (mostly) positivity from here on out! Remember when I said that Love Live is a passage of time show? The moment Honk becomes student council president marks the beginning of this theme. While subtle, it did expand on the running out of time problem, as being the student council prez resulted in a lot of schedule conflicts between idol practice and council work. But wait, idol practice? What are they practicing for? A 2nd Love Live has been announced! With saving the school out of the way, μ's can finally focus on their real goal.  It is here, pretty early on in season 2, that it is made clear that time is running out. This pressure of time, first mentioned when it is made clear that the 3rd years are graduating soon, is constantly brought up, both within the show itself and within the viewer’s minds. At first it’s through subtle things, such as the previously mentioned schedule conflicts of being the student council prez, resulting in usually humorous but still important bickerings between Honk and Umi. A sense of responsibility is placed on Honok’s shoulders, as a leader of the school and of μ's.  Season 2 also makes it clear that time is passing by through the use of specific events, such as Halloween, Christmas, New Years, etc. Many episodes in Season 2 are based around these timed events, and result in a not-so subtle flow of time. By the way, the Halloween episode is one of my favorites, as it has some of my favorite skits in the entire series. Season 2 also uses this time to flesh out characters that didn’t have much spotlight in season 1, and while these moments of character development were touching, it was all the characters and their interactions with each other that made me adore every single member. Time didn’t just flow, it helped the girls grow to love each other. Episode after episode, you could tell that their friendship was subtly growing, and it’s all about the little things. Maki agreeing with Honk sometimes, Eli and Nozomi showing their more innocent and sensitive sides to their kouhais, even the most humorous of skits showed that the teamwork and bond between the girls of μ's were ever growing.  While the urgency of time running out is at first caused by μ's trying to do something before a deadline, eventually it became much deeper than that. While the story kept its style of μ's trying to get something done before a specific time, it became clear that both the characters and the viewers were actually bracing for the real deadline: the time when the 3rd years would graduate, and μ's would be split apart. This is what the entire series was building up towards. As the cliche line goes, all good things must come to an end. Even the mightiest of rivers empty out into the calm endless sea. Even a floating leaf in the wind will land someday. Whatever sappy phrase you want to use, this theme is so especially present in Love Live that it’s undeniably powerful. In fact, μ's spent so much of their time bracing themselves for this inevitable end that they didn’t even realize that they were missing an important answer: what do they want their end to be?  This is the entire theme of the finale, the movie. The movie is the perfect mix of cute grills doing cute things, cute grills dancing in cute ways, and borderline psychological drama. It even has hints of supernatural elements, which were used in very effective albeit confusing ways. After becoming much more famous than she could ever imagine, with expectations placed on every part of her being, Honk’s internal conflicts were at an all time high. To a normal viewer, the right answer isn’t clear at all. In fact, many people could have different answers when placed in Honk’s situation. There really is no right or wrong answer, and the decision that μ's came to at the end wasn’t right or wrong either. It was simply what they wanted. And that’s how the passage of time works. A very straight forward story, with a not so straightforward and possibly even thought provoking end. Even so, despite the melancholic passing of time and the internal conflicts, the ending was ultimately a positive one, and I can’t help but feel the ultimate satisfaction.  Characters:  Easily my favorite part of the franchise, as well as probably the make or break for anyone watching Love Live. To some, they are simply gimmicks and memes who are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and to others, they are precious waifus that we must protect from any sort of harm. What do I think? I think they are precious gimmicky memes that are mildly entertaining once in awhile, and must be protected from any sort of harm. So of course I will be going through all of them.  Hanayo: Despite the fact that she's at the bottom of my list, Hanayo is probably the most well written character in LL in terms of characterization. The point of school idols is that any normal girl can be one, and that's the whole theme surrounding Hanayo. She doesn't stand out at all, in terms of personality nor appearance. As a result, she views school idols as an unreachable goal and worships them from afar. The fact that Hanayo joined Muse in the first place is a groundbreaking development for the group and idol shows as a whole, for it highlighted the whole point of school idols. Also, her rice obsession is one of the most relatable parts of the show. As a Chinese person, rice is my entire being.  Rin: My appreciation for this character is always exponentially increasing. Rin is insecurities personified into a tomboy cat character. Unlike Hanayo, Rin has had experiences of standing out too much, having being teased for her femininity despite her short hair and boyish attitude. This caused Rin to embrace this boyish attitude and energy in order to separate herself from her insecurities. Rin was very hesitant in joining Muse since being school idols is hella girly and she feel like her lack of femininity will cause her to bring the group down. However, her joining the group ends up helping her come to terms with her insecurities, and her episode was one of the most heartfelt episodes in the series.  Maki: Maki's tsundere personality comes off less as a mental illness and more of a result of her upbringing. Due to being a sheltered rich girl, Maki isn't a tsundere cause she's mean, but because she's socially retarded lol. However, joining Muse helped her shed her awkward self contained self, and Maki is one of the few tsunderes who returns the favor to those who helped her break out of her shell. After being coaxed out by her senpais, Maki thanks them by helping Nozomi come out of her shell as well, and she made Nico out of all people cry. Her personality is also very similar to mine, as a withdrawn socially awkward yet passive aggressive sasser who isn't afraid to look down on you if you piss her off. I also share some frustrations she has when it comes to songwriting, for I am a songwriter myself, and I also say ""what the fuck was that"" a lot.  Honk: Honk is one of the more well written genki lead characters, due to the fact that her genkiness isn't one dimensional nor predictable. Her genkiness isn't always positive, as some of the time it's actually her own selfishness, and her overly determined nature actually ends up damaging her relationship with her friends. Honk isn't the perfect happy go lucky person she appears to be, as she is almost constantly internally conflicted and ends up coming off as an asshole more often than not due to her selfishness. Of course, Honk isn't the most consistent character, as her IQ switches between 1 and 100 constantly, but she's definitely deeper than what people give her credit. What makes her relatable in this regard is that she means well, and most of the time doesn't even know she's selfish. This also creates GREAT conflict drama between her, Kotori, and Umi, as Honk's characterization isn't just due to her own characteristics, but also her two closest friends.  Kotori: Kotori comes off as your typical airhead deredere, except she does what no other deredere is capable of doing: absolutely destroying her best friend's feelings. Her tendency to spoil Honoka is seen as cliche by many, for many think it's cause she's too nice of a character, but it's actually her own selfishness that is causing her to be so nice. Her refusal to hurt her friend's feelings isn't just cause she wants the best for her, but because she is too conflicted and unwilling to break bad news. Due to her selfish refusal of doing the right thing, her niceness actually ends up hurting Honoka even more than she could ever have imagined. Kotori is seen depressed more than people think, and her habit of putting on a deredere demeanor isn't because she cares, but because of her own flaws and conflicts.  Umi: Umi on the other hand is the opposite of Kotori. She calls Honk out on her bullshit constantly, and her tough love is a turn off to many. People view her as a sociopath due to her constant bullying of Honoka, but due to being brought up by Asian parents, I see the true intent behind Umi's savage nature. Umi's anger and unstable emotions show me that Umi probably loves her friends more than anyone else. She isn't afraid to completely fuck someone up if it's for their own good. Of course, since Umi is a hardcore dandere, she can have her fair share of selfish moments, but in the end, no one gives more shits than Umi does, even if it looks like she's gives no shits about your feelings.  Eli: A phenomenally multi dimensional character, a lot of flaws surrounding Eli are actually the story's fault. Eli is the ultimate cockblock in the beginning, and boy did I hate her. This made her redemption as a character all the more heartfelt, as I ended up loving Eli by the end. While the story portrayed her as a stern white knight, who's reasons for despising Muse is due to her lack of confidence in them when it comes to saving the school, it eventually became clear that Eli's distaste actually stems from her stubbornness and pride. As an ex-professional dancer, she views Muse's activities as mere games and looks down upon them constantly. The flaw behind her eventual opening up is that the members of Muse were way too lenient with her. This bitch thinks y'all are trash and you're gonna forgive her just like that? Yeah. Again, this isn't due to Eli's character, this is due to Season One's atrocious writing.  Nozomi: Nozomi takes the spotlight as one of the easiest characters to like, both from a characteristic and development stand point. She's the smug mastermind. Her Washi washi may turn off a lot of people, but hey, the author is a Yuri author. Cut her some slack. What made Nozomi even more likeable was when her past was revealed. Nozomi used to be extremely shy, contrary to her extremely calculative nature we see now. Her friendship with Eli and their close bond is what caused Nozomi to transform into what she is now, and that's just a testament to the canon ship that is NozoEli. Seeing Nozomi open up to the rest of Muse and allowing her true shy nature to slip in once in a while humanizes her exponentially.  Nico: Nico is the most controversial character. Very rarely do you see someone who thinks Nico is ""alright."" Nico will usually find herself on the very bottom or the very top of people's rankings. I'm one of the latter, Nico is one of my best girls, but my reasons for liking this monstrosity is different from most people. My reason doesn't just boil down to ""she's funny"" or ""she's a meme."" First of all, let's be honest: Nico is a fucking piece of shit human being. She's the type of person you'd block on all social media outlets. A real life Nico would have no friends, and I learned that the hard way. You see, Nico is a character that chased her dreams with everything she had, and failed. She didn't fail because ""the world is unfair."" No, Nico deserved to fail. Nico failed because she failed to see how selfish she was, pushing people beyond their limits without them wanting to. She failed because being a school idol is a team effort and she only thought of herself. The reason she failed is nobody's fault but her own. As someone who's been chasing their dreams for ages, experiencing failure after failure and blaming it on the world, only to slowly realize that I'm the one who's failing myself, seeing this part of Nico made me cry. Not gonna lie, this side of Nico destroyed me. It didn't help that when I was younger, I was also very foul mouthed and hot tempered. I'm one of those real life Nicos. Nico's shitty personality persisted throughout the series, such as lying to her siblings to make her look good and disrespecting the rest of Muse. That's because leaving behind your selfish self is hard. Extremely hard. Nico's flaws lasted all the way till the end of the series, and hell, she was still an annoying shitter at the end, but that's cause this is realism. People don't change at the drop of the hat, and some people don't change at all, but Nico still accepted it and tried to change till the very end. Nico's determination is honestly inspiring, and that drew me to her character as well.  Nico is one badass motherfucker.  A cast full of characters that naturally clash with each other, yet even so, they grow with each other to the point where every single character is irreplaceable. The characters bicker with each other constantly, yet their contrasting personalities somehow work with each other. In fact, the characters themselves realize that their drastically different personalities are what make them stand out from other idol groups, and it is because of how irreplaceable every single member of μ's is that causes them to disband their group at the end of the series.  Art and Animation:  CG is distracting, and while Love Live’s CG is much better than your typical anime, it’s still, well, distracting. This is especially so during some concert scenes when it rapidly switches between 2d and 3d animation. However, I’ve witnessed some horrible CG in my life, so I grew to appreciate Love Live’s relatively tolerable CG. The 2d animation and art during the actual show isn’t very impressive either. While the character designs by themselves are goofy in their own way and eventually grew on me, the animation and art quality is very inconsistent, ranging from pretty good to downright despicable at times. This is especially apparent during scenes where the camera zooms out, and the characters become barely recognizable sketches, with weirdly scaled facial features and bodies.  One thing that Love Live excels at however are the facial expressions. These goddamn facial expressions are golden, and are used to support both comedic and serious situations. There is a lot of emotion behind these facial expressions, and you can tell what a character is thinking just by looking at their face. You can tell when Eli is done with someone’s bullshit just by looking at her unamused stare. Even the characters are able to react to situations based on another character’s facial expression, such as Kotori constantly wrecking Umi in cards due to Umi’s lack of a poker face, or Nico knowing that her boobies are in for a rough time due to Nozomi’s rape face. The majority of Honk’s silly nature is expressed through her facial expressions, such as her seal clapping and her amazing expression after getting flicked in the forehead by Nico. You can also see the build up before someone starts breaking down into tears, first by their obvious attempts at holding back the tears, until finally you are greeted with the ugliest crying face ever.  Music:  What makes the music in Love Live unique is that only people who watched the show will probably listen to the music. Idol music is very niche and before watching Love Live, I wasn’t into idol music whatsoever. I thought it was too simple and too cringey. While I still think that way about most idol music, there are a few songs that I actually listen to a decent amount nowadays, and not because they are different from the usual idol music in the show, but because of the context behind the pieces.  Songs like Snow Halation and START DASH!! didn’t appeal to me by themselves, but once I witnessed the context behind those two pieces in the show, I started to like them. Also, Love Live uses its idol music in ways that if you like the show and the story, you will like the music. Stuff such as using the OP theme of the first season as the encore for μ's’s “final” concert, and using Aishiteru Banzai, a song we heard in the first episode and a personal fave of mine, as the graduation music in the final episode of Season 2. Love Live puts a lot of emotional connection to a lot of would-be average songs, and that’s what makes Love Live’s music memorable in the end.  Reflection:  Love Live is bad and you should feel bad, but feeling bad has never felt so good. Easily one of the most satisfying series I’ve ever watched, Love Live fulfills a lot of simple wishes, such as seeing a group of friends start from humble beginnings and becoming international stars, seeing even the coldest of bitches open their hearts to become lovable characters, stuff like that. Stuff that has been done over and over again, but for some reason you especially want it to happen to these 9 girls. And then after an emotional scene, they bring it full circle with the first song you ever hear. Stuff like that makes the first time watching it unforgettable, and makes the first time rewatching it that much more spectacular.  At least, that’s what happened to me. Not everyone will experience the same things I did, in fact, most of you probably won’t. However, Love Live is definitely one of those shows that has the possibility of changing your life. When you ask for better or worse, I’d probably have to lean towards the latter, for some people then fall into the idol hell known as School Idol Festival, and I hear that there is no escaping that place. And even if you don’t get your life changed, at least you indulged in some top quality memes.  TL;DR:  Story: Love Live sucks balls, way too sappy and melodramatic. However, it eventually drops this and becomes a passage of time anime to the likes of K-On, and the drama becomes more natural with positive outcomes. Characters: Waifus? Memes? Why not both? A cast of characters that constantly clash with each other, yet eventually become a team where every member feels irreplaceable. Art: CG. And shitty artwork when the camera zooms. Other than that, it’s ok, and the facial expressions make everything daijoubu. Music: Will either make you cringe or cry a river of tears, especially once you know the context behind some of the songs.  Individual Ratings: Love Live! School Idol Project: 4/10 Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season: 7/10 Love Live! The School Idol Movie 7/10  My favorite part of the show: Characters. My least favorite part of the show: How they handled the drama in season 1. And of course, order of grills (Keep in mind that I like all of them): Umi > Honk > Nico > Kotori > Eli > Maki > Rin > Nozomi > Hanayo.  Fun fact! The Love Live franchise as a whole, including Sunshine, has like zero consistency in terms of clothing. Characters randomly change outfits mid scene.";Mixed Feelings
7;Love Live! School Idol Project;Micsupreeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Micsupreeme;6;"Cute girls doing Cute things? To an extent, that was what i expected of this show at a glance, but i was pleasantly surprised to find a notable depth; a captivating depiction of ""idol"" life.  I was drawn in by the music; which combined with the immaculate artwork gives Love Live some of the best anime audiovisuals ever. As for the way everything pans out, the show is generally quite upbeat, though very capable of heartwarming and emotional moments too.  This inspirational (in the classic anime way) journey of a few ordinary high school girls attempting to reach the top ranking of idol bands is a motivational and uplifting one; and it combines casual SoL elements with a very set-in-stone goal that gives the show its purpose, and the viewers, their reason to keep watching.  In many ways, this is a delicate anime: as one will find from the malleable emotions of the characters, and the well studied approach from U's perspective. This allows the show to be taken more seriously, and break the mold of stereotypical idol series'. Not to imply of course that Love Live defies convention - as it doesn't, though this isn't a restraint.  Moving over to the show's ability to move its audience... Love Live invests a significant portion of episode time into enhancing its overall depth, attachment values to the cast, and their friendly chemistry. This is a valiant move for a short series, but It makes the world of difference to the show's personal and sentimental values: enough to render the anime vivid, yet not over baked, cheap, or detracting from its musical infrastructure.  When it comes to 12 and 13 episode anime series', there are those that focus on story, and those that focus on characters; and though i'm certain that Love Live is character based, the story (although unoriginal) does deliver. Its goal oriented simplicity and method does render it very direct, and perhaps leads people to underestimate; though Sunrise had its way and managed to bring about some more gripping moments that really conveyed the seemingly effortless attachment values of Love Live.  Love live is inescapably a cliche, and you know what this implies, but due to its subtly powerful presentation methods, charming and heartwarming atmosphere, it breaks away nicely, and so its a show i wouldn't be embarrassed to share...  But be prepared to share twice, as it's perhaps the most obvious ""hinter"" ever when it comes to announcing its sequel - which, though i won't explain now, is likely to be a must watch for viewers of this series. Why? Well, i just finished this, and i feel like things are just getting started; so a follow up review to its sequel when i get around to it.  Would i recommend Love Live? Well, definitely: now usually i would say WHO i think would enjoy most, but i think that this time around, EVERYONE should give this one a try if they were considering it - as it's a somehow refreshing take on a rehashed premise; and for action junkies, it's an appropriate introduction to the world of casual representation.";Mixed Feelings
8;Love Live! School Idol Project;Werty800;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Werty800;6;"Memes. You love them or you hate them. You live by them and die with them, or just simply don't care. So you can say... you either Love (and) Live or you don't. Thank you everyone, you can leave the death threats in my comment section.  I put a surprisingly large amount of time into thinking about why do I like Love Live's first season. A lot of thoughts ran through my mind, but overtime all the overthinking bullshit, I realized it's as simple as ""I had fun"". Not everyone's going to agree with me, but I think watching happy people be happy and achieve their goals is rewarding. Honoka wanting to save her school, finding people to do that with and all of them becoming more open with themselves and other people evokes exactly that.  Love Live is very much capable of creating happy characters and scenarios. There's the dumb and passionate people like Honoka, Rin and Nico, the collected but silly ones like Eri, Umi, Maki and Nozomi, and the shy but cheerful ones like Hanayo and Kotori, and they all find themselves digging into the stereotypes of a happy school life and being an idol, providing for a bunch of rather calming and relaxing episodes. There's a distinct progression to it all too, with more members and the growing happy, somewhat loud atmosphere of a group of friends overtaking the show more and more. It was happy at the start, but it's the middle where all of the characters get to really showcase themselves in casual situations and embrace that happiness to its fullest.  Aside from that, I also think Love Live's first season has strong moments of characterization for most of the girls, giving them enough personality to be worth following. There's Honoka with her strong resolve that captured me during the first concert of the group at which any normal person would probably give up. There's Eri looking down on idols as a whole due to their lack of actual skill, but after some time understanding that the most important part of being one is the atmosphere and the fun that comes with it. There's Nico and Hanayo with their life-long dreams of becoming idols, with their own reasons as to why those dreams couldn't become reality sooner. Maki with her enclosed style of life opening up due to the passion for music and friendship she develops throughout this season.  Unfortunately there's also Umi, Rin, Nozomi and Kotori. In comparison to the others, they feel empty, and that's really meaningful when you understand that the others aren't really ""full"" either. Umi suffers from being sidelined by Honoka, who's always with her, despite having a rather strong presence in the show it's always easy to forget about her. The opposite goes for Rin, who's basically nonexistent. Like, Rin does not exist. And yes, it is annoying to see her still be around despite being nothing. She has one scene to herself, but then she disappears, doesn't contribute to anything meaningful, any jokes, any cute scenes, anything whatsoever. Nozomi on the other hand, has too many scenes. Too many boob grabbing scenes to be exact. I think the idea of her as a hidden mentor, giving backup when needed, was good. That surely helped with turning Maki and Eri into somewhat realized characters. But on the other hand, we have every scene where she tries to be herself. Those scenes consist of: A. Grabbing boobs B. Threatening to grab boobs That would be about it.  And finally, there's Kotori. Kotori, whose arc was supposed to be the closing one. And oh boy it sure closed with a bang. A bang that would kill the show for a lot of people, that's for sure.  Kotori's arc is bad. It is REALLY bad. Admittedly, it's not only her arc, and that's what makes it even worse. Even before her confession about leaving, we get Honoka pushing herself too hard and getting sick, leading to a gloomy atmosphere in the group. Making Kotori confess her decision in that situation sidetracks both of those seemingly important issues, creates now ones, and making a one huge mess in general. Visibly forced one at that. I mean, this show was so happy before all this, it's like they force all of the drama they had left in their arsenal. Outside of creating a few cool connections to the second season and the movie, which could've been mentioned in a normal, less dramatic ways too, it has very little purpose. At best, it'll make you sad for the characters that you like, but at worst it'll make you hate numerous characters or the show in general. I'd say that's a pretty poor choice to make there to say the least.  And with that being said, I think it's safe to assume that Love Live: The School Idol Project isn't a good show. But do I care? As if. Love Live was very enjoyable for 10 episodes or so out of 13. You think I'm going to give it a low score because of two or three episodes? I've always felt weird when people tell me ""I liked the show, but the ending is why I have it low"". Sure, if it's the artistic quality we're talking about, then by all means, think about it in that context. But this? This is Love Live. It is a meme, it is relaxing fun with cute girls, where would I try to get this value out of? I watch a 13 episodes fun, cute girls show, which was always just that, and then I get both the fun and the cute girls that I think are fun to follow in good doses and so I like it.  On top of that, it is crafted pretty well. The designs for the girls are cute enough, varying in figure, faces, movement, making for fun interactions on the screen. The show looks very pleasant, with tons of bright colors and the nicely fitting uniforms to complement that. The colors just bounced off of each other so nicely that I honestly couldn't stop looking at it.  Then there's the CGI during performances. In all honesty, I'm very glad that the studio decided to do it the way it did. It allowed for much more freedom in the choreography of the performances, and it really shows, there's a lot of movement and the performances look realistic and coordinated. I hear the issue that the jumps between 2D and 3D faces can be jarring, but I never went through that problem, it's pretty clear and obvious that this is how it's going to be, so I took it in pretty fast.  And lastly, the music. The OST is absolutely forgettable background music contributing very little to what's going on. The actual idol songs on the other hand, should be satisfying for anyone new to idols. It's basic stuff, music that you can jump to and wave at a concert. I don't think there were any standouts in particular, but each performance, together with the choreography, made for an entertaining moment in the show, and the songs fit well, especially given their context each time. It gave them that little extra weight.  And with all that, I feel safe in stating that Love Live does its job pretty well, setting up a decent foundation for the second season. It's far from being anything more than satisfying. The ending is just an ending, undermines an entire character for the sake of a finish and can definitely throw people off, giving them low expectations and even making them give up on the series in general, but if that's the case, then I just want to point towards the parts that I believe can be genuinely fun - the first 10 episodes. That's some well crafted cute girls stuff, and if that's what you're looking, then it's waiting for you. And then there's the second season, but that's a different story.  As always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop your own.";Mixed Feelings
9;Love Live! School Idol Project;snakebite9696;https://myanimelist.net/profile/snakebite9696;6;Bear with me - this is my first time reviewing an anime. I tend to show an overall rating too high even if I couldn't even finish the anime - I rated Shakugan no Shana III as a 4 if I remember correctly. But anyway, on to the real topic. Love Live - School idol project. As the name suggests, it is a project done by school idols.  Story - 7 To be honest, I didn't see much wrong with the story. A school is going to close down, so three girls decide to get the school publicity in order to prevent this. So they decide to form an idol group. Of course, I'm obviously missing out some things in that short synopsis of the first few episodes. Then more girls start joining. And this was, in my opinion, this anime's downfall. I'll explain why in the character section though.  Sound - 9 I'm being really biased towards the idol anime genre now. The music was pretty good! Start:Dash was a good song, and the rest of them were also good.  But nothing's perfect.  Art - 6 The design of some characters just didn't seem original. Umi almost looked like Mio from K- On. However, the dancing went with the music. And I think that counts as art. And before I forget - the use of the 3D effects gave an unsuspecting kick to the anime.  Character - 3 (WARNING - prepare for rant) This is the major downfall. Seriously. Characters with more screentime, ideally, should have a well developed backstory. Obviously, because they are main characters. However, if someone joins the main character crew in the middle, they should at least actually be GIVEN a backstory. Rin, for instance. Not one drop of backstory throughout the entire anime. Obviously it was a short anime, but still - if there's no time to add a backstory to a character, why add in the character at all?  Enjoyment - 5 While the music was enjoyable, the actual anime wasn't as good. I enjoy knowing backstories though, so the overwhelming lack of them didn't help.  Overall - 6 Obviously this will appeal to some more than others. But for me, character development is vital for a good anime. And in 13 episodes, 9 characters are not going to be developed. But there is going to be s second season. The question is: will the rest of the characters be developed?  And I shall end this with a recommendation. If you liked Love Live: School Idol Project, trust me. You. Will. ADORE. The iDOLM@STER.;Mixed Feelings
10;Love Live! School Idol Project;TheMortalSoil;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheMortalSoil;6;[STORY]  The story for love live is relatively simple which shouldnt be a surprise since its just a moe anime with the intention of using waifu fan service to get its main success.  It goes like this, our main 3 characters (at the beginning) Honoka,Umi and Kotori find out that their school will be closed down in a year due to not having proper funding or new applicants to justify staying open.  So Honoka comes up with the brilliant plan to become highschool idols to attract new prospective students.  This is despite the fact that none of them have any musical or performance experience at all.  and thats the storyline for the first season, along the way the recruit other girls for their idol group but thats pretty much it.  one thing i will give this series is that unlike other moe anime this series does actually stick to the main storyline pretty well and doesnt drift too much in the name of fanservice and if it does drift it does return to the story pretty quickly.    [ART]   the quality of the art is pretty good i will admit. Its done well enough to be above average but not enough to really stand out all that well.  The character designs arnt anything special but are unique enough to where each character looks different.   [SOUND]   ok so the sound is where this show excells because this is a music anime after all and unlike K-on this music anime actually has music in practice and they actually give performances.  But i will say while the music and choreography is good i dont like the psudo cgi style they are done in. It just doesnt fit but thats my opinion.  The music is idol music so if you dont like upbeat catchy jpop music you probally wont like it but it does the music very well.  [CHARACTER]  ok so there are alot of characters in this show so im gonna limit to the main characters.   Kousaka Honoka: the leader of Muse and main character.......im just gonna be blunt she is a fucking dumbass and its surprising she hasnt accidently killed herself yet.  Minami Kotori: they overly cute character she is cute and innocent......and might have a lama fetish....   Sonoda Umi: dependable but very shy which makes me wonder why she is even in a idol group to begin with........she also has a few yandere esque moments   Koizumi Hanayo : garbage, trash and just unentertaining as a character at all.  Hoshizora Rin: not quite garbage, not quite a dumbass she is just not quite there. She doesnt have any unique traits apart from being into sports   Nishikino Maki: a tsundere and the main songwriter for muse and the fan favorite it seems. Arguably one of the most important characters in the show.   Yazawa Nico: Nico is probally the only person in this entire group who actually wants to be a idol. She has a passion for being a idol where as everyone else doesnt seem to care as much as she does. Also she is very cocky and sneaky which makes her best girl by default.  Ayase Eli: her being in muse makes no sense at all. She spent half the season trying to sabotage the entire group so what do they do? They invite her to join them......cuz that makes sense.   Toujou Nozomi: .....nozomi....ok im convinced this girl is a pedophile pretending to be a student because she is so knowledgable, alot more than a student should be and she molests everyone she can every chance she gets.     [ENJOYMENT]  despite the fact i tend to hate moe shows i honestly enjoyed this show just from the characters alone and to see what stupid decision honoka would make in the next episode.  i wouldnt say its amazing but it wasnt complete shit either.;Mixed Feelings

12;Love Live! School Idol Project;SmartestManAlive;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SmartestManAlive;6;School idol project does as much good as it does wrong. Take that as you will. For the first show of the general love live series, it's pretty well done. Most of the characters are pretty enjoyable and it has a fairly charming pace. The story really isn't anything to write home about, but it's more about the characters. It's cheesy as you'd be expecting for the genre, but it isn't intolerable. It gets better on as the show goes, but it can be a little rough to sit through at times. These times are during the very early CGI which is incredibly jarring to watch. With the tendency to just spring songs and dance numbers out of the blue, the very subpar cgi can make it enough to turn some folks off, which is entirely fair. If you're reading this without having seen love live, go watch episode 1 and then watch the animated video for ku ru ku ru cruller.  Overall, it isn't terrible. I don't know if I'd say anything more than good. It's the weakest show by virtue of being the first and didn't have the refinements or lessons. For that, I really respect just how much they did well on a first try. If you can't sit through this, try Sunshine. It's more or less a retelling of this show with mentions to how it inspired Aqours directly within itself. It's animation is much better, and the characters I personally believe are more charming.

I just finished watching NHK and as I usually like to do, switch off to something light before picking up another heavy show. This being said I never had high expectations of Love Live and knew from the start that it was going to be mediocre and that I was just along to satisfier a cute craving. At first things looked good, with the show making me laugh at several points and a couple characters actually being somewhat appealing. Hoever as the show goes on, it is clear that things get stale. What was once at least a sugary sweet piece of candy loses its charm. The class mate boob grab gag get's overused, one character is literally a cat, and most saddening of all, the music is kinda meh when compared to other tracks I have heard come out the Love Live project. The show even resorts to reusing an old mediocre song as a finale.

Now I know I said its enjoyable, but only if you don't really think about it. (I watched while I waited for my LP to refill)  The plot is a group of girls become idols to save their school. Original really, however I found it extremely unrealistic because everything seemed to go the main girls way, and they all knew how to sing. Its odd seeing nine people extremely talented at singing to the point they don't need to practice. It also was really predictable, I could for see every character who joined, (you can say its because of the opening, but no. Its just predictable.) And it was all shounen anime where every enemy suddenly become friends with the main. Character. Do people even like their school that much? Why does she love that school so much? Is it because her mom went their? Why?!  Art was good since it went between 2D animation and MMD's I think their called. (Though I've seen better quality ones on YouTube.) The songs manage to make me smile and all were fully translated which was nice since I'm big on lyrics.  Despite this being a more anime it wasn't really moe which is odd. K-on which is a similar show I manage to love at least 2 of their characters (Mio and Azunyan) but with I didn't really like any besides Niko and that's just because I managed to relate to her ( my friends blow me off a lot.) Also the main girl everything went her way, it was seriously annoying.  [Spoiler] At the end one of the girls was about to leave and the main chick goes into the airport right as she was about to board the plane (how did she get in?) And talked her into staying. (What happened to the plane ticket? You can't just stop stuf like that. Also she is seriously selfish. I've been told I'm selfish, but I'm selfish in a sense that I do my own thing. I don't mess anyone else's life up. She does something she drags everyone down with her. [Spoiler]  Overall I think this show needs more moe. The only reason I can see someone watching this is so they can play the rhythm game. (It isn't needed but it makes it easier to choose favorites.) The show wasn't funny, moe, or even inspirational. I don't think being a idol would be tough if you can control the weather, and have amazing talent like that, and get everything else you want. Like she screamed at the rain to stop and it did! I'm not even joking. Screw being a idol, be a weather girl. If I had the chance to go back in time and stop myself from watching this I probably would. Yeah watching it is enjoyable but once you get down and think about it you go into this living hell!;Not Recommended
2;Love Live! School Idol Project;renyrells;https://myanimelist.net/profile/renyrells;3;"Lets just say that this show did not live up to the hype or standards that I had been lead to believe.  I knew about the story coming in. A school is shutting down in a couple years due to the lack of enrollment. A group of girls realize that the most popular school also happens to have the most popular school idol group. So their like, ""shoot we can do that. and then the school will be saved."" And then they do that. End of story. the rest of the show is them gathering new members and fighting against the administration who wont let them try to save the school for some reason.  The music in the show is so meh. The songs are well made but that's the problem. These are, in kayfabe, supposed to be high school girls producing a perfectly made song. Also during the performances the animation cuts to some horribly moving cg. Not only does it look bad, but it moves at a different frame rate, or something, than the rest of the show and its a bit shocking every time.  Coming in, I saw that Nico was pretty much the fan favorite. This is not cause she's cool. It is probably because she actually has a character. Shes and the student president are of few in the show that actually do. Everyone else is either very one dimensional or tropey. I think my enjoyment of the show was harmed because I did not like a single character in the show.  By the first couple of songs, which are in universe huge hits, you realize that this is just a product meant to sell merch and not really an anime. It has no interest in being an anime. Once this glass shattered, it becomes very hard to watch the rest of the show. You realize that no conflict will stay a conflict for long and everything will work out. By the end, the show leaves you with a cliffhanger to watch the second season. No thanks.";Not Recommended
3;Love Live! School Idol Project;Marsen-P;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marsen-P;4;"Seeing so many reviews saying the second season is better than the first, I watched both before making this review.  After finishing this show, I have this feeling it could have turned out great.  The art, cute designs and the focus on music attracted me. By the way, the cgi really improved in season 2.   The biggest problem this show has is : the time. The story lasts only a school year, events are rushed. There is no tension at all, every events is one-episode-only. The lack of build-up brings us to another lack : the personality.  While K-on! story takes place on 3years, has only 4 characters to develop with 36 episodes, here, we have 1year, 9 characters and 24 episodes.  The characters lack of personality, some have no personality at all, some others are a duplicate of another one, and some are completely ignored.  Fortunately, 2 characters carry the show. A ""good"" tsundere (maki) and Nozomi. Would you expect to find a Mastermind like Lelouch or Light in a cute school idol show? No. Do you hate it? No. Nozomi is that outstanding. Unfortunately, the episodes without these two are a complete mess.  While some episodes are good, the inconsistency of the show is really bad, that's why, I can't recommend this show.";Not Recommended
4;Love Live! School Idol Project;Jenkki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jenkki;4;"REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS      First let me say, I totally understand why people like this anime. Cute girls doing cute stuff amirite? This was my first idol anime, and frankly I excpected something better.  BUT. I would like to start this review by saying that the plot has some quite big flaws in it, (Aside for it being unrealistic as fuck), for example the time when Umi slapped Honoka to the deepest circles of hell, they just actually made up and never even mentioned or discussed it afterwards?? Like jesus christ your childhood friend just used physical violence towards you and no one cares? Then they just made up with a few words and that's it.  The story is also very predictable and boring, I just waited for the episodes to be finally over. It was so annoying how they made the show so overdramatic, the drama was forced, and the episodes practically went like this:  -Episode starts  -Problem comes up  -They solve the problem through magical friendship!  -Everyone cries and hugs, all is fine. Repeat this for 13 episodes and Love Live is what you get.   Sound was fairly good though the voice acting was quite annoying. Squeaky screaming voices destroyed my eardrums. The OST was also just generic songs used in almost every anime.  Now. The characters were clearly based on ""types"", tsundere, tomboy etc. And add a bit of a backstory, and Voila! You get perverts bying body pillows of them. The characters are so annoying, for example Honoka. MFW when your group member gets sick just before an important event because of her stupidity. I also found Eli annoying, she was an asshole most of the first season.  I didn't really enjoy this series at all and I had more expectations for it. Don't recommend.";Not Recommended
5;Love Live! School Idol Project;Beast-Shugo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Beast-Shugo;1;"Love Live and its sequels are a true treasure in the world of anime. From the moment I saw the vibrant and colorful animation, the originality of the art and character design, I knew I was about to embark on an exciting adventure. The incredibly well-produced music should win awards if it weren't for the rest of the music world not wanting to be overshadowed by it. It combines with the energetic performances of the girls, creating an atmosphere full of joy and positive energy. The animation feels fluid and uses meticulous traditional animation; there is never any cost-cutting with 3D or simplified or undrawn backgrounds.  Although the characters may seem stereotypical at first glance, I have discovered that each of the Love Live girls has her own charm and distinctive personality. As the seasons progress, we can see how these talented young girls face challenges and grow as individuals, developing strong relationships among themselves. They have realistic and profound encounters and dialogues about the intricate problems they must face. Their determination captivates me, and anyone can appreciate that the special bond they share is related to a conflicted and scarred past.  The script is never predictable; it has an exciting pace that keeps my attention at all times. The main plot of saving the school through music is completely innovative in the anime industry, and the anime manages to add twists and touching moments that keep me glued to the screen.  The cast of characters is the most diverse I have ever seen in an anime. Each character shines in a unique way and represents different aspects of maturity and personal growth. The subtle romantic relationships between the girls serve as unexpected and novel glue. Obviously, the reason for their presence is to enrich the plot further, and the only reason they don't fully consolidate is simply because there hasn't been enough time to tell the story.";Not Recommended
0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;Cozye;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cozye;10;In a display of happiness and enthusiasm, the second season of Love Live Nijigasaki is a welcome return for the series. It not only manages to capture everything that made its first season shine but also expands on its many themes and ideas all while continuing to set itself apart from the other entries of this franchise.  There are oftentimes certain expectations when it comes to each iteration of Love Live. One might assume that certain familiar story beats would be prevalent within each version or that each series must follow a similar storyline but this is not always true. And while Nijigasaki may not have the same level of tearful or dramatic storytelling like its counterparts that older fans may look for, it makes up for it by doing its own thing and excelling at it. It still maintains many of the core aspects people love about the franchise in being a charming and inspirational story with cute slice of life yet doesn’t resort to many of the stumbles its counterparts make and that’s what I feel makes it so special and unique.  Given the nature of the first season, it was difficult to imagine where they were going to take the story. Would they go down a similar route of having dedicated episodes for each solo idol or would something change? As much as I liked how they handled individual character episodes before, it seems the show had some different ideas this time around. The story picks up around where we left off with the school idol club riding off the heels of the School Idol Festival and given their immense success, they decide to host another one. But there are many hurdles that lay before them before they reach that point as they now have to face adversity to their beliefs as solo idols. We see the debut of three new girls to go alongside our main group in Lanzhu Zhong, Mia Taylor, and Shioriko Mifune and they play a significant role this season.  Lanzhu Zhong is an exchange student from Hong Kong who transferred to Nijigasaki High School in order to become a school idol. However, she has no intention of joining the idol club as her ideals don’t exactly line up with that of our main group. While in the first season we saw the main group receiving support from others as well as interacting with their fans, Lanzhu deems this to be unnecessary claiming that connecting with fans and viewing them more as equals will hold her back and instead treats them as mere spectators made to admire her from afar. Being a perfectionist who loves to express herself with confidence, she wants to be someone who captivates more than anyone else while bathing in the spotlight alone and even thinks she can outperform the school idol club during the next School Idol Festival. This paints her as a sort of competitive rival who challenges the school idol club in what they believe in as well as Yuu in particular, saying she is better off leaving the club entirely in order to fully pursue her dream in music since she isn’t an idol.  Mia Taylor is also an exchange student and is what some may label as being naturally talented at music and a prodigy having skipped grades and is seemingly quite smart. Coming from a prestigious music family, she seeks to write songs. Throughout the course of the show, she utilizes and relies on Lanzhu in order to spread her songs and gain recognition as well as gives Yuu some advice while she is in the music course. Mia also happens to speak fluent English to go alongside her Japanese (due in large part to her voice actress being part Australian) which is something I rarely see in anime. I found it commendable how every remark she makes in English would oftentimes be surprising at first yet would simultaneously feel as if it flows naturally with her conversation rather than being out of place.  Shioriko Mifune is someone who begins working with Setsuna in doing Student Council business. She steadily becomes more involved with the school idol club’s antics and provides support whenever she can while having a strict belief that she needs only do what she knows she can do best. She also has a family member who plays a role in shaping how she views idols.  Like with the previous season, Nijigasaki continues to characterize in subtle and natural ways while not merely resorting to one particular character trait allowing for easier understanding and relatability to these three new characters despite whatever personal goals, motivations, or struggles they might have. Their addition to the cast feels rather seamless as they make themselves relevant as the series goes on with their own arcs and backstories while not taking away too much screentime from everyone else.  As for the rest of the cast, while each of them received an ample amount of development and characterization in the previous season, this season expands on it. They now have to prove Lanzhu wrong and that there’s value in being helped by others and connecting with them, especially fans. But how will they go about doing so?  The Nijigasaki group has been one that focused more on the individual with each member having their own color corresponding to them in order to stand out. But now the idea of overlapping colors is introduced and with it comes the incorporation of subunits. Now subunits have always been a thing in Love Live from µ's and Aqours, however, it has never been implemented into the actual story before as far as performing goes and has largely been a non-anime aspect of the franchise. For those unaware, a subunit is essentially a smaller group comprising only a few of the members. In Nijigasaki, these units are aptly named QU4RTZ, DiverDiva, and AZUNA and much like with each solo idol song, each subunit carries with it its own style of music and performance. I found this aspect to the show to be particularly interesting since it not only gives them an answer to Lanzhu’s call in letting them reach out to her in different ways but by already being solo idols, they earn a lot more freedom and flexibility in what they can do when expressing themselves. They are able to expand on their group dynamic and relationships with one another and create an entirely new color by understanding and bringing forth each of their individual strengths. It also now gives the characters a new perspective and plays well into the overall themes in that despite being solo idols, everyone was great at observing others yet struggled at seeing themselves and being honest in order to move forward and we saw this many times in the previous season. With the element of subunits (as well as some other events later on) now in the story, it should be noted that the pacing has noticeably been slowed down in several of the episodes which is a bit of a contrast when compared to the more brisk pacing of the first season. The focus is not just on a singular character but on many as we view each of their perspectives and how they handle transitioning into a small group setting. The girls continue to grow and learn new things about themselves through each other and the idols aren’t the only ones who develop either. Yuu does as well.  When the school idol club helped her find her dream, Yuu joined the music course in order to play piano and write songs but she finds herself struggling quite a bit having to ask for advice. Both Mia and the idol club give differing opinions on what she can do and Yuu inevitably has to decide what strategy fits her best as she wants to prove to Lanzhu that she can accomplish her goals her own way while being a part of the club and give back to everyone who inspired her.  And while Nijigasaki now focuses much of its attention on miniature group arcs, it doesn’t completely shy away from still excelling on its individual character ones. Each main girl gets a distinct focus at some point this season but Setsuna, being one of the more noteworthy and significant girls of the cast, receives in my view one of the strongest episodes of the series. She is someone who has been struggling to maintain the secret of having two different identities: one as the responsible student council president and the other as an enthusiastic school idol and the way in which she is able to handle this provides a rather surprisingly mature and emotional but fitting closure to her arc as well as a notable stepping stone for how the rest of the story will be impacted from that point.  The side characters also see much prominence having become fans or appreciators of the Nijigasaki group. It feels like there is a concise network amongst the different schools where they can rely on one another in times of need or to arrange certain school events. There were a few moments though where I felt some of their introductions were a bit out of place with their presence being made merely to solve certain plot elements.  The artstyle has remained consistent across both seasons with character designs and highly detailed backgrounds. As far as performances go, there was a part of me that thought going into this that it would not be able to live up to the same level of quality as the previous season. Thankfully that was not the case. Studio Sunrise continues to deliver with Love Live Nijigasaki having some of the most smooth, gorgeous, and visually stunning use of CG and animation quality in the franchise. I simply cannot praise the animators, the directing, or the storyboarding enough. Despite having a complex arrangement of scenes (particularly with the subunit performances), each one flows well into the other with the same level of robust choreography, cinematography, and dynamic camerawork as the first season as well as maintaining the aspect of being like a music video. I particularly appreciated all the little references and easter eggs they sprinkle throughout the songs that more hardcore fans will recognize (like of other Nijigasaki songs not shown in the anime or of the girls in different outfits). It’s a nice touch.  Being from a well established idol franchise, Nijigasaki has incredible music, both solo and group. There is a noticeable difference in the feel between the two types of songs. Solo songs largely reflect the nature and personality of the idol who’s singing (like Lanzhu’s invigorating performance about being at the top) whereas group songs have a mixture of personalities incorporating a multitude of themes. While one may prefer one over the other, I think subunit performances still carry a lot of the vigor, energy, and charm that one would expect from a solo song. They feel a bit reminiscent of the other series for which group songs are the norm. My only real complaint about the music is that we didn’t get a full version performance of a certain Lanzhu song that came for a short while. The voice actresses excelled in their roles both with portraying their characters as well as singing every song with passion and enthusiasm. Soundtrack is still utilized well throughout particularly in the more lighthearted and comedic segments which there are plentiful amounts of. The implementation of song styles for OP and ED mirrors that of the previous season with the OP: Colorful Dreams! Colorful Smiles! being an upbeat and enthusiastic song with gorgeous visuals to kick off every episode while the ED: Yume ga Bokura no Taiyou sa is a more quiet track with a somber tone and childlike drawing visuals reminiscent of Neo Sky Neo Map.  With everything said, I believe this is an excellent season and a fitting continuation to Nijigasaki. While its story may be simple in nature and the pacing is a bit slower this time around, the ways in which Nijigasaki is able to portray its entire main cast and their issues to go alongside its excellent use of themes without resorting to much drama is something I feel makes it stand out even amongst the other entries of this franchise. When the first season of this show arrived, many viewed it as a breath of fresh air as it brought several new things to the table and mixed up the typical Love Live formula in various ways. Now with the second season, it continues to do so, this time incorporating new and innovative aspects even to itself. The cast has grown larger in size and yet it still manages to give the new girls adequate time to shine and characterize them in genuine and meaningful ways while not neglecting the screentime and development of everyone else. It’s noteworthy how far the Nijigasaki girls have come from their beginnings where they each had an episode dedicated to them and how they now deal with the new challenges before them. There is a sense of progression and it’s quite sad knowing a journey like this has to end at some point since this is one of the most lovable casts I’ve seen.  Experiencing Love Live Nijigasaki has been some of the most fun I’ve ever had with an anime and it’s a show I initially went into with some hesitation. But by the end, it’s proven to be something quite special. There’s meaning, there’s fulfillment, and there’s heart in the journey these girls go through.;Recommended
1;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;10;For the past two years I have thought of nothing as much as I have Nijigaku season 2 and I’m delighted to say that just like season 1, this season takes the LL franchise to new heights.  If you’re a LL fan you know that the story is usually secondary to the songs, performances and Yuri ships and for good reason because that’s usually what makes LL entertaining. Not this time around. Unlike S1 which was mainly independent character driven episodes and the occasional performance. Season 2 of Nijigaku feels like an actual overarching story is being told to which the new characters are integral. It feels like there’s actually something we’re building up and working towards with recruiting the new girls and preparing for the first live, which makes for a really fun and exciting ride.  From the very first episode when Lanzhu is introduced and we get her first performance of Eutopia, I knew we were in for a treat this season. It felt like for the first time in the LL franchise the girls actually had a legitimate adversary/antagonist. Seeing her go from rival to fan and ultimately a member was such a cool experience. The episodes in this season at times felt like normal slice of life anime episodes with some emotional backstories and growth from the new girls. You actually got to see them evolve over the course of the season culminating in an amazing live finale. Shioriko and Mia’s unique stories were a breath of fresh air to the series as well. It felt like everyone got the perfect amount of screen-time and development and that’s very rare in an idol show. Hat has to go off to Sunshine.  As I said earlier, Nijigaku s2 takes everything to the next level. I can honestly say the performances and story this season were the best of the franchise in my opinion. The development of the various sub groups and the introduction of several new fan favourite characters like Mia, Lanzhou and Shioriko was so fun. I woke up every Saturday at 9am to watch this as soon as it aired, and didn’t regret it for a moment. The first live we got in the finale was one of the hypest moments in LL history for me.  I sincerely hope that we get a movie like SIP/Sunshine, OVA or more Nijigaku content in the near future because it is by far my fave idol project and I’ll miss it a lot. Until then, we have Superstar s2 to look forward to in a few weeks! Let’s hope Sunrise continues their excellent form.  Nijigaku season 2 gets a very free 10 out of 10.;Recommended
2;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;Gaspar445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gaspar445;8;"After season one of Nijigasaki ended, I knew there wasn't anything that was tying me to this mortal plane, so I simply stopped existing for sixteen months until the second season came out. Now that this season has come and gone, I'm writing this review before I go back to not existing.  Most of my thoughts on this series remain unchanged from the first season, and I wrote a long winded review on that already, so go check that out if you're interested. Here's the tl;dr: The characters are for the most part fun and have a good chemistry with each other, the art style is a welcome departure from the usual shininess of its sister series, and every single song is phenomenal. The most important point I made was that I was really impressed with how the melodrama in the anime didn't overstay its welcome, thereby maintaining the lighthearted nature of the show and improving the emotional impact of each of the girls' stories.  Moving onto Nijigasaki season 2, countless anime with a large cast fail to create the feeling of a cohesive friend group when there's no mingling beyond the characters that are grouped together from the start. Nijigasaki manages to avoid this with the formation of sub-units within the school idol club. The usual groupings by school year or implied yuri pairings get shaken up with these new sub-units, and they serve to create a strong group dynamic. This kind of variety in character interactions is even seen in smaller inconsequential scenes throughout the season. It's these little details that go a long way in bringing life and personality into the show.  A small criticism I had with the first season of Nijigasaki was it still could have used more time to flesh out some of its characters so they aren't just tied to their defining traits. I'm glad to say that for the original ten members of the club, this has been remedied in the second season. Shizuku is shown to be more than a dull actress for the theater club, as her being a yuri fanfic writing dork is the whole (and hilarious) reason behind the formation of the AZUNA sub-unit. Ai's happy-go-lucky character gains a little more depth when she gets closer with the calm realist Karin. Ayumu and Yu's dependence on each other is actually quite pleasantly directly addressed this season and they learn that it's okay to branch out to other interests even if the other is not beside them. Yu's role as basically Producer-kun and importance to the club is actually pronounced this season as well; she learns to compose music for the girls and continues to be the supporting backbone for the club.  Shioriko, Mia, and Lanzhu are all welcome additions that fit in well with the rest of the club. Lanzhu is set up as a competent rival for the Nijigasaki school idol club to prove their worth to. She easily could have been written as obnoxious and arrogant, but she's actually quite agreeable and lets her talent speak for itself. A really nice detail about Mia is she produces contemporary J-pop music designed for mass appeal for Lanzhu, but when she writes music the way she wants for herself, it doesn't sound like what is currently trending but is in the style of 2000s style pop music. Mia's obligatory English phrase every episode is always funny and her interactions with the rest of the cast is the strongest of the new characters. Unfortunately for my second favorite girl of Nijigasaki, Shioriko, I can't say the same. I've already liked her since I played the mobile game, but I would not blame any anime-only viewers to think she is a bland character. I don't think the anime did enough to show the strong-willed or moe sides of Shioriko. Even her new song is probably the weakest of her very strong list of solo songs.  The music is great as usual. I love the OP and ED just as much as the first season. There are sub-unit songs for AZUNA, DiverDiva, and QU4RTZ; solo songs for Lanzhu, Mia, and Shioriko; and a few group songs. Overall the quality of music is great and I listen to them all pretty much daily.  Nijigasaki once again delivers an incredibly fun and lighthearted Love Live experience. Like its first season, it doesn't overly indulge in the bits of drama throughout the story. The Niji girls come back for more fun sukuru aidoru related activities and the new girls add more to my enjoyment of the series. That being said, this second season did not enamor me as much as the first season. I fell in love with the first season when it was new and exciting. Season 2 of Nijigasaki, however, is like coming back to a comfy place I already know I will continue to adore. If you are a fan of the first season of Nijigasaki, then you will like the second season for sure.";Recommended

Nijigasaki is my personal favourite Love Live series just for the diversity and amazing music. Season 2 puts the bar of season 1 even higher with the animation being even better and the CGI looks even better than some of the 2D animation. Like season 1 the songs so far have been bangers. The introduction of the three new characters Lanzhu, Shioriko and Mia have been an interesting addition. Lanzhu and Shioriko's characters have been changed a lot from the games story but still gives them some great story. The final few episodes are amazing. The pace for season 2 is slower compared to the previous one with more focus on characters and seeing how much they have developed from season 1. The character chemistry and the comedy with between them is fantastically done.

4;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;JuomiAT;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JuomiAT;8;"This generation is the epitome of the franchise of Love Live, it really feels like fresh air for any fan without abusing formulas or recurring gimmicks. And if it, does it have a reason behind it. It rethinks the franchise in general while still having what we define Love Live by: musical performances, charismatic characters, dramatic moments, yuri, and of course School Idols. What it means? Well from non-professional idols to freedom of expression. The series uses it as a wild cart for all kinds of situations in order to reach a larger age group of audition, so…  -Spoiler Warning-  This season is truly a love letter to all the fans and a demonstration that the staff love these characters. Nijigasaki is the perfect definition between doing things for pleasure and to do the same things to please the public: the best artist isn’t the one who does everything for the unconditional love of the fans or the one who does it simply to enlarge the self-ego. It’s the one who connects with people thanks to their work and passion and that’s what allows them to grow and learn together. In the series it shows in Yuu (realizing that she wants to make a song for her friends that please they), Lanzhu (who at the beginning only does it to show that she can but in the process, she abandons anyone), Shizuku (who ends up learning to express herself and stops to being afraid of people’s opinions), Ayumu (who stops being so obsessive with her beloved Yuu and decides to open her world to connect with other people) … In fact, I could say any of these girls because perfectly fits in this description.  Nijigasaki emphasizes the importance of collectivism and individualism alike. In general, we could say that this is the main theme of the series. Each of its characters in different ways teach us to accept ourselves and the same time to understand others without lose what makes us unique. In addition, thanks to the complexity of the character with their faults and virtues, their problems and worries, they create other interesting sub-themes, like for example:  -As being and expressing yourself without problems you will not only be better with yourself and with the other people, but also you can learn a lot of new things thanks to it. -The importance of living in the present with the future in mind in order to be able to live in the moment but worrying about possible problems that could happen tomorrow. And to leave the past just for don’t make the same mistake again and not to yearn for it. -The problem of extreme pragmatism that makes it impossible to enjoy the little things that make us happy.  Actually, this show has a lot of content with full of details, some more obvious and others that you will have to stop and see several times. And I’m not just talking about the visual aspects, the dialogues themselves too. But everything has its negative side, this is linked to the over saturation which generates higher expectations that end when at some point there is some irrelevant conversation/action that doesn’t contribute much to the narrative. Without doubt, with more episodes or more time the series would have benefited from it.  And one of this benefited would be the interaction between the characters. In the first season, we could see how some of them practically didn’t even speak to each other, while in this season it’s the opposite. They became a connected group (demonstrated in the Tokimeki Runners episode) and thanks to this they quickly adopt the new three new members of R3birth. But that causes, that the strong relationships that we knew before are practically abandoned. They are still present and as strong as before, but opaquer:  -Karin and Emma keep worrying about each other. Emma worrying about Karin when she's depressed, or when Karin lets Emma to practise with quartz even if it means she loses her ""alarm clock."" -Shizuku and Kasumi still know each other the most. Kasumi admits that her hairpin is very precious to her and seems to know her beloved Shizuku's house beforehand. And for Shizuku, she is the first to tease Kasumi in an affectionate way and not get a growl from her. -Ai and Rina keep supporting each other, Rina hugging Ai when she is worried or Ai immediately trying to help Rina and being with her. But as I said, that is put on the back burner, giving more relevance to new interactions that not only allow us to observe how they are growing as a group, but also how they continue to grow as separate individuals. Which reminds us of the main theme I mentioned before.   Throughout 13 episodes, 26 if we count the first season, we have some moments that are more dramatic, others more emotional and others whose function is simply to show how the characters continue growing. But always maintaining a hopeful air, because since real life is very hard, it is not healthy to be depressive all the time, as it happens with the girls in the series. There aren’t unnecessary or forced dramas, all the situations are there for a reason which in some cases is simply to make the show more realistic. Which reminds me that even the background characters are made to be differentiated from each other, because even though they haven’t got any characterization, the program treats them as if they were others character who have their own story.  But like all things nothing is perfect, as I said before most of the elements are compressed which also implies that some situations could have given much more of themselves or could have been much more complex. As in the case of Kanata, a hardworking girl who push herself to work to support her house and keeps the scholarship and because that she needs to rest a lot. However, the series, if she isn’t the focus, tends to only remember that she likes to sleep, when she is much more than that. Or Shioriko, who the series only shows as a compassionate but pragmatic and very stoic girl, who also, her appearance is very sudden and not as well integrated as Mia or Lanzhu. An expected problem due to she was not introduced in the first season, and part of its development comes from there in the game story.  Another failed aspect, and this time a contradictory one, is the treatment with Yuu. Despite having achieved characterization and motivations of its own sometimes the series treats her as a flat character that everyone loves and has her in their sights no matter what. She has already shown that she is not really a self-insert character but sometimes the series seems to forget that, for the sake of the audience that is looking for that. This causes a contradiction between her development and her treatment, which although are few there are notable enough.  On other hand, the visuals of the series are magnificent, with a fluidity of movement and an impressive focus on details. But due to the time and budget that this implies, in each chapter we find a handful of static images, which also with the passage of the episodes increase. To the point of recycling images for the last episode. Even so, the series knows what shots to use, what colors and what lighting is necessary for each occasion in order to give each situation more meaning or to emphasize it. Moreover, like the previous season, the CGI is much better than any other in the franchise.  It would be a pity if, being a partially musical series, the sound side would fail and fortunately it doesn't, from the inserted music to the background melodies, they are there for a reason. It makes use of some leitmotivs, such as Kasumi's antics, and others made for specific moments to accompany and emphasize the scene. And the MVs are undoubtedly the best to date, both the lyrics, the visuals and the melody tell us things about the episode and those who are singing: they anticipate events such as Lanzhu's main problem or show us the development they have had as the AZUNA song.  And not to forget to reuse past music like Tokimeki Runners, Love my Friends or Mirai Harmony, who endow the songs with new connotations and work to show us things. Certainly, contrary to the others generations where the references were purely references, in the case of Nagasaki, in addition to that, they serve as purpose.  To all this? What exactly is Love Live Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Club?  It is a series that not only avoids the standards of the franchise itself, but also those of the media itself, since the program does not have an intrinsic plot, it is built by the characters. The series is about following the evolution of the characters and growing up with them. Which brings us back to what I explained at the beginning about the connection between the artist and fans. Individualisms and collectivism. Truly a love letter to the audience and the characters itself.  To close the whole circle the program starts with Yuu and Ayumu going to school where they learn about their dream together, and ends with both of them separately pursuing that dream but with a stronger connection than ever. At the same time, as for the second season, it starts with Ayumu surprised and practically refusing the hug of a welcoming fan, and ends with another hug but this time accepting it and being welcomed one.";Recommended
5;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;Bright_Star645;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bright_Star645;10;I just want to say that Love Live Nijigasaki is truly a beautiful and amazing anime to watch. Even though I been a Love Live fan for a very long time since 2016 basically. I felt a special spot for Love Live Nijigasaki compared to SIP and Sunshine and even Superstar. Love Live Nijigasaki is honestly that anime in the Love Live franchise that was really outstanding the fact in the first season of the anime, I really loved how they introduced and gave some backstory on the characters, even during season 2 I love how they introduced and have some backstory on Mia, Shiriko, and Lanzhou. Not to mention it was finally a Love Live anime that didn’t involve in having to save the school. Even though Love Live Nijigasaki started as Love Live School Idol Perfect Dream Project and was meant to never be something so big when they were introduced in 2017 I’m so glad that Perfect Dream Project got to become something big and amazing known as Love Live Nijigasaki. I’ll truly miss this anime and I know we still got a year or two till we get the anime but truly this anime was amazing. I know the art of the anime was rather something unique compared to SIP, Sunshine, and Superstar, but it was so refreshing to have a new style for the series and all. I know season 2 could’ve improved on its art style but honestly I still love the style and all. If I had to be honest for those trying to get into Love Live I highly recommend Love Live Nijigasaki since it’s cute, amazing, funny, and sometimes fruity amongst the girls but overall wholesome. Plus honestly you would love this much more than SIP and Sunshine since you wouldn’t need to watch it order yo watch Love Live Nijigaskai. To be honest if you are trying to get into Love Live Nijigasaki and Superstar is the two Love Live animes where you wouldn’t have to watch it in order. Plus the music in Love Live Nijigasaki is so amazing and all. Okay I’m sorry for spitting my heart out while typing this review but the anime will always have a special place in my heart!;Recommended
6;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;AkiraChinami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AkiraChinami;8;"There wasn't really any conflict or drama leading into this season finale. Hell, we wrapped up all the stuff with the new characters back in episode nine, so there certainly wasn't going to be any big surprises or twists in here. Much like season one, Nijigasaki chooses instead to go out with an episode-length concert, but whereas season one's ending felt like a victory lap, this one feels like a farewell.  Like, not in the sense that things are wrapped up or there's no room left for more stories or gags with these characters. Nobody graduates or moves abroad or ascends to School Idol Godhood to oversee future generations of Love Lives. They could, theoretically, make another season or movie with this cast without having to change or ignore anything in this finale. If nothing else I'm hedging my bets with that title up top. But I dunno – after watching that big group performance, I couldn't shake the feeling that this was some kind of goodbye, as if the show was staring straight into the camera and bidding adieu to its fans.  And I mean that pretty literally. From what I can tell, they went so far as to include actual fanart sent in by Nijigasaki fans, constructing a huge wall of fan letters and messages in-universe for the cast before their big New Years concert. Like most marketing-driven properties, Love Live! has always been pretty tuned in and reactive to fans – by all accounts the changes to Lanzhu and Shioriko's stories were in response to pretty negative fan reaction to the game's storyline – but this is taking a step beyond even that. Add in the sheer amount of cameos from characters exclusive to the mobile games, and this episode turns into a heaping bowl of fanservice for longtime Livers.  Granted, there are still some problems with that, mostly stemming from the issues that have pestered this season. Every single idol gets a new song to perform this episode, but there's nowhere near enough time for them to each get the music video treatment, so instead we get 30-second snippets of every girl going out on stage individually, and that drags after a little while. There are some cute moments – Rina's fans recreating her faceplate with glowsticks is absolutely adorable, and it was nice seeing her help bolster Mia's nerves; Shizuka's song just outright namedropping Audrey Hepburn – but it has the dual problems of each individual section being too short to mean much, but still taking up too much time in aggregate. There are just too many characters here that, by the law of Not Pissing Off A Character's Fans, have to get roughly equal screentime, and that can't fit into a 20-minute episode of animation.  After that though, things pick up. It's incredibly sweet to see Yu get some fan mail and flowers of her own. I joke about her being Nijigasaki's harem lead, because she is, but she's also a character in her own right, and one that could sometimes fall by the wayside in season one since she never got up on stage herself. But this season, for all its faults, let her shine as brightly as the rest of the girls, and her reaction to inspiring the same excitement that got her to pursue music is a great way to bring her full-circle.  But the real sendoff comes in the extra-long closing song, and if this really is the last of animated Nijigasaki, this is a pretty perfect swan song. It's not my favorite song as just an isolated track, but the presentation put into this last performance really does feel like a heartfelt sayonara to the show and characters. Every girl gets a solid line in – and Crunchyroll even went the extra mile by color-coding the subtitle text – with a visual callback to the solo songs from their individual character episodes. There's an entire portion of the song that's just showing off the crowd, which I'm pretty sure included every single generic R-rarity character from the School Idol Festival mobile game. Not to mention the montage of seemingly everyone across the world watching the performance on everything from smartphones to billboards. It's about as emphatic a “goodbye” as you can get without actually saying the words.  And if this is the final number for Nijigasaki, it's as good a closer as you can ask for. While this spinoff hasn't been perfect – and this season in particular has hit more than a few stumbling blocks – I have definitely enjoyed my time with it. If nothing else, Kasumin has clawed her way into my favorites of the franchise, and there's been a few tunes along the way that are taking up residence in my writing playlist. It's not the best that Love Live! has to offer, but it's been a good time, and if they do ever want to bring this cast back in anime form, I'll happily follow that rainbow too.";Recommended
7;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;whatsosticky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whatsosticky;9;I give this show a lot of credit. There was no lack of continuity between season 1 and season 2. There were some changes that I appreciated, ones that I took exception with in the first season, most notably they took away the 3D performances and made them 2d. I think it made it flow much better. The character development is time went by and the challenges that come along with getting older I handled well. There's still an overwhelming sense of excessive positivity, though it's much more under control this season. I think this was a very nice leave put together show and this second season gave proof that success can be maintained without something going bad as is seen in other shows. This is a good watch, in my opinion. I really enjoyed it.;Recommended
8;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;i-like-this;https://myanimelist.net/profile/i-like-this;7;High School Musical 2.  The Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is back for more song and dance shenanigans. If you’ve watched the first season then you already know what you’re in for. The cute girls you know and love doing cute and wholesome things in-between all the excellently animated singing and dancing. It’s wholesome, simple and very anime.  Season 2 feels a bit less bloated in it’s 13 episode structure. It doesn’t suffer from what I like to call “too many characters syndrome” like the first season did because of the casts familiarity. The seasons main plot thread is focused on Yuu, the pseudo-club manager and her position as a music composer rather than an idol in the club whilst the rest of the girls experiment with group idol performances as well as improving their solo ones. Lanzhu, Mia and best girl Shioriko (with fang) are all welcomed additions to the cast and the show takes it’s time introducing them and building on their characters as well as the rest of the idol club members.  If you’re here for the story you’ll probably be disappointed.. Although it’s not as much of a problem as it was in season one, having so many characters to give equal screen time too means that the story quality fluctuates from episode to episode and some club members are way under-utilised. The slice of life story telling isn't bad, but it’s just very factory standard slice of life and any conflict that comes between the girls (mainly instigated by Lanzhu) feels very forced and easily resolvable. However, when the show gets it right, it’s very good and fun to watch. Also as much as I don’t mind her, Mia does represent one of my new anime pet peeves which is the ‘character that speaks in engrish every other sentence’ archetype. I personally just find it annoying.  Admittedly, I did think the season finale was well set up and surprisingly emotional. It caps off the season pretty well and although I would recommend Love Live Superstar over Nijigasaki High School Idol Club if you want to give this franchise a try, the music and animation (which I don’t really need to talk about, it’s Sunrise) gives Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club more than enough to sing and dance too.  7/10 Good.;Recommended
0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;PandaUwU;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PandaUwU;5;"Spoiler Warning  Here we are with the anticipated second season of Love Live Nijigasaki. The first season received mixed reviews from fans of the series, but I thought it was the best Love Live installment at the time. This second season, however, does not properly execute based on the foundation laid by its predecessor.  This season of Nijigasaki introduces three new characters, Lanzhu, Shioriko, and Mia, but the story is centralized around Lanzhu and her interactions with Shioriko, Mia, and the girls of the School Idol Club. Her philosophy is to captivate others and put on an amazing performance, with that being the extent of it. She also disagrees with the beliefs of the School Idol Club, she believes that people should pursue their dreams without needing the help of others. This creates conflict within the characters, where both sides believe in different things. Additionally, this creates an antagonist within the show, which is a first for Love Live, as well as one of the most interesting things that Love Live has done since its start in 2014.  Where I find this anime to struggle is keeping its attention on this theme. At the start, it focuses on this quite solidly, featuring several developments between Lanzhu and the girls to further the plot. One of the main things that occurred during this development was the creation of subunits. Initially, the first subunit was made to “challenge” Lanzhu’s ideology. I feel that this progressed the plot well, carrying the themes of dreams nicely in a short, few-episode mini-arc. After this, two more subunits were formed. Why? I have no clue. The creation of these subunits made absolutely no sense. One of the more important things during the previous season of Nijigasaki was that everyone was a solo idol. Why do they suddenly want to join up when they were against it before? It’s incomprehensible.  The pacing of this season was very inconsistent. Every arc in the show is dedicated to one or two episodes. Everything that was dedicated to a single episode was rushed, yet all assigned two episodes were properly developed. One exception to this rule was Mia, where I felt she got proper development due to how differently she was written from the rest of the cast. She got a single episode to share with Lanzhu, plus little bits of other episodes. Overall, this helped make her development feel more natural and did not require her to have an entire episode dedicated to herself. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Shioriko or Lanzhu. Shioriko followed the single episode rule, while Lanzhu only felt like she got the episode with Mia and bits of other episodes. While yes, Mia got the same treatment and it worked, why is Lanzhu different? Well, she is the main “antagonist,” while Mia was more of a side character. This inherently means there should be more put behind her than the other characters and this is where her character faltered.  Another problem I had with the characters was the relationship between Ayumu and Yu. It could have been handled much more strongly. There was a deficiency of interactions within this season and it makes me question why they decided to establish their relationship in the former season. It wasn’t completely terrible though, as the show dedicated episode 12 to the two of them, which was one of the better episodes within the show.  Despite everything I said so far, not everything about the characters and story is bad. The new characters bounce off the old ones when they interact and interactions between the cast as a whole are sharper than in the previous season. I had a solid amount of fun watching these events play out. The story is starting to reach its end as well. From where they are currently, they’ve started to worry about the graduation of the third-years. Although this could be seen as generic sports anime worries, or standard Love Live “we gotta win before the third-years graduate” kind of thing, I quite enjoy it. It is not an unreasonable thing to think about, while also providing a sense of time.  The animation for this season was varied in quality, but overall solid. My biggest issue is the background art. Sometimes it looked perfectly fine, nothing too amazing, but was solid; at other times it looked like garbage. The backdrops looked like blurry jpegs without even attempting to be hidden. Characters would also be poorly composited within the scene. Outside of these moments, the show looked fine. The character models looked consistent most of the time and the performances looked solid. The animated segments of the performance all looked great, on par with the images from the game they’re based on. The CGI parts were decent. They weren’t as groundbreaking as something like Houseki no Kuni, nor as well-hidden as those in Love Live Superstar, but they looked fine.  Speaking of performances, how did everything sound? It sounded really solid. The BGM was nice to listen to throughout the episodes, and the performances sounded pleasant. Granted, some performances were stronger than others, all were at least something that I would see myself listening to. The lyrics to these songs were all nice and occasionally meaningful, linking to their character arcs within the show, or, in the case of Lanzhu during the first episode, telling you about their character.  This season of Nijigasaki has some highs, as well as some lows. From a technical standpoint, this show is pretty solid, providing captivating performances, while from a writing standpoint, this show can be lacking at times. Overall, this season has been somewhat of a downgrade from its promising first season, which has been very unfortunate to witness.  Thank you for reading.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;valiantslakr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/valiantslakr;5;"Well, as someone who used to play a lot of Love Live: SIFAS, which this is all loosely based off of, season 1 left me disappointed with the lack of interesting conflict or drama due to none of the ""antagonists"" showing up. This left me hopeful that season 2 would correct this; I was left sorely disappointed once more.  Lanzhu was supposed to be the ultimate villainess that split the idol club apart, and ended up being quickly defanged and befriended as a secret fangirl of the other girls. As for Shioriko, she was introduced as an afterthought instead of a true challenger to Setsuna's position as the student council president, and barely had ANY presence or character as a result.  I understand that the mobile game plot's drama wasn't exactly popular with the hardcore love live fanbase, but neutering these two characters THIS far is quite frankly, ridiculous. There is now absolutely zero stakes, conflict, or drama, and the entire show is now just fluff and girls just singing and dancing for the sake of it, with no real ultimate goal or actually visible character development. The resulting show is an incredibly boring slog to watch through, music video sequences aside.  I'm sure the hardcore love live fanbase that dislikes any sort of drama will like this, but come on man, there's MANY ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows that are far more entertaining to watch than this.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai 2nd Season;DaddyDubs;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DaddyDubs;4;This season sucks.  (Some) of music like Emotion is great, and there's a few things to like here and there, Ai for example gets a great episode which was really surprising because I honestly didn't care about her at all. But that's about all I have to say positive about Niji season 2. So let's go thru all the negatives.  1- Inconsistent animation In some of the episodes, the animation looks great and then in other episodes it's extremely lazy for no reason whatsoever. I don't expect this level of laziness from Sunrise, and it's unacceptable for a massive studio that prides itself on quality.  2- Characters and Character Relationships Ayumu and Yuu's relationship (which I didn't care much for in season 1) takes a complete 180 in season 2 especially towards the end in a laughably sad attempt to create drama because the writers must have realized there was no tension or anything to captivate the audience in the previous 8-9 episodes. It's like whoever wrote the later episodes didn't even watch season 1 or just forgot about it.  3- Exposition You have no idea how awful it was sitting through 11 minutes of characters monologuing. I think the episode with Qu4rtz was one of the worst but there's several where nothing interesting happens other than a song (some episodes don't even get that) and there's tons of time with characters just blabbing something that never gets brought up again just to pad time and get the episode over with.  4- Our three new girls Out of the three new girls, the only one with a slightly interesting arc was Mia. Lanzhu seemed like she was going to be a villain character like in the game but what happens is nowhere near as exciting. Shioriko's episode is even worse.  5- Jokes fall flat The jokes are so poorly timed in this season. The problem isn't even writing it's just that the delivery is terrible and they fail ALMOST every single time. Great example is this one scene where Kasumi rages, but the voice acting doesn't even match the expression she makes so it's not even funny.  Stay away from this season if you have high standards for anime. Even as a Love Live enthusiast I expected some semblance of quality but what I got was the beginning of Sunrise mass-producing Love Live for nothing other than to make a profit. I thought first season of Nijigasaki and the game were just mediocre and bland with a few good songs and jokes, but this was just depressing. I just wanted the episodes to be over so I could catch up on Komi and Spy X Family, and while I don't think either of those shows are 10/10 Oscar-worthy masterpieces, they don't insult the audience's intelligence and actually want to tell an entertaining story.;Not Recommended
0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;8;"There are few anime as equally enjoyable as they are remarkable. And there are fewer still as thoroughly pleasant as Sunrise's latest foray into the world of school idols.  Love Live: Nijigasaki is a wholesome reminder of why I enjoy anime, and of why the slice-of-life genre is so captivating.  Admittedly, after the middling and sometimes frustrating experience that was Sunshine, I wasn't too sure what to expect from this year's offering of Love Live. While I was a big fan of the original series (Nico is my favourite character in all of anime), Sunshine missed the mark in many regards. It forgot what made Love Live so special in the first place— charming characters and cute slice-of-life— and decided instead to replace it with unhappy vibes and drama in excess. Sunshine was always walking in the original's shadows, with abundant references to Muse, and of days gone by.  The great news is that, by bringing the series back to its roots, Nijigasaki firmly stands on its own two feet. It is comprised solely of the franchise's best elements, and highlights the reasons so many people fell in love with Love Live all those years ago. And, with a few important changes and some new layers of complexity, I believe that it is legitimately superior to the original. Love Live's third outing is its best yet.  A large part of what makes Nijigasaki such a pleasure to watch is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. The tone here is far more light-hearted and slice-of-life focused than previous, which is when Love Live had always shined the most, from my perspective. While there is still a degree of drama, it is used sparingly, and in a wholesome and heartwarming manner, with the conclusion to the conflict almost invariably resulting in a smile or even a big stupid grin. If you're the type of person who watches anime primarily for fun, I would say there are not many anime that do it better than Nijigasaki. If you're not so much a seeker of fun, and instead have a preference for the dark and violent and so forth... well, you've found yourself in the wrong place, I'm afraid.  I've always found it admirable how Love Live manages to develop large casts of characters in such a concise amount of episodes, and Nijigasaki is the best example of this to date. It bumps the size of the main cast from nine to ten, and rather than the characterization taking a hit as a result, to the contrary, it is actually an improvement over previous seasons. Each of the girls, no matter how boring or forgettable their design may initially suggest, receive at least one full episode developing their character in a meaningful way, giving ample reason for you to care about them. Contrast this with Sunshine, where I remember Saint Snow, the darn rival group, more than the actual main cast, and it is a world of difference in quality. Even the original series had some characters I felt were underdeveloped (Nozomi in particular), but such is scarcely the case here.  The best example of character development done right is with Rina's episode. Personally, and I am sure many felt the same way initially, her character design elicited a sigh and rolled eyes. Her face being covered by a computer monitor, complete with kaomoji and other electronic expressions, felt very much like an unabashed attempt to bank off on the V-Tuber craze of today. But Rina's episode actually creates a valid reason for her possessing this quirk. It makes sense in the context of the anime, and it genuinely makes you feel happy for her in how she has found a way to confront her fears. Without this episode, she would be another Yohane— one-note and defined by a single gimmick— but with it, she has earned her place as a (relatively) believable and dynamic character.  My personal favourites are Emma and Yuu. While there isn't anything too noteworthy going on with Emma as a character, she is adorable as all hell, as well as being from my favourite country (Switzerland). It is not often that westerners take the role of a main character in anime, and if they do, they are often either half-Japanese or a caricature with blonde hair and broken Japanese. But Emma is just a normal girl, treated no different than any of the other girls. This is laudable on Sunrise's part, as it demonstrates that they are more broad-minded and accepting of other cultures than most studios. It is the little details such as these which make the Nijigasaki girls so appealing.  Of course, with it now being the third full Love Live series, it does follow a formula that most fans have grown accustomed to. But where the first two series spent the majority of their first seasons merely building up and assembling the idol club, Nijigasaki is done with this in its first few episodes, and swiftly moves on to character development and other matters. The only aspect I wish were different was that, maybe, this time around, the girls could have all started together from the first year of high school. I always thought it was a shame that Love Live had to end after a single year of story, and would much prefer to see a full three years played out instead. This is especially true in the case of Nijigasaki, as the cast is so vibrant and exciting that the thought of it ending after two seasons (provided we are even lucky enough to get that far) just doesn't sit right. But, I suppose, it is always better to end on a high note than to risk meandering about.  There are considerably strong yuri themes within Nijigasaki. Unlike the other Love Live series, and most slice-of-life in general, it doesn't exist merely as a suggestion or as fanservice, but as something more sober and markedly human. One of the main characters is genuinely— that is, objectively—in love with one of the others. While this initially comes off as a bit of a shock when it is revealed, especially with it occurring so late into the season, it is handled in a surprisingly mature manner, and ends with a hell of an emotional closer. While my first thoughts were ""Oh no..."" when I realized things were going down the oft-trodden yuri path, the events of these two episodes earned my support, and this comes from someone who isn't even a fan of yuri. Sure, hell, I'll even cheer the two of them on, and hope that everything works out between them in the end.  This yuri romance also adds a new layer of complexity to the story. Though I was already enamored with the anime by this point, it went above and beyond, taking a large risk that could very well have sabotaged my enjoyment and appreciation of the anime. But it is a risk that paid off, and I am interested in seeing where this romantic substory arrives at in the second season. The events of these two episodes do steal the focus away from what was otherwise a very slice-of-life centric anime, however, which may not be to everyone's tastes. But as long as Nijigasaki balances the two, and doesn't let the romance overtake the slice-of-life, then I believe the two aspects can peacefully co-exist and compliment one another.  Love Live: Nijigasaki is a delightful and remarkable experience throughout. It is some of the most fun I have had watching an anime in... well, if not just a long time, then perhaps ever. If you enjoy slice-of-life anime to any extent, then, even if you have watched Love Live in the past but were irked for some reason or another, I would strongly urge you to give Nijigasaki a chance as it is a different beast entirely. This isn't just an anime for Love Live fans, or idol fans— it is a love letter to slice-of-life fans as a whole.  In a lot of ways, Nijigasaki feels like the successor to K-ON (complete with its own Azusa equivalent), to which I feel like Nijigasaki has firmly surpassed. Its slice-of-life moments are more fun. Its music is more charming. Its characters are more compelling. Hell, it even handles yuri better.  So where does that leave me, as someone whose favourite anime, for several years, was K-ON?  While the second season still remains an unknown entity, Love Live: Nijigasaki, in my opinion, is poised to be one of the most lovable slice-of-life anime in over a decade.";Recommended

It resonates throughout the city (reaching for far blue sky!)” - lyrics from Nijiiro Passions!  This show came as quite the pleasant surprise. Given the nature of spinoffs, it’s not unusual to believe that they rarely ever live up to or exceed the quality of their original counterparts and tend to fall short. But that is not the case here. Along with having several noteworthy changes and improvements, this installment to the Love Live franchise came in as something incredibly refreshing and serves as an excellent starting point for the girls of Nijigasaki.  As someone who’s seen the previous Love Live shows, I had some anticipation going into this. The original laid the groundwork for school idols thanks to the influence of μ's and while Sunshine shared many similarities in its story and structure, there were certain aspects about Aqours that were able to stand out. Naturally the prospect of another entry got me interested in wanting to see how it would stack up. There were some mixed feelings when seeing the change in art style but upon watching the first episode, those worries were quickly put to rest. This show has not only been able to meet my expectations but somehow managed to surpass them. THIS is how you do a spinoff.  Love Live Nijigasaki is the third animated series in the franchise following the previous titles School Idol Project and Sunshine. Though unlike the latter, which sought to follow closely behind the footsteps of the original, this entry has its own separate story with no callbacks to past shows or idol groups which is a breath of fresh air. It shows that the series is willing to be innovative with trying new ideas instead of going for more repetition which already makes this show feel more distinct. One criticism that many had with regards to Sunshine was how closely it tied itself to the original despite being its successor. As a result, it ended up following many similar story beats such as the school closure plot point all while drawing constant mention and praise to the previous group: μ's. Nijigasaki on the other hand, sets itself apart by beginning with what I would say is a stronger and more impressive start than either of those two shows.  Instead of starting out with trying to become school idols in order to prevent their school from shutting down, this time it's finding out why the idol group that was already established in their own school decided to disband. With this change, it allows for the show to focus more on exploring the different aspects about being an idol such as expression and being able to connect with fans rather than having a constant worry over our heads (Besides, this school is so large and robust anyway that it doesn’t need to worry about closing its doors). It eases us into the mindset of the girls and what being a school idol means for each of them whilst providing meaningful characterization instead of having them simply become one because of an outside threat. This is helped by the less arduous process of recruiting members as many of them were already part of a smaller group. This also allowed the show to feel more grounded with its story and characters as well as its handle on drama. Each of them is presented with the question of what they want to invoke to their audience which provides for some variety. All of them have different answers yet none of them are incorrect as the appeal of idols vary from person to person. Compared to the more ambitious starts of the previous shows, this story starts out as more simple and intimate with wholesome character interactions between the two main leads Ayumu and Yuu as well as a brief glimpse of the other girls. After being inspired by their first performance, which was done by an idol from their own school rather than another, they seek to understand what caused the idol club to disband and try to reestablish it. Later on it becomes about how each girl in the show will try to stand out as individuals as they strive to become school idols. Understanding other people’s viewpoints, being honest with oneself, and accepting the different sides of your identity are all obstacles they must face in order to get there. While the lack of a familiar looming threat such as school closure did cause the show to feel more open ended and lighthearted overall given there’s less stakes involved, it also allowed for some flexibility as we steer away from the somewhat tired narrative plot point giving Nijigasaki its own unique flavor which many may find to be a welcome change.  The show instead focuses most of its attention purely on character development and with it comes the concept of solo idols which was interesting to see as it adds a new dynamic to the series and to the way live performances work. Nijigasaki is putting more emphasis on the individual, with each girl having their own color that corresponds to them, instead of the group which results in them not actually having a group name like in the other entries. While the show does fall into a formulaic rhythm with each episode focusing on a different girl who would inevitably get their own song at the end, repetition doesn’t necessarily mean bad here as it gives us something to look forward to. This is mostly because each episode feels distinct from one another being able to stand on its own merit with each character having their own problems unique to them making it interesting to see how it unfolds. They all get a chance to shine and develop this season which is something Love Live hasn’t done before. One of the biggest flaws with past entries was that there was not enough time spent fleshing out all the characters by the time the plot started rolling along. With such a large cast, there would usually only be a few characters who get their own episodes per season leaving the rest of the cast feeling both underutilized and underdeveloped, but here they all do.  Another interesting change to the series are the visuals. How does it compare?  Well to put it simply: it’s utterly gorgeous. Love Live has maintained a similar look for its first two installments, but here the art style is distinctly different especially in terms of the character designs which come off as less shiny but more vibrantly colored and crisp. Some of the background art coupled with the lighting in this show are absolutely superb and exceptionally detailed making some scenes really pop out especially during the performances. I was particularly awed by the setpieces used during some of the songs which all have a strikingly rich color palette like Ayumu’s glorious pink stage. While the general look of previous entries are fantastic in their own right (not to mention that I have a strong fondness towards it), the style chosen for Nijigasaki works surprisingly well especially with the CG. Studio Sunrise, having made the previous Love Live shows, truly stepped up in quality for this one. There’s no jarring CG, no awkward movement...it’s clean, smooth, and gorgeous. The CG in this franchise has sure come a long way and now it is some of the best I’ve seen compared to most anime out there coupling amazingly well with the 2D. There’s some incredibly stunning and fluid animation and several unique visual effects that are a first for this franchise as evident in the first song of the show: CHASE! with its interesting but effective use of fire effects as well as many others. The series made some notable improvements here.  With that said, Love Live is not a show that will impress you with having complex ideas or a deep intricate narrative. It has a simple and fairly straightforward story but more importantly, it is a character driven show first and foremost with the aim of eventually becoming school idols in order to achieve their end goal. If you don’t like the girls, then you probably won’t like the show. As for me...there was not a single character that I disliked or found underwhelming. Even the side characters, which mostly consist of fangirls that the main cast garnered over time, eventually became a welcome and benevolent presence whenever they were on screen. It can be a difficult task having to adjust to a completely new cast of characters if you already have an attachment to either, both, or even neither of the previous groups. However, I found it rather easy to get invested in the cast of Nijigasaki. Naturally when you find one girl you like in the group, you want to find reasons to care about the others and the show does exactly that. It does a fine job of portraying them in a more subtle and natural way with relatable issues which made the girls here endearing and fun to watch without being overly obnoxious or unlikable and not feeling like shallow characters. They have some depth to their personalities and have more going on with them than meets the eye instead of merely identifying with one particular character trait or cliche. No one is constantly spouting deadpan one liners even if they were somewhat cute or comedic before. But that’s not to say the show isn’t without its humor. The funny moments can be utterly hilarious with the characters being fun and goofy with playful banter whether that be hanging out in the club room or working hard on becoming school idols. Coupled with good dialogue, interactions are unique and quirky without feeling overdone and this leads to the show having a smooth and energetic pacing throughout which complements well with the lighthearted tone. The voice actresses really did a great job in bringing these characters to life adding a bit more detail and personality to them such as the subtle playfulness in Kanata’s voice when she’s sleeping or the little mumbles and outbursts from Kasumi whenever she’s feeling frustrated.  Handling of character drama has shown great improvement compared to previous first seasons as they feel genuine and built up with resolutions that feel more down to earth while not being forced down my throat with excessive melodrama or unnatural reactions. But it’s not smooth sailing all the way through as the conflict in the last few episodes felt uneven at times and a bit out of place given how far things went which clashed with the consistently toned down nature of the rest of the show. While it did provide some interesting and insightful context to the mindset of a certain character, there’s a lingering thought that it could’ve been handled in a less bothersome way.  Now onto the girls themselves who make up the wonderful cast of Nijigasaki:  First Years - Kasumi serves as the cute lovable goofball of the group. I won’t lie when I say that she might easily be one of the funniest and most entertaining characters I’ve ever seen. I appreciate the studio for going the extra mile in emphasizing and exaggerating her movements and facial expressions by adding in some nuanced animation in many of her scenes to strengthen the fact that she’s over the top and hilarious. While there are some obvious similarities that can be drawn to Nico, there is a bit of distinction between them. Kasumi strives to be the cutest idol but doesn’t put up a facade or have an alternate personality. She might be overenthusiastic and flamboyant at times (albeit for comedic purposes) but she is self-aware about other people’s feelings and deep down, she can be helpful to her friends and pull through when it matters. Rina is someone who is good with using technology and has excellent programming skills but she has difficulty expressing her emotions and making friends. She is a unique character to the series being the first who covers her face during performances. Shizuku has a passion for acting and because of this she is in the drama club. But below her calm exterior lies someone who is afraid to show and express her true self to others. The way in which the show portrayed her inner monologue is commendable as it works well both visually and thematically. As far as first year trios go in this franchise, I find Nijigasaki’s to be quite compelling as their character growth is apparent and carries over to the later episodes with a lasting impact. Rina and Shizuku’s episodes in particular coupled with their performances and songs were the ones that stood out to me as some of the strongest in the show and perhaps the franchise as a whole.  Second Years - Setsuna is a standout character as she is a stunningly beautiful and passionate girl who performs in the first episode and is an inspiration for Ayumu and Yuu. She has a serious and hardworking side to her but also an energetic and vibrant personality. Plus she happens to be a fan of anime which earns some points in my book. Now concerning Ayumu...one may be led to believe that she serves as the lively leader of this Love Live group like how Honoka or Chika were for theirs, however, she is not at all similar to either of them. While those two characters shared attributes of being energetic and poised on becoming school idols, Ayumu is more shy and easily embarrassed. I would say that her friend Yuu serves the leadership role better and actively does so throughout the show. While she does have a strong attachment and reliance towards Yuu, she is a rather sweet and adorable person especially when she’s doing the Ayu-bun. Ai is the helpful and friendly athletic type. She has a strange affinity for puns though thankfully, this quirk of hers is not overused. With her laid back personality and positive attitude, she provides an added level of fun and liveliness to the group.  Third Years - Kanata has an easy going and playful personality. She seemingly looks like a girl who only loves to sleep a lot and is not particularly flexible but there is more going on with her that results in this. It paints her as a far more interesting character than at first glance. Karin is a model with a more mature and cool headed personality who sort of serves as the Nozomi of the group i.e. the big sister figure who quietly watches from behind the scenes which is a welcome homage to the original. Despite her calm demeanor, she has a sweet and more innocent side to her. Emma is a girl from Switzerland who loves eating food. She has a kind and understanding personality which allows her to play a more supportive role in the group.  Normally that would be it for the main cast, but in Nijigasaki there are now 10 main girls instead of the usual 9. It seems Love Live has indeed added one more to their already copious roster of female characters which at first glance would seem rather trivial but the way she’s utilized in the story is quite intriguing. Yuu more or less serves as a self-insert lens for the audience as well as someone for Ayumu to bounce off of. She is all about supporting her best friend and everyone else in the group and that can also be said for any fan who wants to cheer for these girls’ success. But she is not just a blank slate or a useless character. Even though Yuu herself does not want to become a school idol, she plays a pivotal role in bringing together several members acting as both a voice of reason and of motivation leading to some emotionally satisfying moments (and building up her harem all the same). She has a likable and charming personality while being reliable which makes her interactions all the more meaningful and in some cases absolutely hilarious.  Of course it wouldn’t be Love Live without the music and suffice to say there are some straight bangers in this one. While there are some that stood out to me more than others (CHASE!, Solitude Rain, etc.), I somehow found myself listening to all of them an unhealthy amount of times. Now I liked quite a few songs from both the original group and Sunshine, but this...just hits different. Compared to previous entries which had primarily group songs, Nijigasaki focuses more on the individual with solos for each character reflecting their own ‘color’ and personality. This is even more emphasized by the different types of music they sing and their styles of performance such as the vocaloid-esque display from Rina or the stunning theatrical from Shizuku which all showcase the exuberant appeal of idols. Each one feels like a music video with its aesthetic, lighting, visual cuts and dynamic camera. As expected from this series, there is a keen eye for detail in the directing and choreography as well as overall fluidity with hair, mouth movement, and facial expressions. Everything matches up well with the lyrics. Since the main theme seems to be the girls coming together to represent a rainbow, the songs themselves signify each member being honest with themselves, moving forward, and ultimately accepting what they can bring to the group as a different color and standing side by side. That being said, while the new style is extravagant, it is noticeably different from past entries as most of the songs are not performed in reality but rather in a ‘dreamlike’ world where visuals are exaggerated. There also isn’t the familiar group song setting. In previous shows, the girls from μ's and Aqours had the capability of bouncing off one another. Here they have to perform alone which they do address in the show and have legitimate concerns for. But despite the fact that they are performing by themselves, I never got a sense that it was an inferior experience to past shows because each individual was able to stand out thanks to the emotional support from the other members of their group and the gradual buildup of their characterization from each of their arcs. Credit to the show, everyone seems to be on equal footing making it feel all the more worthwhile to believe that if the time comes for them to perform together, they can all stand proudly as school idols. Coupled with smooth and improved animation and amazing performances from the voice actresses, every live show is distinct and riveting. The OP “Nijiiro Passions!” is bursting with energy and excitement coupled with gorgeous visuals and for lack of a better term ‘pizzazz’ while the ED “NEO SKY, NEO MAP!” has its somber yet uplifting tone with vocals from each character giving the episodes a strong sense of closure. Both are worthy additions to an already stellar lineup of OPs and EDs in this franchise. The soundtrack is also great as it fits the upbeat and energetic scenes as well as some of the more somber moments pretty well.  To sum up, Love Live Nijigasaki has proven itself to be a worthy addition to this franchise. It stands to reason that both Love Live fans and non-fans will likely find this to be a solid if not a fantastic entry and may end up being a little surprised by it. It certainly has a case for being the best. Despite whatever hiccups there were along the way, it was an absolute joy to watch. For newcomers, this can serve as a good starting point to the series as prior knowledge of past shows is not necessary. From the smooth and clean art style, improved animation, a different and fresh story, amazing songs, likable and memorable characters...it’s the full package. It improves on what the other entries lacked while also being distinct, having its own identity, and all while adding some new twists to the formula. It managed to implement all these changes yet none of them I feel were unwarranted and it was still able to maintain the charm Love Live has with its enjoyable goofy moments. Sure idol anime might not be everyone’s cup of tea but as someone who enjoys a more lighthearted show with cute characters that have a lot of personality and passion, this is one of if not the best I’ve seen. It managed to become a surprisingly meaningful experience and showed me that this franchise still has so much more enthusiasm to express.;Recommended
2;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;10;Love Live Nijigaku represents the next stage in the evolution of the best ongoing idol franchise. It takes everything we know and love about the series to new heights and breathes new life into the Love Live series.   Disclaimer, when it comes to idol shows, I am very easy to please. Cute girls, good songs and good performances are really all I look for. That’s why I was pleasantly surprised to see how much more Nijigaku contained. If you’ve seen sunshine and SIP, which you most likely have if you’re here, you’ll recall how fluffy and cutesy those shows were. While we had the drama of the school being forced to shut down in both seasons, there never really felt like there was drama or tension among the girls.  Nijigaku deviates from that trend and actually introduces some pretty overt yuri romance/love triangle type situations with Ayumu, Yuu and Setsuna which I really liked. I felt like the tension between the three of them throughout the second half of the series was the best Love Live has ever been at. The story in general feels a bit more mature this time around. Of course there’s still the usual dramatisations that we have come to know and love, but in general things feel much more natural.  Sunrise went with a different art-style this time around, which I personally think is the best LL has ever looked. I liked Sunshine’s art over SIP, but would take this over both of the previous series. It feels much more “real” rather than the uber cutsey nature of Sunshine. The CGI also needs to be applauded. We have come a LONG way since the days of SIP in terms of quality CGI. At times, I could not even distinguish the CG from the drawn images.  Nijigaku has to be in my top 5 shows of the season and was probably the second or third most anticipated on a weekly basis. I think this season was an evolution for the franchise and bodes well for the future of one of my favourite idol groups. I’m looking forward to seeing what new heights the girls and this series reach. Love Live Nijigasaki gets 10 mics out of 10.;Recommended
3;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;dlxuniuniu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dlxuniuniu;9;"„Never get dragged into Love Live! idol hell or your wallet will hate you.” - everyone who has already spent too much on Love Live!  After the Aqours movie ""Over the Rainbow"" (Love Live! Sunshine!!) in 2019 we finally get a Love Live! continuation with a new setting. All those fans who are already familiar with the Love Live! mobile games know what Nijigasaki is about. Even if the main goal is not the Love Live! competition this time, we feel that our girls are doing their best to make everyone happy. Lean back, relax and just enjoy the wonderful world and music of Nijigaku! The “Nijigasaki High School Idol Club” initially started with 5 members led by Setsuna Yuki (she is the same person as Nana Nakagawa, the student council president). But because of different goals and opinions, it was dissolved. Thanks to Yuu Takasaki, later becoming the manager of the group, it was brought back to life. The main difference to the previous Love Live! series is the solo idol performing by each of them. Since there is no threat of closing the school here, it is not necessary to win the Love Live! competition, our solo idols do not pursue this goal. Although they are rivals through their solo careers, they support and push each other. The deep friendship can be clearly felt. The Niji adaptation focuses on our nine idols and their manager and song composer Yuu. She is the budding school idol enthusiast of Nijigasaki High School. Her love for school idols blossomed after seeing the performance “CHASE” of the legendary school idol, Setsuna Yuki. She is Ayumu's inseparable childhood friend, the two support each other in every situation. The dynamic relationship between Yuu and Ayumu is particularly striking. Ayumu quickly becomes jealous when Yuu is hanging out with Setsuna. After stumbled upon a school idol performance for the first time with Yuu, a new path suddenly appears in her world. Despite not being able to sing or dance, Ayumu would nevertheless venture on to become a school idol herself. She is a hardworking girl that puts her everything into what she does. She tries her best to be helpful to others. In most of the full unit songs from Nijigasaki, Ayumu is also the person taking the center place most of the time. The third second year of them is the most popular idol Setsuna. She has an energetic smile and a distinctive style of performing. With her love for anime, manga and video games, she shares the same interest with us. She lights up whenever she is asked a question about these. She has not only a lot of knowledge about idols, but is also one of the best in the other school subjects too. Ai (愛-LOVE) is someone who’s always in a good mood and can cheer you up with her incredibly sociable attitude. Because she is a gyaru, she can be mistaken as the type to skip school or be rebellious. However, she has very good grades and is excellent at sports as well. She is also very caring, especially with her family and friends. Rina is Ai’s best friend. She admires Ai for her confidence and friendliness since she Rina is not good at conveying emotions on her face. During the performances on stage, she wears her self-created “Rina-chan Board” to show all the emotions. As a school idol, she hopes that people will cheer for her so she can show everyone her true smile. Another first year is Shizuku, our level-headed and mature honor student. She is considered a traditional Japanese beauty with her polite attitude. Besides dancing and singing, she is talented in acting and performing in plays, even being a member of the school's theater club. “Kasukasu” (she doesn't like this nickname actually) had always dreamed of becoming an idol. She is the one always believed in the club and is determined to keep the dream alive. Kasumi loves all cute things, her love for idols is unrivaled in strength and inspiration. She wants to be number one in any competition she's in, and often resorts to cheating or even sabotage to achieve that goal. If you liked Nico-Nico-Nii from School Idol Project, you will love Kasu-Kasu-Miin. Let’s take a look at our third years starting with the most mature girl in the whole Love Live! Series: Karin Asaka. She can use her adult-like looks to her advantage. Karin often tries to tease her underclassmen, or teach them lessons on how to be sexy and cool like her. Besides being a school idol, she works as a model for magazines. Her roommate Emma from Switzerland has the biggest Bazookas of the whole Love Live! Franchise, even bigger than our shrine maiden Nozomi. Coming from a family with eight younger siblings, she would leave her home country to pursue becoming a school idol in Japan. Emma is very cheerful, pleasant, and tries to look after the other idols. She aims to be encouraging and to help others smile. Finally, we have my favorite character from Niji: Sleepy Goddess Kanata. Her little sister Haruka can also be seen in the anime. As the nickname suggests, Kanata loves sleeping and short power naps. At times, she will appear to be sleeping but is actually awake and listening to what's going on around her. Despite seeming always tired, Kanata is motivated as a school idol by her younger sister and others' praise. She takes care of the others, she works hard, she can cook, she is the ""sleeping beauty"". Without the help of many other students and friends, our idols would not be able to realize their dream. In addition to our ten members of the club, we see many other support characters. They also give everything to make the perfect show possible!  If you are already familiar with the art style from the previous Love Live! series, you will feel comfortable right away here as well. Love Live! always gives you a colorful and beautiful animation. I have to admit that there are small differences if you compare the style with School Idol Project! and Sunshine!! Nevertheless, you can still directly say after first sight: This is Love Live! It’s beautiful!  What is very important for every idol anime is the music. Love Live! has never disappointed us in this point, we experience the wonderful music world of the idols once again here. Since Niji focuses on solo idols, we hear a lot of solo songs. From the fiery ""Chase"" from Setsuna to the beautiful ""Butterfly"" from Kanata, each girl shows us her personality with her own song. The singles are just nice to listen to. But this anime does not only delight us with singles, with the OP ""Nijiiro Passions!"" and ED ""NEO SKY, NEO MAP!"" we also get to hear two wonderful group songs. The Love Live! feeling can be felt directly, they managed to win our hearts with stunning music again!  As someone who loves the idol group “μ's” more than anything and also enjoy “Aqours” a lot, Niji was definitely a must-watch for me. I always have a lot of fun watching and following Love Live! When the game ""Love Live! School Idol Festival ALL STARS"" was released on the Japanese Playstore, I was already able to find out a lot about our Niji members. But seeing them animated is a much bigger highlight and way better! Although I'm not a big fan of solo songs, I still loved the singles. But of course, the OP and ED were just overwhelming. The Love Live! hell has a tight grip on me, but I love this hell. I can and will not escape from it!  For every Love Live! fan there is no question whether Niji is worth watching, you have to do it! For those who has not been with Love Live! familiar before, I recommend starting with School Idol Project! first to find out how everything started. However, it is not necessary since in the anime Niji and μ's have no connection in common. So just enjoy Love Live! All parts are great!  In the end, I'm curious to see whether we will see the second season of Niji (not announced yet, but I am convinced it will happen) or even the latest project Love Live! Super Star !! first. No matter which one it will be, all are SUPER!";Recommended

Also, how they put characters to this anime, it portait very-very powerful self-view as themselves.  one point thats very weak for this anime is that approach between characters with other characters. just they need to do more for that plothole.  nah im not reffering this anime story as its game story (since i've never actually read the game story itself.);Recommended
5;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Squid1030;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Squid1030;9;Reviews in 100 words or less: First, the animation. Nijigasaki really blew it out of the park. Go watch an old muse mv, you'll see what I mean. Beyond that, I really wasn't a fan of the beginning episode structure (introduce character, minor problem with character, they sing away their problems), but after they got into the actual story, the quality tripled. In both the storyline and studio decisions (not competing, solo idols), their message was that there isn't one clear answer to success, which resonated deeply with me. Overall, a slow start but definitely a 10 at the end. S2 definitely on track for 10!;Recommended
6;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;PhantasmKarin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PhantasmKarin;7;As someone who has been stuck in idol hell for almost four years, I must say that this new generation has a good story and is full of surprises. Although the main point of this show is probably to promote their game, they still made a different story from the previous generation, and it was something new that made the rise of this show.  In terms of the story, it was nice to see something new in Love Live with major problems that are different from the previous generation, μ's and Aqours. It was interesting to watch how their progress to become a school idol being told in separate episodes. Not to mention, we got to see ourselves as a school idol manager in this show is a rare sight.  For art or animation, it was pretty mediocre since there's a lot of difference compared to previous Love Lives (other than the CG animation), and it was kind of a disappointment where they didn't animate the 3D models during the important shows (i tried not to write a spoiler, either way, that one itself stand my reason to give this show a solid 7). Apart from that, the animation still looks good for the most part. This franchise keeps making money from their games and their lives, i'm sure it was worth it with the CG visuals.  If we talk about sound, then it was good, nothing special. The voice actresses also voiced their characters really well. Nothing much to worry about. For the songs in every episode, it was great. I haven't played the game but to think that they had nice songs to listen to, i might as well give it a try soon.  Character development in this one was amazing yet lame at the same time. We got to see each character's problem throughout the series, they all got their own episode, but how they managed to become school idol in this series is very predictable, it's not like i have a complaint but it's boring how i wait every week and all i got was a very wack episode. Yes i know they are supposed to be a solo idol but still, the forced drama and whatsoever, totally not my type. Other than that, it was still enjoyable.  I enjoyed their performances in several episodes and they had nice songs. By far, Setsuna wins my heart on this one, her charming character really warms my heart, and she's also had two personalities which are why, her character is so relatable at some point. Nijigaku starts to grow a bit on me, really enjoyable to fill up my Saturday's mood, probably because i haven't watched any idol anime other than Sunshine back in the days.  Overall it was a great ride watching this. I'm also glad i can appreciate the voice actresses' works on this one like it rarely happened to me. It was fun while it lasted, and totally worth watching for those who play the game. If there's an announcement for a second season to happen in the future then i hope they make this show more interesting by making a new character an appearance since there are still more characters in the game that haven't been introduced yet. For now, all i can do is wait for their other work, Love Live Superstar, i hope it won't be a letdown, since they only have fewer members compared to other Love Live groups.;Recommended
7;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;superp2222;https://myanimelist.net/profile/superp2222;9;Nijigasaki was undoubtedly the most original and unique member of the Love Live franchise, for the first time, their idols don't perform as a group, but as nine individual Solo Idols, each shining with their own unique spark. It brings about the catalyst for originality that this series wasn't able to execute with its predecessor Sunshine, and it paves the way for the most original, well-rounded character development this series has seen so far.    Plot As I mentioned earlier, I believe that Nijigasaki has the most well fleshed-out plot of all of the Love Live franchise so far. Why do I say this? Because it no longer clings to the past. Sunshine suffered a lack of originality because like its fanbase, the producers couldn't move on from the original Love Live, that is why Sunshine's plot revolved around Aqours trying to find their own individuality. However, here, there is no mention of previous groups, Nijigasaki starts from a completely clean slate and tries to establish their status from the ground up. They don't even attend Love Live, the namesake school idol competition. Instead, they create their own Festival, the School Idol Festival, as a celebration of the joys of Music through Idols. This unique premise immdiately screams to the audience that they are not like their predecessors—they are new.  As for the actual progression of events itself, it takes on a different style because of the individuality of each idol. Nijigasaki's selling point is that they are unable to operate as a joint group because of their clashing personalities, that is why they operate as solo idols. We spend the first 9 episodes of the show seeing just why that is how this club operates, I'll be diving into more detail about the intricacies later, but with 9 episodes gone, all that's left for Nijigasaki to do was blend them together to see how they interact, right? __Wrong, totally wrong.__ Instead of taking the predictable approach of melding the 9 solo idols, the anime instead decides to now cast its light on the protagonist Yuu. Who, since she isn't an idol, has been out of the spotlight this whole time. The show paints how the progression of these idols' personalities have caused a rift in Yuu and her childhood friend Ayumu, and graciously paints a clean and heartwarming resolution to this conflict. Just in time for the collection of all the personalities to amass in the highly anticipated School Idol Festival on the last episode. It created for a satisfying and well-felt end to the entire series, and only leaves the viewer yearning for more.  Characters  This iteration of Love Live, as I mentioned, has the most rounded out cast of characters I've ever seen. They are introduced in a manner such that players of the gacha/rhythm game School Idol Festival All Stars would instantly be able to insert into, but also in a manner so that newcomers to this series would also be able to instantly see their uniqueness. I'll go over them one-by-one.  While Yuu herself only received character development when her childhood friend Ayumu did, she's technically the insert persona of us, the player from All Stars, where this series originated. She's a catalyst for change, and since she's not an idol, its the best they can do.  As Yuu's childhood friend, Ayumu easily recieves the most development out of all of the idols, her personality paints her as this shy yet sweet cinnamon roll who relied on Yuu to lead her to her passion of School Idols, as Yuu gets more heavily involved in the Club, Ayumu goes through a metamorphosis, painting her new individuality while also a gratefulness of Yuu's help to her all this time. Her innocent personality combined with her reliance on Yuu makes for a character arc that tugs at your feels stronger than any character arc in the series.  Kasumi remains, as I unfortunately must point out, a bit left out. Her character arc revolves around her and Yuu attempting to revive the defunct School Idol Club, while also illustrating Kasumi's goal of becoming the cutest school idol around. While her arc itself isn't that great, the style of her personality made her a second coming of the meme goddess Nico Yazawa herself and quickly placed her as the prime candidate for many of Love Live's running jokes, such as the infamous photobomb and her Kasumi box  Setsuna's arc revolves her two conflicting identities within Nijigasaki, as the head of the Student Council Nana Nakagawa, and as the dominant school idol Setsuna Yuki. In her arc we see Yuu help her manage the conflicting personalities her two identities demand while also re-embracing her passion of singing as a school idol. Her insert song reflects this, as it is riddled with large jumps across entire vocal ranges. As a musician myself, I know that making a vocalist jump distances Setsuna jumped in _Dive!_ was mostly taboo until the modern era of music, and even still is only cleanly executable by very profoundly talented singers. Which adds to her status as a well-established school idol.  Ai's arc talks all about how she orbited the club as a helper from behind the scenes, there to try to get her friend Rina to become an Idol, but eventually fell a bit too close to the planet that is Idols. It paints a vivid picture of how she should try stuff for herself as well instead of always helping others for the sake of being a nice person.  Emma's arc painted her in a manner that no one saw coming. While it was established she was a Swiss transfer student who came to Japan to try to become a school idol, the anime reveals that it was really Karin who helped her achieve that dream, painting both characters in a manner that both the games and previous knowledge never has before. Her insert song reflects her gratitude and grace, while still maintaining the Swiss folk melodies that was present in her original live _Evergreen_. Rest assured the trend of the Foreign Student lives on in her blood.  Rina's arc quickly captured the hearts of many, including mine, and made her indisputably one of the characters with the most fleshed-out arcs of the entire series, revolving around her inability to express emotions through her face, we follow her as she tries desperately to fit in while also despairing at her lack of emotions. Her insert song's lyrics suggest that while it's not perfect, its the best she can do so far and she wishes to keep on connecting until she can truly smile without her board.  Kanata's arc, like some of the other arcs mentioned so far, had many of us on our heels. It was known that Kanata's signature quirk was her tendency to sleep. The anime not only provided us an explanation for her quirk, but also shaped it into an immersive character arc that left many fans seeing Kanata in a completely new light. Thank you Haruka, you've made your big sister proud.  Shizuku's arc raised her status within the community's perception of the school idols. Many people thought that she was often extremely flat since her entire personality revolves her being a literal drama queen and nothing else. However, the anime adds a layer of complexity to her passion, painting her reluctance to perform due to stage fright as a split persona, and as a musician, I related to her so much. It's no secret that public performance, whether it be public speaking or a public display of talent has been ranked more feared than death, and seeing Shizuku overpower a force that once held me back is not only resolving but also strengthened her persona to the point in which many members of the Love Live fandom instantly respected her after her arc.  Last but not least, we have fashionista Karin. Often painted for her picture of perfection (literally since she's a model). In the games she was indeed a seemingly perfect person, with no evidence of flaws, otherwise an inhuman being. But the anime decided to give her flaws, drawing her persona more down-to-earth. Painting the conflict that rises between your outer and inner self. Now she's not only revered for her over 9000 Ara Ara vibes, but also her uncanny inability to navigate. Dear god she reminds me of Leon from Pokemon so much  Music and Art  Love Live once again outdid themselves in this category. Each and every insert song was so vibrant in color and sound that it was a spectacular outburst of passion. While the actual art style feels like it simplified since Sunshine, it was painted with much more vibrant colors, once again reinforcing the fact that Nijigasaki sings in all the colors of a rainbow. As for the music itself, it has certainly become a lot more immersive. Each insert song attuned to the character's individual personalities. Smooth and melodic for Ayumu, Swing and upbeat for Kasumi, Intense and fiery for Setsuna, A Blast of Electric guitars for Ai, Traditional Swiss for Emma, Electronic for Rina, Sleepy and Soothing for Kanata, Orchestral for Shizuku, and Techno and beat-heavy for Karin. Each insert song played a key role in establishing each Idol's individuality and did so expertly  Overall, this Love Live has to be the best iteration I've seen so far, its plot is lined with detail and its originality is through the roof, each character received substantial development compared to its predecessor and I can't wait for Shioriko's inevitable entry into the series.;Recommended
8;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Naneo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naneo;10;This anime is the third series of Love Live franchise. But you can't really call it the sequel to the previous one. This one feels like its a spin off. They didn't follow the usual emotional story. This is how you expect an idol anime to be about. Just an anime filled with content that related to idol. And not an anime that filled with heavy drama. I mean Nijigasaki is created for a mobile games at first, so it would be logical if they want to invite gamer viewer into the idol genre. As a long fan of the LL franchise, I got a great time watching this one without the need to prepare my mental emotion so I can continue watching the story unfold.  Although I say that the story isn't heavy, it is still worth watching. Simple everyday problem in which you can relate too. The individual element of the story like comedy is stand out too. I can't stop smiling and laughing everytime I watch an episode. Either it's because the jokes or it's because their wholesomeness. Every characters help each other in here, every characters also help driven the plot. No one is being left out. And yeah I really love that. Its always a pleasure to watch how friendship is made, especially surrounding cute anime girls. You can kinda watch the episode randomly except for the early and last episodes. Because in my experience I accidentally skipped one episode and it's fine. Tho it's gonna be a little weird when the preview roll in.  Love Live is famous for having a lot of main characters in one anime. Nijigasaki is not an exception. We got 9+1 girls. I say 9+1 because 9 idol that sing like the previous Love Live series and 1 supporter. This supporting character is brand new and she play a big role inside the story, she is the viewer. Without her, or should I say us the fans, these idol is nothing. And I think its a great addition to make the viewer realize they are important too. It is literally a self insert character but in a good way. All the characters design and personality is top tier. Everyone looks beautiful with their own persona. We have tomboy, gyaru, tsundere, onee-san, childhood friend, foreigner, you name it. Maybe you can also search for your waifu in here.  This is an idol anime, so surely their song would be good right? Absolutely. I find myself vibing to the OP and ED everytime, and sometimes sing along too if I'm alone. Really like how its summed up the mood of the anime itself. I already know some of the song they here thanks to their games. And now I know the story behind them, I love it even more. Every characters have a chance to shine and sing on each of their respectively episode. Gotta give the thumbs up to every seiyuu involved because they are multitalented as hell. Not to mention this idol exist in real life too, this mean you can enjoy their amazing concert without the need to go into the anime world.  Beautiful animation as expected from Love Live, they never disappoint. The CGI when they dance is great, the backgrounds art is also great. I love how colorful the Nijigasaki world is. Because you know, Niji means rainbow in Japanese. Even every members icon color match the Niji too. And they proudly present that in the ED animation with umbrellas.  I really really enjoy watching this anime, looking forward to continue watching the 2nd season. Even though I've been in the Love Live fandom for 3 years now, this is my first time watching Nijigasaki. Already know everyone name and personality doesn't change the fun experience. Because there's a lot of new things I discover while watching. So should you consider watch this? If you want to know more about idol, then give it a go. Like I said above, this can be a good introduction anime about how most idol anime progress. Thank you for reading my review.;Recommended
9;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;KawaiiIsLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KawaiiIsLife;10;"Love Live: Nijigasaki is simply the best idol show we've seen since the original Love Live finished airing in 2014. I expected the show would be a cool tie in to the Love Live School Idol Festival games, and would be mostly made to appeal to those who play them and that's about it, but those proved to be wrong. Instead, we got a show that introduced (or fleshed out if you already knew them from the games) a captivating cast of idols, completely blew up the well and tried formula of idol shows (especially Love Live itself), and gave us possibly the best 3D animation seen to date in any anime.  Firstly before talking about the plot and characters, I think it's important to talk about the animation quality of Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai which is arguably it's strongest point. One of the often critiques of the Love Live shows has been about it's animation quality, and particularly it's 3D animation quality. All of those critiques were squashed by this show. Nijigasaki rarely has a poor quality 2D frame (unlike the much lower budget 1st season of the original Love Live), and it's 3D animation is simply mind blowing. The jump in quality of 3D that was made in only three years since Love Live Sunshine ended by Sunrise is seriously hard to believe. Unlike the previous two Love Live series, Nijigasaki created a formula in which most episodes ended with an insert song performance by one of the idols. These insert songs are almost entirely done in 3D, rather than the standard of the series which is to mix 2D (for closeups) and 3D for zoom out shots. The 3D models, motion, landscapes, and effects are simply unrivaled with any anime that I have seen to date. These insert songs are also far more exaggerated then we have seen in previous incantations of the series and do a better job in my opinion of being truly memorable performances. The overall aesthetic of the show is quite different than the previous Love Lives as well with the color palette choice giving it a unique feel.  The story of Nijigasaki is completely different from the previous two series. There are zero direct references to either of the original series (a huge criticism of Sunshine), and the show tries to make it very clear right from the get go that the ultimate goal of these girls is not the same as in the previous series. There's also a new element to the show that I feel was a strong choice by Sunrise. The main plot driver of the show for the first time in Love Live, is not the leader of the group, but instead a girl who isn't actually an idol or really a part of the group. The show has much more of a third person vibe for this reason as you feel more like you are watching the plot and character development from an outsider perspective than in the previous shows. While the show does have some very clear callbacks to plot elements from the previous two, it changes them up enough that they don't feel samey. There is also definitely a more ""mature"" vibe to the show than the previous ones, especially in regards to some of the animation and the Yuri sub-plot that goes on in the season.  From top to bottom I feel that Nijigasaki has an argument of having the best cast of idols of any Love Live or idol show to date. Unlike the previous spin-off, it feels far less like they just switched around a few of the girls personalities or hair colors and left the overall cast virtually the same. Sunrise also did a spectacular job of developing the girl's characters over the course of the season. You have plenty of reason to be invested in and care about virtually every girl, and they each got at least 1 episode dedicated to furthering their main story line. This was essential in fleshing out the characters of a few girls that I had personally never really cared about before the show from playing the games (Shizuku and Karin specifically.) This time around there are all new anime-girl trope types that we hadn't seen before in Love Live including a kuudere and (soft) yandere character. Ayuumu is also a refreshing change to the role of (defacto) leader of the group, as she's not another orange haired genki subtype, but instead a mishmash of various tropes and a very well-rounded character. Even the girls who feel similar to ones in the past (notably Kasumi who is quite similar to Nico) are different enough that they don't come off as retreads.  Overall, there is something for virtually everyone in this show. If you are into Love Live, you are going to absolutely love Nijigasaki. If you like idol shows, you will probably love the insert songs as well as the idols. If you are a fan of school slice of life/moe, you will like the melodrama and story as well as the moe (though it's not quite as pushed as the previous two series yet.) I highly recommend giving Love Live: Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai a watch.  P.S. I thought episode 7 was the best of the series by a mile.";Recommended
10;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;8;"Whoa. I...I was honestly not expecting this anime to be this good. Hell, I never expected to even watch it, let alone complete it! Now, originally, I hadn't planned to go anywhere near this, as I mentioned previously that I never liked the Love Live franchise. It just felt too cheesy and overly saccharine for my tastes, and the first two seasons, Love Live: School Idol Project and Love Live Sunshine, have a certain thing that I have a very visceral hatred for, which is characters grabbing other peoples' boobs without their consent and playing the sexual harassment for comedy. Yeah...no. I can't stand that in any way, shape, or form, and yes, I know the Love Live franchise has much more to offer than that, but those elements are a HUGE turn off for me, and I stay the hell away from any anime that has that trope in it. That's the reason why I'll never go near shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Nagi no Asukara, Seven Deadly Sins, Adachi and Shimamura, Strike Witches, and many others. But hey, if you like the other Love Live seasons, cool! More power to you! They may not be for me, but the Love Live franchise has become massively popular since the first anime aired in 2013, and there's no fighting big successes. That being said, two more Love Live seasons were announced, this one included, and assuming that this one was going to have those creepy elements as well, I wasn't going to go anywhere near it, and I had planned to watch other shows.  So how did I wind up watching Love Live: Nijigasaki High School Idol Club in its entirety? Well, two things: One, boredom, and two, I dropped several shows I had intended to watch, one of which had a really annoying main character who did nothing but whine, screech, and act like a brat and just got on my nerves every time she appeared on screen (The Day I Became a God), and the other one started going in really questionable directions and apparently never recovered (Wandering Witch). Then I started hearing that the Love Live Nijigasaki anime was turning out to be really good, so I was bored, and I thought ""What the hell? I might as well try it out and give it a fair shot."" So I watched the first episode. Then another. Then another. And before I knew it, I saw the entire show, and to my MASSIVE relief, this show doesn't have a SINGLE instance of boob groping or sexual harassment played for comedy. THANK GOD!! This is what I've been waiting for!! I still have no intention of watching the original SIP or Sunshine, but I did feel somewhat guilty about not getting into the franchise, as several friends and people I know really love the franchise, flaws and all. Now, any guilt I once had is now assuaged, as not only have I finally completed a Love Live anime series in its entirety, I found one I actually love!  Alright, enough of my personal history with it. Let's talk about what this iteration is about, shall we? Two best friends, Yu Takasaki and Ayumu Uehara, have recently become fans of school idols after seeing one, Setsuna Yuki, perform live. They see if they can find the school idol club in their school...only to find that it's been shut down. Undeterred, the duo decide to start their own school idol club themselves, and through trial and error, even recruit the previous members of the old school idol club, who had broken up due to a falling out. But rather than form one big group and enter competitions, the girls pursue their own individual paths as school idols, learning the ins and outs of the entertainment industry such as making promotional videos, holding concerts, putting themselves out there, practicing singing and dancing, and so on. Every day brings something new as the girls become school idols to have fun and see what it's all about. Unlike the previous Love Live series, there's no dramatic plot to save the school from being closed nor are the girls participating in any competitions, so the stakes are much lower and more grounded this time around.  Now, if you're a hardcore Love Live fan, you'll notice that the animation and art style is different from previous Love Live anime. You're not seeing things, and there's a reason for that. Unlike SIP and Sunshine, Love Live Nijigasaki (I'm calling it that rather than its much longer original title for the sake of convenience) is directed, written, scripted, and animated by a completely different group of people. Yes, Sunrise still does the animation, but a different set of animators were brought on to animate this particular season. You'll notice that the character designs are simpler, slightly less refined, and with less emphasis on things like the color in their cheeks or the detail in their eyes. But the simpler character designs also allow for more fluidity and making the character movement feel much more dynamic. It also helps that the animators always slip in little easter eggs that reference the cell phone game, the backgrounds are still bright and colorful, though slightly more muted compared to its parent series, and it makes good use of dynamic camera angles and lighting during particularly important scenes. One thing that Love Live fans in general feel that this series vastly improved on compared to the original two seasons is the CGI. These days, most anime companies prefer to render characters in computer generated images whenever they're dancing rather than actually animating them themselves due to cutting costs and wanting to make things easier. But early idol shows had really bad CGI that had really wonky movements and made the characters look more like plastic knockoff barbie dolls, complete with weird faces. None of this is present here. Not only are the CGI models of the girls much more dynamic, they actually actually blend surprisingly well with the 2D scenery for once and the models actually resemble the characters.  Of course, with this being a music anime, the soundtrack has to carry the show, because of it doesn't, it'll bring the show down. The background music is pretty versatile, with plenty of sweeping orchestras and heavy usage of instruments like oboes, flutes, pianos, electric guitars, and so on. I admit I'm kind of a sucker for orchestras. That being said, I liked many of the songs okay, as they're mostly well sung and fit the characters well, but taste is subjective, and while I like them just fine, others will likely dismiss them as just generic bubblegum girl pop numbers. Though if you ask me, I'd much rather listen to the Love Live Nijigasaki songs over, say, anything Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry sings these days.  While I admit to not having seen SIP or Sunshine beyond their first episodes, one thing I've noticed upon researching these seasons is that they often had problems with focusing too much on certain characters while not focusing enough on others that really needed proper character development. With large ensemble casts, it can be hard to find that balance where you need to develop every character and show what they're like in order to make your audience care about them. Thankfully, while not without its own issues, the Nijigasaki cast is free of this. Every character gets their own focus episode, along with an insert song as the cherry on top, and all of them get nicely fleshed out, receiving healthy amounts of development that make them feel like they're more than just a single archetype. Ironically, the mobile game that this series is based on is notorious for not really bothering to flesh out the Nijigasaki cast in any meaningful way. The staff on the anime seemed to realize that this was a problem and rectified it ten fold. I admit to not having played the game, but after being impressed by the levels of characterization the girls received here, I can only imagine what the mobile game's handling of them must have been like. Nevertheless, the show has a great cast of characters, and while many may still consider them generic moeblobs compared to other shows, considering that most moe shows these days are actually trying to put more effort into giving their characters more depth than just one personality trait, I have to give kudos to the staff here for at least bothering to care about what they do. Also, IMHO, Rina is my best girl, with Kanata coming a VERY close second.  Another thing I really respect about the Nijigasaki anime is its writing. Previous seasons often wanted drama a little too badly, bordering on melodramatic at times. I know the original SIP had characters singing rain storms away, shouting their feelings whenever they experience hardship, a huge deal being made of main characters wanting to quit after getting sick once, school idols being considered more important than studying abroad, characters being needlessly mean and wanting to stop school idol clubs from being formed for asinine reasons, and so on. Since the Nijigasaki anime doesn't really have a central conflict like saving their school from being shut down, the stakes are much lower this time around, and I think this was for the better. The Nijigasaki anime shows a lot more restraint when it comes to its drama. For one, whenever the characters have a problem, they actually talk to each other about it and work to resolve it like mature people rather than dragging it out needlessly or throwing hissyfits like toddlers. Nothing is ever blown out of proportion or made into a bigger deal than it is, and the characters behave and act realistically, which is something I really wish more anime would do these days. One reason this anime has a much more subdued atmosphere is that one of the scriptwriters, Jin Tanaka, also worked on shows like Laid-Back Camp and various Pretty Cure series. Tomoyuki Kawamura, who directed the show, previously directed Mitsuboshi Colors and Kamigami no Asobi, and did storyboards for shows like Anne-Happy and the last Gintama movie. Sometimes change can be for the better, and in this case, it was absolutely needed and it worked out perfectly!  That said, as much as I want to lavish with show with all the praise, it's not a perfect show, as it's often held back by its own formula. Every episode goes like this: Character goes about their day, character has a problem, the others help out in some way, character has an epiphany, random song number, end. Granted, execution is everything, and there's really no original spin on anything anymore. Plus, the show does expect you to really stretch your willing suspension of disbelief at certain points. Early on, the characters go into random choreographed, PV-esque musical numbers, complete with colorful visuals and new outfits, even though these music video setpieces make no effort to really tie into what's actually happening, so it makes the transition from regular stuff to music feel very jarring. Later episodes rectify this with having characters actually perform in concerts where they can actually make use of special effects and show them in costume, but I can totally understand feeling very thrown off by it initially. Plus, a later plot point has the girls attempt to hold this super huge festival, managing to put together everything from venues to equipment and costumes perfectly even though the show never explains how they even manage to put together the possibly huge amounts of money to do so.  However, Love Live Nijigasaki's positives more than outweigh its negatives. I'm glad I got to watch this, as now, I finally have a Love Live season that I both actually watched in its entirety, but can proudly say I actually love! If you want to watch any Love Live season at all, but feel put off by some of the decisions the first two seasons made, don't hesitate to check out Love Live: Nijigasaki High School Idol Club if you can. It's a sweet show about girls having fun, and considering how crappy 2020 has been, we could use a bit of subdued sweetness right now.";Recommended
11;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;ReviewsByRyan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ReviewsByRyan;9;Wow is really all I can say as we conclude the first season of Love Live Nijigasaki. I can truly say that THIS was a magical ride for an idol anime! Idol animes, in general, get really bad reviews a lot of the time for being cliché, too bubbly with unrealistic stories and just flat out hate throughout any particular idol shows airing for being ‘stupid’. Going into this show I kept a very open mind about what story would be presented to us. As a Day 1 player of the official All Stars game my excitement was through the roof for this show and deep in my heart I knew they would execute this show near flawlessly. And execute near flawlessly they did!  CHARACTERS: EVERY character in this show was presented with love and care throughout the airing. The story writing and overall direction of the 9+1 was phenomenal and, at times, completely masterful. While I may have a ‘favorite’ out of the girls, you leave this first season feeling a newfound love and satisfaction for each girl, their problems and how they arrive at the solutions to these issues. In past Love Live animes the story has always presented problems to the girls, however my biggest concern always has been the very bubbly, not so realistic conclusion to these problems (this was especially a big concern I had with the entire airing of Love Live Sunshine). Those issues, however, were not present throughout the duration of this 1st season (some may disagree with this statement and say resolutions were still ‘optimistic’ though I believe these problems were still presented a lot better in this generation of Love Live than in previous ones). Also, I must give a BIG thumbs up to the overall maturity change with this group, which I think is attributed to the fact that the producers chose to focus on individualism rather than being collective. This was a controversial change for some who have been used to the collective mindset reigning supreme with µ's and Aqours. That said I think the focus on individualism truly made Nijigasaki, as a whole, a better group and better people. Finally, the first time addition of a manager to the Love Live universe was a welcome change. Yuu truly bought another sense of change and admiration to the overall presentation of Nijigasaki. She was an absolute joy to see on screen!  ART/VISUALS: There were slight modifications in overall art/design of each character from what they looked like in the game to what they ended up looking like in the anime. That said I think the BIGGEST change and adjustment the community had to come to accept was the huge visual change that we have come to expect from Love Live girls. Gone are the days of the extreme shiny eyes and extreme vibrance, being replaced with a slightly more mature look and feel. The vibrance is still there, however this art change was a huge topic of discussion in the months leading up to the animes release. I personally felt this art style matched Niji’s aesthetic perfectly and I was so pleased to see the change and how it ended up meshing so well during this 1st season. I know many people will be stuck on the ‘if it isn’t broke don’t fix it’ thing but change CAN be a good thing, and for Nijigasaki I LOVED the art. Please give the new art a chance as you may come to love it, too. It should also be noted that the visuals/mv’s presented throughout this show were PHENOMINAL. From Setsuna’s first performance all the way to the conclusive festival performance we were treated to a visual treat these last few months. I am truly grateful to all that were involved in these visual productions.  MUSIC: There is not much to say about the music. We have come to expect absolute perfection from Nijigasaki songs and we were given absolute perfection. Each girl debuted one new single song (with a particular jealous girl getting to have two haha). These songs were presented exactly where they needed to be presented and added to the overall high level music Nijigasaki has been producing since they were announced.  Overall, I have to say that if the production level and story writing stays the way it was this season in future seasons this very well could go down as my favorite of the big 3. While µ's will always be my first idol loves and the queens that started this amazing Love Live journey, the journey of Nijigasaki is very bright and could become one of the best journeys to follow. I cannot wait for Season 2!;Recommended
12;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Tabemonogatari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tabemonogatari;9;"By all accounts, this Love Live! spinoff was a complete surprise for me and I absolutely loved it. First, let me explain my point of view; I’m only interested in Love Live! purely for being a slice of life show and I enjoy it for that. I don’t particularly care about idol music/culture, nor do I care about the mobile game this particular season is based on. I’ve seen a lot of reviews more critical of this saying it was disappointing compared to the mobile game’s story, so while that possibly may be, my perspective is of that pertaining only to viewing this as its own thing and I’m judging it only from that view.  Now, as I said before, the mobile game this is based on doesn’t interest me at all, and before this came out I was expecting a half-baked, serviceable show with one dimensional characters that I would have forgotten immediately (keep in mind, this is not a dig at the game if you enjoy it, more so that seems to be the nature of these anime adaptations coming from sources like that). And boy, did watching it turn my thoughts completely around, to the point where Nijigasaki just might be my favorite thing from Love Live! at this point. The series finally has a different presentation to the story, characters actually have depth, underlying conflicts take a more show don’t tell approach, and the general presentation is oozing with passion and creativeness, from the music to the artstyle and environments, etc. It was really refreshing for a series I thought was already treading similar ground with Sunshine (I enjoyed it, don’t get me wrong, but my enjoyment came mostly from the characters, seeing as the story beats were very similar to SIP, and I thought it got a bit heavy with melodrama). I’m not very good at reviews or writing so I’ll try to give my thoughts on each different aspect as many reviews do:  Story: Stories in slice of life shows are a bit hard to give my thoughts on, because a lot of the time they’re either very simple or not much happens and things aren’t that different in the end, so on an objective scale they might not be ‘amazing’ story-wise, but that’s also by design and part of the appeal of the genre. Anyway, I did enjoy the story of this. To add on to what I said before, it was refreshing to finally have a different overarching plot than saving the school the girls are at from shutting down as the previous shows in the series both had, and in fact while there’s a small bit of focus towards the end on finally making a “School Idol Festival” (seeing as that’s the point of the original game), there’s actually not much overarching plot and I think it actually does the show justice. Instead it focuses on individual characters, with each of their motivations and purposes, and really makes it seem like there’s more care put into everybody, rather than having some fan favorites and the rest are put into the background, which I think does wonders for the type of show to have a main cast that’s this large as is standard in idol anime. Now that being said, I do think around the middle it goes a bit formulaic, with the episode structure of it mainly consisting of being about a single character, they go through a mini-arc of sorts, and it ends with a solo song by them. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, the characters’ stories themselves are quite enjoyable, but that is a thing to keep in mind. I do appreciate the dialogue in this, and many times in more serious talks you actually see different aspects of characters rather than them only sticking to one niche; it’s a bit hard to specifically describe without directly watching the show, so you’ll just have to take my word for it. Finally, with the story being more focused on the characters, this also feels much more carefree and really hones in on that feeling that you’re just watching a slice of the life of a bunch of friends that I enjoy this genre so much for, with not needing some huge overarching problem this time around. It’s fun and lighthearted with a focus on the cast’s friendships, which has always been what Love Live! does great (at least for me).  Score: 8/10, keep in mind this score is relative to slice of life shows only  Art: This is absolutely gorgeous. The heavy use of bright, saturated colors, the detailed environments and sets. Everything about how it looks is so good, and perfectly brings the sense of everything being magical and whimsical. The MVs for the songs have reached a point to where the CGI fits in perfectly with the animation (it has come a long way from SIP’s CG looking more like a game), and are overall super unique and creative with how they go about theming the sets used for songs. Another aspect I greatly enjoyed is the character artstyle redesigns. Characters actually have different faces and looks, with each cast member differing greatly from one another.  Score: 9/10  Sound: First off, to compliment the art is the background and scene music/sounds. It does a great job of giving that calming, whimsical vibe as described before and nicely fills the background where otherwise not much is going on. And obviously, you can’t ignore the idol songs. I was very surprised by how good all of them actually were. I am not an idol pop person (In fact the only Japanese music I listen to is metal with bands like Boris, if that gives you a clue of how opposing my usual tastes are), and every single song that played in this I very much enjoyed. In fact, I ended up getting into a habit of sharing any new song that came up with a friend who hates anime, and he actually really enjoyed them too. While there were a few songs in SIP/Sunshine that I enjoyed, for the most part I just neutrally sat through them anytime one played in an episode, yet here I enjoyed anytime they were on screen, with especially the OP and ED songs being so catchy I didn’t mind sitting through intro/outro as opposed to skipping. The voice acting is also good, nothing mindblowing, but the emotional deliveries were all on point, and I felt the voices for the main cast all had their unique sound to where you could tell each character apart even without visuals.  Score: 9/10  Character: When I first started watching this, and as characters were introduced, I kept thinking to myself that they were going to end up boring and most of them would end up just being for 1 gag (such as the girl who likes sleeping, one being obsessed with being cute, etc) but it never actually gets to that point. Yes, while for the most part the girls do have their own ‘gimmick’, with how they’re presented they usually go beyond just being that, whether it be through dialogue or going through a conflict. Now one thing I do appreciate Nijigasaki for doing differently than the other 2 series is that characters actually break the mold of ‘just’ being a school idol group. In fact, you have one character that is never an idol, and instead acts as the club’s manager, and everybody in this is rather their own solo idol that does their own thing. I’m not saying that was a bad aspect to SIP/Sunshine, rather it was cool seeing something done differently than what is usually done. Overall, as mentioned in the story section, I ended up enjoying every main character in the end, even if there were a few that were my favorites. I felt they each had their strengths and I could definitely see how each one could be somebody’s favorite idol from this. Although I will say, again, they do have their own gimmick that they can fall into when the story’s not focused on them so I don’t think they’re done perfectly, although with idol stuff the whole point is to have a different character for different types of people that may be into them, so it’s a bit hard to fault the series for leaning into that aspect of being a very specific type of character.  Score: 8/10  Enjoyment: Obviously from my wording in all of this review, you can tell I really did enjoy this, and not trying to be objective or unbiased. It’s a refreshing take on a series I already thought was one of the best takes on the slice of life genre, and even doubly so for this season for having zero expectations from me. I definitely recommend this if you’re a fan of the genre, and it’s a no-brainer if you like idols or Love Live! that you’ll probably also enjoy this. Altogether I’d say this is my favorite thing to come out of the franchise so far and I’ll definitely be looking forward to any future show in the series.  Score: 9/10";Recommended
13;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;KMSpico;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KMSpico;8;I watch Love live Nijigasaki with little to no expectation. In the end it becomes the most enjoyable series in fall 2020.  Before i started i think important to mention that i never finished any love live predecessor. I watch muse first and drop it after episodes 2. Its not like muse bad or something like that. It just don't work well with me and it feel like this show will not going anywhere. Luckily, Nijigasaki was different. Or you can say a huge improvement from its predecessor.  Nijigasaki use cuting corners methode of Storytelling. It much easier to tell a story from disband idol group rather than make club from scratch. Also this time we don't have saving school subplot. Just about our characters dealing with their conflict when pursuing their dream. The best part of Nijigasaki storytelling is about solo idol. This approach is very helpful in introducing and developing our character with our characters give one episodes to justify their motives, inner conflict, and their reason to become idol. Also i want to mention about Nijigasaki clever use of visual storytelling. But later in visual section.  Another part i like from Nijigasaki is wide characters cast. Most of idol have this but what makes Nijigasaki special first i think its character design (outfit, hairstyles, etc). We can see how unique and different one character is from another, if you ask me i will say LL Nijigasaki have better character design than its predecessor. Also our character have more wide range personality and less annoying and this makes our character feel more realistic.  in the visual section nijigasaki is completely on a different level. Nijigasaki likes to experiment with it visual styles. One thing i want ro mention is use of shadow and darkness and become the most powerful thing in Nijigasaki visual storytelling. My favourite part came from eps 8. When talking with Kasumin window shadow fall over Shizuku and its make her look like trapped. Also when she ran away from Rina and Kasumin the lighting become less bright and its reflect Shizuku feeling well. Also i want to mention Ayumu confession in episode 11. I have no idea about how great this scene. Thanks to framing, lighting, camera angel and other shit that makes this scene standout. Last thing i want to mention is Nijigasaki great use of color. In the ED song you can see that our character associated with certain color . For example like Setsuna red really fit with here bright personality and fiery passion.  For music i dont have many comment. This time the music have wide range of genre and its not always about cute thing (often overused in idol anime). So its another possitive point.  With all of the thing combined i think its safe to say that LL Nijigasaki my Anime of the Season. Tbh, this review only reach the surface since my lack of knowledge and english prevent me from writing better review. If you want to relax and some good idol story with good character development. I think this show for you. But need to mention that LL Nijigasaki heavier on Drama Slice of Life than Comedy.;Recommended
14;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;JomSpoons;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JomSpoons;9;I was working on a very in-depth review on why I think this is the best Love Live anime to date but it was going on far too long so I think it's best I just sum up my thoughts instead.  Simply put, I think this is the peak of the entire Love Live franchise. I was absolutely blown away, I went in with high expectations and it still somehow exceeded nearly all of them. The new story structure that puts the spotlight more on individual characters was a great change of pace from the previous Love Live animes. I'd been following the Nijigasaki girls since their initial reveal back in 2017 and there were a couple characters in the cast I was always pretty indifferent to, but this anime really allowed the characters to shine in ways they couldn't before and now my opinion of each one is much higher.  The new art style is a huge step up from the typical art style of the franchise in my opinion. While I do still like the old style a lot, this new one is just fantastic and I almost wish this were the norm for the franchise now. The amount of new songs introduced through this anime is insane and several of them are easily some of the best songs Nijigasaki has put out to date. Also, there were a ton of references to previous Love Live media I picked up on while watching and I really appreciated.  I could go on and on about how much I think this anime does right but I'll hold my breath, I think it's best everyone just see for themselves, and I'm sure others have probably already written better nitty-gritty reviews than I could have. If you're a newcomer to the franchise, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys slice-of-life and/or idol anime. If you're already a fan of Love Live then I feel pretty confident in saying this is going to please you, it feels very fresh for the franchise while still sticking to it's roots.  The first Love Live anime starring µ's had been what I considered my favorite anime for several years now, so when I say I think this is the new peak of the franchise I'm not saying it lightly. I highly recommend Nijigasaki High School Idol Club to anyone interested.;Recommended
15;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Gaspar445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gaspar445;9;"I am a huge fan of Love Live music and the Love Live rhythm games, but I have not seen the previous Love Live generations' respective anime. So my thoughts on Nijigasaki will be from the perspective of someone who is familiar with the characters and music, but with little to no knowledge of the Love Live anime franchise.  The art style of the Nijigasaki anime is, in my opinion, an immensely positive departure from its predecessors. Yes, I know I said I know nothing about the previous LL anime, but I at least know this much. This season opts for less shiny character designs with a less saturated color palette and minimal shadows. The combination of simplistic coloring, light lineart, and beautiful lighting make for an utterly charming set of character designs that I honestly can't get enough of. Aside from some stiff posing usually seen in group shots, this style is light, welcoming, and pleasantly understated while still maintaining striking and vivid colors when the scene calls for it. The environment and setpieces look great as well. Nijigasaki High School is an expansive and modern complex with multiple levels, big open spaces, large glass windows, a seemingly endless amount of clubrooms, and an equally large outdoor courtyard area. Though most of the anime takes place within the school, the scenery is rarely boring or repetitive because of how its various spots are supported by the backdrop of a sunny blue sky or the moody orange lighting of the setting sun.  Like most idol shows, Nijigasaki is carried by its cast. There isn't much of an overarching story. The plot, instead, revolves around the personalities, ambitions, and struggles of each character. I think discussing each character will give a good look into what this anime is all about.  First there is Yuu Takasaki. No, not (You). Well, actually, yeah she is basically the self insert character - but not in a bad way! Yuu represents the player character from the accompanying rhythm strategy mobile game, Love Live School Idol Festival All Stars. She is essentially the charismatic cheerleader support of the Nijigasaki School Idol Club that handles much of the backstage-type activities. Like the Producer-kuns from the IdolM@ster franchise. Though she regrettably does not sing and dance like the school idols she supports, her VA performance is just as good as the rest. I wish more of her Producer-kun-esque activities were shown to drive home how important she is to the group, though.  Ayumu Uehara has the traditional Love Live ""main"" girl warm-colored hair and is the childhood friend of Yuu. She has a gentle personality and is embarrassed by her penchant for cute and pink things. From the support of Yuu, she becomes a school idol to embrace that side of her she has been suppressing until now. She loves Yuu. Very much. The yuri moments between these two are pretty heavy-handed. It's great.  Kasumi Nakasu is my personal favorite of the group. She also seems to be the animator's favorite because of how full of life her movements and expressions are animated. Kasumi's obnoxiously cute idol personality and streaks of cheeky arrogance are just like the #1 School Idol in the Universe, Nico Yazawa, except the former is more open about that cheeky arrogance. She is like a mix of Nico and Iroha Isshiki from Oregairu. She likes to have the spotlight on her and wants to show everyone how cute she is, but she still cares for her friends and was the first one to fight for the revival of the school idol club. Like I said earlier, she has a lot of fun and goofy moments in the anime that I feel the animators had tons of fun making. Kasumi is so energetic and charming that it is hard to dislike her even if you are the type to find the overly-cute persona annoying.  The straight-laced Nana Nakagawa is the student council president of Nijigasaki High School and moonlights as the fiery and passionate school idol Setsuna Yuuki. While her singing voice is powerful and her songs absolutely rocking, Setsuna is a softie and a total otaku dork. She is often one of the level-headed one of the group, but not is as militant about practice as Umi from Muse. Coming from All Stars, I thought Setsuna was kind of boring aside from her music, but her characterization in the anime made her really grow on me. Plus, she has some very funny facial expressions second only to Kasumi.  Ai Miyashita is the cheerful pun-loving athlete of the school idol club. There is not much to say about her since she has had the least amount of drama surrounding her. This may look like somewhat of a negative, but I think it works well with the type of person she is. Ai just wants to do what she thinks is fun and is more than willing to help her friends have fun as well.  Emma Verde is originally one of the N-rarity cards from the Love Live School Idol Festival game. She is a transfer student from Switzerland with a calming aura. Like Ai, there isn't much to say about her. Her own struggles this season are tied closely to her growing closer to her first friend since moving to Japan, Karin Asaka. Karin is a model known for her long legs and mature appeal. In All Stars, that's literally everything about her. Every other character makes a point to say how sex Karin-senpai is. (I am not super far into the game's story nor have I read her side stories so her character is more than likely fleshed out there) However, in the anime, she is a more interesting character. She is introverted and wrestles with the all-too relatable and irrational difficulty of feeling part of a group.  Another N-rarity card, Shizuku Osaka has a passion for both school idols and theater. She is arguably one the more bland characters of the group and does not get as much screentime outside of her own episode. Lacking confidence in herself, she puts up a ""perfect student/school idol/actress"" front to mask her true personality. She is a character I'd definitely want to see more of in a second season.  The last N card to become part of the Nijigasaki School Idol Club is Kanata Konoe. Her shtick is she's always sleepy and can nap anywhere. The anime actually gave her a reason for always being sleepy, to my surprise. She juggles a part-time job, housework, and school idol activities for the sake of letting her little sister (who was also a N card) focus on her own school idol life. Her own story is pretty straightforward but endearing and nicely done nonetheless.  Rina Tennoji is the biggest surprise of the entire anime for me. She went from one of my least liked (I can't bring myself to say I dislike any of the LL girls) to possibly top three of Nijigasaki. Rina being the sort of successor to Rin and Hanamaru, I never would have thought that the writers could turn the gimmicky ""Rina-chan"" board she uses to express herself into the most endearing and relatable episode of the entire season. For some background, Rina uses the notebook over her face from the beginning of All Stars. It's lame and comes off as even more gimmicky than Rin's or Hanamaru's speech mannerisms. But in the anime, she doesn't have it in the beginning, and as a result she struggles with making friends because of her emotive ability. Rina's story of her overcoming her struggle to express herself and make friends is a shining example of what makes this anime so good: how effortlessly the drama is paced and balanced throughout the show.  A common problem I have with anime that have a big cast is their lazy way of developing a character. They get their big moment for one or two episodes and then return to near irrelevancy right after. Their character arcs are often too ambitious or dramatic to be effectively handled in such a short runtime, which, in my opinion, seriously diminishes the impact of their story. I've rolled my eyes at this exact situation countless times that I end up impressed, perhaps more impressed than I should, when an anime like Nijigasaki doesn't end up in this pitfall. There is a simplistic beauty in the writing of the Nijigasaki anime. The kinds of problems the Nijigasaki girls face are straightforward and relatable. There is just the right amount of melodrama to add weight to the story while still maintaining the lighthearted nature of the show. These issues aren't painted in an overly dramatic light, so when these issues are resolved in one to two episodes, they don't feel contrived or rushed, and actually hit much more emotionally because I'm not taken out of the scene. That isn't to say the writing is super realistic, it's just refreshing to see an anime - an idol anime of all things - to be handled with this level of self-awareness and tact. Nijigasaki still is guilty of leaving some characters undeveloped outside of their respective episodes. It's a tough balance to strike, but for ten characters in thirteen episodes, I think the anime did a decent job at it. The school idol club feel like a group of friends getting closer to each other, despite the focus on individual idol performances. I can only hold out for a second season for more character development.  I'll be upfront about the music: I can't get enough of it. Every week I looked forward to a brand new song and I enjoyed each and every one of them. The songs are accompanied by gorgeous music videos that mixed impressive CG dancing and super cute 2D segments. Rina's ""Tsunagaru Connect"" is not only the catchiest song in the universe, but I enjoyed her music video the most as well. Setsuna's ""Chase!"" from the first episode does a wonderful job introducing the awe and splendor of school idols to the viewers. I never skipped watching the energetic opening sequence, and the OP ""Nijiiro Passions!"" has that classic and infinitely replayable Love Live sound to it. The ending song ""NEO SKY, NEO MAP!"" is beautiful, orchestral, and is the perfect anthem for the Nijigasaki girls. The way each girl sings individually and then they all come together to reach unfathomable eargasm heights perfectly represents what the Nijigasaki School Idol Club is all about. This song is playing on repeat as I'm writing this review. The amazing artist Mebachi (who also did the ED visuals for Revue Starlight) provides a wonderfully simplistic charm for the ED's visuals, utilizing a lovely combination of watercolor, an easygoing yet effective color palette, and an efficient lineart application. The music is easily the best part of the entire show. I think if you are interested in watching this anime, you will like at least one of the nine girls' musical styles. If you're a fan of Love Live and/or J-pop in general, then the music right up your alley. I think the Nijigasaki girls are collectively the strongest vocalists of all the Love Live generations so far. I don't think there is a single weak singer in the group, and I can't say the same for Muse or Aqours. If there's any reason to watch the Nijigasaki anime, it's the music. As a side note, I highly recommend watching the MV for Kasumi's song Muteki-kyuu*Believer and the MV for the group song ""Mirai Harmony"", as the art style of the anime is polished to stunning music video quality.  There isn't anything really groundbreaking about the Nijigasaki anime. It won't impress you with deeply thought out writing or kino cinematography. And I think that's completely fine because this show doesn't try to do any of that. Carried by simple and inoffensive writing, lovely visuals, a cast of top notch seiyuu, and amazing music, Love Live! Nijgasaki Idol Club doesn't try to do things much different than other shows similar to it. It just does the same things way better than most. This anime is simply a blast to watch start to finish.";Recommended
16;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Yohane01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yohane01;9;"I've been a huge love live fan for about three years at this point. And this show was very long awaited for me. I did really enjoy the show, but it did have some flaws. The show takes place at nijigasaki girls school and has two girls named ayumu uehara and yuu takasaki developing a love for school idols. Unfortunately though the Idol club is in tatters and freshly disbanded. So throughout early parts of the season the girls try to reform and rebuild the club.  This show does this pretty quickly which probably wasn't such a good idea. But after this the group all start to explore their individual problems with each character getting her own episode. I've heard a lot of people complaining that there wasn't much of a plot, and that's because of this reason. Instead of a big problem to deal with, the group just kinda deals with their own stuff each episode. You can tell that they wanted to give each character a bit of a backstory in place of a bigger plot.  To me the characters were pretty different than the usual love live girls. We had sleepy girls, anime loving girls, and even actress girls. To me these girls could arguably be even better than the original and that's saying a lot. And out of the nine of them I think I love setsuna the most, an anime loving student council president. She even had a lot of screentime this season, which made me pretty happy. Really out of all of them there's something for everyone so if you watch I'm pretty certain you'll find a fave.  One thing I definitely enjoyed though would be the music. The music this season was absolutely awesome. Most episodes had an awesome song and music video that really lifted the shows coolness even higher. The music videos were beautiful and explored the world view of each girl. I even find myself listening to these even after the season is over.  As far as the art this season was made by a new studio; and at first I thought it was just okay. However as the season played out I found myself really enjoying it, the difference helped separate this show from the others and gave it a life of it's own. Everything wounded up being pretty cute.  As for my enjoyment, I'd say I really liked it. I found myself rooting for each girl, and even finding respect for ones I didn't like. I also couldn't wait for niji Saturdays each week, which was a pretty fun time. People can say that the plot was weak, which is kinda true...but I still loved it. If you've never watched love live, I wouldn't highly recommend it, but if you have then you probably liked it. Can't wait for season 2!!!";Recommended
17;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;veemon23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/veemon23;8;"This anime really depends on who you personally like. As there are 9 different idols and each have their own episodes. So if you don't exactly like them, you won't enjoy that episode as much as the others. I enjoyed all of their songs but some were more forgettable for me, not saying they were bad. I just didn't enjoy it as much when it wasn't the one I really liked.  Personally my favorite character was Yuuki, I love her design, voice, and character the most. So early on I was like hook, but towards the middle I didn't care for it much. And this is just me being bias, it's not that this show is bad. But if you are looking at 9 different characters, it's honestly tough to say I love them all the same. Since I personally won't have mind just watching her the whole time with our two main girls.  So your enjoyment depends really on your personal taste. If you like idols, you'll enjoy this more... maybe... but even if you aren't one like me, you can still enjoy this. It's not a show that will ""WOW"" you with it's plot or characters... mainly it's good because the graphic was legit and the singing was on point!";Recommended
18;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Britannian13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Britannian13;8;Today I’ll be giving my thoughts on the newest entry into the Love Live franchise, Love Live Nijigasaki High School Idol Club. This is quite the good show, albeit it has some aspects that are questionable to say the least. Let’s get into specifics.  Story: 7 This show doesn’t really have a main story that the show stays with for the whole season, but it doesn’t really have to. It’s actually probably better to not have a central narrative in an idol show besides the idols pursuing their dreams of being an idol. What is there serves its purpose fine. Most of the episodes are episodic in nature. Each idol has their own episode dedicated to their character and its development, which is a very good structure for an idol show. My all-time favorite idol anime, The iDOLM@STER, has this structure as well, so it was nice to see it in this show. I’d have to say that some of the drama elements fall a bit flat. Also, because of the plots of some of the episodes, some of the insert songs just happen in the open rather than a formal performance on a stage. It just feels awkward. Just because it’s an idol show doesn’t mean every episode needs an insert song. This show also carries a tradition of many idol shows, that being the characters talking like nobody on planet Earth would ever talk. It is pretty dumb, but it’s in almost every idol show so maybe I should just get over it.  Art: 9 This is a different art style from the past 2 Love Live series, School Idol Project and Sunshine!!. However, it is, in my opinion, a change for the better. The character designs don’t particularly look unique to the show, but I personally prefer this look over the look of the franchise’s predecessors. One thing that hasn’t really changed, though, is the signature look of the eyes of the characters. While it is still there, it is toned down to a degree. The art style as a whole is just more simplistic, which is great in my opinion. CGI is used during the music sequences, and it is surprisingly well done. It retains the art style of the traditional animation very well and, aside from the smoother movements, the CGI is almost indistinguishable from the hand-drawn stuff.  Sound: 9 The songs in this show are fantastic. Each character gets to sing their own song at one point or another in this show, which allows the viewers to decide what their favorite idol is for themselves. My personal favorite is Karin, but everyone will have a different favorite. As for the quality of the songs, it is great across the board. Each song sounds fantastic and the production quality for the videos that play with them is top notch. Both the opening and ending are sung by the club itself. The opening, Nijro Passions!, is quite catchy and is overall a nice, upbeat song. The ending, NEO SKY, NEO MAP!, is more forgettable but it is still a pleasant listen. I often found myself staying during the end credits to listen to it. The voice acting is very good. Everyone puts out a quality performance as their respective characters.  Character: 8 I watch idol anime for the characters more than I watch them for the music. A show like this lives and dies on its characters. Shows like The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls failed to properly develop its large cast, which is why the show itself isn’t too great. If you don’t care about the characters, then what’s the point? Thankfully, this show actually develops all of its characters. Every idol’s personalities, aspirations, and struggles are different from everyone else, but they all have each other’s backs no matter what. This show uses its episodic nature well, taking a character I didn’t care about at all and making them much more unique and interesting, all in the span of only 1 episode. This show really only has 1 side character, and while she obviously isn’t as developed as the main characters, she ends up helping in the development of one of the main characters. However, even though every character is developed, not all are developed equal. Some characters have much better character development than others when all of them are on pretty much the same level of importance throughout most of the show.  Enjoyment: 8 This show is really fun to watch. The only thing that made me angry was the random insert songs in a few of the episodes, but this show is a blast for the most part. It’s so fun watching these characters develop because they make you actually care about them.  Overall: 8 While this show does have a few flaws, it doesn’t hugely detract from how great Live Live Nijigasaki High School is. With an old but very effective episodic formula, this show does what is imperative for every idol anime, that being making us care about the characters. On top of that, the songs are fantastic. I’d recommend every idol fan to check this show out, and with it being 13 episodes long, it wouldn’t take too long to do so. It’s exclusive to Funimation if you want to go and see it.;Recommended

This anime has some interesting episodes, some of the stories are nothing but the ending of this anime is very good. An anime that reflects the life of an idol very well. I admit that some episodes of this anime are not very interesting, but not too boring. The development of characters in this Anime is not bad and not too good. The art style is very good. This anime, the music was performed really well, not bad at all, and I loved it.

0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Ryoketsu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ryoketsu;5;This new anime from the Love Live franchise is a huge disappointment. The production is perfectly up to date, the CG is so good that for the first time it does not require the use of 2D in the concerts and the songs are wonderful but, besides these things, there is not much to be praised in Nijigasaki Doukoukai. And I say that as someone who loves the franchise. School Idol Project and Sunshine were great anime, while this one can't get anywhere near that.  This review may contain light spoilers. Not that I say anything that could ruin your experience, but I comment on the structure of this story to exemplify what exactly makes Nijigasaki Doukoukai a disappointment for me.  Story: 3/10. My biggest problem with this spin-off of the franchise is the fact that it doesn't have a story, however bizarre it may seem. This is because the series uses the first 9 episodes to introduce the girls one by one and literally does nothing else during that time. Watching these episodes gives me the feeling that I am playing a gacha game in which, each week, it releases the side story of one of the characters. However, there is no main story.  It seems to me that the most important thing for Nijigasaki Doukoukai is to sell waifu. When, after 9 episodes of selling waifu, the anime decides to tell a story, there is no basis for anything. Mainly because it is very difficult to remember each of the girls who have been introduced over the past 9 weeks. In the case of each of them, what happens is the following: in her episode, she matters. In the other 8 of this early phase of the series, the anime hardly remembers that she exists.  At the time of the last few episodes, the script tells you that months have passed and you have to accept it just because, since there was no indication of the passage of time in the initial nine episodes in which the anime was concerned exclusively with selling waifu. So the script talks about how X character has been working hard lately, but the only thing we saw from her was in her presentation episode and she was practically irrelevant in the other 8, with very few exceptions.  This makes it impossible to create a connection with any character in this anime and it also makes it impossible to create a connection with the story itself, since there is no story. Nijigasaki Doukoukai doesn't even have any sense of unity. It seems to be nine different animes in the first nine episodes and, from 10 onwards, it becomes something just boring and uninteresting. What reason do I have to be invested in whatever they are doing in the last four episodes if I don't care about any of these characters? You can't like someone who was relevant in just one of the nine episodes the anime has had untill then. If these first nine episodes of the series were about the club, this could be quite different. But the anime chose to talk exclusively about each of the characters in these episodes and this structure ensured that none of them were really important to the story since, going back to the starting point, there is no story.  Art: 9/10. I have nothing to criticize regarding this anime in its visual aspect. The studio knows where to put a budget, even if it means turning the other anime of the season into a slide show.  Sound: 10/10. The sound design, original soundtrack and especially the songs are of the highest level, as usual. Incidentally, this is the first anime in the franchise that makes me want to have its OST, for having some songs from the moments of slice of life that do not leave my head.  Characters: 5/10. They're not bad, but the script definitely doesn't help me like them. It's like I pointed out above: in the first nine episodes, each character exists in only one of them and is practically forgotten in the other eight, with rare exceptions.  Enjoyment: 4/10. All the problems in this anime make my experience watching it far from good. As much as the anime is impeccable in technical aspects such as art, sound and direction, this fact alone cannot sustain an anime without a story and cannot make me think it was worth watching.  Overall: 5/10.  Anyway, as much as it hurts me to say that, I do not recommend Nijigasaki Doukoukai to any fan of Love Live. Perhaps the only ones that this anime can really satisfy are those who already knew the game and just wanted to see the characters from the game in an animated series. If this is not your case, I recommend that you pretend that Nijigasaki Doukoukai does not exist and wait for Love Live Superstar.;Mixed Feelings
1;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;SanaeK10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SanaeK10;5;"Let me preface this by saying I'm not particularly a fan of Love Live. I like some of the songs, but that's pretty much it in terms of my engagement with the series. The only reason I decided to watch this because I do like the character designs this time round, and I enjoyed the Famitsu 4koma a great deal.  Let's start with the positives. There isn't a ""Save the Club"" or ""Save the School"" plot, apart from a very brief moment where they re-established the club in the very beginning. Kasumin is absolutely adorable and best girl, her antics never fail to elicit a smile on my face, she truly is an aisare kyara. But among all your standard one-episode drama episodes is the infamous episode 11, where you do get a glimpse of what may be, a glimmer of potential if it wasn't for corporate oversight or conservative production committee decisions. Episode 11 was easily one of my favourite episodes from any anime, from the cinematography to the episode direction, the latter half of it genuinely gave me chills and had me wonder if the creative team would fundamentally shake up the status quo of Love Live with regards to its character dynamics.  Of course, things never turn out as what you'd hope. All the buildup to that moment with Ayumu's building jealousy is resolved in the most anti-climactic non-romantic way possible. It's as if they are actively downplaying and burying any romantic subtext between the characters for a ""just friends"" and ""fulfilling dreams"" excuse instead of doubling down.  Most other episodes follow a very basic structure where the girl of the week gets into some minor drama with herself or other characters and resolves everything very simply and with a song. Apart from Kasumi's and Ai's episodes, I wasn't particularly enraptured by any of the other episodes, and felt that they could have been handled better. In fact, my preference would have been to focus on the Ayumu x Yuu drama from the very beginning instead of having it be very minor background elements in order to have it climax at episode 11.  Music-wise, HASHIRIDASHITA is so good you can see why Yuu started loving Idols in the first place. However none of the other songs quite managed to reach that level of excellence (even Setsuna's other song). I did like Ai's and Karin's solos, and of course the amazing ED, but for an idol show to have 30% of the songs that truly appeal to me is pretty lacking. But hey, at least you do get a decent variety for songs.  Love Live isn't for everyone and it definitely wasn't for me, but at moments, you can really see something truly special buried underneath a lot of play-it-safe moments, where they didn't choose to innovate enough when there's clearly room to grow.  5/10";Mixed Feelings
2;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;MihikoAnim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MihikoAnim;6;Love live! Nijigasaki I find it less interesting than the previous two anime about Love Live! The story does not have one continuous story but is divided into individual episodes, which is not as enjoyable to watch as the previous ones. However, the very idea of not one group of idols but individuals with different characters was a refreshing idea. Each of the protagonists represented themselves on stage or off stage in their own way. We see different performances in each episode, and as in previous editions of Love Live! everyone can find the idol they like the most, with whom they associate the most.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;BringThePropain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BringThePropain;5;"Here it is, another Love Live phone game ad, uh, I mean anime. Jokes aside, this season ponders more for people that already play the phone game (School Idol Festival All Stars) than it does for people that know nothing of this group or franchise because it makes assumptions that you already know the characters beforehand. As a result, it leaves out some important details among other things. Spoilers below.  Story & Presentation  This season sets itself up as a completely separate setting with no relations to any of the previous Love Live generations other than the existence of the idol competition called Love Live. This means it doesn’t rely on cameos or references to any of the previous generations to maintain viewer interest which plagues so many sequel series today. So far, so good. And so, it has to do a good job as a stand-alone show which it unfortunately doesn’t do. From a narrative perspective, here’s are the things I’ve noticed.  1. Unlike the previous generations, there’s no overarching plot so far. Thankfully, that means we’re not getting the same recycled plot for the third time. However, this can be a big minus for some people since there’s no sense of direction story-wise. It wasn’t until episode 10 that the group had a goal in mind to work towards which honestly would’ve been a better if introduced near the beginning of the season before everyone’s character ‘arcs’ as it would’ve made each one a bit more meaningful while having a goal in the story to get to.  2. This new group focuses more on individualism rather than collectivism and so each member has their own story to tell as well as their own style of being an idol. A nice idea for sure, but this comes with a big drawback for a season with only 13 episodes with 10 main characters, and that is: no one gets enough time to get fleshed out and develop properly. Additionally, everyone’s personal issues get resolved too damn fast! Take Rina’s episode for example, her lifelong problem of not being able to express herself conflicts greatly with her dream and style of a traditional idol. The Rina-chan board is a simple but effective solution to her problem, but this solution just appeared out of nowhere in one episode without any prior foreshadowing and build-up. Most of the episodes this season essentially followed this pattern: character has some deep problem related to them being an idol, character displays visible sadness, some talk-no-jutsu happens and everything is sunshine and rainbows. No matter how good the solution may be, it’ll feel hollow, rushed, and lack weight if the build-up wasn’t done properly. The phone game does go into more detail with each character, so if any of the main cast catches your attention, that’s where you’d want to look (hence why I called this a phone game ad).  3. Even though everyone has their own issues and end goals as idols, they’re still a club and some of them have relations with each other outside of it. Another issue has to do with how disconnected each of the character ‘arcs’ are to one another. If they couldn’t connect one character with another’s story, they could’ve tied their ambitions to the school idol festival to have some consequence to the plot. Yes, Emma’s episode did concern Karin but it honestly felt more like Karin’s episode but at least they tied together two character’s plights into one ‘arc’. If they only did this for a couple of the other characters, it would've felt less episodic and would've established some meaningful character relationships.  Characters  Just because something’s a little episodic doesn’t mean it can’t be good. That usually means the characters have to do the carrying. Kaguya-sama, for example, blends its brilliant character chemistry with its skits perfectly.  Each Niji club member is a bit more thought-out compared to the previous generations and this season does give each member an even amount of screen time. However, considering all these personalities, they certainly did not utilize this to its potential (probably because this season’s jammed with disconnected character ‘arcs’). The majority of the fun character interactions this season come from Kasumi’s eccentric nature bouncing off of other club members. I personally would’ve liked to see more of the element of the training camp episode where it isn’t just Kasumi creating fun interactions but also every character bouncing whatever character trait off one another; like when Kanata’s cooking skills fixed the product of Setsuna’s lack of cooking skills. A lot of interactions like these are fun only if you know the character beforehand as well.  As for the individual characters, to each their own opinions. I’m just glad there isn’t another Honoka clone. Kasumi’s basically Nico 2.0 but it makes for some entertainment so I’ve got no complaints.  Sound & Visuals  The only reason anyone’s watching this is probably for the music. This season will not disappoint if that’s the case because it delivers a new song almost every episode. If you enjoyed the music from previous seasons, you’ll likely enjoy most songs this season has to offer. The voice acting is good as you’d expect from most anime. Nothing bad from sound effects nor background music either.  This season has changed its art style from the traditional Love Live art style. I’m personally a big fan of this new style as it blends the traditional 2D drawing style with modern animation while still having a Love Live vibe. The animation in episodes is surprisingly smooth. You’ll get some derpy in-between frames if you pause at random times, but overall everything is pleasing to watch. You’ll especially notice the budget kicking in during performances with dynamic camera work and some great visual effects. Speaking of performances, there’s still CG dancing but fortunately, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as it did in previous seasons. Hell, it looks better than most CG in other anime.  Overall  This season is pretty standard for Love Live so existing fans will probably enjoy this as much as the previous seasons. Newcomers to Love Live may find this underwhelming since it doesn’t quite do any of the characters justice and whatever story that happens feels like an afterthought for the writers. If you want singing and dancing, then look no further.";Mixed Feelings
4;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;LiloWeeaboo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LiloWeeaboo;6;"O review em português que você procura! ATENÇÃO: SE QUISER UM RESUMO DO QUE EU DISSE, VÁ PARA O ÚLTIMO PARÁGRAFO  Para começar, acho importante lembrar que Love Live é como uma franquia e seus vários títulos (Nijigasaki, Sunshine etc) funcionam independentes um do outro. Se você estava na dúvida se há uma ordem certa para assistir ou se algum se trata de um reboot do original Love Live School Idol Project, agora já sabe que não. Mesmo assim, vou usar Love Live School Idol Project de 2013 para ressaltar alguns pontos nessa review. Tirado isso do caminho, vamos lá:  A primeira coisa que gostaria de exaltar é a qualidade visual da obra. Em Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukai fica nítida a preocupação do estúdio com o padrão entregue, visto que se esforçam ao máximo para evitar o uso de animação em 3D durante as apresentações musicais das personagens, coisa que infelizmente não ocorreu com Love Live de 2013. Não vou entrar no mérito dos motivos que levaram a uma decisão ou a outra e nem vou demonizar o uso de 3D em animes, mas basta assistir os dois animes para entender essa diferença no prazer visual da experiência.  Ainda nessa questão, há mais ou menos uma apresentação por episódio focando em uma idol específica e essas apresentações são realmente muito boas: As músicas, o design de cada personagem, suas particularidades, tudo é bastante rico. No entanto, é aqui que começam meus motivos para a nota 6. As apresentações individuais existem porque, diferentemente do Love Live de 2013, as school idols desse anime querem seguir carreira solo e não formar um girl group. Por isso, cada episódio foca em contar a história de uma garota, enfatizando algum problema que a esteja impedindo de ser a idol dos seus sonhos ou de entender mais sobre o que a leva a querer perseguir esse sonho em primeiro lugar. Isso por si só não é um ponto negativo, mas a quantidade de garotas é grande e por isso todos os conflitos são apresentados e resolvidos naquele mesmo episódio, não dando tempo do expectador realmente se conectar com a garota em foco. E somando isso ao fato de que se não for o episódio da menina X, ela quase não vai aparecer de verdade, quase não vai ter falas ou falas significativas (falaremos disso depois), aí sim que o expectador esquece da menina X.  O que me leva ao segundo grande problema, que é a distribuição desigual de importância de cada história: no primeiro episódio somos apresentados a quem parecia ser a protagonista do anime, sua personalidade, o amadurecer do seu sonho, conflitinhos etc e tudo segue esse ritmo até que o ""verdadeiro"" primeiro conflito é introduzido, envolvendo uma outra personagem que vem com uma presença e importância que eu julguei ser quase uma segundo protagonista. No entanto, assim que o problema é resolvido (bem rápido), ela fica ""nas sombras"" dando espaço para o início das rodadas de sub tramas individuais, como já expliquei antes. Junto a isso, a ""protagonista"" se junta a ela nesse espaço coadjuvante e sinceramente mal tem presença até os últimos 3 ou 4 capítulos finais.  Volto a dizer que cada episódio funciona bem sozinho e as idols são sim cativantes, mas o problema é que essa imersão dure apenas 20 minutos. Nos episódios dedicados à outra idol, as demais são quase uma caricatura de sua personalidade mais marcante, ganhando falas bobas demais que empobrecem a personagem e ás vezes flertam com um regresso da ""lição aprendida"" no seu episódio individual.  Por isso, não consegui ver essa obra como algo necessariamente ruim, mas seria injusto dizer que é bom. Ela não teve sucesso contanto uma história, mas sim contando várias pequenas historinhas. E eu levo a intenção do anime em consideração, é claro. Existem milhares de animes slice of life ou animes formados inteiramente por compilados de pequenas tramas e isso não é defeito. O problema é que Love Live Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai não tinha essa premissa e por isso falhou e recebe nota 6 dentro dos meus conceitos.  Uma outra coisa que atrapalhou, mas agora é pura questão de gosto, é a falta de peso nos conflitos. Além de se resolverem fácil demais, coisas que poderia ser conflitos palpáveis simplesmente não são nem jogados na trama. Em Love Live School Idol Project de 2013, por exemplo, as meninas lidam com problemas de dinheiro, de roupas, de composição de músicas, de permissões, de alcance etc. Em Nijigasaki Gakuen, nada disso parece ser um problema e tudo está a disposição delas quase por mágica. Eu não preciso de super realismo num anime de school idols, mas essas meninas são abençoadas com tudo sendo dado na palma da mão delas e todos os conflitos menores são resolvidos nos episódios individuais, ou seja, quase não existe o sistema de ""conflito"". Nada é difícil e nada tem peso. E isso torna tudo menos interessante ao meu ver.  Em suma, você deve assistir esse anime? Se sua intenção é apenas passar o tempo e ver meninas fofas seguindo seus sonhos de idol individualmente com apresentações bonitas e tramas levemente satisfatórias, então sim. Se sua intenção é ver uma história substancial e acompanhar conflitos que envolvam ""o poder da amizade e do esforço"", então acho que outros títulos da ""franquia"" podem te interessar mais.";Mixed Feelings
5;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;6;"Quick Thoughts: My favorite of the Love Live franchise.  Story: Much of this season is spent on exposition, in the sense that each club member gets an episode focused on their development. While not technically episodic since there is timeline followed, it does have that feel to it. I felt the quality of these episodes was inconsistent, but i think they at least succeeded in giving each member some depth. Adding to this, the mood of the anime was inconsistent as well. The speed at which serious situations (relative to this type of anime) arise and then resolve is too quick. It kinda makes sense for the first several episodes, since they're short development arcs, but it was annoying at times during the last few episodes. Despite that, I think these things worked well for the pacing. You quickly get a good feel for how each episode will play out. The constant influx of characters worked for the comedy as well; it helped prevent gags from getting stale. I thought ending was a bit disappointing in that it doesn't suggest a second season, but it does conclude this season's events well enough.  Art: I like the changes in art design from previous iterations of Love Live. Facial expressions are more dynamic, side profiles are more detailed, and the CGI moments are much less jarring. The quality is maintained throughout, with drops in quality being minor (like faraway shots or background characters).  Sound: There aren't many vets in the casting, but I think everyone did a good job; they fit their roles well enough. I thought the OST was a strong point, as usual for Love Live. The decision for a solo idol based club rather than a group allowed for deviation from more standard idol music. This does make the songs more hit or miss, but I definitely appreciated the variety in sound.  Characters: Even with each member getting episodes dedicated to their development, they still ended up feeling one-dimensional. The anime's more comedic nature tended to focus on one or two traits from each character for its gags. Considering how short the anime is and large amount of characters, I thought this was fine overall. There's one character who's development could be seen as annoying or melodramatic to some, but I thought it was fine given the context. Outside of that, I thought the rest of the characters were likeable.  Enjoyment: I enjoyed the series, but this is coming from someone who plays the game these characters stem from. I can imagine someone who's never played the game struggling to connect with any of the characters, but it should still fairly enjoyable if you've enjoyed other idol anime.";Mixed Feelings
6;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;hyperwaddledee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hyperwaddledee;6;I’m a little late to the party tonight, as season 2 of Nijigaku is airing as I write this review. As a longtime fan of the original School Idol Festival mobile game (happy ninth anniversary, btw), it pleases me to see this anime getting so much love—I also feel that as a longtime fan, I owe it a fair review.  So, how does Nijigaku stack up against the μ’s and Aqours animes?  Story: 4/10  Many people are praising Nijigaku for shaking up the Love Live formula. Unfortunately, this cause of appeal for some is also the root of one of its coremost issues: it lacks a strong sense of character goals, resulting in a loss of plot direction. Consequently, with loss of strong goals and direction comes loss of strong emotional pull over these elements.  There is nothing inherently wrong with slice-of-life anime, but Nijigaku wants to have its cake and eat it, too, resulting in several scenes in its second half that serve to attempt to create tension, but ultimately feel stilted and manufactured. One in particular pulled me out of the moment so hard that I started laughing at what was supposed to be a tense scene. I’m typically not that kind of viewer (like, for example, I’m not going to question how these high schoolers are setting up these professional-looking stages, rigging and all, because it’s about the viewer experience, dammit), and yet!  So, in my humble opinion, Nijigaku’s story element does not live up to its predecessors. The good news is that like a fine wine, Love Live sequel seasons seem to be improvements on their foundations. There’s still time yet for the cast to tell a story just as memorable as any other from the franchise.  Art: 10/10  Holy shit! The animation in this series is legitimately breathtaking, especially if you’ve been around to remember the clunky days of stiff 3D models dancing on stages that don’t look like they’re sharing the same dimension. This is Love Live at its best.  Not just the animation is beautiful. The character art style has ever-so-slightly shifted to allow for more colored outlines, and backgrounds have been lovingly rendered in ways that make them pop with colors and values. The artist in me is geeking out over how well the principles of art are exhibited, but I’ll spare you the rant and just say that it’s hecking Pretty with a capital P.  Sound: 9/10  Love Live continues to impress in this department (as one would hope it should, given its subject matter!), and the discography continues to be phenomical. I did knock off a point for reasons that are hard to articulate… Nijigaku’s insert songs just didn’t grab me like the others have. Though I will say the rotating solo focus of the episodic inserts was a wonderful idea. Fingers crossed for some bangers in season 2.  Character: 5/10  Each girl gets a feature episode. Some are better than others. People will disagree on which constitutes better and worse episodes. I think they’re all at least sort of okay. At least they all got one this time? *coughcoughKanancough*  Enjoyment: 7/10  Nijigaku was a pleasant and enjoyable watch, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed in the weak storytelling aspect this time around. As much as I want to simp for my girls and give this a 10/10… I really can’t. Outside the spectacle, Nijigaku is pretty bland. Safe, comforting, but bland, like a warm potato.  Who should watch Nijigaku?  If you are a returning fan of Love Live from μ’s and Aqours, you will be adequately entertained with this. If you are big on the concept of safe comfort anime, you will probably enjoy it even more than I did.  If you are looking to dip your feet into the Love Live franchise… maybe? It depends on what idol fix you’re after. In terms of spectacle, Nijigaku is second to none thus far, but in terms of story, μ’s and Aqours have them beat.  If you are looking for melodrama between girls, well… Nijigaku kind of does that, but it’s not very good at it. There are better anime out there.  If you need inoffensive background noise, Nijigaku could fill the role for you with a smile on its face.  Overall, 6/10.;Mixed Feelings
7;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;whoisashleigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whoisashleigh;5;"This series took the best parts of the love live franchise, threw them in a trash can, and attempted to superglue the rest together while constantly attempting to avoid the ""LoveLive"" title. Honestly, it felt like a barely related, utterly mediocre show, and doesn't deserve the franchise title at all.  CHARACTER : 3  Each character gets and introductory episode. Followed by being cardboard cutouts to stick drama onto. It's like trying to stick magnets onto cardboard - most of the ""drama"" is either out of character, or makes the character look even less likeable than they already were. Which is saying something, given most are shallow, selfish, and not very interesting at all. Instead of feeling sympathetic or downright crying on behalf of the cast, you'll mostly find yourself wanting to bash their brains in at worst, or get them off screen already at best.  STORY: 4  Look, I don't mind a character driven series - I even love it, occasionally - but given how bad the characters were, the complete lack of a solid, overarching story makes this series even more painful than it had to be. The part that sold the last two shows was the pure passion and singular shared goal of the group, but in this series, that goal is barely even an afterthought, rarely mentioned, and far from compelling.  ART & SOUND: 7  This series lacks some of the magic of the earlier series, and it often fails to make the groups look like... well, idol groups. The music is fine, the 3D models are better than the average idol series, but certainly not perfect.  OVERALL: 5  This series feels like an attempt to cash grab, and to generate new interest in a mobile game. Which makes sense, given that game kept being delayed and many gave up on it towards the end, but it definitely doesn't make for a good addition to the franchise.";Mixed Feelings
8;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;brillante;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brillante;6;Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club (we’ll call it NijiGaku here) isn’t terrible. In fact, I’m scoring it similarly to previous idol anime I’ve watched, some of which I consider myself a fan of. Despite my rabid consumption of idol anime, I am an anime fan first and foremost, so I know that idol anime are not often considered masterpieces in the sea of the industry. And that’s okay. Sometimes, the anime isn’t the strongest part of each franchise, and this seems to be the case for NijiGaku. When considering the anime critically and comparing it to its predecessors of School Idol Project and Sunshine, it plays it safe and doesn’t do much to be completely groundbreaking.  Part of the issue lies in the scenario that NijiGaku is given. Previous incarnations of Love Live have had bigger stakes, but these are nonexistent this time around. These are solo idols, rather than one large group. There is no big Love Live competition to compete in, nor is there a school to save from permanent closure. Furthermore, NijiGaku operates as solo acts rather than units or groups. These deviations from the usual formula should allow for capitalization on a more exciting premise, but NijiGaku fails to surpass its predecessors. Even in the failure to surpass, it makes up for it in its music and animation, and it ends up being equal to previous Love Live series as a result.  The storyline may be the biggest culprit as to why, as the lack of serious stakes results in the anime having no such purpose except to introduce the girls of NijiGaku. Conflicts only last one episode, maybe three if lucky. The largest overarching conflict of the series deals with the relationship with Ayumu and Yu, but even that tension is resolved quickly when it’s addressed. Because of this, the anime can feel rushed and tied to a formula that leaves little room for deviation. The majority of the anime is 9 “Idol of the Week” episodes, which allows each girl to get the same amount of devoted screentime and development. While you do get a feel for everyone’s character, there are only 5 episodes left, and they feel wasted due to how the rest of the pacing goes. The series ends with a School Idol Festival, but the first 3 episodes are slice of life and so there are only 2 episodes showing its planning and commencement. The anime ends, but does so in an unfulfilling way.  The characters are written in ways that are familiar to existing Love Live fans, so of course there are hits and misses. Love Live characters often have motifs and traits that define them, and these are treated in the same way as previous incarnations by. Some of these traits are pleasant, cute, and interesting (Setsuna, Rina), but some aren’t as successful (Kanata, Kasumi). The new character, Yu is a breath of fresh air. She’s a variable that hasn’t existed in Love Live before due to representing the player/producer character. Although she resigns herself to a supporting role for most of the series, the end of the series sets her up to have a larger role in the future. Because of that, it looks like there’s a character everyone can love despite these irregularities in character development, just as with other Love Live groups  Where the anime falters with story and characters, it makes up for in animation. Sunrise continues to give us the best 3D idol animations in the industry, and they continue to demonstrate their ability to create dancing idols that look better with each generation of Love Live. The 2D style, to most viewers, may feel jarring to previous viewers of the Love Live series by how rougher the outlines and shapes feel compared to the smooth and shiny aesthetics of the main Love Live series. However, I happen to like this change a lot and it was never a bother. I think it works as a homage to the early days of the School Idol Festival game. 3 of the main NijiGaku girls and most of the side characters from other schools originally appeared within the game. This style provides some nostalgia for me due to how it seems to pay tribute to it, so I can’t hate it.  So what about the sound, the most important part of any idol anime? Unfortunately, I consider NijiGaku to have the weakest songs out of the Love Live franchise, perhaps due to the new challenge of having solo songs that you need to attach to each character. It’s not as simple as simply attributing one song to an entire group like Muse or Aqours. Perhaps this is why I’m having such a hard time connecting to the songs. I barely remember which songs belong to who, unlike with previous generations where they were stuck in my head for days afterwards. Despite this, I must admit that the songs are well-made as always, even if I have trouble remembering some of them. Special mention goes to the ending, Shizuku’s solo, and both of Setsuna’s solos.  At the end of the day, I really wanted to enjoy NijiGaku, but I didn’t. Though I do appreciate it as a Love Live fan, I always felt like I knew what was coming and sometimes it felt like a chore to move forward and finish it. Also, disregarding my bias as a Love Live fan, this incarnation seems inaccessible to those who have not seen at least one of the previous generations of Love Live or at least played the corresponding mobage. When it comes to giving it a final ranking, I feel uncomfortable ranking it below the other Love Live anime, so I’m giving it a 6 as an equalizer. I think this is deserved, as it has some positives going for it and there is lots of potential now that Season 2 is announced. I’ve found 2nd seasons of Love Live are usually better than the first, so I will be watching it to see if it capitalizes on that potential.  Overall, NijiGaku may not be the best introduction to the idol genre, and it might only appeal to hardcore fans and mobage players. The fans who are able to get into NijiGaku will find a continuation of school idol adventures that the Love Live franchise has built over its 10-year history. If you have watched School Idol Project and/or Sunshine and want more school idols, and you’re looking to get into the latest Love Live mobage, NijiGaku is worth a look. However, it may be useful to hold off and wait for the next season previews to come out to see if it peaks your interest. If the mobage storyline can tell us anything, if a bigger and better story is coming, it will be coming with season 2.;Mixed Feelings
9;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;valiantslakr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/valiantslakr;6;"As a longtime fan of love live and someone who's actually played a fair bit of the mobile game that this is loosely based off of, I have to say, I'm unfortunately underwhelmed by this anime. Don't get me wrong, aesthetically it's great; the new art style is very pretty, and the CGI is much improved from previous love lives, while the music is still solid. However, what makes this a 6/10 and not a 8-10 out of 10 is the fact that there is a lack of any real conflict for the entire anime.  Anything that remotely resembles conflict in an episode is almost immediately resolved within that episode, and usually the conflict itself doesn't have very serious stakes in the first place. As a result, this anime as a whole is very boring, and does not hold a candle to the original love live. Even sunshine, which didn't exactly have a very original plot, at least had stakes.  Now, you could argue that many moe slice of life shows don't have any real plot either, but those make up for it with comedy and over the top situations and reactions; Nijigasaki tries to keep everything a bit more grounded in reality but has nothing particularly interesting to show in place.  At the very least though, I suspect that the reason for the lack of conflict is due at least in part to the absence of a certain character from the mobile game, Love Live SIFAS, who will probably show up in a subsequent season, should it ever get one. Perhaps then, the plot would get a lot more interesting.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;kattah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kattah;2;*this review does contain spoilers*  I have been following Love Live for quite some time now. I love the original series and adore Sunshine!! just as well to the point of creating art folders on my computer and even getting some minor merchandise pieces like keychains and cards.  Believe it or not, I expected a lot from the third Love Live generation anime despite not knowing what it was going to try to represent. What I received was wasted potential and large disappointment.  Not sure what to start my rant with, but I guess getting to the story first would be fitting because there is literally none of it. Unlike previous two parts, this had no to zero significant plot. Got to admit, it started kind of well. The first episodes seemed to show what might have ended up being a good storyline. However, once the characters got together (which as I remember happened about 3 episodes in) the whole thing went downhill with next half a show being what’s supposed to be ”character development” which is one of the points I will get back to later. After 10 episodes passed, it remembered it had something to tell. This is the moment we are introduced to… School Idol Festival. What even is that thing and where did they take our very own “Love Live”?... the thing this very show is supposed to be about?... the thing this show is basically named after?... Apparently, the thing that the first two parts were based around and named after simply does not exist in the Nijigasaki timeline. Why is this named Love Live if there is not a single word said about what was the main thing of the original series??? This should not be called Love Live. The story part has more to be told about and I am going to talk about those details in the next paragraph. Moving on.  What I consider the main problem of Nijigasaki crew is the crew itself. Characters. Character development is made in the worst way possible. Instead of being naturally developed with the story (which as I mentioned earlier does not exist in the case of Nijigasaki) going on, every single character is forced into the viewer by having an entire episode dedicated to each of them. What’s so bad about it being like this? Let me explain. Imagine a narrator introducing characters giving a quick description of them in order they appear on the screen. Yes, those short descriptions explaining who the character is, what their interests are, their relations to the rest of the cast etc. In Nijigasaki anime, the descriptions are episodes and the order is the episode order. Every single episode until the SIF introduction just gives us information on characters the viewer is supposed to follow with literally zero further development. You have to accept the characters as they are. In fact, you are forced to do so. None of the characters in this show can be considered main. Every single one becomes main during their own episode. After that they vanish to just hang around for the rest of the screen time. Every time a certain girl appeared on the screen, it felt like they are here just to remind us what their quirk they were introduced in their episodes with is. Kasumi constantly being self-centered, Rina constantly taking out her Rina-board, Kanata constantly reminding us how tired she is etc. These went from fun little things to GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP ALREADY. When there was “drama” going on, I had no idea what my reaction was supposed to be. Why would they put the most uninteresting character aka Ayumu in a totally unnecessary drama? Just to show how she does not care about anyone but herself? I guess in her case being a bad character is better than being absolutely nothing because unlike her pals she does not have any specific characteristics other than being Yuu’s friend. How am I supposed to react to characters I never got to care about? Where does the drama itself come from when the whole cast is just having fun while being in literal fillers? The story does not move with the drama too, making it absolutely needless for both nonexistent plot and character development.  This show does have good sights too. Sound and design. Not going to give any comments on the sound part, because, well, this show is centered around music (in fact it barely is, but at least it was supposed to). The character design is close to flawless. Love Live has always had great design, I just wish it was used on the right characters this time…  All in all, the third generation Love Live anime is an awful show. It takes everything good and charming about its predecessors and throws it in the trash bin. This was likely made as a fanservice material for the game fans, which I do not belong to the group of. I guess it is exciting to see characters you have known for years finally getting their own series. I understand why game fans and other people enjoy it and I respect their opinions. I, however, did not like this show. Not just as an alternative setting for two previous Love Live parts, but as a separate thing too. Yes, I would rather watch another “our school is on the edge of getting closed so we have to become school idols to save it” than this.  Ratings: Story - 1/10 Art - 8/10 Sound - 8/10 Character - 1/10 Enjoyment - 2/10  If season 2 of Nijigasaki ever gets announced, I will not get excited for it as much as I was for this. But I really hope it is going to have something more to it other than unnaturally introduced characters and absent story the first season managed to get us through in its 13 episodes.  “Nijigasaki? – more like Nijigasucky”, - I would say if I were to be Miyashita Ai, because making puns is what her entire character is about.;Not Recommended
1;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;Yunyuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yunyuu;3;I’m going to start off by saying that I am a huge love live fan, I absolutely loved school idol project and to a lesser extent also enjoyed sunshine quite a bit. Needless to say I was very hyped when I saw that Love Live was getting another iteration to the point where I went and downloaded the game to learn more about the upcoming characters.  But oh boy was I disappointed. I have been reading other people’s review and can’t understand why exactly they liked so much about it.  Love Live is an anime about music and character progression through trials and frustration, developing and evolving personalities and songs as they become more acquainted with each other and live their lives. School idol project placed its songs exactly where they needed to be. START:DASH!! was placed in S1EP3 to show the beginning of their story, the start of their dreams and journey. Snow Halation showed their emotional progression and attachment to each other.  But why did I go through the effort of explaining School Idol Project story telling? Well, because Nijigasaki does a 180 turn and goes the other direction. It introduces each character individually, making each the focus of the story. Sure, some of their stories can be sweet and show character development like Shizuku and her inferiority complex, but this in exchange takes a big toll on the world development and group mechanics. Now we have not only less impactful characters because they hardly get any screen time aside from their one episode, but the songs are less emotionally impactful.  When Nijigasaki actually tried to shift their focus from single characters to multiple, it started off decently, meaning for the first 10 minutes of episode 10. After that I believe they ruined what people considered a fairly interesting character, being Ayumu. I’ll say it straight, I very much dislike yuri anime, and introducing it to the show made what I thought was an already uninteresting progression even worse. Ayumu simply came off as a petty and selfish person. Other characters aside from her got little to no screen time, so what could have been two and a half episodes setting up a future plot (which I thought would have been to bring together the 9 girls to sing together and shoot for love live), was simply a selfish yuri romance insert.  Character drama and story telling is bad enough, but at the end of the day, Love Live is a show focused on music, so how does that fare? Well, in my opinion, very badly. I personally loved the 9 member voice, exchanging centers and show dynamics of School Idol Project and Sunshine, and that to me is what made it unique. We had 9 girls singing and dancing a captivating choreography, mixing and matching which voice would go better at certain parts of the song. But we don’t get any of that in Nijigasaki. We get some interesting songs with, well, low impact aside from the very first time you watched it. To put what I’m trying to get at into perspective, the song I most enjoyed and went back to listen in this entire series was the opening.  Edit: Also just a tack on thought, who makes their music? From what I've seen there was no Maki or Riko in the show, and most characters seem to have no knowledge of music composition. This might be nit-picking as obviously in the original cast or sunshine they didn't have a band to make guitar sounds and such, but having one character that understands it makes it more believable, or at least suggestive of skill, the songs being a master-piece. This is an anime afterall, we're conecting to the charcaters and not the people behind their voices.  Now, what I also want to know is why the series is called Love Live? I only heard one mention of it during the entire series and that when Setsuna was fighting with Kasumi about their training sessions before they had more members. At that point, it made sense, and gave the viewers a sort of familiar feeling about the struggles of becoming a popular group and arriving at the Love Live stage. But then episode 10 came and Yuu said “let’s do a school idol festival”, whatever that is. Why? The girls did nothing to deserve them acting so high and might to stand with other presumably popular groups like Touou academy.  In conclusion, I think that Nijigasaki is a wasted potential in storytelling, lacks impactful songs and misses the mark of what I considered interesting in the Love Live franchise. My hope for the future of the series, although unrealistic, is that they drop Nijigasaki altogether and go back and improve upon the original series with a new cast.

2;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;zokoi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zokoi;3;"I have been fan of Love Live from 2013, right when the first season of the original Love Live starts, so I believe I am right to say that this is not a good Love Live anime, not at all. It feels more like an advertisement for the game instead.  Story: there is a lack of a main story line. Unlike the LL Project, LL Sunshine and LL Superstar, Nijigasaki is just about a bunch of cute girls doing cute idol things. And as most of you know, Nijigasaki is about how instead of being a group of school idols, they are solo idols instead. For me, this is the worst decision ever. Even though the characters are doing things together, they never truly had that ""togetherness"" that makes them feel like Love Live.  Art: eh, this is just me but I feel the art is a bit too clean and doesn't have that unique Love Live look.  Music: as much as I dislike solo idols, I do find the songs enjoyable.  Character: I don't find them as relatable or as unique as the other generations of the franchise. They seem very one-dimensional, but eh, they're cute and fun enough if you're just here to see cute girls doing cute things.  Enjoyment: this is the kind of anime that you enjoyed watching once and only once. It's not memorable enough to remember about nor emotional or relatable enough to make you want to see it again.  Overall: Honestly, the show is not that horrendous, if it was a normal idol anime. But as a Love Live anime, it's severely lacking, it feels more like an iDOLM@STER thing. If you're a fan of the franchise, you can skip out on this and miss nothing.  Also, watch Love Live! Superstar!! as it's much more faithful to the franchise.";Not Recommended
3;Love Live! Nijigasaki Gakuen School Idol Doukoukai;BuggoIsHere;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BuggoIsHere;3;Everything about Love Live is empty and meaningless. Every single interaction, every single song, every single scene holds as much importance as a gust of wind. It’s devoid of any substance, and any attempt it tries to fill the characters with some sort of personality is shallow, and comes off as forced.  The only notable points of the show are its animation and songs, which are both well produced and pleasing to listen/watch. Unfortunately, the characters singing these songs are the absolute worst.  While I’ll at least pat their back for trying to develop characters, their problems and personalities can be summed up in single sentences - which conveniently is how long it takes for them to overcome said problems.  Nothing about the show is worth the time sink - in fact, the show’s an absolute bore to sit through. Despite each episode being centered around a single character’s trouble, and them being fairly interesting ideas, they all are far too shallow to get invested in. The only memorable plot point is the near the end, but even that fails to create an interesting or satisfying scenario.  Just like the idols and industry the show continuously applauds, Love Live is pleasing to the eye, but devoid of substance.;Not Recommended
0;Love Like Aliens;messedupboi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/messedupboi;7;This was just a really good AMV, nothing else. The plot about he falling in love with an alien who saves his life from bad guys is good IG. Giving it a 7/10 stars for the music.  The animation was pretty well done in the first few seconds but as soon as they went outside into the space, it seemed like they were running short out of budget so the quality kinda downgraded.  Autotune used in the song kinda left me a bad taste in my mouth but it still was better than what the modern day rappers do.  And plus its only six minutes long so it wont be a problem to give it a try. And you wont find it anywhere else except youtube.;Recommended

0;Love Lab;Florete;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Florete;9;"This show is not yuri. I don't want to spend a lot of time on that fact, so I'll just throw it out there immediately and move on.  So, MAL review reader, if you're reading this line, you probably started your trek of this review by checking out the number I dropped in the ""Overall Rating"" section. Intrigued, perhaps you even clicked those words to bring up the breakdown of numbers I awarded the show for various aspects of its creation. You would then have noticed the number ""10"" in the story section and probably asked yourself, ""What? A perfect 10 in story for a comedy? How does that make sense?""  Normally I would not so directly reference the scores I gave in my actual review; the review is for explaining them, not reiterating them. They're just numbers, anyway. But I feel this worth the mention as it is, in fact, the most crucial part of the review and why the show is so great. I do not consider Love Lab's story worth a 10 because it's deep, or unique, or emotional, or ingeniously crafted. I give it a 10 because it is a comedy executed perfectly.  Love Lab, first and foremost, knows it is a comedy. What does that mean? It means that through everything it does, it stays comical. It will always keep you laughing (if its style of comedy does that for you, of course). Does it have dramatic subplots? Oh yes. Three, in fact. Yet even at the climax of these subplots, it stays funny. In fact, sometimes that's the funniest part.  And yet, at the same time, it never sacrifices suspense for the comedy. It's paradoxical in a way, but the show remains both serious and funny at the same time. Within the suspension of disbelief the show works under, the ways these problems manage to work themselves out are both believable and funny.  Now, one of the worst crimes a comedy can commit is to throw in a dramatic subplot out of nowhere to arbitrarily heighten tension, then forget it when it's done and go back to normal. Well, once again, Love Lab dodges this bullet. Every dramatic subplot has something to do with the point of the show (which, if you weren't aware, is a group of girls researching how to be popular with boys), is led up to, and continues to effect the story of the show and its characters throughout. The final climax of the series is actually the culmination of the event that began the daily lives of the Fuji Girl's student council in the first place and had been building up all along.  If that's not comedy done right, I don't know what is. But now, where would we be without our cast?  With all the praise I gave the story, the characters, too, must be good, right? Of course they are. Maybe not as perfectly crafted as the story, but still plenty good. First up is Riko, the tomboyish ""wild"" one. She has zero relationship experience, but her personality makes her pretty popular with the girls. However, when she walks in on student council prez Natsuo, known around school for being beautiful, kind, and just all around perfect making out with a hug pillow (Yes, really. Not exaggerating)...one thing leads to another and Natsuo, desperate to know how to be popular with boys, ends up believing Riko has tons of relationship experience. She has been around boys a lot...but always AS one of them, not WITH any of them.  Thus begins the relationship with Natsuo as the crazy and Riko as her straight man, even if the reason for it is a bit of a lie. Most of the show's time is spent with these two, and as they grow closer, Riko's secret becomes tougher to keep and even tougher to admit.  But that isn't all. Coming in to help with the love research will be Suzune, the klutz and shy girl, Yuiko, the slightly-childish and somewhat tsundere, and Sayori, the money-loving and merciless smart girl. Suzune and Yuiko, unfortunately, do not really get a chance to shine. One can only do so much in 13 episodes. That doesn't mean, however, that their characters are not well realized and put to use. Suzune's shy nature, while the center of multiple jokes, is also put to use as a way to distract faculty members when the student council needs to get a hold of the broadcasting room. Yuiko and Sayori make a comedy duo not unlike Riko and Natsuo, though in this case it is Sayori treating Yuiko as her butt monkey (don't worry, it's funny in context). Both of them also believe Riko's lie about being popular and further escalate the challenges of keeping or admitting it.  But Sayori doesn't believe Riko's lie. Naw, she's sharp and sees through Riko. But she's not just going to let it loose; she wants to use it to her advantage and have some fun, so she does. But for as clever as she is, she manages to get into some trouble of her own, and when it comes time to face the consequences, which she is completely prepared to do, what becomes even harder for her is allowing her friends to share in the blame with her.  Oh, there are boys in this show, too. Crazy, right? A cute-girls-doing-cute-things show with sausage? I already said it's not yuri, so it shouldn't be that much of a surprise. One might expect the appearance of boys to be a strange turn that doesn't work well in the show, but the opposite is the truth. If anything, the scenes with the male characters only serve to make the show and its characters even better, allowing them to grow in a way one normally wouldn't expect from this kind of show. It's also simply a nice diversion from the paths these shows usually take.  And honestly, I love yuri, but I'm happy for the inclusion of boys here (I know I said I didn't want to spend much time on this, but you've already gotten past the most important part of the review). These shows have a tendency to be kind of sort of maybe pretending to be yuri but not officially yuri so they can say it's not yuri and not polarize any given subset of fans but it's kind of sort of maybe pretending to be yuri so it gets the yuri fans, too. That's cute for a while, but, quite frankly, I'm sick of that shit. Be yuri or don't be yuri. Love Lab replies, ""We are not yuri."" Thank you, Love Lab. Thank you for being straight with me.  Hm, okay, technicalities now. Art and music are both in the decent/good area. They're not nearly bad enough to take the show down at all, but they also don't do a whole lot to enhance one's experience. To sum it up in one word, they are ""fine."" Standard. The character designs aren't wholly unique but distinctive enough to set them apart and animation is largely smooth, mistakes mostly being minor and unnoticeable if you aren't looking for them. The OP and ED are both pretty generic (actually, I found the OP annoying), though the insert music does tend to fit quite well and give the show a good mood when applicable.  If you're tired of the standard cute-girls-doing-cute-things formula but still want to see a good one, check out Love Lab. That was my situation. Heck, if you never even liked the standard cute-girls-doing-cute-things formula, you may still like this. It really isn't easily judged by its cover or title because it's just so much better than what it appears to be.";Recommended
1;Love Lab;MAND4;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MAND4;8;"Well ... that was a freaking surprise. If someone told me, based on that synopsis, that Love Lab is a hilarious and heartwarming journey all through, I'd have him jump off a cliff into my love lab of death. Glad no one did. Regrets would be far too many.  So, where do I even begin? It's quite hard seeing as I'm still kind of thinking about the anime. I'll just begin by saying this: do not let title or the synopsis drive you off. If you think that this anime is filled with cute girls (it kind of is) doing cutesy things (it kind of is) and that's all it is, then you're wrong. Not blaming you though, I only decided to watch this after seeing a short, hilarious clip on YouTube. So yeah ...  The story is surprisingly good. Where majority of anime comedies fail, Love Lab managed to go up a notch. Almost nothing in the anime happens just so ""you can have a couple of laughs"". Somewhere, somehow, it all kind of ties up to the end of the story and the conclusion. It starts in a light tone which continues all throughout. Yeah, there's some drama, but it's not over the top. It doesn't try to shove tears into viewers eyes or anything. It's simply there to give more depth to already great characters.  The story follows Riko and Mika, two seemingly total opposites when it comes to ... well, everything. Mika is a perfect girl, nicknamed even ""Princess"", while Riko is a tomboy, nicknamed ""The Wild One"". They're both admired by other girls in the school but for all the different reason. Fate (and by fate I mean teacher) has its hands in them meeting one another and then the adventure begins. Along the way they're joined with some other (equally hilarious) characters and you're bound to like at least one of them, if not all. To be quite frank, the story is not deep, but it's extremely well executed. It's a story about friendships and how lies sometimes make it hard. Nonetheless, everything that happens is a part of the story. It's not just a sidetrack business trying to make you laugh.  Another impressive part of Love Lab are the characters. There are five main characters (seven if you include guys), and they're all enough unique to have their own charms and likeness to them. Mika is a delusional perfectionist who does everything on her own and wants desperately to have a boyfriend. Riko is her straight counter-part, who's ""Master of love"", and never fails to make you laugh with her comments. She's not as smart as Mika, but you admire her for what she is. Then you have Suzune, shy and timid but equally enthusiastic about their quest to learn how to seduce boys. There's also another duo of hilarity, Sayori and Yuiko; Sayori being composed, seemingly cold and detached person with quirky remarks and affinity for money, and Yuiko being not-so-annoying tsundere. All of them have distinct personalities and they all bring something to the table when it comes to comedy.  You see them grow closer and closer as friends, and you actually believe in their friendship and you feel worried when it feels as if it's going to collapse. There are some over the top moments, but most of the time it's down to earth funny.  When it comes to the production department, it's nothing amazing but it's good enough looking to the eyes. Anime-only-comedy was done extremely well, and I really loved most of the expressions of the characters. They were cute when they were meant to be cute, and they were extremely ugly when they were meant to be ugly. Backgrounds were lacking but that's to be expected from character-focused anime so no complains there. Soundtrack was lacking as well but, from what was there, it fit solidly.  Overall, Love Lab was extremely well done, definitely above average and on sub-par with some other hilarious comedies. Its drama wasn't there to suddenly shift the tone to dark and try to appear more mature, but to give more depth to already established characters. I really do recommend Love Lab if for nothing else but its hilarity.";Recommended
2;Love Lab;SpleenMachine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SpleenMachine;9;"I almost didn't watch this show.  My friend was giving me the rundown on this season's lineup, and mentioned that he was disappointed that the Yuru Yuri crew were working on a show that was being described as being, ""Yuru Yuri, but lewder."" I was a bit sad, Yuru Yuri is one of my all time favorite shows, and seeing the talent behind it make, what I assumed to be, a show with the fan service dial cranked up to 11 was just a let-down. Fan service won't put me off a show altogether, but if its the central focus of the show, I tend to have a diminished interest.  Whoever came up with that description of Love Lab is a monster, and should feel bad. This show is nothing at all like it was described to me.  Content wise, it's not dirty at all, the subject matter of practicing for love is presented in a charmingly innocent way. With characters who are all oblivious but earnest in wanting to know just what it takes to find love. Little to no fan service through the entirety, just smart and well paced humor with fairly low stakes character drama.  The art and animation are incredible, with a very good flow and perfect snap when they want to punctuate a gag. Everything flows just right, and it just FEELS good to watch. Character design fits its tone perfectly, and the voice talent is spot on.  Sure, it's another slice of life anime about high school girls in an incredibly specific and idiosyncratic club, but it does it well enough to be worth watching by fans of fun comedies.  So, ignore what you heard and check this one out. If you remember the awkward days of trying to understand what it meant to find love, or just like funny slice of life shows, then check this one out.  Love Lab ended up being my surprise favorite of the season, and it demands your attention.";Recommended
3;Love Lab;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"Of all the things that exist in the world, perhaps one of the most debated for centuries is the concept of 'love'. Like seriously, what exactly is love? Is it a feeling towards someone you hold dearly for? Or is it perhaps something we humans are born to be part of? Or whatever the case, I'm not a scientist here to discuss the concept of love. However, what I am here to discuss is this cute little series known as Love Lab that debuted during the summer of 2013.  Love Lab (also known as Renai Lab) is an anime series based off of the 4-koma of the same name. The series is written by the author Ruri Miyahara whom has little presence in the manga industry. Her other work known as Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou also has similar themes involving love in a slice of life story with awkward comedy, drama, and romance. However, Love Lab is a little different because it takes the idea of love and focuses it on exclusively as a sort of experiment. Our main characters at Fujisaki Girls Academy plays the role of the scientists and tries to find out exactly what love is through these so called ""love experimentation"".  For starters, Love Lab's concept consists of the idea of discovery. This primarily focuses on discovering how to attract the opposite gender and what love is. It's quite a difficult task because there are all sort of mishaps dealing with love. I mean, think of this way....when you first fell in love, how did that feel like? At any rate, the experiments dealing with the discovery of love and its concepts are explored at Fujisaki Girls Academy. The school itself is famous and pretentious because its school body is composed of well mannered students with elegance. A primarily example is Natsuo Maki, the Student Council President. With her elegance and beauty, she almost seems to be the perfect example of a Yamato Nadeshiko. Hmm, or is she?....  Among its other cast members is Riko Kurahashi, an admired girl but with a rather tomboyish personality. She is one of those girls where is very straightforward with their brutal honesty. In fact, she is even known by others as 'The Wild One'. This is clearly evidenced in the first episode with her actions. Coupled by the fact that she grew up with a little brother younger than herself, expect Riko to be the contrasting side of Maki. If Maki represents the princess, then Riko would be the beast. Then, there are also other characters of the series also become member of the school's life as they are on the journey of perfecting their discovery of....love.  Because the series takes place at all-girl school, expect some undertone yuri. However, this is rather a facade because the tone is actually not as explicit as people may think. This is more evident later on when other characters enters the story that degrade this genre. (if it can be considered one at all for this series). To put it simply, it's NOT yuri.  What makes Love Lab entertaining though are a variety of its ideas. The surprising concept is immediately presented when Riko discovers Maki with her obsession. It doesn't help Maki disprove her case as she is caught red handed with a toy that she practices on. While this is essentially seen as a joke, it's clear that Maki is actually serious about romance. She hopes to make the hearts of boys go 'doki doki'. In reality though, she is already considered elegant with a beautiful face and figure. This is prove especially later on when she actually has several chance encounters with the opposite gender.  As for the experiments go, the theme focuses on love and its various little gags. The fun part typically involves with Maki and she tries to practice with situations that she believe will trigger 'flags'. In a way, her ideas can be relatable to otome games. Unfortunately for her though, these concepts don't always apply to reality and she learns it the hard way. Furthermore, her denseness on the concept of love makes her go to extreme measures with delusional ideas on several occasions. These experiments varies in many degrees as the girls tries at all sort of weird ideas. It's not very simple to explain so it's better to watch the series yourself to see what's going on. However, it can be relatable to high school experiences. Remember the first time you asked out someone? However, the process of actually verbally ask the question is a lot harder than it seems. It takes trials and error to get the right response usually. Here, the girls are in a similar situation.  Being tagged as comedy also, expect Love Lab to have many humorous dialogues and absurd character interactions. There are moments where we can't help but laugh with Maki's behavior regarding to the experiments. In fact, her initial encounter with Riko becomes an abrupt bubble burst with humor. Riko on the other hand is fun to watch as she becomes a sort mentor to Maki. It's like teacher and apprentice without the light sabers.  At some point though, Love Lab might become a chore to watch if decide to follow it all the way through. For one thing, we should want Maki to succeed and unlock the doors behind romance. However, the key to opening it often has her grasping on the wrong set of the key chain. This is proven by her naive ideas and because she lacks experience involving actual interactions with the opposite gender. Also, Maki often interprets almost everything as serious and often fails to recognize words behind the meaning. This is proven later on when she gets into a situation where she gets trapped in a zone of confusion. Additionally, Love Lab often tries a bit too hard and the ideas are cliched. These ideas are usually seen in most romantic comedies but here is taken as a joke. Unlike capturing targets similar to TWGOK (The World God Only Knows), the girls often finds themselves to be the targets.  Artistic wise, the series is pretty generic in its designs. The only two characters that seems to stand out among the others are our two lead female protagonists – Maki and Riko. Maki is designed to look, dress, and act elegant. Riko on the other hand has that tomboyish look for her hairstyle. She even changes her hairstyle too but no one seems to notice it. Two of the supporting characters also goes along with glasses to their design that makes them seem more mature and geeky. Yuiko Enomoto's eyebrows are also designed to look noticeable and commented on many times throughout the show. Finally, there's also the school design that gives off that girlish feeling. It's a girly show after with girls trying to learn romance.  As far as soundtrack goes, Love Lab once again adapts that girlish tone through its OP song, “Love Shitai”. Hearts are clearly seen in the song along with blushing moments of the girls. The OST itself is lighthearted but maintains a poor position because the majority of the series focuses on romance rather than a music band. However, Riko's VA Manami Numakuma does a terrific job in her role because of her tomboyish personality. Her tone of voice clearly presents the vocals of a tomboy. The way she speaks truly makes her the “Wild One”.  I won't say I love Love Lab but it's definitely something fun to watch to pass time by. It has its moments with the girls and what they do at school. In many ways, we see a familiar side to what girls think of the opposite gender as a rather entertaining outlook on the anime industry. Usually, it's the guys that goes after the girls like no tomorrow. But here, the girls wants to learn about love, educate themselves with romance, and maybe even earn themselves a boyfriend. Ultimately, this series might seem to be a bit different but it's certainly can be worth the time to watch through. Love Lab isn't just about experiments of love but also about discovery through experiences.";Recommended
4;Love Lab;Yamada2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yamada2;10;Before I start officially start this review, let me make one thing clear. Love Lab is a full-time comedy anime. Those who don't like comedy, please stay away from this anime. Don't go around giving Love Lab a low score. It will stop those comedy lovers out there from watching Love Lab. On with the review.   Up till now thousands of animes have been released and among these animes we have Love Lab. A small 13 episode comedy anime. Now, what is the plot in Love Lab? Well, it is about the members of the student council in an all girls middle school. The funny part of the plot is that these young girls are secretly doing some 'research' on how to make boys fall for them despite the fact that none of these girls has had any sort of love experience with any boy.  Let's talk about the story in Love Lab. As you might know that many comedy animes don't have a proper story and they rely mostly on unlinked episodes with loads of funny scenes. This is not the case in Love Lab. There is actually a well built story here. You know those animes with good stories where you can tell how it will end halfway through? Well the best thing about this particular anime is that it won't turn out as you think it would. Apart from being well planned, the way the story progresses is totally unpredictable. You will find instances in this anime where you would think of an obvious ending, but it won't end that way. Some characters starting off as antagonists will quickly change to the protagonist and give a whole different view of how things will end. To start off Love Lab, a great introduction to the characters was given so that you know what kind of people you will face. The story progresses quite beautifully. They bring about unexpected events and don't go according to what you think. The story doesn't go the expected way. It felt nice to just go where the story took you and not being able to see the ending beforehand. The ending this anime gave was by far the best ending to an anime I have seen till now. The ending really brought me to tears. They gave it an obvious ending which most won't expect.  Coming to the artwork and sound. It's what you would expect from an anime released in 2013, pretty decent. The artwork is not boring as to make you want to drop this anime. It is pretty neat.  Every anime along with a good storyline should also have well developed characters in order to stay interesting. The way they portray the characters is worth praise here. Unlike some animes, the number of characters was kept low. Some extra characters were added only for the purpose of adding some more comedy to the already funny anime and they had no role in the progress of the story. We are introduced to 5 main characters who are members of the student council. First off we have Maki Natsuo, the vice-president (later president) of the student council. She is a pretty and talented girl who is top in her class. The problem (and main source of comedy) is that she has had no interaction with boys and wants to. She started 'love research' after caught kissing huggy (a large pillow) as practice. She was caught by our next character, Riko Kurahashi. Assistant of the president, Riko is sort of a tomboy and told a lie that started to haunt her every time love research was brought up. Then there is Suzune, a first year middle schooler. She is a clumsy little girl and her clumsiness is one of the main sources of comedy. Then there is Yukio Enomoto, the president (later vice-president) of the council. We also have Sayo, the treasurer. She has a sort of sadistic personality and is the only one who doubts Riko but still plays along. The weird personalities of these characters and their somewhat stupid actions is what makes Love Lab enjoyable.  Love Lab is a brilliant anime. It's hard to tell how good an anime is in words or without spoilers. If you want a good laugh, you might as well give Love Lab a shot. You are sure to enjoy it.   I hope this review was good. Please do comment and give any suggestions on how I could make my review better. :-);Recommended
5;Love Lab;BanjoTheBear;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BanjoTheBear;9;"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)  In many ways, love is a skill. It takes practice, determination, and a little bit of luck in order to fully master its ways. Love is used with romance; it can take on many different forms, and can be applied to many different situations. So, how can one deal with the vast amount of possibilities? Love Lab aims to tackle this problem, and what we are left with is one of the best comedy shows that I have ever seen.  STORY  Love Lab starts off quite simply. ""Wild Kid"" Riko one day stumbles upon ""Princess Fuji"" Maki doing something quite out of character. And from that encounter, the rest of the show follows.  The point of the show is literally in the title. The student council conducts ""love labs"" in order to train themselves to become better lovers and therefore engage in romantic developments. In this way, the show becomes an interesting mix of episodic and story arcs. Much of what happens appears to be standalone, but in actuality, the actions they all take and the things they do affect what happens as the story evolves. This type of ""story-telling"" worked wonderfully because it allowed it to jump from their ""love lab"" escapades, to weaving a narrative, then back to more ""love lab"" shenanigans.  This is a comedy show. As such, the vast majority of what happens is entirely comical and hilarious in nature. However, the show does introduce somewhat significant pieces of drama. But thankfully, none of it feels forced or unsatisfying. Rather, it aligns well with the way the show presents itself. This is because it again employs this mix of two different brands. Meaning, it doesn't just sit on being dramatic, instead going between funny and emotional in a sinusoidal pattern. This is mainly the reason why the drama never feels out of place.  In Love Lab, its overall (and pretty much only) theme that is explored is the idea of what it means to be a friend. Having someone to rely on during good and bad times, someone to be honest with not only yourself but with them as well; the show does a nice job of delving into many different friend-like scenarios. Now, this idea isn't groundbreaking: many shows look at ""the power of friendship."" And while Love Lab doesn't knock it out of the park, their ideas are noted and at least appreciated.  ANIMATION  Despite what LL may look like from the outside, its actual animation is pretty darn good.  The show uses a rather generic looking art-style. There are no highly detailed locations, intricate character designs, or clever uses of light and shadow. In this regard, the art isn't exactly appealing. However, that isn't to say that it is bad to look at. For the most part, it is just ""there.""  In contrast, the animation is great. It contains fluid character movements, detailed facial expressions, and excellent use of both standard and ""comedic"" designs. It's rather funny to see a show like this be animated so nicely. As a viewer, one starts to notice the extra frames in their arm movements, the ways their eyes move, and the attention to detail for their hair and other objects.  I touched on it slightly, but definitely one of the best parts in terms of animation comes from the expressions they are given. Whether it be extremely happy with shades of blushing or quite depressing with glistening eyes, the show incorporates many different reactions that are always on point in comedic timing.  CHARACTERS  The characters of Love Lab are mostly good. I'll stick to the main five since the rest are largely unimportant.  The weakest of the bunch goes to Eno. A classic ""tsundere,"" she is rather bossy and rude at times, but her underlying feeling of justice and caring makes her a good person to have around. I'm a fan of this type of girl. But the problem was that she was probably the most underutilized. She would often retort back with a ""Shut up!"" in most situations, but she did have her moments throughout the show.  Suzu is next. Extremely shy, terribly clumsy, and horribly unfit, she seems quite pitiable on paper. However, her kind demeanor and optimistic attitude makes her nicer than any other person. Always looking to be like her seniors, she does her best to aid the group when it comes to their endeavors. Her schtick was always funny to see, and seeing her deviate from her character or go above and beyond it was constantly hilarious.  The wise and mature one among the student council, Sayori is understanding, defensive, and has a strange obsession with money. While she mostly contains her feelings and teases Riko to no end, she is rational and respectful in the situations that she is put in. During the show, she actually gets her own arc, which allows us to see more of the girl behind the glasses. She isn't super funny on her own, but instead plays well off of the rest of the cast.  Riko, a.k.a ""Wild Kid,"" a.k.a ""W-K,"" is your typical tomboy. She's both forward and passive. She cares deeply for her friends, especially Maki, and doesn't like to see them get hurt in the slightest. Willing to do anything for anyone, she is what you call a ""best friend."" On top of all this, she is easily one of the funniest characters from the show. Her constant bashing, her playful teasing, and her hilarious reactions to the happenings of the group make her a joy to behold.  By far the best character, and now personally one of my all-time favorites, is Maki. Talented, beautiful, nice beyond words, and actually a little strange, I can't say enough about her. She's incredibly funny and her love to love is endearing. It is literally impossible not to have a huge grin on your face whenever she is on-screen. She alone should make you watch this one.  SOUND  The OP is actually quite catchy. I especially like the beginning and the ending where the characters are ""singing"" along with it. It fits the show nicely due to the overall upbeat nature that it brings. The ED, like its visuals, does kind of feel like a car song, if that makes sense. It kind of just makes you want to go. That, and their own little ""Go!"" is really adorable.  The soundtrack is fine for what it is, but I actually found the use of the varying and unique sound effects to be strong. There are many different types, such as with the slap-sticks or the transition piece that work really well.  Voice acting-wise, I found Maki's, Riko's, and Eno's performances to be quite above average. Not only do their voices fit perfectly, but they do a really swell job at making the characters act and feel as they should.  ENJOYMENT  It probably goes without saying at this point, but I absolutely loved this one. I'm a huge sucker for romance, and while the show isn't about romantic relationships, its interesting premise of focusing on romantic happenings was so much fun to watch.  I busted out laughing every time Maki would squeal with delight, I adored Riko breaking the fourth-wall, I smiled at Eno falling for ""Makio,"" I loved them overreacting to many situations; there wasn't an episode where I wasn't laughing or smiling the whole way through (minus the drama parts!).  There's not much more to say here, to be honest. I loved every second of it, and my only wish was that there was more. Love Lab has easily taken a spot among my favorite comedies, and I will be eagerly waiting for season two. Because we can always use a little more love in our lives time and again.  SUMMARY  Story: Great, mixes slice-of-life and arcs in conjunction with comedy and drama to nice effect  Animation: Good, plain art style but really well done actual animation  Characters: Good, Maki is fantastic, Riko is great, and the rest support them  Sound: Great, good OP and ED, nice use of sound effects, above average VA work  Enjoyment: Great, smiles and laughs for the entire ride  Final Score: 9/10";Recommended
6;Love Lab;DreamyGhost;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DreamyGhost;7;"Since this was recommended to by a girl, I already knew it would be good. Then, I found out it involves relationship issues... Talking about romance, without featuring it at all is trully original...  {STORY - 6/10}  A small group of girls giving love advices? Eventhough they don't know a thing about it? Pretty original! Love Lab is about ""how to be romantic"", as it literally gives out lessons to help young girls on getting that special guy's attention.  Finding Maki on a embarassing situation with her own ""kissing"" dakimakura (body pillow) suddenly turna Riko into the student council's assistant. Her first task: teaching our princess how to get closer to a boy and make him interested on her.  Problem is that Riko has no experience and her extremelly tomboyish behavior triggered many rejections from her classmates all over the years past. One single lie convinces Maki the contrary and the admiration she shows is big enough to take Riko down for good... How long will this act last?  Inside a school made for girls, obviously that others may want to learn something from the ""Love Master"". All focus from the council now goes to resolving romantic issues and this is fantastic!  {ART - 7/10}  Aside the ""sweet"" design used on Love Lab, a lot of short ""special"" animation sequences are featured. High speed chases, dark auras and many background changes are some of the nice extras we can notice while watching it.  Overall art is quite simple, specially when it reffers to the characters. Still, the main ones are distinctive on appearance matters and the low-contrast style is gorgeous!  {SOUND - 8/10}  Perfectly matching songs were used on both intro and ending sequences. ""Love Shitai"", about getting in love, and ""Best Friends"", based on these five girls relation, are cheering and joyful, nice to hear, being performed by the main voice actresses, under the name of ""Fuji-Jo Seitokai Shikkou-Bu"". Onto the cast's choice, voices fit well to all characters!  {CHARACTER - 6/10}  Members from the Fujisaki Academy's student council, every one being a love initiate, represent somd of main the possible kinds of girl a male student from junior high may fall in love with.  Riko, violent and rough, gets constantly avoided and rejected, but she her strong-willed and protective attitude is what steals the spotlight. Maki, sensible and gentle, is the one who shows most interest on starting a love relationship with someone. Her beauty is what attracts everyond nearby.  Suzu, cute and shy, is always making mistakes and admires Riko from deep inside. Eno, dedicated and proud, is the only true friend from Sayo, whose cold and anti-social personality prevents her from interacting with her classmates.  {ENJOYMENT - 9/10}  It was a very good comedy and improved a bit of my knowledge about girls in general. All the tips I saw in here aren't useful for me to approach any, but those are a great way to understand something about them.  {OVERALL - 7/10}  An accidental encounter turns Riko's life upside down and she steps into a mess that only gets bigger and bigger. Dating isn't allowed and the council shouldn't be caring about the students' love issues. However, Maki's determination on finding the prince of her dreams persuades Riko onto helping her and trouble after trouble will meet Love Lab!";Recommended
7;Love Lab;raritydash;https://myanimelist.net/profile/raritydash;10;"The schoolgirl comedy genre is something which has just gotten increasingly ubiquitous in anime of late, but contrary to what one might expect, anime studios keep finding ways to make series from the formula which stand out. Studio Dogakobo--who previously produced the anime Yuru Yuri in the same genre--have with Love Lab found another anime that is case in point to that. Likable and refreshing, this is an anime worth watching for someone with even a passing interest in the genre.  Love Lab is well produced. The art looks great and I never noticed much in the way of bad animation. Sound is good too--background music is appropriate and the opening and ending theme are both really cute and fun. The voice acting is where it really shines on the production front though. The voice actresses have impeccable timing and exquisite delivery, which just makes the comedy funnier and the proceedings seem all the more natural and fun.  Which brings me to one of the reasons Love Lab stands out in its genre. The comedy is really good. Humor is subjective, I know, but for me, I can't think of very many similar shows that made me laugh and smile more. The comedic writing is excellent and the characters play off of each other impeccably. At its core its your basic boke and tsukkomi act, but it does it so well it's all more satisfying than it usually is.  The other big reason Love Lab stands as something unique is its plot. Most series in the genre seem content to offer separate snapshots into the girls' lives that maybe in some cases build toward something but don't usually connect directly. Love Lab, on the other hand, connects together in more obvious ways. The episodes actually end with a ""to be continued"" and there are usually plot hooks setting up what is going to happen next. The continuous feel works to it advantage, making it feel more like a complete story even if it is at its core still a collection of amusing events in the lives of a set of schoolgirls.  Now the schoolgirls themselves are an interesting bunch. Good characters are needed in these shows and Love Lab has them. At its core are: Riko, the tomboyish lead who ends up getting dragged onto the student council as an advisor where she must unconvincingly pretend she is a master of love; and Maki, the student council president who is kind of a completely ridiculous idiot and, in her utter cluelessness, is eager to receive Riko's guidance. The two are in time joined by three other girls: shy secretary Suzu who is clumsy and cute; the manipulative and cunning treasurer Sayo who likes playing games with the others, particularly Riko; and the student council VP Eno who is a ridiculous aggressive tsundere character who seems to frequently make a fool of herself. All of them are well developed and produce laughs as they interact both witch each other and a cast of supporting characters that is in time introduced.  So in short, Love Lab is great fun. With good characters, well produced, actual continuing story and excellent humor, it has a lot to offer. Very strongly recommended.  Update: Upon completion, I ultimately bumped my score of Love Lab up to a ten in score. It was impressive from the start and in the end it didn't let me down anywhere. The characters are so lively and fun to watch and also dynamic and engaging, the humor is so consistent, and the sheer fact that it pulled off the feat of staying true to its genre while also offering up an interesting enough ongoing plot that it never stopped being rewarding. I find myself unable to think of anything more I wanted from the show, aside from more of it as soon as possible. Anime comedies are seldom this remarkably solid.";Recommended
8;Love Lab;Blue_Miku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Blue_Miku;8;"[Spoiler Free Review!]  Love Lab. Whilst the name may be somewhat off-putting, this anime deserves a solid 8/10. It's not overwhelmingly unique or captivating but it does what a slice of life comedy is meant to do and in all honesty, it does it pretty well.  Story: 7  The story is good. There is a main plot line that's easy to follow with some side stories thrown in here and there. That being said, there are very few moments where one feels engaged in the story line. It's predictable, to say the least. There are, however, some decent tensions regarding Riko's lies. They kind of make you want to pause the video to relieve yourself of the awkwardness but that's a sign of good writing. This show has a lot of funny moments and with a satisfactory ending, it deserves a good 7/10 in terms of story (which is pretty high for a slice of life, in my books).  Art: 5  Love Lab was released in 2013, so I wasn't expecting anything great in terms of art. However, the art and animation almost seemed like it was older than that. There's nothing awful about it, I just feel like it lacks vibrancy in places (especially at school). In terms of character design, the characters all look very different in terms of faces and hair, which is a plus. Although, Mizu's face and glasses seemed very poorly designed and animated in some scenes, which kind of made me dislike her character, sadly. I'm harsh when it comes to art and this is unfortunately only deserving of a 5.  Sound: 8  The OP and ED were catchy (especially the OP) but not incredibly so. The soundtrack wasn't too noticeable most of the time but had its moments. The voice acting is good. All character's voices suited their personas and there are a few familiar actors, which is always a plus. Riko has a particularly attractive voice in my opinion so... 8!   Characters: 9  So close to being a perfect 10, honestly. The show has an eclectic mix of characters who, whilst aren't the most unique, are this anime's strongest aspect. They aren't introduced too quickly so we have time to grow fond of them before new ones are introduced and the creators also seemed to keep up a steady pace of introducing new characters, which really kept it feeling fresh throughout the series. They're are all unique and there are a lot of likable, funny side characters too! The only thing Love Lab lacks in terms of characters is development. However, the anime is a 13 episode slice of life comedy and one would be considered insatiable to expect fleshed-out character development from it.  Enjoyment: 8  All of these features combined left me feeling quite fulfilled whilst watching and after finishing Love Lab. It's a casual slice of life comedy. Great stuff if you just want a break from stress or don't want something too complex and serious.  Overall: 8/10  I'd recommend this anime to watch. Its re-watch value is also decent, considering that most of the jokes are the kind that make you laugh in the moment, but are also forgotten over time. If you like slice of life comedies, you'll like Love Lab. However, don't be mislead by the ""romance"" tag. Whilst the main goal of the characters is ""love research"", the main theme of the series is the friendships between the characters. As long as you go into this anime not expecting any romance, you'll enjoy it.";Recommended
9;Love Lab;JonBort;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JonBort;8;"Let's get one thing out of the way first: the show's not yuri. It definitely isn't! I was surprised that it was seeing that it was. Prejudice aside, Love Lab was a fun-ride for me after it's 13 episodes.  The show's protagonist is Riko Kurahashi, a tomboy who attends Fuji Academy - a prestigious school known for its well-behaved female students - who is greatly admired by the female students, entitling her as ""The Wild One"". One day she accidentally discovers Maki Natsuo - the academy's student council president and model student - kissing a hug pillow (""dakki"") and claims to be learning romance. Consequently, Rika became Maki's aid for love research and is followed by several other female student council members.  The story was classic comedy. It always end with Riko punishing or reprimanding Maki for her idiocy yet her mischief that stems from her devotion of knowing romance gets more elaborate and comedic as the show progresses. Though the show greatly emphasizes enjoyable friendship which is rather nice and warming to the audience. All characters are unique and I don't find either one of them despicable, even I find Sayori's schemes and way of talking to other characters very funny.  Aside from girls, some guys are introduced as well, which share a very special relationship with Riko, both good and somewhat bad. Their interactions with her were one of the ways to get Riko all flustered in contrast where she acts cool and reasonable at her school. Seeing this shows how female she still is despite her boyish-characteristics. The ending was a good ending for everyone as it proves that deceiving someone is never the root of a great friendship, knowing that made me reflect on myself which was very enlightening.  Visual and audio quality were decent and voice acting was great as always.  Overall, Love Lab! is where you can escape from the common harem genre, which is very refreshing. You get fun characters and a decent story if not all bland. Either way, it all depends on your preferences.";Recommended
10;Love Lab;straggy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/straggy;9;"Love Lab was an anime I pretty much only started watching because it was newly airing and, honestly, I probably wouldn't have bothered with it otherwise, but boy am I glad I did. It's a sweet hidden gem that performed well (despite a few problems I'll address) and is something that everyone should at least give a try, especially fans of ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime, which is exactly what this is.  This anime starts off, and remains, pretty simple. It gave me some Oniisama e vibes in the first episode, from the intensely shoujo ai vibes of the female cast to the gentle worship and admiration of some of the students to the light cherry blossoms flowing between sweet girls at a prestigious school. However, this did not turn out to be the plot-filled twists of drama that Oniisama e was and is very much a slice of life comedy from start to finish. It's light hearted and doesn't really need very much commitment if you're after something relaxing.  Our heroines, Maki and Riko, are both the idols of the all girls' schools they attend, Fuji High, although for very different reasons. Maki, the sweet and prim ""Fuji's Princess"", for single handedly running the student council and being utterly perfect in every way, and Riko, the ""Wild One"", whose disregard for uniform policies and paying attention in class catches the attention of the other very well behaved students. When these two idols end up being in the school council together, many people might've expected their personalities to clash. However, they bond immediately over a desire for love and their relationship grows as the school council and the love research it undergoes do too.  This format worked extremely well. It wasn't entirely plotless, but also never got too complicated. The characters and their gags blended together into a genuinely enjoyable storyline that felt very much like what a slice of life should be - nothing too serious, but also that doesn't just become the same things over and over again. It mostly worked so well because of the characters, who are very much one of this anime's strong points.  The main five of the student council are really the only ones present often enough to receive things like character development, but all of these girls are extremely likeable and watching them interact is a thing of joy. Their chemistry was through the roof, leading to the inevitable question of ""will this be yuri?"" - a question that they, perhaps deliberately, left mostly unanswered. This does lead me to the anime's main fault though, and that is the introduction of what can only be described as love interests.  Partway through the series, two boys are introduced and both as childhood friends of Riko. Their purpose is rather clear - Satoshi and Jan are there to entice Maki and Riko's development and probably eventually become their boyfriends. However, nothing about this scenario was particularly done well, especially for an audience continuously teased by yuri themes in not just this anime. The situation would've been fine if the boys actually had screentime and development, but they barely ever appear, and only ever to be shown as nothing more than love interests. They're not important to the plot otherwise and, despite adding some comedy, feel slightly obnoxiously and haphazardly flung onto the plot like an afterthought of ""ah, yes, this has to be het!"" that almost all animes resort to in the face of yuri, even though it was yuri the creators themselves put in place via the choice of having the girls constantly blush at each other and swoon over circumstances like Maki's crossdressing.  Overall, the boys mostly just felt pretty disappointing. It was incredibly hard to ship them with girls they spent next to no time with, in comparison with girls that literally spent the entire anime building their relationship together. There was very much a difference here between just ignoring the yuri suggestions and ending the anime ambiguously (as many animes did before them) and trying to tear these themes apart with shabbily lobbed characters. It was a real let-down and almost felt like it undermined the girls' friendships by brushing any suggestion of something more into a raging fire of ""no, you have to ship them with these generic archetype boys we just flung at you"".  However, despite these faults, the anime was by no means dragged down to being bad because of it - it really hardly affected my overall opinion at all, despite some disappointment. The art in particular was astoundingly beautiful and the characters had a real charm to them - it was definitely something about their eyes that drew you in. The animation was just consistently fluid throughout and it was incredibly beautiful to both look at and listen to. It was all very light hearted with bright colours, a very fun OP and ED and some good girly voice acting that felt like you were listening to real highschoolers.  It all lead to what was a very enjoyable anime. I looked forward to watching this every week, even though a highly predominant romance genre is not something I'd ever call my type of anime at all. Maki and Riko, and their genuinely beautiful relationship, were the anime's shining star, and if you enjoy what you see of that in the first few episodes then you should carry on to the end, because it really only gets better. I'd really thoroughly recommend Love Lab to pretty much anyone, whether they're in the for or against yuri boat.";Recommended
11;Love Lab;gr8stalin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/gr8stalin;8;"Love Lab is one of those very deceptive shows where you look at the season preview and go ""wow more girls doing club things in high school such original wow very unique"". Under that stereotypical shell however, there's a great show. Hopefully you know what you're getting into by picking something from the SoL category and you'll treat this recommendation as such.  The comedic value mostly comes in the form of the Straight Man/Funny Man routine made famous by comedic duos like Abbot & Costello and Laurel & Hardy. A lot of SoL shows tend to have a pair like this but it's usually limited to one pair and they tend to ride one type of joke throughout the show. What sets this apart from others is that the characters aren't bound to each other: even characters that don't get much screentime with the main cast in the anime are lively and can mingle with said main cast. The best example of this would be the newspaper association's interaction with the student council from episode to episode in which they have a part. There are jokes that come up more than once, but there's enough breathing room and minor detail change between their repetition.  The story isn't really impressive. The overarching conflict is something that can be drawn from a simple skim of the synopsis: a big misunderstanding. If you've watched enough anime, ""misunderstandings"" are all too common a plot device and can sometimes end up defining all interactions one character is involved in. The day to day love research subplots make up for this by giving us introspect into the cast on top of giving us some pretty funny scenes. The story does keep you interested in what's going to happen next and always ends on a proper cliffhanger, however, which a lot of shows which attempt an overarching plot sometimes can't do.  My biggest weakness when it comes to talking analytically about shows is that I'm no art/music critic - I leave that to people who are much more knowledgeable about the arts. From the shows I've watched, I felt that the music was pretty average. Scenes that relied on different music to set moods worked well, but I can't say that I'd remember Love Lab's soundtrack 6 months from now. I've grown used to shows relying on one jingle for some minor background noise, but the OP, ED, and character songs were all very well done and enjoyable to listen to. Some people like to skip OPs and EDs after watching them once - I'm one of those people. However, I ended up sitting through each OP and ED with ease. The seiyuus doing their character songs in character was certainly a point booster. I'm not really that great at finding QUALITY moments that aren't painfully blatant, but most scenes were well detailed. There are placeholders for background characters as you get later into the show, but when concerned with active characters (not necessarily the main cast) there weren't any major QUALITY moments I can remember as of now. The color pallet used is very warm, reminiscent of shows like Nichijou and SYD. There were some very funny animated scenes: case in point, a LOT of animated .gif files are floating around on a number of image-sharing/social websites.  The characters are possibly my favorite point to talk about. Like with all works of fiction, the viewer wants to feel like they can relate to the characters in the show and the problems they go through. This is usually a stretch for SoL shows where it's mostly cute girls doing cute things cutely sometimes with light yuri undertones and a few gags. Love Lab gets the character score I gave it because it hit the mark for realistic and understandable characters. While there are certain tropes that come with your standard high-school cast and any show that has a Straight Man/Funny Man routine, Love Lab manages to keep things grounded in reality. Everyone is flawed in one way or another, and there are no hyper-dense characters that are just totally oblivious to the feelings and actions of the other characters around them. While inter-character conflicts are short in the interest of time, enough background is given to us so that we can put 1 and 1 together. A popular arguing point is that a male target audience is unable to relate to a gaggle of high-school girls in a club or council of some sort, but it's not the characters we're relating to - it's the actions they take and the thoughts they have and the feelings they experience. What's most refreshing about the Love Lab cast as characters is that their decisions in serious scenes don't leave you asking ""What logical path would one have to take to even THINK of arriving at that conclusion?"". I'm honestly not going to touch upon anything relating to ""yuri undertones"" besides this sentence and the next because that topic was argued ad nauseum during the show's debut. Although I liked shows like YuruYuri and Yuyushiki quite a bit, those ""undertones"" don't exist in Love Lab despite people's insistence on them being there and it would have brought my rating of the show down quite a fair bit if there actually were strong ""undertones"".  While obviously not perfect, Love Lab is easily worth watching if you're looking for something not your run-of-the-mill SoL show. I dislike the arbitrary number system for giving something a rating because there are too many grey areas in evaluating a piece of media that a simple number can't express what makes up that grey area, but I default to the Anthony Fantano rating system: Love Lab gets a strong, beefy 8 out of 10. I'd possibly go so far as to stretch it to a light 9 which I reflect in my own list rating.";Recommended
12;Love Lab;Ching-Chan_Kyo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ching-Chan_Kyo;9;I finish this series right before I start to write this review. To sum it up, I would say this daily-style anime exceeds my expectation. The main reason behind this statement is its story is much better than others’. Anyway, I recommend this anime to everyone who enjoys in this kind of anime, such as “Is the order a rabbit?”, “New Game”, and etc.  Many factors in Anime are satisfied by high quality.  Art, the overall quality of Art is stable. Many details are handled well. The quality can be compared with “New Game. “  Music plays an important role in a number of plots. It does its duty that is to bring the audiences into the show. Although, in my opinion, the opening and ending theme are not outstanding.  Characters, from my point of views, are build extraordinarily. Maybe the reason that makes me have this though is this anime is from 2013. Compared to current characters, there are some differences. After all, every character in this anime is unique. Theirs personalities are impressive on the positive side.  Story plays a crucial part in this daily comedy. It makes this anime not be boring. The boring I mean here is there doesn’t exist some crucial events but nothing important. For instance, although “Is the order a rabbit?” is an outstanding daily-style anime, what it lacks are in this anime. There are several important plots in these 13 episodes. Every single plot makes the audience realize that “Look! We got some interesting story.”  Conclusively, this anime is worthy to watch. I recommend to you who needs some laughs in your life.;Recommended
13;Love Lab;LaughingElk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LaughingElk;9;This is a feel good anime and a good one at that. It starts out pretty dull and generic but then turns really emotionall and funny throughout the entire thing. The characters have flaws and can make misstakes and will do misstakes, this is something that i like and that Love Lab does extremly well. I would recommend this to anyone as it's extremly fun and weird but can still be emotionall when it needs to be. This quickly became one of my favorites. Some might not like the artstyle but this is something that you'll quickly look past if you start to watch it. If you like anime in generall this is a anime which you mustn't miss out on.;Recommended
14;Love Lab;halfthewords;https://myanimelist.net/profile/halfthewords;7;"I picked up Love Lab while looking for a new shoujo ai-themed show to watch. I was pleasantly surprised by it, despite the lack of actual shoujo ai. There is some borderline subtext if you squint, but the show largely encompasses friendship, everyday life and some basic lessons of life (i.e. don't lie).  Story: 7/10 There's not much of a plot in Love Lab, as you might expect, following the day-to-day lives of a bunch of highschool girls. But there is a point to the story, even if it's something as simple as having good morals. Of course I've seen more done in 13 episodes than was done with LL but I enjoyed it for the fact that it was short, to the point, and not one moment of it was boring. In fact I can't remember the last time I finished a series faster.  Art: 6/10 I'm usually not a fan of moeblob-type designs but the hilarious facial expressions and the beautiful background imagery of LL was enough for me. The colours are subtle and pastel-ish but lovely all the same.  Sound: 6/10 I wasn't a fan of the OP or the ED and the BGM was nothing memorable, but I've definitely heard worse. The soundtrack for LL isn't the strongest.  Character: 8/10 All of the characters are a refreshing take on the shoujo/slice of life genre. Even though some do live up to the stereotypes that their designs are known for (i.e. Suzu being a shy klutz, Natsuo being the ""princess"" of Fuji-girls and rich etc), every single one of them has flaws, as well as things that make them memorable. Riko is the most entertaining of the bunch and definitely my favourite overall apart from Enomoto, whose tsundere-ness is an ongoing gag. There was only one or two characters I wasn't fond of by the end of the show.  Enjoyment: 8/10 I blitzed this series in a matter of days because of how much I liked it. LL is a light-hearted show that provides a nice change of pace for someone like myself, who typically prefers anime with dark themes.  Overall: 7/10 LL may never be hugely popular, but it does stand out as one of the few shoujo shows that has something different about it. I initially was wary of watching it due to the nature of the artwork and the way it presented from the synopsis, as the whole love research thing sounded ridiculous, but it works so well.";Recommended
15;Love Lab;modernjosei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/modernjosei;7;To summarize this show quickly, it’s the story about the Student Council at Fujisaki Girls Academy who makes an effort to study love and romance to help themselves find love successfully, as well as advise their fellow student body. Maki the Student Council President is a bit naive and ropes in the edgy wild one, Riko, to advise the girls on what they should do to find love. Hesitant to accept, Riko gets pulled in while lying to all the girls that she has copious amount of boy suitors and her popularity outside of the high school. Luckily for her the girls don’t catch on, and antics ensue with the girls struggling to keep Love Lab a secret from the faculty while also aiding their fellow classmates. The dangers aren’t too serious though, as this show is mostly light and fun, with serious moments being on the back burner for the duration of most of the episodes.  The Characters   The show is very good at roping you into the student council as Maki, (the secondary protagonist) has an infectious personality. You sympathize more with Riko, (the main protagonist) as she is a bit more level headed, but you still enjoy the banter between the two of them. They are the two main drivers of the plot, but intermixed is the gentle yet clumsy Suzu, the stubborn but convicted Enomoto and the cunning yet well-intentioned Mizushima. Each character has qualities to like about them, and none of them are people you couldn’t consider yourself getting along with. They’re probably too perfect but that’s ok. The show is pretty idealized and not too serious so it’s ok that the characters are idealized as well. I give this aspect of the show a 7.5 out of 10 as the characters although not riddled with too many flaws for a dynamic show, are still likeable and feel very real as people, especially when interacting together.  The Story  As summarized earlier, the story is pretty simple. It’s mostly about young girls having fun, and it accomplishes that fun aspect very well. It attempts to bring in conflicts if you can call it that, but it doesn’t surprise the audience as we know of course things will be resolved in no time. Although this makes it pretty predictable, we shouldn’t expect a show directed towards a younger demographic to do much beyond that. At least the conflicts are interesting and explore new ideas that young girls have to face. Contrasting that is the funny moments in the show which were executed perfectly. I was laughing along with them, and the comedy succeeds because of the strength they accomplish with developing the characters. We learn to like every character because it delves into each characters’ back story, even if just for a little bit. Getting to know what to expect from each character makes the comedy that much funnier as we see the dynamics between the girls play out with their contrasting personalities. And that’s all and good, but the question is, and I mean obviously it would be on your mind since this show is called Love Lab, how’s the romance? And I would answer you… underdeveloped. The show pushes forward friendship first, with love much farther on the list. This short season just gives you a taste for all that Love Lab has to offer, so anyone wanting more from it has to turn to the manga. So with all those elements put together I give the story a 7.0 out of 10. Its comedy is bang on, but it lacks in most other regards to make it shy of a higher score. But for young girls, this show is a must see for sure. For women my age however? (I’m 22) It’s more a nostalgic revisit to the easy times when you were first learning about love.  The Message  Now, one thing I did not expect from a shoujo comedy series was just how deep this show got at times (Refer to image above from episode 9, it’s an artistic metaphor). There were a lot of moments where I thought damn, these girls are really just amazing people, they try to be nice to everyone and help each other grow and mature in a constructive way. This isn’t one of those mean girls episodics, the girls learn from each other in a positive way. And as I mentioned before, there’s never any real dangers because the girls are such a together group, and their hard work pays off for them. The show demonstrates what real friendship is, that what it takes to be a good person isn’t always easy, and that being confident in yourself will gravitate others towards you. Just a lot of fuzzy nice messages that are often overlooked in animes, especially those geared towards a younger audience. The message of this show is what kept me watching, because easily a young adult woman would have nothing to relate to this show otherwise. If you’re curious and you’re a little older, maybe give this title a try, if not for this reason. I give the message a 9.0 out of 10. For obvious reasons mentioned above, it made the show stand out this season.  The Verdict  This show is complex for the overthinker and simple for those just looking for a sweet laugh. But did I enjoy it? Yes! I’m not eager to admit that I liked a fluffy shoujo anime but I believe it accomplished a little more than most shoujos tend to. It was pleasant returning week after week to watch the latest episode as it was continually giving a new experience instead of boring me. Although it ended just as new ideas were developing, it’s only 13 episodes long and I intend to look into the manga to get my Love Lab fix. Compiling my score it gets a solid 7.8 out of 10. Not perfect, but probably a bit more perfect for young girls, especially those in their tweens to early teens.  Christina  via modernjosei.tumblr.com;Recommended
16;Love Lab;vitriolcocktail;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vitriolcocktail;7;An overall wholesome anime, in the same vein as K-On! and other slice of life animes.  The plot is something fresh and interesting, instead of doing something run-of-the-mill like a normal school club the writers came up with something unique. I give them points for originality.  The characters are generally well fleshed-out and interesting.  My biggest complaint would be that the drama arc between Riko and Maki is kind of lame, but i guess one could argue that it fits perfectly for teenage girl drama.  Art and sound is fine enough.  Not a bad anime, but also not exceptionally noteworthy in any category, in my opinion.;Recommended

While YuruYuri is more of a slice of life show Love Lab is more of a raunchy comedy. I don't want to use a synopsis because of the spoiler but it is funny and worth the watch. And that's coming from someone who generally doesn't seek out shows like this. It’s hard to review a comedy because humor is subjective; just because I laughed throughout doesn’t mean everyone else will. Some may find Riko unlikable. some may find this wholly inappropriate behavior for middle school girls. Some may dismiss it as moe trash. I’d say those people are overthinking it with this series. It’s funny and raunchy without being pretentious and preachy.";Recommended
19;Love Lab;albertbrown;https://myanimelist.net/profile/albertbrown;8;"When I watched “Love Lab” for the first time, I was amazed at how interesting this story was. The funny thing about the show was how well the characters were developed, mainly Sayori, Maki and Riko. Those characters shined in the first 7 episodes when they talked about how they go along with romance, while at the same time trying to make sure the girls-only school doesn’t know that much about it. Sayo is one of the cool characters that doesn’t have to be liked like Riko, or try hard to get love like Maki and Eno. However, she is a sort of a balance between these characters, as they sort of represent a battle between two worlds.  As for Eno and Suzu, the next 6 episodes dealt with their two different personalities; one wanting to be a leader while not really knowing how much to lead because of Riko’s popular personality, and the other so shy that she wants to be popular, but not wanting to be too much of an outcast.  Riko has her flaws, too. Besides being overconfident and flimsy, she does wish about what it would be like to have a boyfriend without having the “tomboy” look, whereas Maki has very wild expectations that don’t come close to reality. When it comes to dating, it’s like her visualizing kissing a body pillow: you won’t come too far with actual romance and relationship skills.  Love Lab is a good show if you wonder how a school-themed show can be enjoyable and quirky at the same time. Most of the school-themed tropes aren’t as evident as most school-themed shows, but the jokes about high school love interests being something that must happen in your life if you want to have an “authentic” relationship, will hit you hard, when they weren’t trying to be serious.";Recommended
0;Love Lab;FreakyTy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FreakyTy;6;Much to my dissatisfaction let me start off saying despite a few other reviews I saw this show is not shoujo ai. The opening also points to this possibility however don't get your hopes up. It's not there so if you're looking for a cutesy yuri don't go for this, but that doesn't mean you should drop it either.  If you like moe shows you'll like this and if you like comedy this is also a winner. At its core Love Lab is a comedy and no matter how serious the tone it always delivers a joke and never misses the punch line. It delivers plenty of fun moments and does a good job of not deviating too much from the main goal of keeping you laughing.  The plot itself is not going to blow your mind or set new lines for what a comedy should be so just expect the common place cute girls doing cute things and trying to learn about boys, but actually hilarious in comparison to something like K-ON! The main characters are your standard fare of cookie-cutter archetypes don't expect much on this front. That is not necessarily a bad thing though because the show works and flows nicely this way and will deliver at least one or two characters you'll like.  The art for this show is very familiar and nothing too new or impressive. It does keep the same style throughout. On the animation side of things Love Lab starts off with some pretty visuals and nice flowing scenes that are very well animated and looks surprisingly good for a moe comedy. However the animation doesn't keep this quality through all the episodes, and falls off quickly. It seems only the more emotional scenes get this treatment and it's a shame because it looks awesome.  The sound in Love Lab is also nothing too impressive, but it's good enough to not take away from the rest of the show. The voice actors portray the characters well. The only thing is that they're the same voices you hear in all moe comedies. The music is nice and accommodates the scenes nicely, but is overall forgettable outside the OP. The ED isn't anything that great either, and I found myself skipping it a few times just to get to the next episode.  Overall Love Lab is just another moe comedy with not too much going for it, but at the same time seems to hold something special that not all the others have. It's funny and it doesn't stray from this path other than once or twice to add drama and even then it's always just setting up the punch line for another joke. Its fun and entertaining if you like innocent, romance themed humor or cute girls interacting with each other.  I give Love Lab a 6.5 out of 10 but MAL won't let me do that so 6 because I round down.;Mixed Feelings
1;Love Lab;Maggot_Brain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Maggot_Brain;6;Love Lab,as seen in the preview,is about a group of middle school girls as they try to prepare themselves to eventually fall in love.  Story: The series has a very good start,it is very neatly paced.Nowhere will we feel that it is progressing at a fast or a slow rate.Riko is mistaken to be an expert in matters of love and she has to maintain that facade due to her rather proud nature.This seemed interesting,but the later episodes brought this up too much for the shows good.After some point,it all does not ring true,and we are not that interested anymore as to how this issue will be resolved.Many characters are not given much screen time and they seem underdeveloped.If there is a season 2 planned,this may be rectified in it,but as this series stands now,it is quite weak.  Art: I won't dwell much on this but it quite good,one of the best characters of this anime,in fact.  Sound: Nothing memorable,but it works.  Characters: Even though it feels as though we have seen all the characters somewhere before in other anime's,the interactions between them are quite refreshing at times,so much that the fact that they seem cliche does not seem a bother.Some characters were not adequately developed,and i hope a 2nd season will address this issue.  Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the first half of the anime,but for some reason,the second half was not as enjoyable.The jokes just do not seem as funny.The main reason i rated this a 6 was the ending.I was disappointed in it.I expected so much more.Maki's character lost it's freshness for me around the middle of the series.Only sayo seemed interesting as the story progressed,and to a lesser extent,yuiko.  As for my final verdict,this is quite good,just does not have the 'something special' to elevate it to higher position compared to other high school comedies.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love Lab;ImRingo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ImRingo;6;"***Spoiler free review***  Love Lab is one of those many (and when I say many I really mean millions) cutesy girl anime that revolve around a school setting. Furthermore it takes place at an all girl’s high school where everyone is petrified to even be near a man thus bringing us to Love Lab quirky but somewhat plausible premise. It is a flawed show...but I still love it.  Story: 4/10  I found the premise of the show extremely superficial since I find it hardly believable that these girls would have almost no experience even being around boys. Basically these girls start up a “Love Lab” as a part of the student council. They would take questions on love (which they have no clue about) from students that asked and somehow answer them. This however was easy to look past (for me at least) since the characters were really the stars of the show. You can draw comparisons to K-On in this setting; you didn’t watch K-On for the music aspect of the show but rather the character interactions. The same applies here as if you are seriously watching this show for the plot then you have very low standards.  Animation: 6/10  This just may be my weirdness but I swear at one point in the show the animation quality dropped down. I feel as if things like how the character’s hair flowed or the clarity of background objects just suddenly lost effort. Regardless the show sports some okish visuals. Each character is very appealing to look at (eyes yum) but other than that I feel as if everything else was just passable.  Sound: 4.5/10  Nothing really stood out here. Some ok tunes but I didn’t find anything over the top. Didn’t like the OP or ending stuff either.  Characters: 8/10  I LOVED all the characters except the annoying vice president Maki. Other than her, all the other characters really flowed well with each other and brought some sort of enjoyment to what was going on. My personal favorite was Enomoto since she eventually starts to open up to the club and provide some helpfulness.  Overall: 5.6/10  Overall the show was pretty bland but I did end up enjoying it. Loved the character interactions and there were some moments of awesomeness on the animation front (though VERY limited). I would recommend this anime as one of those rainy day type stuff you watch when there is literally nothing left.  Enjoyment: 8/10  Thanks for reading my review!

3;Love Lab;PixelB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PixelB;6;Love Lab is a surprisingly decent comedy that tries to incorporate melodrama when it really doesn't need to. In fact, it only muddies the waters and it makes you wonder what the identity of the show is going for. Love Lab is built on a comedic premise about girls dreaming about their ideal guy and fantasizing about them in unrealistic scenarios: the childish fantasies fuel the show and characters, and it's what makes the comedy charming. Yet, on the other hand, you have a decent amount of conflict and drama in a comedically themed show. I never really expected this show to be realistic or anything beyond comedic since it's not really what it was aiming for in the first few episodes, and it doesn't fit the theme of the show at all. It makes sense, considering that despite the girls in the show doing research on love, there's no romance at all, and there's just fantasies and imaginary scenarios. It definitely is strange that there is such an emphasis on drama in this show despite its silly premise. I wonder why there's always shows like these, which can't make up their mind on focusing on a set of genres that don't clash with each other? It's fine if a comedy has some drama, and it sometimes is expected. After all, a show can't always be a pure gag. There's bound to be some story or character development arcs. A good example of this Boku no Tonari. It's a comedy too, but it maybe used a couple episodes of drama at most, with emphasis on comedy. Contrast this to Love Lab, where every single arc after the first in the show has some sort of conflict and drama, with comedy sprinkled in between. There's some intermission scenes with pure comedy, but for the most part, you're going to be seeing some melodrama unfolding. I'd say that perhaps 30-40% of the show is melodrama, which is a decent chunk of the show, and if I were to judge purely based on that content, then this show would score not nearly as high as I rated it. Comedy carries this show hard, and so I just kind of find it weird that it's not the focus half the time. If the show wanted to be more serious, it should have taken a more serious direction. Have a show be about research on love and with drama sprinkled in? Why not actually introduce romance or Yuri, so there actually is some sort of drama and conflict that makes sense with the theme of the show? Instead, the show does stupid things like introduce consequences to a light-hearted action like punishing student council members for an unannounced broadcast. Does it really make sense that this would be a problem in a comedy show? Come on. Even the final arc of the show really forces the conflict and is precedented on a terribly predictable misunderstanding that everyone would have figured out. The show could have still resolved the conflict in a reasonable manner if it was framed better, but instead, it drags out the melodrama for no particularly good reason. Again, and it's like I'm a broken record at this point, but Love Lab would have succeeded a lot more if it decided to go with a theme that it stuck with. If it wanted melodrama, it should have built a cast of characters and introduced relationships and stories that fit it. Otherwise, just focus on the comedy, please.;Mixed Feelings

Yeah, the story is really weird and doesn't make sense sometimes, but this show is obviously not supposed to be taken seriously, it's supposed to be funny and entertain you for 4 minutes.

1;Love Kome: We Love Rice;WhatDothLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhatDothLife;10;"Minor Spoilers.  Yes, I know. I get it. It's a gimmick: a bunch of anthropomorphic (read: basically human) strains of rice set out to become the HarveStars in this food-based idol anime, glorifying white rice in what is essentially a propaganda piece/P.S.A. attempting to encourage more sales and growth of white rice.  With that bizarre scenario in mind, if you ride the irony, this show is absolutely hilarious. So much effort went into telling the facts of the grains industry and real world problems facing it, inserted clumsily into the actual character dialogue; you can almost imagine the meeting that was had in order to promote white rice effectively in the show. If you take into context the absolute corporate cynicism at display here, it becomes very humorous to think about, at least, for me.  It follows stereotypical rice boys, a complete set of oft-used anime personalities. They gotta train to be HarveStars, you see. When they do a special dance, it is a Harvest Show, and rice begins to grow. The main protagonist gets a crew together and the group is called Love Rice. There's also the bread boys, their rivals, whose group is called Yeast King. Even if it is enjoyed ironically there's some dumb but funny humor at play, with a lot of rice puns. Lots of rice puns.  Each episode is short and you could blaze through the series in a day. The first season episodes all end in a special rice-related recipe (done in live action footage, something akin to what you might find on your facebook feed), whereas the second season episodes end in rice trivia.  So the question being, is it fun to watch alone? Probably not. But if you get a good buddy and you both go into this anime, it's a fun watch for how dumb it is alone.

I had a really great time watching it and I would recommend it to anyone. Plus, the episode run time is so short you really have nothing to lose.  The show falls on a LOT of cliches, but given the absolutely absurd premise, this is actually a strength. Like, what if generic idol academy competition plot, but RICE??? I mean, canonically within the universe of this show, rice people have rice water for blood. This comes up more than once, this is consistent world building we're talking about. They just triple down on the rice thing and don't look back, and it had me screaming-laughing and crying-laughing more than once.  A lot of the rice puns get lost in translation, but the translators really did their best. You can kind of get the idea that it would be funnier if you spoke Japanese. Most of the humor is more visual and premise-based, though, so the pun thing isn't too bad.  Given the minimal plot, the ending (of season 1) is still genuinely sweet and ties things up nicely. Plus, the ending scene features the main characters floating in space naked with glowing sparkles to censor their private parts, which is something this anime has in common with Puella Magi Madoka Magica, one of the greatest anime of all time.

0;Love Kome: We Love Rice;Jojimatthews;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jojimatthews;6;Actual rating 5.5/10  This show was an interesting experince, in many ways upon the surface it would appear similar to a great cooking manga/anime like Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou, Shinya Shokudo or Shokugeki no souma, and in terms of actual product it was similar to all three but in the worst way, the linking of the shorter charachter studies in this show were enough to retain one's attention but not enough to be engaging so it is almost an inverse of Shinya Shokudou, it lacks the requisite goofiness and identity through visual presentation to be as funny as Tonkatsu Dj Agetarou and it lacks the amazing presentation of cooking that is present in Shokugeki no souma.  BUT  The series as a whole had one other thing in common with these other series, Passion, there was a clear effort put into making this show charming above all else, it has real heart and I think that is worth as much as I have given the show;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Kome: We Love Rice;Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;4;"Do you love rice? Do you love boys? If yes, you'd better hand yourself in to the police. But before you do, you'd better watch Love Rice. It might make you reconsider your life choices.  Hinohikari is a boy who knows what he wants & what he wants is to be the HarveStar of the Harvest Show. There's just one problem: nobody likes rice any more, which is unfortunate enough when you're a rice-boy (not the car kind) but doubly so when it means the Kokuritsu Inaho Academy he attends is in danger of shutting down. Undeterred, Hinohikari will achieve his dream & save his school the only way he knows how; by joining a cross-dressing idol unit? Okay.  Rice Boys sets out to answer the ultimate question – which is better: bread or rice? After quickly ditching the women's clothes, the newly christened Love Rice (because they love rice) prepare to do musical battle against their wheaty rivals the Yeast Kings; using as many bad puns, bland songs & homoerotic moments as it takes.  In case you weren't able to tell, Love Rice is out to promote Japanese rice (white, sticky, short grains only. None of that exotic Indian stuff here) to women. Each character is named after a specific strain & some effort is made to tie their personalities with their namesake, though it's hard to tell with rice - since it's rice. Their musical performances take place in golden paddy fields & dammit if they aren't trying their hardest to be the best rice-boys they can be so the Gourmet Girls will vote for them. It's a concept silly enough that it could have been a lot of cheesey fun.  But for a concept as silly as pretty rice-boys, Love Rice for the most part plays itself frustratingly straight. Part of this is down to the utterly uninspired production, which makes almost no effort to visually accentuate the humour & often leaves the characters looking like rough drafts rather than finished articles. But even beyond that there isn't much to it. The story is for the most part bog standard, with the bland songs doing little to improve things. It take a turn for the suitably stupid when Love Rice & the Yeast Kings set aside their differences – because at the end of the day rice & wheat are both grains - to thwart a kidnapping, but it's so rushed & disjointed that the humour is lost.  When compared to other male idol or anthropomorphic pretty boy series, Love Rice hardly measures. Unlike Sekko Boys, It doesn't do nearly enough with the ridiculousness of its core concept, relying instead of repetitive agriculture puns & Sasanishiki coughing up more white fluids than Paris Hilton. It barely manages to fill its four minute episodes, even with songs & cooking tutorials padding out the runtime, whereas Miracle Train managed to build an entire regular length series out of sexy male train stations. Or they could have gone in a completely different direction & made Love Rice about actual rice. Worked for The Nameko Families.  Instead, whatever the intentions behind its creation, Love Rice just feels like a half-arsed attempt to ride the male idol & fujoshi waves by combining “attractive” male character designs with a silly gimmick that's supposed to make you think it's just a bit of fun, so who cares? It's certainly no Pillow Boys, but there are plenty of better examples of what Love Rice is trying to do, though you might get some new meal ideas from it. Unless you really love boys...I mean rice, it can be safely ignored.";Not Recommended
0;"Love Hina: Motoko no Sentaku, Koi ka Ken... ""Naku na""";Mante;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mante;9;I LOVE Love Hina Series, its one of my fav animes. I enjoyed watching this special because as you might know, in this episode appears Motoko's sister (who I think is a lot hotter than her).  This special is also known as the chapter 25. Since Motoko is an interesting chatacter, this especial tries to make her look even more interesting, by showing an intense fight and another side of her life...  So now you know, if you want to know more about Motoko's life, you should watch this 20-mins special;Recommended
1;"Love Hina: Motoko no Sentaku, Koi ka Ken... ""Naku na""";Malhavok;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Malhavok;8;"This DVD bonus episode is an adaption of the fan-favorite ""Burn up Blade!"" arc from the Love Hina manga.  It's a fairly well known fact that mangaka Ken Akamatsu's favorite Love Hina character is Motoko Aoyama and this arc is probably the turning point in the original manga where she begins to appear much more frequently. As an interesting side fact, by the time the series ended the character of Motoko was more popular in fan polling than the lead heroine, Naru Narusegawa!  So with that being said, if you are a fan of Motoko and in particularly the idea of a Motoko and Keitaro fan-shipping relationship, then you will enjoy this episode immensely.  The quality of this episode is just as good, if not better than the televised episodes and Motoko's seiyu, veteran Yuu Asakawa never disappoints with her performance as Motoko. The only real downside here is that they condensed what could have easily been a full length OVA or 3 episodes into a single bonus episode. It's still good, but there was a lot of stuff tossed in the adaption from the original manga arc that would have been nice to see animated.  Final verdict: If you love Motoko, then you will love this bonus episode.";Recommended
2;"Love Hina: Motoko no Sentaku, Koi ka Ken... ""Naku na""";arnxx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/arnxx;7;First, don't watch this if you haven't watched Love Hina, it'll spoil some stuff.  Story: This special will give a nice backstory for Motoko, you'll met her sister and learn some stuff about her past. All your favorite characters will be there to give a mix of shonen, comedy and echii. This episode focuses on shonen action between Motoko and her sister witch makes me wonder if it'll be a good idea to make a anime about Matoko.  Art: I'ts slightly better than the original, though i'm not particulary a fan of the artwork, probably because its better in the manga. This special will give lots of fanservice in the form of pantyshots and even a bare butt. I don't think anyone would mind.  Sound: Same music as the original, though I think they re-use music too much, especially the main theme.  Enoyment: Enjoyed it as much as other episodes from love hina. Nothing much to add  Overall: I'm giving it a 7, just as the original. The story is not too special but the characters are superb. Must see If you liked the original.;Recommended

0;Love Hina Haru Special: Kimi Sakura Chiru Nakare!!;anime_n00b;https://myanimelist.net/profile/anime_n00b;7;"This is a typical special episode.. There really isnt much here for someone looking for a bit of a ""conclusion"" on the Keitaro x Naru arc.. But the one thing that this special does do.. is give you more of a prespective into the Shinobu x Keitaro arc. You learn more about her feelings and thoughts.. I wished they would have went ahead and made it into a special completely from her prespective.. but.. they did enough for me to develop her character and feelings a bit more..  But.. This IS a special so.. its basically for the fans.. It doesnt really have anything to do with the storyline.. and its more like a mini-movie for fans of the series.  The art is the same as the series.. the music is still good.. and it has the same comedic hi-jinks. If you like the series.. youll like this too! I hope you enjoy!";Recommended
0;Love Hina Haru Special: Kimi Sakura Chiru Nakare!!;rewdalf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rewdalf;5;Let's get down with the review.  -Keitaro got a tan. -Keitaro finally got into Tokyo U, but the rest of the episode is spent on the girls locating him just to tell him that. -There's an alternate dark side Shinobu. -At the waterfall scene both Naru and Nyamo had to change into leaf clothes after their shirts had been soaked with water but few scenes later Nyamo changes back into her normal clothes while Naru is still in leaf clothing. Okay. -The scene at the end is an important event, as it is an important progress for both Naru and Keitaro's relationship. Might as well be saying that this whole episode is worth it just for that scene. Even Love Hina Again will reference to this scene.  The audience would not miss anything by skipping this out but the confession scene at the end still looks pretty important in preparation for Love Hina Again.;Mixed Feelings
0;Love Hina Haru Special: Kimi Sakura Chiru Nakare!!;HybridMedia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HybridMedia;2;The tests have come, and Keitaro can only hope to succeed. However, in the final stretch, he fails miserably and daydreams through the test. Assuming that he has failed, he runs away, so the rest of the cast hunts him down on a remote desert island to bring him back.  I might as well call this special, “The FUCK IT ALL” special because we’re just going through the same shit again with Keitaro trying to pass his entrance exam to be in Tokyo U for the umpteenth time but manages to fuck that up and ended up being at a desert island.    Sorry if I don’t have much to say on this because they’re really isn’t much to say about this. Keitaro is going through some shit we’ve seen before. Shinobu’s storyline isn’t that much vital anyway considering that whole “this guy likes me but I’m obviously in love with Keitaro” plotline isn’t referenced that much in the OVA and of course, there is another character, this island girl named Nyamo, who is basically a darker skinned version of Shinobu and her plot of finding her father or grandfather or something…….yeah, the OVA didn’t have much care about it so why should I?    And yes, those Keitaro/Naru moments are back and still annoying as ever, especially with one scene where she’s chasing him throughout the desert and even when she’s almost exhausted, she still tries to hit him. Stop with that shit!!! It wasn’t cute nor funny the first time and it’s not going to be this time either, it’s just an annoying gag that got overused way too much in this franchise and it only justifies as why should we care if these two idiots get together in the end. Even if there was a conclusion to that story, I still wouldn’t care that much about it. Yeah, as I said in the Again review….their problem isn’t the fan service, it’s their comedy and their schmaltzy attempts of getting sentiment from the audience. You want to make something with enough laughs and heart? Then don’t follow Love Hina’s example!!!    As for the animation and sound, they are about as equal to the series and the last OVA, The Christmas Special, and they isn’t really nothing new to add on the animation front. It was daring and new at the time it come around but it’s just mostly the standard as of……well, a few years ago. Music is just the same cutesy yet annoying tone but it gets worse during the Spring Special and worse of all, The English dub is just so horrible…….my god, this is a bad one. All the voices sound too high-pitched and girly even when it’s the voice actresses giving it their all and while I may like some of these actresses, I think their talents were abused during this OVA.    FINAL VERDICT: I’m so glad I’m done with this franchise. Just so fucking done. I hate Love Hina within all my heart and this is never going to change. You don’t give a shit about the story, the characters, and you wonder why you even thought of going along with this in the first place.;Not Recommended
0;Love Hina Final Selection;AoiMemori;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AoiMemori;5;"Oh wow. Seems like this was a much waited ending to something that was watched a long time ago. But I am going to be blunt from the get go: don't waste your time watching this if you have already watched the main series. It's seriously not worth it.  Story: This is nothing more than a re-cap of all 24 episodes mostly concentrating on the fact that Keitaro finds his &quot;girl of the promise&quot; and &quot;winding up with the one&quot;. Seriously. It doesn't even give you the great ending that we get in the manga so it's a bit of a time waster to just watch this to review what you have already seen.  Art: Is as lovely as the rest of the series.  Sound: Is pretty much the same as the series and specials.  Characters: We dive a little bit into the background info of all the main characters of who they are and what they did in the original anime storyline.  Enjoyment: Wow. This was seriously a downer. I was expecting to see a wedding or a big expedition kinda like the one we see after Seta &quot;kidnaps&quot; Naru and Keitaro to do at the end of Hina Again.  But, take your chances. It may be a way for you to see what it was you may have watched years ago but don't go into it expecting a sound answer as to who he truly winds up with and has a happy ending with in the end.";Mixed Feelings
0;Love Hina Final Selection;PhillipMannering;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PhillipMannering;4;"Actual Name: Love Hina: Final Selection More suitable name: Love Hina: Final Recapitulation(recap)  Sorry to disappoint all fanboys like me who were expecting something epic, something awesomely grand and romantic like that in Love Hina Again. I must admit that Love Hina Again was really great. This thing is basically a recap- for the better part of the wpisode(about 25 minutes) the characters were being introduced and the story was being summarized.As if ANYBODY would watch the final episode without watching the prequels. It is safe to say that most people already knew who he ended up with (in Love Hina Again) this just reinforces it... So pretty much no story.  Art good as always- no need to comment.  Being a recap, the characters weren't given much screen time so it is really hard to rate them based on this alone.  Enjoyment. Bruh. I was totally let-down. Like I didn't come here to hear what I already know be repeated. But still,the final selection IS there although there is still room for a final selection 2 (if you get what I am saying.) Overall; Judging this episode alone, it would receive a decent-which according to MAL is a four. The whole series would get a 9.98 but saying that here is pointless.  Should you watch? Yes.... -but skip to minute 25 for the -well- decent- content.";Not Recommended
0;Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve;ColdBeans;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ColdBeans;8;"STORY 8/10 The Christmas special is by far better than any of the Love Hina television episodes. It concentrates more on the characters and their interactions with one another, rather than overdone slapstick comedy, though that also finds its way into the release. It can easily be said that this one release has more emotion in it than all of the episodes combined, making it a very worthwhile view for Love Hina fans everywhere. Within its one hour run time, it manages to focus on Naru and Keitaro, while still exploring the feelings and thoughts of the other characters. Interestingly, while it has, by far, the most emotion of all the episodes, as well as a plot line that is stronger than the entire series combined, it also has the most fanservice shots. These shots occur often and plentifully, from breast shots, prolonged implied nudity, to panty shots. While sometimes they seem too forced and overdone, they don't detract from the release, whose main focus remains the story and the strong emotions felt by the characters.  ANIMATION 7/10 The animation in the special is just as choppy on occasion as the television series, but with all of the action occurring on the screen, it's not too noticeable. The art, also, is nothing extraordinary, but serves its purpose well. The characters and backgrounds are clear and largely uncluttered, which allows it to be free of any unnecessary line distractions. Another aspect of the art that has always been commendable is the successful way that facial emotions are shown in all of the characters. Coupled with the emotional scenes that appear near the end, this enhances the effect of the feelings that the director tries to portray. There is one particularly disturbing aspect of the art, though, and that is the way snow is drawn. Most of the times, it's shown as just balls of white fuzz drifting from the sky, which is nice, but on occasion, the camera will attempt to show zoomed-in snowflakes. These appear as large popcorn-esque chunks of white material, which can invoke a rather puzzled feeling from viewers who aren't used to seeing balls of styrofoam rain from the sky.  MUSIC 8/10 Another characteristic especially pleasant about the Christmas special was the music. The soundtrack ranged from catchy JPop tunes to slow melodic instrumentals that fit the spirits of the scenes perfectly. The only complaint is that sometimes the cheerful holiday music in the background combined with the background noises clutters the dialogue tracks more than they have to. Given the fact that some of the scenes take place in the middle of Tokyo around Christmas time, this is understandable, but on occasion, it can be slightly distracting. Nevertheless, the JPop is sure to win some fans over, as they are infectious and perfect for Christmas karaoke parties.  CHARACTER 9/10 The characters are excellent, especially Narusegawa Naru. Characters like her are very difficult to pull off believably. It's too easy to want to make these girls too perfect (Belldandy in the Oh My Goddess OAVs) or too over-the-top (Ryouko AND Aeka in Tenchi Muyo). Naru is not so perfect that female viewers might feel alienated or intimidated by her - you know girls like her, you've probably gone to school with girls like her, you may even be related to her. She's sort of an EveryWoman. And so you end up rooting for her to hook up with Keitarou just as much as you root for Keitarou to hook up with her, because she in her own way is just as much of a loser as Keitarou. And if you don't see them as the Destined Couple of the Series, well, you just haven't seen enough anime.  ENJOYMENT 8/10 The Love Hina Christmas special is infinitely better than any of the Love Hina television episodes, and Bandai definitely does this release justice. Love Hina is a very intriguing series. It mixes drama, romance, and slapstick comedy in a pleasing combination. The music is incredibly cute, and also has some gorgeous slow pieces that create a very dramatic effect. If you like romantic shows, or just shoujo anime, then you should definitely see Love Hina Christmas Special. If ever you have the chance to watch Love Hina, do yourself a favor; sit down, relax in the hot springs of Hinata Sou, and experience the magic of Toudai.";Recommended

Still as same as Love Hina, but let me tell you, you won't be disappointed by watching this special.  Story: 7/10 The special concentrates more on the relationship between Naru and Keitaro. It is still as same as Love Hina's ""stupidity"", but slightly the story is better than the TV series although the special is given a short period of time.  Animation: 7/10 Same as the TV series, the animation is executed pretty good since it's 2000! Also the artwork is good, too, although it's not that special. But overall, the animation and the artwork are executed well.  Sound: 8/10 Nothing's special with the music and song, but also nothing's wrong with them, too. The seiyuu are doing a well-done job. They really define their characters.  Character: 9/10 The characters are fun to watch, to be honest. While the anime is about a loser guy who is loved by several girls, they execute the characters brilliantly. They are memorable for me, not boring, and unique for a romantic-comedy harem anime.  Enjoyment: 9/10 I didn't feel the 46 minutes while i was watching the special! I was really, really stunned by the special, since I didn't have high expectations from it. Trust me, if you enjoy Love Hina, you'll enjoy this special as well.  Overall:8/10 Overall, the special is a very good special episode. Rarely have special episodes done better than their TV series.

3;Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve;selvania;https://myanimelist.net/profile/selvania;9;The characters of Love Hina celebrate the season to the fullest in this special, which features elements from the main series as well as new ones brought in with the season. The story centers around, as the premise of the series itself, on a rumor that states that if you make a wish on this 'special christmas eve' at midnight it will come true. It zeros in on the romance between Keitaro and Naru, yet features each of the characters, a fact which cannot be forgotten. You see the truer sides of all the characters and see them interact more in one episode then is really seen in any normal episode of the series: between Matsume and Keitaro, Shinobu and Keitaro, the girls towards eachother, and even a glimpse at Kitsunes past love towards Seta. The story ends in what some may call tear jerking, others sickeningly cute, and Naru even (sort of) confesses to Keitaro. It is a special that I would definately reccomend, and is definitely in the Christmas Spirit!;Recommended
0;Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve;rewdalf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rewdalf;6;Let's get down with the review.  -This is probably the most well animated episode by Love Hina standard. You can see the excessive frames around the beginning of the episode. But then it stagnates a little bit around the middle but still good. -This time it's Keitaro who do the sulking when he taught Naru was cheating on him. He also don't get beat around too much. -Naru confessed her affection to Keitaro on national TV in the end but moments later she's back with her normal abusive attitude towards Keitaro. Okay.

1;Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve;alx222000;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alx222000;6;8 months and countless shows since watching Love Hina, I've gotten hold of the specials, and it's review time.  Story  It's Love Hina, and it's christmas time, so we have to have some holiday romance.  The story is nice, especially the end, though I found too much of it to be predictable. Relationships move a bit, but I didn't really gain any new perspective on any of the characters.  Animation/sound  Not really anything noticably different from the series.  Character  If you've watched the original, then there aren't going to be any surprises here. They're all given an appropriate part in the story, but as I said above, I didn't feel any new depth to the characters.  Enjoyment  Well, personally, I watched the original Love Hina for the comedy, and the romantic comedy, rather than straight romance. However, this extended episode contains little humour, only a few bits worth mentioning, and with the predictability of the story, I was left feeling just a little bored.  Overall  I guess what really matters is what you watched through the original series for. If it was the humour and silliness, then this extended episode won't give you a good fix, and you'll probably be somewhat bored. If it was for the romance, then you'll probably like this extra bit, though it might depend on how predictable you find it.  Short review, certainly, but it's only a short show.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve;MKSTEEL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MKSTEEL;6;A lot better than the series proper, this holiday movie manages to draw a lot more emotional depth than any of the series episodes tend to. With some real emotional investment, the way it becomes a big throwdown about gifts and affirming love at the end reminded me of the final two episodes of the 'Oh My Goddess!' OVAs which also involves a Yuletide confession of love and gift-giving that had a lot of emotional gravity.

0;Love Hina Again;Wolferion;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wolferion;8;So there's the sequel to the Love Hina + Love Hina specials. I'd like to justify this anime with better score than so far I saw other people to give it. Sure it's still with same people, who have same behaviour, but doesn't that feel like happily coming back to something you know?  Let's get to the details of anime now =)  Story 8/10 = Well, it's just 3 episodes after all so the story ain't long and that detailed, but it's well considered a sequel and hey, it finaly has what we were waiting for in the Love Hina! That specific thing really shined up my opinion about the ending in overall.  Art 8/10, Sound 8/10 = The art remains the same and it's a quite good one for sure. As about sound, it's pretty alright.  Character 8/10 = Well, there's finaly a bit of change in the two main protagonists ( Naru and Keitaro ) , Keitaro's pretty much more useful now and Naru finaly gets herself to do what's needed to do.  Enjoyment 8/10 = It's not one of the brilliant animes you've got to watch, but it's definitely worth watching after you finished Love Hina! . This anime still made me laugh a lot with all the tricks put in, like samurai with chi, a girl constructing killing toys ( where the hell she got the materials? :D ) and a new kind of dilemma between the two main protagonists. If you're the person that likes cheerful shining endings that make you smile and laugh ( well, there just happens something quite funny before the complete ending ) , don't hesitate and give this a try!

These OVAs especially the first episode is pretty heavy on the fan-service than the rest of the anime.

0;Love Hina Again;HybridMedia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HybridMedia;2;"Welp, I’m back in this god awful anime franchise.  I get that comedy is a subjective art form and there are many different ways to make people laugh, from the most high-brow comedy to the lowest of the low (and people tend to see/watch that the most; don’t believe it? Two and a Half Men lasted this long. There’s your proof) but it all depends on what you thought as funny because many people have different tastes and all that. I know that can tolerate Love Hina and all its….*ahem* glory and I question them why and wonder what people see in this show.  Keitaro needs some time to evaluate himself and his goals, so he goes onto a trip with Seta to attempt the life of an archaeologist. However, not all is safe at the Hinata Inn while he is gone. A woman claiming to be Keitaros sister comes and claims right to be the manager of the inn. Life gets complicated when Keitaro returns, and attempts to deal with his sister of yesteryear.  I’ve read some reviews saying that this is here the franchise has fallen from grace and how this might be one of the worst entries of the Love Hina franchise. But then again, if you really thought Love Hina was good or poignant or touching in the first place, then you really needed to re-think your thoughts on the show. Yeah, they’re right on this OVA being absolute shit because it is. Most of the time, they have these ridiculous plotline of Keitaro’s younger sister Kanako staying in the Hinata Inn in order to be closer…..*vomits a little*…..to her brother. Yep, it’s another one of those stories and of course, it drives a wedge between the “ever so progressing” relationship between Keitaro and Naru because it’s not like it wasn’t much boring or annoying than before. Oh wait…….    Yeah, there is a bunch of fan service thrown in there, but in the wrong and mostly turned-off way as possible but then again, it wasn’t the fan service that annoyed me (even though it was one of the factors), they just have a clumsy way of doing comedy along with transitioning to the serious and “touching” moments this show has. I’m sorry but if you expect me to feel some sympathy for those characters especially after a scene of bullshit fan service, the ever popular Naru beating up Keitaro for something that was a honest mistake, more torture shit and Kanako trying to bone her brother, then you’ve failed to be given a shit about.    Speaking of Kanako, oh God, she was one of the most annoying characters in the show, granted she is not as bad as Naru or any of the girls (nix for Shinobu and Haruka) but her constant efforts of making Keitaro fall in love with her is just super creepy to me and like I said, I could not give less of a shit about this character.   As for the animation and sound, they are about as equal to the series and the last OVA, The Christmas Special, and they isn’t really nothing new to add on the animation front. It was daring and new at the time it come around but it’s just mostly the standard as of……well, a few years ago. Music is just the same cutesy yet annoying tone but it gets worse during the Spring Special and worse of all, The English dub is just so horrible…….my god, this is a bad one. All the voices sound too high-pitched and girly even when it’s the voice actresses giving it their all and while I may like some of these actresses, I think their talents were abused during this OVA.";Not Recommended
1;Love Hina Again;valce;https://myanimelist.net/profile/valce;4;Love Hina Again disappointed me. After watching the beginning five minutes of the first episode, I did not feel this sequel lived up to the name of the series.  The first noticeable difference in the show is the character art, which resembles manga more than anime. A minute difference yes, but it did take some getting used to. The tempo speeds up too suddenly at times, causing scenes to jump or end without much believable transition. Coupled with a predictable storyline, I felt this gave Love Hina Again a very rushed feel.  Audio is probably the only redeeming factor of the show. Characters are appropriately voiced by their respective actors in sync, sound effects create depth and music set mood.;Not Recommended
2;Love Hina Again;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;1;This week I'm talking about the sequel OVA to Love Hina, Love Hina Again. But first,let's go over what happened previously in Love Hina. Blandon is a loser who consistently fails his university entrance exams. He fled his parents' house where they wanted him to get a job and make something of himself to be the building manager of his grandmother's girl dorms. Where he was abused by virtually every dull and insipid inhabitant of the building. Being a masochist with a poor idea of what a healthy relationship looks like, he fell for the girl who beat him most often, Narusegawa. After stammering around with the blindingly obvious, Blandon, Narusegawa and Otohime learned the partial truth about their past together at the Hina building but only after having it spelled out for them. And somewhere along the line a twenty five year old wanted to marry his thirteen year old sister but settled for his other sister who was basically his own age. So let's look at the sequel and see if the romance actually improves. It wouldn't be hard to do better than the first series, but I'm guessing it probably doesn't and that this is going to be painful.  Story:  We open with Blandon, Naru and Otohime on the Tokyo U campus, because they all managed to pass the entrance exam. And it only took Blandon and Otohime three tries. Blandon gets his leg broken by his main love interest. Her abusive ways are even worse when we see actual consequences beyond him flying into the distance and coming back without a scratch. Especially since they still treat it as not a big deal. With his leg broken, Blandon misses a bunch of classes. Which makes no sense. A broken leg may hurt and make it harder to get around, but this is set in Japan. They have reliable public transit. It's not like he can't reach his lectures and do his course work. It might make sense if they were treating the abuse situation even semi-realistically and he was afraid of being around Narusegawa, but that isn't the case. It's played up as him having to skip the classes because he couldn't possibly take the bus or something with a busted leg. Except that he could, easily, and he's just being a dumbass. While he recovers, he misses so much of his classes that he decides to postpone starting until next semester and he goes off with Seta to do archaeological digs. While he's gone, his younger sister, Kanako, shows up at the Hinata apartments and tries to drive the other girls away so that she can have him for herself. Yes, that means exactly what it sounds like. But it's okay because they aren't blood related. They've just been raised as siblings since they were really little kids. I'm sure that's not an insulting attitude towards people who were adopted at all. When Blandon returns his sister goes after him with gusto and Naru finds herself having to confront her true feelings so that she can continue to be sociopathic towards him.  So, this series features the same problem with incest that the first had, except that it's even worse in this one since the Blandon, Naru & Kanako love triangle is the major conflict which results in it being more prevalent of an element. The romance is still highly abusive and we're still supposed to support the most abusive girl. The first series' one redeeming factor was that roughly 30% of the comedy worked. In this series, they took that number down to zero. The narrative arc itself is really stupid and predictable, with the ending we all knew was going to happen when we'd gotten a few episodes into the first series.  Characters:  Our cast is just as banal and one-dimensional as they were in the initial series. The only new additions are Kanako and her flying cat. Shockingly, she's an archetype with no real personality. She's pretty much defined by her brother complex. Her cat is more of a prop than a character. It can talk, but never has anything useful or interesting to say. Its few lines are basically used to exposit about how much she's into her brother. Because they still assume that the audience needs everything spelled out for them. The characters are still obnoxiously thick and slow on the uptake. On the positive side, this series is much shorter so they can't have them flail about nearly as much as they did in the first series.  Art:  The artwork is improved a little bit with the characters looking more detailed and the backgrounds being a bit better. Of course, they still have a real problem with fan-service. They have a short montage scene of Kanako trying to seduce her brother by putting herself in compromising positions behind every door he opens. We also get an up-skirt shot of one of the junior high girls, because class is something for other people.  Sound:  The sound remains the strong suit of the series. We've got the same group of talented actors giving a more mediocre performance than you're probably used to, but still one that lets you hear that they are skilled. They're joined by Kuwatani Natsuko as Kanako and her performance is on par with the others. You can tell that she's good at what she does, in spite of her not having anything to work with. The music is pretty decent. Although it's certainly not as strong as it was in the first series.  Ho-yay:  Love Hina Again does throw in some “lesbians are hot” scenes. There's one involving Motoko, an alleyway and blatant molestation and another involving Kitsune on the couch and blatant molestation. Kaolla Su also cuddles up to Shinobu for one scene.  Final Thoughts:  Love Hina Again is actually worse than the first series. It features higher levels of incest, no funny jokes, more unlikeable characters, weaker music and slightly improved art. In every aspect that really matters, it fails miserably. My final rating is going to be a 1.5/10. Next week I'll look at Ginga Ojou-sama Densetsu Yuna: Kanashimi no Siren.;Not Recommended
0;Love Hina;TheLlama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheLlama;8;Love Hina is really great! From the first moment, I was gripped by this story's violence, drama and slight funniness, s well as the romance, which develops as the story goes on.  So, a young man called Urashima Keitaro suddenly finds himself working as the manager for an all-girls dormitory. Yes, you can probably see where that story is going. Lots of slapstick humor, romance and funniness is the recipe for this show. I think it's pretty cool, and if you like romance/harem anime, this is a definite must-see.;Recommended
1;Love Hina;realanimefan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/realanimefan;8;"Love Hina Review by realanimefan.   &quot;Love Hina&quot; basically, is a romantic comedy. For an idea on what I mean, watch a show such as &quot;Ranma 1/2&quot; or &quot;Tenchi Muyo.&quot; If you have seen these shows before, then you should feel very comfortable with the show. &quot;Love Hina&quot; though, takes this genre to a new level, introducing a wide variety of characters, strange situations, a good plot with a lot of twists that will keep you guessing \'til the end, and a countless amount of strange things that seem to happen for absolutely no reason.  &quot;Love Hina&quot; is, simply stating, hilarious. Every episode, you ask yourself, &quot;What will happen today in the Hinata House?&quot; Well, something new happens every episode. And poor Keitaro gets the crap beat out of him every episode by at least Naru. Though this eventually becomes repetitive, it never subtracts from the humor of the show.  Of course though, there is a healthy dose of romance mixed in with the craziness. If you are a sappy romance freak with no sense of humor, this may not be the show for you. If you are one that doesn\'t mind just a touch of romance, this show will be overly enjoyable. If you despise romance, still check this one out. You may still enjoy it.  The only downfall of this anime is it does eventually get a bit repetitive, and most episodes are basically only fillers that don\'t add to the main plot one bit. Besides this though, &quot;Love Hina&quot; is presented with a charm and humor that is hard to find in any anime these days. The main story is simple: a man is trying to get into Tokyo U to and meet his childhood sweetheart. It is never the main plot that counts though. The sub plots and character interaction are the heart of the anime. I must say that &quot;Love Hina&quot; executes this quite well. All the characters have their own distinct personalities and no two are at all similar. The romance part of the story will keep you guessing until the end. At several times, just when you put two and two together, a plot twist happens and you are back to the beginning. Too bad the series doesn\'t answer any questions. 1: There is not a lot of continually. Basically, each episode has its own story, with maybe a few things in a few episodes that actually add to the main story. This series is so fun though, this barely even matters (Hey, Cowboy Bebop does the same thing). 2: Don\'t expect everything to be wrapped with a pretty bow at the end. I\'m afraid you\'ll have to wait for &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; (my next review). Overall, the story is presented nicely, and filled with memorable characters you will not soon forget. Su Kaolla is my favorite!!! The heart of mostly anything (besides a good story) is good/fitting music. This is where &quot;Love Hina&quot; delivers its best. All the music of the show is great, and every song suits every scene perfectly. Never is a song out of place. Also, the music is great on its own too. The crazy intro theme, the slow ending theme, the action-packed guitar song from episode sixteen...&quot;Love Hina&quot; has it all. No matter what your music taste is, there will be at least one song that you will enjoy in this anime. As for voice acting, all the voices (in Japanese, of course) are great and diverse for each character. Never do two characters sound the same, and each voice suits its character perfectly. I could say different for the dub though. The dub voices are horribly selected and executed. I could not help from cringe every time either Su or Kitsune spoke. Absolutely horrible! Keitaro sounds like a wimp, Su sounds like a mouse, and for no reason, Kitsune has a strong (obviously forced) southern accent. I could only ask, &quot;why?&quot; The other voices I can tolerate, but they still pale in comparison to the original seiyuu. One word can describe how &quot;Love Hina&quot; looks: beautiful. Most likely, you have never seen a better-looking anime TV series. We\'re talking OVA quality here. Not much more I can say. The characters are drawn beautifully, and all have distinct features. Naturally, the females are drawn to look beautiful, most with large... Expect lots of fan service too, which should please you hentais out there. The characters are all animated smoothly, and this show also sports some cool effects seen in newer animes, such as motion blurs. Everything\'s great. Can\'t get better than this, I\'m afraid.";Recommended
2;Love Hina;RyuuTenshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RyuuTenshi;10;The story of this anime is a little disappointing if you compare to the manga, but if you haven't read the manga, then the story is pretty good. The contents in some of the episodes is a bit off the main storyline. It's like each episode have it's own story, and then ends up with the main story.  The art in this anime is excellent, you never get tired of watching it, the animation is well made too. The animation also shows the characters face expressions great, whether it's, fun, sorrow, sad, love etc.  The music fits the scenes good, it catching the emotions, and it's even catchy too. Also the voice actors plays their roles perfectly, their voices matches the characters and their behavior, and you can really tell how they are feeling.  Love Hina gives you a combination of comedy and romance. Mostly comedy. If you're looking for comedy, then you might enjoy this. Some of the episodes can seem quite confusing, if you only focus on the storyline, but I think this anime is mostly focused on the comedy and romance than the story. If you expect a good story you'll get disappointed. But if you're looking for some fun, then you will enjoy this very much.;Recommended
3;Love Hina;ProfessorGinkgo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProfessorGinkgo;10;What attracted me most to Love Hina was the main character, Keitaro, and his perseverance on achieving his goals. His determination to do his best no matter how many times he had failed getting into Tokyo U, he still tried so that he could fulfill the promise he had made to a girl years ago.  Sure, the story has its funny moments and the love interest aspect, but aside from that, Keitaro's character is one I personally admire. Perhaps this is because I face a lot of my own life's journey's the way he does, and especially refusing to give up on things no matter how many times I had failed before. Love Hina certainly brings out an amazing protagonist.  And he's immortal! Can't count how many times he's gotten the Naru-punch!;Recommended
4;Love Hina;Inushinde;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Inushinde;8;"To start things off on a blunt note, Love Hina is the quintessential harem anime. However, unlike works like Shuffle!, it plays with the associated tropes very well, and has enough charm and wit to endear them to the audience.  Love Hina's story won't win any awards for originality or pushing the envelope; it plays very safe and has a very saccharine backdrop; it's not like a character fulfilling a promise to his childhood sweetheart hasn't been done before. Where Love Hina succeeds is pulling it off with such heart, and only touching on it lightly right up until the last few episodes. Most of the time, the show focuses on the characters and their relationships within Hinata Apartments, and the zany antics they do to keep from getting bored.  The characters, as you'd expect from any harem series, form the spine and take the central role in the story. Each has something to contribute in their own psychopathic, borderline sadistic way to keep the show lively and fresh (Mostly in the form of abuse towards the lead, Keitaro). Keitaro himself is an increasingly likable lead character for all the torment he's put through at the hands of the tenants of Hinata Apartments. His devotion to the girl he made a promise to almost 20 years before the main plot and his determination to get into Tokyo U, even after repeated rejections, is almost enough to completely excuse his bland personality and appearance.  In the animation department, the show doesn't fare so well. It's workable throughout, and usually does a good enough job at keeping up with the often frenetic pace. However,the occasional slight hiccup or static background doesn't impress. And the characters, while distinctive, aren't the best looking. After all, I can't be the only one who thinks there's something wrong with Kitsune's hips. The art itself is good for the most part (Again, Kitsune's hips detract somewhat), but the occasional glitchy animation is too noticeable not to mention.  Where the animation stumbles, the sound props it up and carries it to the finish line. Everything, from the exceptional voice-work to the quick paced and cheery OST, is imbued with enough life to wake the dead within a ten mile radius.  Despite all this, Love Hina has its share of faults. The characters have a good possibility of annoying the viewer, some of the plot points feel needlessly contrived (Though the most humorous ones are generally acknowledged as such), the abuse of Keitaro can feel downright sinister at times, and it can overstay its welcome if marathoned. However, looking past these, it's easy to see why Love Hina is considered a borderline classic. It has enough quirks and outright bizarreness to entertain, supported by a charged pacing that gets the blood flowing.  Love Hina isn't perfect, but very little of it, aside from the robot turtles that crop up from time to time due to the machinations of Su, feels manufactured. It's of an authentic high quality, and well worth the time to watch.";Recommended
5;Love Hina;xxinfinitixx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xxinfinitixx;8;Realy great anime.. has a romantic story that started when naru and keitaro (the main couple) were little kids.

6;Love Hina;anime_n00b;https://myanimelist.net/profile/anime_n00b;9;"Since my review is probably last on the list or close to it.. Let me fill in the gaps.. because I actually took time to read all the others.. less than an hour after I watched the series lol.  The one thing none most of the reviewers have wrong is the Ecchi.. in NO way can I or anyone consider this a anime based on ""fanservice"" .. if you think a couple shots of them in the hot springs are perverted.. Then the high ranking Toradora on this site would be put in the same category. Trust me.. look at my list.. I know fan service.. and this definitely isnt a anime filled with it.  The other thing that noone really comments on is the music. The music in this.. is by far.. the BEST music in any anime Ive seen so far.. There are many songs that the characters sing.. that are very cute.. There are alot of songs that they sing together.. but at action scenes.. and during other various times.. the music really reminds me of a good american movie.. It is almost symphony like.. and it just gives me the feeling of a really good score from a movie..  Lastly let me comment on the character development.. What I really like about Love Hina.. is the fact that the younger characters arent so ""loli-like"" .. Which means.. The younger characters are more developed and more easy to relate to ... Su-chan is a fun loving girl thats always seeming to have fun.. Shinobu.. is very cute and reserved.. and even Sara.. has the more aggressive personality.. Thats why I liked the younger characters so much.. they reminded me of actual people.. their traits were more realistic.  Overall I loved the series.. I just wanted to touch up and maybe clarify a couple points.. since I will be way down on the list of reviews read.. but I hope I did my best to maybe sway you into giving this series a try!";Recommended
7;Love Hina;JBranch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JBranch;10;Please be kind this is my first review so bear with me they will get better. WARNING: This review may contain SPOILERS.  Story- This is a harem themed anime so let’s set the scene, 1 boy and 5 girls in all girls dormitory. Add some romance, comedy, and a little ecchi and you have Love Hina. This series as its highs and lows (trying to be objective) throughout. While managing the Inn and studying for his exams he ends up in every having a series of misadventures. The main focus of the story is Keitaro and Naru trying to get into Tokyo U, and the developing relationship between the two. As it turns out, wait, I’ll let you find that part out on your own. There are a few other romance sub-plots as well as some filler episodes mixed with in the main plot, but I really felt that they didn’t hurt the series in my opinion.  Low areas arrive in the form of “fanservice”. Ecchi content is way low in this series. There are bath scenes in almost every episode, yet for some reason they bathe in towels. Why you ask? They wanted to make an ecchi series without ecchi. Either put it in, or keep it out.  Viewer alert: “Love Hina” is not the end, and does not wrap up the series in a tight bow. The reason for this is a bonus 25th episode, as well as a Christmas and Spring special. You have to watch these before watching “Love Hina Again” to get the full story. Before that you need to watch the specials in the following order of airing date which is as follows:  Bonus 25th episode : Motoko's Choice, Love or the Sword - Don't Cry LH Christmas special LH Spring special   Any anime streaming site should have these. If you can’t find it pm me for one that does, or try your luck with Netflix. Quality is okay, but is better than not getting the full story.  Sound/Art: I condensed this category because this is my first review I don't really want to scrutinize every little detail in these areas for now. I will say that I thought that the dubbing for this series was great. The music for each scene went well the events occurring and the story flow very well.  Characters- This anime has delightful and colorful characters all around. They all have different stories and backgrounds as well as personalities. The series does take time to give the viewer sort of a background of each character and their past. This is done in the form of filler episodes or flashbacks. Also you notice slow changes in some characters as the story progresses.  Overall - I finished this anime recently I must I was completely amazed. I not really into romance anime and this was my first one. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this series and all the specials that came along with it. As a result I plan on reading the manga in the future. Overall I give this series a solid 10, it has its flaws but overall it was a good watch.;Recommended
8;Love Hina;WorldWide;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WorldWide;10;It starts out very heart felt. This dude has this promise to go to Tokyo University with a girl he played with as a child. He grows up into sort of a nerdy person, but he's a fairly pure hearted person at the same time. He becomes very lonely and continues to try to get into Tokyo U with all of his might. He's failed 2 or 3 times already (I'll edit it later). Then his grandma is going to go off for vacation and asks him to be manager of an All girl dormitory. Hot, right!? Well that's where it splits off from usual Shonen Jump stories, they all end up thinking he's a pervert. He comes in not knowing that it's an all girl dormitory and hops in the spring and UH-OH, here comes a chick. Blah blah blah, all else is a mystery. You watch it, I'm not summing up the whole series.;Recommended
9;Love Hina;Mliekseter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mliekseter;9;"I love Love Hina for a lot of reasons. For one, it was the first Anime I watched in Japanese. But that's irrelevant to you. So lets give some proper, review style, reasons. Naru, for me, defines Tsundere. Throughout the whole series, right to the end, refuses to give in to the inevitable, continues beating Keitaro to a pulp, keeps up at least some of her walls. Its both hilarious and somewhat touching. Keitaro himself is such a memorable character that he's almost worth a series in himself. Watching (or Reading), its fairly obvious that he doesn't really deserve half of the bad stuff happening to him, yet you still anticipate it each time. He is, at once, incredibly lucky and constantly chased by misfortune. He's clearly quite smart at points, but so often acts like a fool that its hard to believe he's anything but an idiot. Spending too long on Keitaro now...Moving on If Love Hina has a downside, its that most of the laughs revolve around someone (generally Keitaro) being subjected to vicious beatings. There are a couple ""Smart"" laughs, but most is violence or silly humour. That's not Bad per say, but by the end of the series you'll probably view the beatings as just part of the background. What's important about the series is the romance, the way everyone falls for Keitaro, but for him its never really anyone but Naru. A lot of Harem Mangas and Animes get too involved in the various different romance, so by the end its almost impossible for the Un/Luckly man to choose which woman he truly loves. Love Hina doesn't have that problem, and is all the better for it. If I must be honest, I prefer the Manga to the anime. But that's ONLY because the Manga ending was, frankly, a lot better than the ""Again"" Episodes they gave the Anime. But still, I only read the manga After the anime, and it'll always hold a place in my heart.";Recommended
10;Love Hina;KirbyDragons;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KirbyDragons;9;"A while ago, I began a quest to watch more anime, y'know, to get more of them under my belt. And it's anime like this one that make me glad I set out on this quest. I found lots of enjoyment, enough for it to become my second favorite anime at the time, after One Piece itself.  This is a good example of a romcom, I'd say. The story behind it all, with Keitaro's promise to his childhood friend, is decent enough to generate a good story. From this promise, we get two different plots: an alleged crush on this childhood friend, and a yearning to get into Tokyo U. From the 25 episodes to the two specials, we see these plots be carried through.  Keitaro becomes the manager of an all girl dorm, which is just asking for trouble and antics, which we see lots of. The reason the anime is fun to watch is because of all the crazy misadventures these characters get into. It's a perfect way to spice up a romance anime. And to speak of the girls themselves, there are six, counting Mutsumi, who doesn't actually live at the dorm. All six of them have their own personalities and interests. They each get their own episodes to give them development, which we see through their interactions with Keitaro, or them having zany adventures of their own.  I'd have to say, out of the six girls, only two are ""generic"": Naru and Shinobu. Naru is the typical target of the pervert, who gets violent when she thinks it's necessary. We see in many, many anime. Shinobu is the typical shy introvert, with a crush on the protagonist. Also something we see in many anime. However, the other four girls are rather unique:  Motoko Aoyama: My favorite of the six. A lot because I find myself attracted to longer hair, but I also like the way a swordsman, which is one of the last things you'd expect in a romance, tries to fit in with the rest of the girls. Kaolla Su: I thought I was gonna hate her, but I found her a decent and unique character. I can't think of any other strange foreigners who consistently pump out a variety of inventions. The inventing was of course, the thing I liked about her the most. Mutsumi Otohime: Along with Naru, she's a candidate for being Keitaro's childhood friend. She is a contrast to Naru in just about every way. While Naru is aggressive toward Keitaro's mistakes, Mutsumi just passively acknowledges them, and never holds them against him. If you don't like Naru, this character's out there as the alternative. Mitsune Konno: My least favorite of the six. I disliked her design, and didn't consider her as developed as the other five. She does have identity as being manipulative though, which already sets her apart. At times, she's behind the scenes of the interactions between Keitaro and Naru.  This cast just spells out diversity, and it's not limited just girls. There are other males, namely Kentaro, Seta, and Keitaro's friends. Overall, there's a good amount of characters in this anime.  There may be some filler, but when I watched this anime, I never even thought of it as filler. This is due to either the way they developed one of the characters, or how interesting the story was. Motoko gets transported into a video game dream through meditation. The characters have to take on the roles in a play based on ancient legends. Su's robotic Tama becomes huge and starts to rampage. Even still, the anime makes sure it keeps up the main story, which is finished in the spring special. I actually think the filler was justified. The story can get repetitive, which is due to how it all builds up in the first several episodes. The filler serves to calm things down.  Keitaro is a protagonist you can definitely sympathize for. He's constantly misunderstood by his main love interest, he keeps failing his entrance exam, and he isn't really good at anything. It makes you want to see how things turn out for him in the end.  I think we can all agree that Naru hits Keitaro too much. Like, at least once per episode. This seems to be one of the main criticisms. But unlike other anime girls who do the same thing, Naru has a soft side towards Keitaro. We see that deep down, Naru doesn't hate Keitaro at all. Another main criticism is that the characters are generic and/or annoying, but I flat out disagree with both of these. In fact, the characters are a large part of the reason this became my second favorite anime. The other reason is how downright entertaining it is to watch. It's a romcom at heart, but that doesn't stop it from dipping into other genres. It occasionally sticks in an unpredictable fight scene, or sends the characters out on a fun adventure. Love Hina does a lot to make itself memorable, which is what a good anime should do.";Recommended
11;Love Hina;Hakase-dono;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hakase-dono;7;Love Hina may be considered by some as a classic. Certainly, it shares many elements that current day animated series in the harem genre. The main character is Keitaro Urashima, a twice-failed entrant into Tokyo University. As he moves in with his grandmother, he finds himself the manager at an all-girls dormitory.  The premise of Love Hina is completely unrealistic, though, it's not meant to be. It is purposely designed to maximize comedic situations between a clueless high school boy and the world of girls he never knew. I suppose a more accurate description of the plot is a youth's journey to discover love in the face of infatuation.  The characters, while not caricatures, possess definitive traits. For instance, Shinobu is quiet, reserved and almost typical of an introvert, though she does act outside of her typical personality at times. The show eventually focuses around the relationship between Keitaro and Naru, who are relatively the most ordinary out of the entire cast. Despite the comical nature of the show, the elements of romance does become more apparent as the series progresses. This makes the show much more true to its definition as a romantic comedy than other shows in the harem genre.  Overall, I felt that Love Hina is a light-hearted show that can be enjoyed casually. It strikes a good balance between comedy and romance that few harem shows are able to reach. Regardless, due to the saturation of the genre, I believe that Love Hina is unable to make a lasting impression on today's audience.;Recommended
12;Love Hina;Malhavok;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Malhavok;8;"Love Hina is a show that relies heavily on an appreciation or familiarity with Japanese comedy and certain tropes in order to fully enjoy as the anime makes heavy use of cultural idioms that might not resonate with western viewers - the biggest of these is probably the comedic nature of the intentionally over the top physical violence.  That being said, if you do ""get it"" then Love Hina is a real treat of a show. It has some very appealing and compelling characters, great moments of comedy and a super-star voice cast who have all moved on to be huge successes in the industry (arguably the role of Naru Narusegawa was the breakout role for Yui Horie).  One thing to keep in mind as you're watching Love Hina and observing all of the tropes and cliches in the various scenes, is that in many ways this show actually defined them. While not the first ""big"" harem style show (that honor probably goes to Tenchi Muyo) it's inarguable that Love Hina set the mold for good or for bad for harem comedies for years to come and when watching it, you should almost be treating it like examining a treasured piece of anime history.  Also, the theme song, ""Sakure Saku"" is catchy as all hell - and it's even more amazing when you realize that it's Haruka's seiyu, Megumi Hayashibara performing it!";Recommended
13;Love Hina;Swenpai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Swenpai;10;love hina was great!!! it was one of the first anime i watched. love hina is funny,ecchi and full of girls! it was funny to see how clumsy keitaro is and his bad luck is really funny. but the turtles were weird. i liked how each person in love hina is absurd on his own way. i have to say this is one of the good animes (not that the others are bad!) i would say if you like comedy with romance and some weirdness this is your anime! and i watched love hina in 2011 but they released it in 2000 or something haha.  animefreakNL was here!;Recommended
14;Love Hina;fiedore;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fiedore;9;Following every negative opinion, I can tell - jokes are overused, graphics are cheap, and Keitaro gets beaten way too often. However I love Hinata story (more in the manga thou) for powerful emotional load that is hidden in there. Somehow their loving feelings where so strong, I was feeling it with them. That's funny for such a redundant comedy to act like this. It was seriously even more beautiful than Clannad and Kanon stories. This is my opinion.;Recommended
15;Love Hina;TNinja;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TNinja;10;All 10. Seriously. All 10.  The story is very nice, and have it's touching moments. At first, it might seem to be any ordinary daylife harem, but it actually got a story to follow. And it includes some overnatural situations. Like a flying turtle and temporary transformation. (Spoilz?)  The art, what can I say. It's nice. Very nice. There was nothing I hate abou it.  Sounds is pretty good. Must have been exhausting for the actors to scream all the time.  The characters are quite interesting. A boy with low luck and a sandbag for the girls. A violent girl, a shy girl, a hyper mech expert girl, a sword master girl and a drunkard. All the mix makes the this anime good in it's own way.  I really enjoyed through all the episodes. Gave me a thousand laughs, and some fan-services. Well, the service might have been overused.  Overall, I say it was one of the best anime I've seen. Well, it's the first, and some people tends to love their first experiences, so it might seem I overrated this. It's been long since I watched it, but during then, I watched so many times that i lost count. I couldn't let it go because it was so good.;Recommended
16;Love Hina;Khalit-theone;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Khalit-theone;8;What is this a Tokyo U ad?  All jokes aside Love Hina isn't meant to be some amazing love story, It's another cringy harem anime with a tsundere love. Despite all the obvious character flaws that are present, this anime does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Love Hina is a moment by moment anime where you don't really have to pay close attention to know exactly what's going on, there's no interesting plot or amazing character development because that's not what it's meant to show. It's supposed to be funny, episodes play out like a sitcom and almost never connect.  If you just want to sit back and watch some funny anime without thinking too hard then here you go.;Recommended
17;Love Hina;Objectivity_jk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Objectivity_jk;7;I come from the perspective of not needing to love all of the characters in Love Hina, and that is generally where most criticism comes from on this show. To be fair everyone would probably also agree that the plot is vapid and a thin plastic covering for the harem setup, but I usually hear the character criticism first. So basically my weak defence is that characters such as Naru Narusagawa are supposed to be awful, unreasonable, and mean. Some of the comedy for me is the fact that Keitarou likes in ether a romantic or friendly way the majority of the female cast. So in that sense the show sort of saves itself from being a standard harem anime, and deflects the criticism if you take my lopsided view.  I must be reaching for an excuse to find the show sort of funny and entertaining, but the mindset sort of helps coming into a show with such a low reputations with veteran otaku.;Recommended
18;Love Hina;Chopst1cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chopst1cks;9;Love Hina was a great anime up until all of the characters were introduced. After that, you start to see a recursion in the comedy scenes, and other stories. For example, nearly every episode ends up with Keitaro being blamed for something that he accidentally did, and the girls get pissy for about a few minutes then Naru sends Keitaro flying with a super-punch. Then with all the foreign travel scenes, Keitaro and (most of the time) Naru get lost in a place or are stuck together in a foreign land due to some godforsaken scenario, beat their way out of it with the late arrival of their friends, then they all celebrate and Keitaro does something stupid and Naru sends him flying with another spinning punch. The overall plot wasn't that great. The art and enjoyment factor was satisfactory however.;Recommended
19;Love Hina;Wolferion;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wolferion;8;"Don't get confused by the title and think this is rather dramatic anime with adequate romance. In the start, you have that main hero with rather creative imagination skills and drawing skills. Failing an exam to one of the Tokyo university already twice, his parents are against him trying more, so the solution is simple = He takes the advantage of a chance and becomes manager of all-girl dorm. Now this is what makes the whole anime quite light and funny. He gets across a lot of troubles, but there are a lot of comedic moments as well. It won't be precise to tell that this anime is purely for relax though. I'm definitely sure I'm not the only one who finds that abnormally often ""get hurt"" part and that the main hero is unrealisticaly clumsy everytime there's a good chance for romantic moment. I enjoyed greatly first episodes, but then those two facts were just becoming annoying and your point of view changes from ""Ouu that must hurt"" to ""Gosh, again"". Now to the characteristics  Story 8/10 = As mention above, the idea of a guy being a manager in all-girls dorm is quite the whole base of story. The main next action is him trying to get into the university and find the girl he made a promise with to get into that university.  Art 8/10 = The art there is good enough for a nice watch.  Sound 9/10 = I personaly liked a lot the OP, the music used in the anime is pretty fine too, thus the 9/10 rating.  Character 8/10 = Well you know, it somehow feels there that characters don't show much grow. You can see some feelings appearing , but then everything's crushed by the main hero's clumsiness. So it's kind of all a wonder if he got better or not. After all, this anime is ment for relax and having nice time ( except the two bad facts written above )  Conclusion = If you're looking for an anime with moments to make you laugh and enjoy the time, this definitely won't be a bad choice ( well, only maybe if the often ""get hurt"" and clumsy part would annoy you enough to stop watching the anime ). If you got the free time to watch, give this anime a try. After all, you never know until you try, do you? =)";Recommended
0;Love Hina;AsianKungFu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AsianKungFu;5;"Looking for a romance/comedy/harem anime to kill time? Look no more because Love Hina will SERIOUSLY KILL your time.  I've watched Love Hina before way back when I was still a kid and I remember loving this series, but after re-watching this series 10+ years later, I began to question my taste for anime because Love Hina is by far one of the most stupid and ridiculous anime I've ever watched and I can't believe it’s actually possible for me to hate an anime this much.  I'm writing this review at the risk of getting viciously mauled by an angry mob of Love Hina fans who will do anything to defend their beloved anime, so I'll try not to be too harsh on this. Okay, time to get started with this rant—I mean review.  *CHARACTERS: 5/10 The characters of Love Hina are soooo darn GENERIC and just downright ANNOYING that I need to punch the wall just to appease my frustration. Let me introduce them.  — Urashima, Keitarou - The main protagonist. He is really dumb and extremely unreliable but he is very persevering (Sounds familiar?) and he makes a good punching bag for Naru. — Narusegawa, Naru - The main heroine. She's a tsundere on drugs who's got nothing better to do besides beating up Keitarou EVERY…SINGLE...DARN...TIME!!!. — Aoyama, Motoko - The very typical ""Ice Queen"" of the harem. — Maehara, Shinobu - The kind and pure-hearted middle schooler *cough* loli bait. — Su, Kaolla - The awfully annoying and carefree kid in the harem. — Konno, Mitsune - The ""mature"" one. — Otohime, Mutsumi - The airhead.  I don't have a problem with harems, in fact, I love them (not including reverse harems) so I'm quite used to stereotypical girls, but the girls in Love Hina are just so darn annoying that it's impossible for me to like any of them. The one I have the biggest problem with though is not one of the girls, it's the stupid MC Keitarou! because he is just so fucking useless and unreliable! I JUST FUCKING HATE THIS GUY!!!. He doesn't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever except for his undying perseverance and hard work that leads to nothing most of the time.  *STORY: 4/10 The story revolves around Keitaro and the ""promise"" but mostly, the episodes are just stupid fillers designed to prolong this stupid anime. The fillers doesn't contribute to the plot one bit and can get really really random, for example, ancient turtle civilizations? seriously? come on, they can do better than that. I wish they focused more on the main plot because I was actually curious who's this mysterious ""promise"" girl.  Although I have lots of bad things to say about this anime, I can't deny the fact that I did get some laughs watching Love Hina, but the jokes becomes so repetitive (Naru beating up Keitarou) I'm laughing no more.  ~Love Hina's formula for comedy~  Keitarou + accidents + misunderstanding = Naru beating the crap out of him  *ART: 8/10 The art is fine, I don't really have much complaints about it because it's a very typical art for an old anime.  *SOUND: 7/10 I actually liked the OP and ED and I kinda felt nostalgic hearing them again. The OP is kinda catchy, although it annoyed some viewers, I'm not annoyed by it at all.  As for the Japanese voice acting, there's one voice that grabbed my attention, the voice of Motoko. Her voice is adorable especially when she is screaming. The voices of the other characters are also good and fits the characters quite well.  *OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: 5/10 I recommend this to you if... you like generic harem anime. you like old and repetitive jokes. you like an extremely violent tsundere heroine and a pathetic loser MC. you're masochistic.  But if you're not any of what I mentioned above, I suggest you cross this out on your list now, because I guarantee you'll hate this one.";Mixed Feelings
1;Love Hina;JackCox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JackCox;5;I know I\'ll probably get flamed for trashing this show, but really it\'s probably one of my most disliked animes. It was extremely boring and not to mention a huge letdown from what I truly thought would be a laugh out loud farce, instead it turned out to be a poorly written comedy. It\'s a shame because Ken Akamatsu\'s other series, Negima is actually much better and much more funny than this one. My personal problem is with the characters in this series who I pretty much hate for picking on Keitaro nonstop. But my most hated character had to be Sara McDougal who helped heap scorn and hurt on him the most.  I\'m hoping that funimation might redub this series and make it better but to be quite honest, this series is awful and I really didn\'t enjoy this. Probably the only anime show I haven\'t liked.;Mixed Feelings
2;Love Hina;Yemi_Hikari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yemi_Hikari;7;Story: 5  Let me pose a question to the reader of this review. Does a good storyline need obscene humor to make it good? No, what it needs is good plotlines. To say the least, I felt the overall concept of Love Hina, a guy getting stuck in charage of basically a bording house and not able to pass the entrance exams to be an awsume storyline.  However, I found the execution of the storyline to be overiddled with panty shots, panty humor, and to be a tad bit sexist. Actually... make that a lot sexist. Then again, I am a female who ended up watching this because of a bunch of boys at my school, and I know that while a few panty humor scenes are funny, to many are derogatory and can lose the charm.  If you want it for the panty shots and such, then this storyline is definatly for you, but truth be told, what could have been a really good storyline gets overloaded with this kind of stuff, which is a dissapointed. I think there is ten at least in each episode, if not more. Not to mention I hear the English version was edited.  Art: 8  What I have to give to Love Hina is it's art style. I will openly admit to being a tad jelous of those girls looks. There is not one ugly one amoung them, unless you count the guys relative. Thing too though... is it actually possibly to have all beautiful women in the same house. I mean, at least one of them should at least be average.  Sound: 8  I remember it being humerous and fitting for the anime. Other then that... I really can't recollect much as it really didn't stand out to me. I am more of an artsy person and I tend to be tone death.  Character: 7  I personally think there are to many characters to keep track of for one thing. Also, while the personalities on the characters are awsume, I would for one thing think that they would get an idea of the true personality of the guy after a certain amount of time, but no... they tend to jump to conclusions. They also seem to run heavily on sterotypes, which runs down the true charm behind them.  Enjoyment: 8  I have to say that Love Hina is addictive to watch, it is no wonder guys like it so much. But it really had no storyline whatso ever and it is very humor driven. And I didn't find everything funny... the raiting is more of for the momments I did find funny.  Overall: 7  I could say that Love Hina is overated, but for the kind of Anime it is supposed to be, I have to say it isn't. One shouldn't go into this anime looking for a good storyline. One needs to go in looking for a good, possibly perverted laugh. Yes... I have to wonder still about how perverted the guys I was with were, and how much they were not after watching this. I see them as the type with playboy bunny magazines and such.  That is who I think that this show is aimed for, NOT for girls like me, but guys that need a hormonal fetish fullfilled perhaps.;Mixed Feelings
3;Love Hina;NightlyDeath;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NightlyDeath;6;"This show is pretty decent if you never read the manga. This is basically a story built off the characters and locations from the manga; and has basically no connection at all. this story does have quite a bit of unnecessary episodes in it. that has no relation to the show at all. It's mostly about Keitaro getting beat up by Naru everyday while studying on getting into Tokyo U.  The overall story was an okay experience for me. They portrayed the characters almost exactly like they were in the manga, except the extra ones added into the anime version. Art was fairly well, as with everything else, but one thing that was a letdown was the story. In my opinion, I don't think that it was well planned out as the manga was, since there were a lot of things that didn't add any value to the show and somethings didn't make any sense at all.       I'll admit that parts of it was funny, but overall it was a disappointment for me, since I read the manga, and decided to watch the anime, hoping it would have some correlation to the original version.  A remake that follows the actual manga would be GREAT. Too much of the anime didn't follow the manga, or wern't even in it. and more than half of the story wasn't even from the manga. thay basically took all the characters and the places from the manga, and made an entirely new show from it. If you read the manga, i don't suggest you watch the anime, unless you just want to have a ragefest.";Mixed Feelings
4;Love Hina;Bluegojoe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bluegojoe;6;It's not as good as the manga I'll tell you that much, but it is a good anime to watch if you absolutely love Love Hina. Most of the story is similar, but there are some changes to the storyline. Though the plot remains constant and the characters still obtain similar characteristics with their manga counter parts. However, I was too pleased with the art, it did lack a sense to capture the true beauty the girls have in the manga. Well You can't expect their too be that much fan service. Overall though I really enjoyed the inclusion of the theme song Sakura Saku, it made watching the intro to this anime very amusing and you could probably listen to it over and over again. I can say this anime is a waste of time, but it might not exactly be worth it either. I suggest picking up the manga. :];Mixed Feelings
5;Love Hina;TwoSevenTwo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TwoSevenTwo;6;"Was Love Hina good? It spawned a generation of imitations. It's said to be a ""classic"" harem anime. How much mileage can you get over Naru punching Keitaro over some misunderstanding? Apparently 24 episodes worth! The main character is such a cool guy that every last girl in the story is chasing after him. I suppose it was good enough for me to read the entire series and then watch all the episodes, but it's not something I ever need to see again.  The setup follows the pattern of Maison Ikkoku. Take a young man, studying for college entrance exams, put him in a boarding house with some colorful characters and a woman with a short temper, sprinkle in a bunch of misunderstandings and watch love bloom. For bonus points, have them both go on vacation at the same time and meet up! Unfortunately, Love Hina lacks a lot of what made Maison Ikkoku work so well. Naru's violence is played for laughs, but Kyoko's outbursts and emotional immaturity are serious character flaws (and she knows enough to try and hide them). Keitaro is a nice guy who is loved by everyone and just needs to get into university, but Godai's outlook is a bit more bleak and he has a lot of real character growth to go through before he can win anybody's heart.  What does work for Love Hina is the cast. The individual characters are tiresome, but as an ensemble, they work very well. The show promises silly adventures with wacky people, and that's exactly what you get. Should you watch it? Maybe. It's a fun show, the humor just hasn't aged well.";Mixed Feelings
6;Love Hina;DaemonDesiree;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DaemonDesiree;5;Love Hina is a womderful story that is trapped in a poor adaptation. The story follows your typical harem plot. Keitaro, a ronin who is taking his exams again to try to get into Tokyo U inherits an inn from his grandmother, only to find out that it has been converted into a girls dormitory since his childhood all while trying to find the girl he made a promise to in childhood, whose face he cannot remember.  Of course, the typical archetypes are here, the tsundere, the warrior traditional girl, the genki girl, the shy one, the jaded old one, so on and so forth. But all of the really nice slow character development that really gave these girls life and made you care about them is stripped from this anime, leaving it lifeless. If you are a fan of Negima, you will know that it is nearly impossible to adapt Ken Akamatsu's work without ruining the charm that makes his works good. And Love Hina does not break this mold. If you are a fan of harem anime, or even if you are not, check this out in manga form. It is a masterpiece in dynamic character development. But as for the anime, give the soundtrack a listen to, cause the girls' image songs are cute and the late, great Ritsuko Okazaki voices one our ditzy girl and sings some songs. But other than that, pass for the manga.;Mixed Feelings
7;Love Hina;Flexicute;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Flexicute;5;I had a LOT of high expectations for Love Hina's anime adaptation once I was about four volumes into the manga. Unfortunately, as a BIG fan of the manga, the anime left much to be desired.  Story-wise, you get enthralled the moment you realize how much Keitaro has struggled to get into Tokyo University, especially to keep a 15 year old promise to the love of his life. However, there are many plot holes and re-written story arcs that drive this wonderful story through the wall. For instance, Motoko's dream sequence when she's sick and she gets a look into Keitaro's past - it's originally Keitaro dream in the manga, so having that plot centered on her doesn't make a lick of sense. Then there's the awful First Kiss episode centering around Shinobu. That moment was far too melodramatic to the point of being trite, while in the manga it was far more lighthearted and enjoyable as a result.  The characters are all unique, lovable, and quite memorable. However, their character interactions have been muted in the anime in favor of the constant Keitaro sight gags where he's being pummeled and blasted into the air. Yes, they are quite violent to Keitaro in the manga as well, but there are also far more moments of Keitaro being less of a gag and more of a serious, respectable character. And there are also hilarious moments where the other girls in Hinata House also have their own share of problems and even suffer some bad karma for their treatment of Keitaro.  I'd call this part a spoiler if it really was much of a spoiler, but the anime and all of the OVAs combined do not have the answer you're looking for in concern of Keitaro's promised girl. All of the animated series give you no conclusive answer to who the promise girl really is, which makes you wonder what this was all for. The manga, however, has a far more developed plot and, even with some filler towards the ending, is far more emotionally satisfying.  Love Hina is fun to watch if you just like some silly slapstick with some budding, awkward romance, but will leave you hungering for more. If you want a more satisfying bite from the franchise, as well as wondering who the true promise girl is, the manga is very highly recommended.;Mixed Feelings
8;Love Hina;the_neko_man;https://myanimelist.net/profile/the_neko_man;6;"To be honest, the only reason i watched this anime was because of the Role playing game of the same name . While the RPG didnt give away any of the plot, i found 3 characters very interesting. So i decided to check it out.  Remember how i said the rpg didnt give the story away much? Well thats because it basically doesnt have any. I'm assuming that you pretty much read the synopsis atleast before this. So you know that the MC wants to get into the Tokyo University . The whole story centres around him wanting to make it to Tokyo U because of a promise he makes to some girl he played with as a child( And ofcourse he doesnt remember here face or name even ...Why?? PLOT!! Thats why).  The author throughout the first season and other ovas goes out of his way to exploit this promise and the girl to whom it was made in every way possible. He uses the fact that all possible candidates for this role dont remember what happened when they were young.. but atleast he quickly makes it clear that only 2 girls have a realistic possibility of being her . But he goes a step further in the end by making Naaru say that she "" may not be the girl to whom Keitaro made the promise "" , leaving the plot open for Keitaro's sister to jump in during the last OVA  The characters were nothing special really. All the usual tropes were used - 1. the tsundere( Naru) , 2. the shy girl who loves the MC but is too shy to say it ( Shinobu) , 3. the annoying drunk girl with big boobs for fan service ( Kitsune) , 4. the totally unnecessary junior high girl who basically is the most annoying of the lot because she is a child and proceeds to annoy you throughout ( Kaolla Su) 5. the smokling silent one ( Haruka) 6. the rich , pervy rival to the MC ( Kentaro) 7. the irrelevant beautiful idiot girl who turns out to be relevant to the story (Mutsubi) 8. the younger sister who has an inappropriate crush for her onii-chan ( Kanako)  and ofcourse 9. the loser MC who somehow always stands up for the girls in moments of need and wins them back ( Keitaro).  But it did feature some characters good characters like Motoko (a swordwoman) , Seta ( an archeologist who just cant be killed by any amount of Road Traffic Accidents) and his Daughter Sarah.  As far as character development goes, its pretty much limited to Keitaro and Naru ..although they hardly get that much development at all  One of the more eye catching parts of the anime was its viokence . The MC blasts off more times than Team Rocket ever did. Its definitely not everyones cup of tea thats for sure.  Another thing was the presence of a flying turtle and a talking cat. Id really have loved it if they had explained the whole lot of mecha turtles multiplying from the scraps in the backyard of the Hinata resort  The author even made a cameo appearance on a couple of occasions , so that was kind of fun.  The only thing that was more annoying to me than Kaolla and Kitsune was Naru's inability to just confess how she truly feels for Keitaro. Neither does she say she loves him nor does she want other girls to get near him (*at which point she punches him out of the room) It really gets really frustrating for the watcher .  Overall id rate it at a 6 . Same as Girls Bravo.. just a fine one time watch .";Mixed Feelings
9;Love Hina;Fireblazer51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fireblazer51;6;"Now, to begin this review, I want to state that I do not dislike the story of Love Hina. Rather, I read the entire manga first before watching the anime, and I enjoyed the manga, thinking it was a creative and somewhat clever (of course, for its time) story. However, when they adapted the story into an anime, I was more than shocked to see that the anime decided to not even follow the story (or even try to) of the manga. It's as if the writers only took the cast and ""basic plot"" of the original story and decided to write their own thing. The original story, while faulty and repetitive at times, still manages to hook the reader somewhat and create a funny yet cute tale about Keitaro and his quest for love. The anime, however, chooses to stray as far as possible from the original story, trying to stray and create its own story, even introducing its own characters. While some may praise it for being original and creating some arcs that feel better than the manga, the story does not fit together, and the anime ends up being a mess. The manga, while jumpy and random, manages to stick itself together, as at least character development is shown and the plot doesn't stray too far. However, one cannot forgive the anime as the introduction of too many characters and the lack of developing either of the main characters (as opposed to developing side characters for no particular reason) completely ruins the story. However, if one looks at it from a non-reader standpoint, the story does look average at most, and the cast of characters, taken directly from the manga, is creative and original. The sound is good for its time, and the art is also pretty good, considering this anime was made in 2000. As a fan of the manga however, I cannot praise the anime at all due to how poorly it followed the plot. It frustrates me due to the fact that I actually really enjoyed the original story. Therefore I have no choice but to give it a 6, because while it completely disregarded any original story of Love Hina, it would have been at least average on a neutral standpoint. For readers of the manga, stay away. Others can choose to watch, but be cautious.";Mixed Feelings
10;Love Hina;tylervayo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tylervayo;6;"I don't understand why this show is so popular. Sure, I got some good laughs out of it, but that's about it. Probably the first anime I would call a ""waste of my time"". But hey. That doesn't mean that other people aren't allowed to like it. But I'm here to warn you that unless you are looking for a somewhat ecchi comedy that completely focuses on comedy, then you need to find another anime.  Plot: 5  Plot? What plot? You mean 25 episodes of fillers that are only connected by the fact that they share a group of characters, and then a 3 episode OVA arc that they label as a ""sequel""? Cause yeah, that's what Love Hina is. Fillers. Don't get me wrong, each episode had it's own quirk, allowing the series to keep that ""it's funny cause it's random"" kind of feel. From an army of Mecha-turtles to Arabian princes to a living doll to a summer festival, this show never ceased to surprise me. But that doesn't make up for the fact that the show had no real plot. So I had to give a 5 here.  Art: 7  I'm still no art connoisseur, so as far as I can tell, the graphics are on par with other series that came out in the same time period. So no complaints from me here.  Sound: 8  Even though I disliked the show overall, the opening theme remains in my top 5. It is unnaturally catchy and upbeat, and for the first time in a long time, I didn't skip the opening. NOT EVEN ONCE did I skip the opening. As for the ending song, it was catchy in a different way. In a somber, guitar riff kind of way. And I couldn't find anything wrong with the music throughout the anime. So kudos on the sound, if nothing else.  P.S. DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB! It's just indescribably bad.  Characters: 7  A diverse cast of characters, if I do say so myself. Living in Hinata Apartments, there's our main character, Keitaro, a loser among losers; our main heroine, Naru, a slightly hot-headed girl who didn't hesitate to beat the crap out of Keitaro at any and every possible opportunity; there's Su, an inventor who plays a big role in the ""randomness"" of the series; there's Kitsune, who's only trait throughout the show is her love of booze; there's Motoko, the strict swordswoman; and there's Shinobu, a character with absolutely no personality. Other characters include Kentaro, who I credit for being the character that prevented me from dropping this anime; then there's Seta, an archeologist who plays a pretty large role in the ""randomness"" of the series; there's Sarah, Seta's ""daughter"", and finally there's Mutsumi, who plays the role of secondary love interest, next to Naru.  Now this sounds like a pretty good set of characters, right? A lot of room for development to make for an interesting anime, right? WRONG! As I mentioned in my opening paragraph, this anime focused completely on comedy, so every character in the series is the same from start to finish, with small exceptions here and there(like Motoko doesn't hate Keitaro come the end of the show). As diverse of a cast as it was, I can't give a group of 2D characters anything higher than a 7.  Enjoyment: 5  For a show completely focused on comedy, the comedy wasn't terrific. I chuckled at least once every episode, but that's not enough to make me want to watch the next episode, especially when there's no plot to drive me forward. So a 5 on the enjoyment.  Overall: 6  Ehh, the show wasn't terrible. A catchy opening theme. A solid slew of characters, with some of the funnier supporting characters I've seen. And Love Hina Again wraps up the ""romance"" the show had rather nicely. If you're looking for some laughs and a barrage of interesting characters, give Love Hina a shot. Just don't expect a plot.

0;Love Hina;Splitter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Splitter;4;When Love Hina was released, it came with a high pedigree. First anime featuring no cel animation whatsoever, and the foundation of a successful and very popular manga by the soon-to-be-well-known Ken Akamatsu. Yes, everyone looked forward to Love Hina, and everyone most likely had all their hopes for it dashed along the rocks in an instant.  For as innovative as they may have wanted us to think the animation is, it's just bad. I know cel animation anime that flow far more smoothly than this. It jerks, the characters are often disproportioned, character movement is erratic and often impossible even by anime standards. Backgrounds are nice looking but that's about it.  The BGM had my ears bleeding. It's an example of why amateurs shouldn't be playing with artificial synthesizers. It's all over the place, never appropriate, and nothing you would ever want to hear stand-alone. The only decent thing the series manages is a very catchy OP sequence, but with repeated listening, even that will beging to grind on your eardrums.  Enough about the technical aspects, Love Hina is based off the manga by Ken Akamatsu. It's a fantastic romantic comedy and the series roots itself in the concepts that made the original very popular. In fact, many of the main story is well scripted and executed, but then manages to make everything likeable about the story horrible. The comedic timing is off, the dialogue is laughably awful, and of course there is no nudity. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not some horndog wanting to see the girls nude, but don't have twenty-thousand bath scenes and all the girls bathe wearing towels. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Either make an ecchi series or don't!  But that's not the worst part, oh no. What really makes this series near-unbearable is the godless amount of filler. 1/3 of the series doesn't even correspond with the story, introduces meaningless characters who serve absolutely no purpose, and only serves to annoy the viewer who slowly realizes what he or she has been cheated out of.  Speaking of characters, the core cast stays very true to the original idea whether you like them or hate them, but when the series devolves to filler it feels like the characters become stereotypical versions of themselves. Not only that, but the spotlight is put on meaningless filler characters who only add minor and inconsequential conflict for the allotted time of the episode they're in. Development is slow and often unrecognizable for the majority of the cast, sans Keitaro, Naru and arguably Shinobu. It's just very unsatisfying given the length of the series, and what is done with the characters.  You know, the first time I watched it, I wanted to like it but the more I watched, the more I realized I was watching crap. My 12-year-old cousin who watched the series with me lost all interest in anime after finishing this I kid you not. Let that be a warning to anyone who thinks that because this anime is popular, that it's also good.  Overall, Love Hina gets a 4 out of 10.;Not Recommended
1;Love Hina;BurntFlower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BurntFlower;3;"Absurd, ridiculous and just plain idiotic, Love Hina is mindless entertainment for those days when you want to turn your brain off.  Love Hina is about a run-of-the-mill wimp named Keitaro who develops a crush at a very young age to his nameless childhood sweetheart. Unfortunately, she has to move away. While running after the moving van, he promises her that he would get into Tokyo University – one of the most prestigious and hard-to-get-into universities of Japan – and find her at all costs. Years pass, and he fails the entrance exams of Tokyo University. His parents kick him out of the house, so he decides to move in with his grandma who manages a hotel. But unbeknownst to him, it has since turned into an all-female dorm. While the female residents are initially not happy with a man moving in with them, they come to accept him. He decides to retake the exams next year and find his lost love. The only problem is that he doesn't remember who she was, but he's determined to find out at all costs.  And that's it for the story! If you expect anything more, run far, far away from this and never look back.  While this was an entertaining anime at times, it was also unashamedly shallow and stupid. The extremely thin 'plot' would veer off frequently in favor of pointless side-stories. No, no one gives a damn about a hidden turtle civilization or a doll that comes back to life, just get back to the real story! These filler episodes take up a large portion of the show, and derail any advances to the main plot or character development. While one or two filler episodes are generally forgivable, if a series has more than half its episodes dedicated to these, then there's a huge problem. And even the story itself has numerous plot holes if any amount of logic is added to it. If the male lead had been anyone but the lowest common denominator, Love Hina would not exist at all. No breathing, straight male is desperate enough to get together with a girl they had met once over 15 years ago, when said girl at the time was barely old enough to go to the bathroom by herself. But lo and behold, we have Keitaro and it's thanks to him that this ridiculous story is able to stagger along at all. The main ahem, 'story' decided to make an appearance at the very end, but it was too little, and far too late.  The comedy in Love Hina is juvenile to an extreme degree. If you like dull, childish jokes that get dragged on and on, you'll be right at home here. Most of it depends on Keitaro accidentally touching someone's breasts, or looking at someone in a state of undress, while the rest of the female cast goes berserk and try to kill him. Rinse, wash, and repeat for 24 episodes. And if you're not tired of this brainless joke after the second time watching it (if that's the case, you have the patience of a saint), you'll soon become exhausted by the frustrating, supposedly 'funny' scenarios the characters get into. Oh, look, Keitaro got burned to a crisp by Su's bad cooking. Hilarious! Watch out, Keitaro, a flying mecha turtle is shooting lasers at you! Comedy gold! Worse, the comedy saps out any small redeeming qualities this show might have by making it mind-numbingly painful to watch.  Although fans of the show will cry out for my blood for saying this, I will say it nonetheless: Love Hina is a terrible love story. The 'romance' (and take the word with a grain of salt) was so forced and contrived I was seriously considering shoving a fork up my nose instead. That's how painful it was sitting through this travesty of a romantic story. The show tried to convince me that Keitaro was somehow in love with Naru, but given her deplorable treatment of him in every single episode, it was really hard for me to find this believable. In fact, it made me angry. Why would he love someone who made him a human punching bag without the slightest hesitation? For a large part of the series, Keitaro would run away and be scared of her, while she would stalk him in a rage. He was less of a convincing love interest, and more like a beaten housewife. No, the fact that the series treated Naru kicking and punching Keitaro as 'hilarious' did not convince me at all. And likewise for Naru's feelings for Keitaro. Her behavior for most of the series frequently crossed the line of funny boyfriend-girlfriend slapstick comedy to the disturbingly abusive. Why on earth would she love a spineless loser whom she thought was a lecherous pervert is really up to anyone's guess. In other words, the couple of Naru and Keitaro had all the charm and plausibility of a used condom. I would roll my eyes every time the anime stopped its wacky hijinks and try to pretend that it was a love story all along. It's really not. Love Hina is first and foremost a zany, out-of control, ecchi comedy and to assume otherwise is laughable.  And finally, we have the ending. The ending was one of the most disappointing aspects of this tripe. It just...ended. There was no half-baked conclusion, or anything resembling a somewhat satisfying ending. The series didn't bother to resolve the flimsy plot threads it still had going on. Nothing. It simply showed the characters smiling dazedly at the camera...and cue credits. Do not expect to find out who the mystery girl was or if Naru and Keitaro end up together or not. It was an insult to viewers who had to watch hours of this pointless drivel and have no payback for all their time wasted.  The characters are all cardboard cut-outs that have been borrowed from many other harem series before it and somehow made infinitely more annoying. Some were better than others, but that's like saying that being stabbed in the arm is better than being shot in the head. Keitaro is yet another useless twit that is so common in this genre, and despite the plethora of negative qualities he has, half the female cast is in love with him. He is nothing but a wish-fulfillment vessel for desperate male fans; he appeases their insecurity. Although he frequently got himself in awkward situations that were blamed on him through no fault of his own, he never stands up for himself or do anything to make him seem less of a pathetic failure that he is. Although the series tries to portray him as a nice guy that looks out for the well-being of others, it is not enough to redeem him as a whole. These are rare instances in the anime, and do not outweigh the great majority of the time where he is the butt-monkey of the rest of the cast. And while Keitaro is a pitiable human being, his love interest – Naru - is way worse. I will put this bluntly: she is a wholly unlikeable, violent bitch. Undoubtedly, the anime also tries to portray her as an incredibly intelligent young woman that aces every exam, but for all we see of her, she's just as utterly moronic as her friends. She never tries to hear Keitaro out, and opts for physically assaulting him at every instance. She is haughty, aggressive, selfish, immature and a horrible female lead. The secondary characters do not fare any better. They're all unremarkable archetypes that do not even feign to break out of their molds. Shinobu is the painfully shy girl, Mokoto is basically Naru with a sword, Su is the young genius with a perchance for childish mischief, Kitsune is the horny alcoholic, Mutsumi is the well-meaning ditz, Tama-chan is the cute mascot...none of them have any hidden depths beyond this. And if they do, the anime does a damn good job at hiding it. What's worse, they frequently regress backwards by acting like irritating toddlers throwing a tantrum. Character development goes out the window in favor of pointless side-quests that have no bearing on the plot. These characters do not grow, but remain their same brain-dead selves throughout the entire series' run. This is your 'winning' cast of characters.  Animation is decent for its time, and has not aged badly. However, there are times when movement would become very choppy, such as when Naru would punch Keitaro through a wall. Character designs are nothing special, but each one has certain physical traits (like Mutsumi's hair 'antennas') that made them stand out from the others, but they would become disproportionate at times. Backgrounds are standard fare, and not much effort was put into giving them a lot of detail, but they're all decently colored. The anime itself offers no real eye-candy, but it gets the job done.  The OP fit the series perfectly. It is an over-the-top, hyper song that wholeheartedly reflected the series' overall insanity and the bizarre situations the equally crazy characters would get themselves into...but it gets obnoxious fast. The ED was its polar opposite – it was a slow, almost jazzy tune. It seemed out of place in this sort of anime, and I had all but forgotten it until I listened to it again. The rest of the music here is composed of artificial synthesizers, similar to the opening song, that made me want to pour acid into my ears. The Japanese voice actors did a good job bringing their characters to life; they noticeably put a lot of effort in capturing what each of their characters would sound like if they became flesh-and-blood people. Unfortunately, their voices grated on me frequently and were very annoying.  I do not understand the hype of Love Hina. It completely fails as a love story, the comedy is extremely repetitive and sophomoric, the ecchi scenes are yawn-inducing, and the cast of characters seem have a combined IQ of 60. While it has some hidden appeal underneath all those breast shots, it's ruined by the staggering amount of filler and general stupidity of the series as a whole. I do not recommend Love Hina at all, unless you're a hardcore fan of harem shows and have a couple of hours to waste. And even so, just know that you could do much better. Your brain will thank you.";Not Recommended
2;Love Hina;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;2;It's been almost a year since I was asked to look at a harem series. This one was written by Akamatsu Ken. In the year 2000 it was adapted into an anime by Xebec. You may remember them from Bakuretsu Hunters, Bottle Fairy, Mnemosyne & Zombie Loan. So, about half their stuff I've reviewed has been good. I don't really anticipate this one joining them but let's take a look and see what happens. Maybe it will surprise me.  Story:  Our tale opens with Keitaro, who I will refer to as Blandon for the rest of this review, our protagonist. He dreams of entering the prestigious Tokyo U, in spite of having failed the entrance exam twice. Why is he so set on this particular school? Because he and the only girl who ever liked him way back when they were really little promised to get into Tokyo U together and series like this have no attachment to reality so promises made when you were five or six are something you remember and still care about fifteen years later. Blandon's parents are tired of him leeching off of them and they want him to find a job. Despondent over being expected to do something productive with his life, and having been invited, Blandon goes to visit his grandmother at the girls' dorm she runs. He quickly finds out that she's scarpered and he was called over to take over as the building manager. Shenanigans ensue as he finds himself surrounding by attractive young ladies who regularly beat him.  The biggest problem is with the romance elements. To put it bluntly, they are horrendous. First off, most of Blandon's potential love interests are actively abusive towards him. Including Narusegawa, the one we're supposed to be pulling for. Yeah, I don't care how much Blandon lacks personality or what a loser in general he is. No one deserves to have an abusive partner. The only two exceptions are a junior high school girl named Shinobu and a ditsy girl named Otohime. The other four girls, plus some side characters, all act like sadists. Is Akamatsu just a masochist? Is the idea of being surrounded by girls who hit him just the ultimate fantasy for him? Even if that is the case you'd think there would be a safe word or something. This series also has an obsession with incest. We've got a nine year old girl who's obsessed with hooking up with her father. But it's okay because he's just a relative who adopted her and not really her father. We've also got a subplot of Kaolla Su's brother trying to marry her. But it's okay because he's really her cousin who was raised with her as a brother. We're also expected to ignore the fact that he's in his mid twenties and she's thirteen. If Akamatsu really thinks this is romantic as opposed to incredibly skeevy, he really needs a psychiatrist.  The main narrative itself is also really predictable, but it's going for humour rather than serious story telling so that's fine. As long as the jokes work. The comedy is mixed, though. There are a lot of stupid jokes about Blandon being beaten because a man being abused by a woman is hilarious. There are also stupid jokes about him doing something perverted or something that just looks perverted out of context, which usually lead to him getting brutalised, of course. There are also some zany comedic bits and those can be funny at times. Overall though you're probably looking at jokes that work maybe 30% of the time and that's probably a generous estimate.  Characters:  There's really not much to these characters. Blandon is your typical harem protagonist who looks plain, excels at nothing and has no personality because he's there for the audience to project themselves onto. Which is something that this and Twilight have in common with the difference being the sex of the character like that. Personally, I've always found that to be rather insulting for a character who's supposed to stand in for the audience. I know that they do it so that anyone can put themselves in this guy's shoes, but it's still expecting us to project ourselves onto a massive loser with no redeeming traits aside from being generically good-hearted. The girls aren't much better in terms of complexity. They're pretty much a group of archetypes with no real personalities because, I guess, girls with complexity aren't sexy? I mean, they might have their own thoughts and opinions on things and that would just be terrible. It's much better if they're really bland and super predictable. There's also an issue in this series with the characters being extremely thick to the point of obnoxiousness. They can't figure anything out unless it's explicitly spelled out for them. Especially towards the end where the series assumes its entire audience is made up of morons and keeps repeating the same information so that they can hammer it into our skulls for the climax. Seeing these twits struggle to figure out the blindingly obvious really makes me miss Hyouka and the protagonist's basic problem solving skills.  Art:  The artwork can be strongly summed up as “meh.” The backgrounds are pretty plain but they work well enough. The action sequences are passable but really repetitive. The character designs are fine. The biggest problem is the fan-service, sometimes involving the junior high girls because class is something for other people. All things considered, however, it's neither good nor bad.  Sound:  The sound is by far the best part of the series. We've got Hayashibara Megumi pulling double duty as Blandon's aunt and Shinobu's school friend. We've got a lot of other talented actors as well including Horie Yui, Asakawa Yuu, Kurata Masayo, Noda Junko, Yukino Satsuki & Ueda Yuji as Blandon. These are some highly skilled and prolific actors. This may not be any of their best roles but you can certainly tell that they're a skilled group. The music is really good and I'm not just saying that because most of the lyrical stuff was sung by Hayashibara Megumi. That's only 90% why I'm saying it. The music is well done though and has a good amount of energy and excitement to it.  Ho-yay:  There's a bit. There are three scenes of girls sharing kisses, although it's more played up as being hot because girls are kissing each other rather than being used to illustrate anything about the characters and their sexual preferences. Motoko has a trio of fan-girls who follow her around. There's also a scene where you see two old guys holding hands.  Final Thoughts:  Love Hina is a stupid, poorly written series. The romance is awful, the comedy has some moments but is largely weak, the characters range from being generic to being really annoying. The only thing that's really well done is the music and you can easily find it without having to trudge through all the idiocy. My final rating is a 2/10. Next week, I'll look at Love Hina Again. No, that doesn't mean I'm going to be re-posting this review. That's the actual name of the sequel OVA. Because someone thought it would be fun to have me review both this and its sequel. I hope he's feeling hyper x giddy over that decision right now because I'd like one of us to find joy in this situation and I'm certainly not excitedly anticipating the sequel to this thing.;Not Recommended
3;Love Hina;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;3;"Overview:  Love Hina is one of the most famous entries of the infamous Harem Genre, that flourished in the 1990s and still somehow survives to this day. Did this series do anything to deserve its level of fame? We aren't expecting high brow sophistication here, but is it at least funny? The short answer to these 2 questions is ""no"". The original manga actually was surprisingly funny, well drawn, and had a cheesy sort of charm to it. This anime is an example of a horrendous adaptation that brutally murders everything that made the manga passable.  Story: 4/10  The main story is about a hapless loser that wishes to gain acceptance into Tokyo University, which is one of the most prestigious and difficult to get into colleges in the world. While studying for his college entry exams, Keitaro Urashima must act as the land lord for the world's most insane girl's dormitory. Shenanigans ensue. The anime story adds lots of pointless filler that isn't in the original manga and flows with the smoothness of a nail on a black board. Rather than ending with any kind of satisfaction, Love Hina simply stops. There is no filler ending, it doesn't end with an artistic ""open ending"" where the viewer is left to interpret, it just fucking stops. There is of course a love triangle between Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi, but it really isn't captured in the anime as well as it is in the manga. The jokes in this anime simply don't work and there is something about the manga's slapstick humor that just doesn't translate on to the screen.  Characters: 5/10  I actually liked the cast of characters in the manga. This is a comedy, so predictably we see a number of cliches and stock characters. This isn't really a detriment by itself considering that this tradition dates back to the commedia dell'arte of the 1400s. Hell, even Shakespeare himself reused the same comedy characters again and again. What makes this a problem is that the characters here are watered down from the manga and don't have the same zaniness. Kaolla Su's scientific genius and struggle with social norms is never appropriately captured in the anime. Motoko goes from an OCD plagued Samurai that literally tries to kill Keitaro and commit suicide upon hearing bad test results to another Naru with a sword. Naru goes from being a tsundere with a heart of gold, to just being a violent bitch for no reason. Mutsumi's genius savant nature is never captured well in the anime either and we are left with just the tired clumsiness gags. The characters in the anime come across as bland and boring. The one thing a comedy simply should never be is boring!  Sound 1/10  The soundtrack will make you want to emulate Kakihara from Ichi the Killer and shove needles into your ears.  Art: 3/10  The manga's art is actually pretty good. The anime's art sucks. The animation is choppy, the characters look like crap, the backgrounds don't fit in well with the rest of the art. Poor Mr. Akamatsu must have vomited when he first lay eyes on this artistic abortion.  Enjoyment: 2/10  Love Hina is not just bad, it's physically painful to watch for anyone that enjoyed the manga. It isn't funny, the drama isn't moving, it isn't though provoking, it isn't erotic. It fails in everything.  Overall: 3/10  I decided to go easy on it and give it a 3/10. Maybe if you didn't read the manga you might find the characters amusing or some of the slapstick funny. If you enjoyed the original manga, avoid this series like the plague. The Love Hina manga won the 2001 Kodansha award for best Shonen series. This is one of the highest honors a manga can receive. Attack on Titan also won the same award and it remains the highest critical award ever bestowed on Attack on Titan despite fanboy worship. The Love Hina anime...did not win awards making it the equal of Attack on Titan. It didn't win anything...ever!!! Fuck this anime!";Not Recommended
4;Love Hina;Yuvie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yuvie;3;Maybe I'm being a little harsh. Well, the series probably wasn't aimed at my kind of audience. My partner bought the series so I thought I might as well be an anime purist and give it a go. I had the same experience with Fruits basket but I actually enjoyed that a lot. This series started well, I thought. Then it became kind of tedious during the middle, what with Keitaro accidently walking into bath area with bunch of girls, then getting hit every episode for being 'perverted'. Then, every other scene, Keitaro gets punched into the sky by Naru and these two are meant to be in love. I don't know, maybe there's a deeper meaning in there that I'm not getting because I'm about as dumb as Keitaro at this stage. I've gotta say by the end of the series, I absolutely detested Naru. I've seen plenty of anime but that's the first time a character really pissed me off. The mid-to-end episodes started well but then the last bunch of episodes were a letdown. You both love eachother, you dumb emotionally retarded schmucks, you could have ended this happily ever after 15 f'n episodes ago. Those two bastards deserved eachother in the end but I gotta say I was rootin for the 'other' girl. However, on a slightly positive note, I'm sure the girls will love it!;Not Recommended
5;Love Hina;HybridMedia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HybridMedia;1;"Like any other anime among casual fans and otakus everywhere, this happens to have a massive fan base as it was based on the manga series by Ken Akamatsu. However, I know little of the harem genre of anime, aside from the fact it’s usually a guy living and/or being with a variety of girls or the opposite being the reverse harem, where it’s a bunch of guys surrounding a young lady with examples of shows like Fruits Basket, Ouran High School Host Club, Ranma ½ & Tenchi Muyo.  Keitaro Urashima is determined to be accepted into Tokyo University, the hardest Japanese University of all to get into, because of a promise he made to a girl when he was young... a girl whose name he can't even remember. After failing to get into Tokyo U twice, he is kicked out by his parents and goes to live with his Grandmother at her hotel, but it seems it has been turned into an all-girls boarding house. What's more, much to his surprise and to the tenants disgust, Keitaro is made manager of the boarding house.   So watching all the initial 25 episodes, I am the guy that usually isn’t quick to judge on an anime even before watching it but after a few episodes, my reaction to this show is pure disgust and hatred. Yeah, that’s right, I really hate this show and I mean genuinely hate it from the bottom of my heart.    Let’s start with the storyline and the romance. The show isn’t exactly episodic to an ump, mostly Keitaro trying to get into Tokyo U. just to find his true love he promised to meet but he isn’t exactly the sharpest mind and the same goes to Naru Narusegawa, a girl who looks similar to his crush and also trying to get into Tokyo U. Most of the time, it evolves around as the somewhat couple-to-be and there herein lies the problem. They are a terrible couple, much like a beaten housewife and an abusive husband, only Keitaro the former. I mean, really, Naru has got to be one of the worst female characters in all of anime and for that; I officially take back what I said about Asuka from Neon Genesis Evangelion. All the time when Keitaro always gets in these awkward positions, especially ones designed to be perverted, he gets the shit beaten out of him…ALL THE TIME and I mean every damn time!!! Hell, every time I think of that, the Kendrick Lamar song, “Swimming Pools (Drank)” comes to mind, only replace the word “drank” with “hit, punch, or ouch”. Hell, if you make a drinking game out of it, you’ll die for sure. Keitaro as a pervert is nowhere near the level of most characters like Desert Punk but he is quite the moron in this show as I don’t know why he has the patience of not only her but the rest of the girls living there and it’s obvious that both have a crush on each other but Naru has the nerve to tell him to be a man and say something about it, while she is definitely worse in the department when she can’t even tell the dork that she loves him, too. She kept talking about how problematic and pervy he is but she’s violent, temperamental, petty, immature and juvenile, just like this show. They are mismatched as a couple as Kim Kardashian and…….anybody stupid enough to marry her (for a couple of days).  I would speak about the other characters but what’s the point about that? Most of the plot involves around the two main characters and I can’t stand either of them (and yes, that includes Keitaro, he’s just a dense moron who often has the IQ of a weed-infused porcupine) and the other characters involve themselves into that cycle and really, that’s the whole other problem. Kitsune, the white-haired resident, is mostly the one who’s doing the meddling in their problems and does manipulate people just for a sick kick. Motoko practices the art of kendo and sometimes uses it to beat and threaten Keitaro, and just about everything, even for something out of his control, it’s “I’ma kill you, Keitaro!!!”. Shinobu is basically the poster child for “I hope Senpai notices me” meme as one of the only character that actually doesn’t rag on him, however, it is obvious that she has a crush on him. Hell, you got to have a neon sign if you’re that dense of the situation. Su basically have Ed (from Cowboy Bebop)-like similarities but the only exception to that is Ed is likable while Su just causes more trouble for everybody and as for Sara McDougal……..the less I say about her, the better as she annoys me whenever she’s on screen. Mutsumi is the ditzy girl who has a crush on Keitaro but Naru kept cock-blocking Keitaro, but we all know she’s jealous of them being together, no matter what she say. Haruka, on the other hand, is actually the only person who actually has a pleasant presence on screen as she’s the only person who’s actually enjoyable to watch but that’s not enough to favor this. As for the two best friends…….FUCK THOSE GUYS…….HARD!!!!    That’s part of the problem of this show. It thinks it’s being funny and humorous considering there is nothing funny about some defenseless dweeb getting beat up over and over again by violent women whose first response is beat the living shit out of them without any explanation. It would’ve been fine if it was some guy who deserves it a lot but apparently, FUCK THAT SHIT!, it’s all about turning the harem genre upside-down, much like Elfen Lied, but like that, it gets too damn tiring and the hype turns into disappointment but here, it goes into hatred.  Now for the animation, it is done by Xebec, a division of the acclaimed animation studio Production I.G. and they mostly do adaptations based off manga while I.G. does original content. However, I watched Kanokon this year and I have more to that about that coming up. It’s actually…..nothing special and I suspect most of it being gag-based especially with the punching Keitaro silly scenes. The character and production designs are passable but still bland compared to better shows. The opening theme is most likely the one to skip because I couldn’t stand it the first time I heard it. The ending theme is not as bad but still I wouldn’t stick around to listen to it. The BGM is alright to a full extent but is very amateurish at best with its clustered style. The dub (yes, I watched the dub with subtitles to know the direct translation) is grating in some areas but not as bad. Wendee Lee, who voices Su, directs the adaptation for this for a dubbing company that’s not Bang Zoom!, but while she’s a fantastic voice actress, she’s no Mary Elizabeth McGlynn when it comes to directing.     FINAL VERDICT: It’s no contest that I really hate this show and all it does is cater to the lowest common denominator of anime fans and what sickens me about it is that people find this to be funny. I cringed every time I watch an episode of this show. I despise the despicable characters and I know there is no deeper meaning of this but really, this is the best? I fear for those people and if I had one wish, it’s to never watch this again.";Not Recommended
6;Love Hina;toopthaste;https://myanimelist.net/profile/toopthaste;4;"I'm going to start off my reviewing career with the anime that got me into the whole thing. Love Hina! More like Love Shit! When I first finished the series I thought the same thing every other person without good taste said, ""why'd it end? This is so good!"". Well now I can say I wish it didn't end. In fact I wish it never even started. Read on to find out why.  STORY: 10  The story for Love Hina is surprisingly unique. A dense dorky guy makes a promise with a childhood friend and embarks on a humongous highway of harem hijinks when he grows up. I have never heard of such a plot before, so I have to give the story a 10 for its originality. The main character, Keitaro Urashima is trying to enter the University of Tokyo (Japan's Harvard or something like that) because he made a PROMISE to a CHILDHOOD FRIEND (GOSH F'N DANG IT) to enter the school together. A love triangle develops as ditzy girl Otohime Mutsumi enters his life, and she may or may not be the CHILDHOOD FRIEND that he made PROMISES to.  CHARACTERS: 10  The characters in Love Hina are extremely enjoyable. My favorite character would have to be Urashima Keitaro. He's always getting beaten up by Naru for being a pervert XD. My second favorite character is Naru Narusegawa. She's always beating up Keitaro XD. I think she might end up with Keitaro at the end, but I'm not sure since the anime was inconclusive. There's a chance that she won't end up with him. She got a fu*k ton of screen time and is featured center on every cover of the manga volumes but I think there's a chance Keitaro will end up with any of the members of his harem. There's so much drama, this anime is very unpredictable!  Other characters include Matoko the silly samurai girl, Su the primate, Kitsune the silly airheaded girl, and Mutsumi the other airheaded girl. Theres also Shinobu, the quiet submissive girl who is forced to cook lavish meals for her overlords every day. Apparently the anime scripters thought they were being mega creative when they decided to give an actual reason for her to like the protagonist rather than the crush route in the manga. It ended up making a lot more sense. After all, what parent wouldn't let their daughter stay in a hotel with a man who looks like a predator for an extended period of time?  There is also Kentaro, the man who spits into Keitaro's beef bowls and tries to pee on Naru's face.  SOUND: 10  The soundtrack is extremely memorable. Every song is great.  ART: 10  The artwork is excellent. Every scene was extremely coordinated without awkward juttery movements. The character designs were excellently adapted from the manga. I thought it was absolute genius that they were able to redraw the characters as they would look after a few weeks of gorging on trans fats and exercising a few second a day.  ENJOYABLITY: -20  Holy sh*t. This is a great entry level anime. However, If you've seen more than 10 series (even if they're generic harem rom-coms) this show will sicken you. This is the bottom of the barrel, you either start here or never look back. The Author and producers were EXTREMELY lucky that they picked an excellent time to eject this crap from there metaphorical anus. If they had released it now... well they wouldn't because no sane person in this day and age would allow this abomination to cross the pacific. In a time in America where shounen battle series was the face of anime, Love Hina thrived. In this present day in which we are aware of other sh*tty series that are still better, Love Hina is nothing but a source of cringe and regret.";Not Recommended
7;Love Hina;Notshane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Notshane;3;"Ah, man, I have not written a review this negative in a very long time. This will be a painful write, especially since I know this anime is apparently mildly popular and I imagine it relates to it being the creator of the harem genre in its rawest form. You know, where the innocent guy is continuously assaulted by women. For real, if somebody can show me just one anime where it's one with with a bunch of guys and the girl, for once, knows how it feels to be beaten up all the time, send me a message.  This review is brutally honest, but it deserves to be. Some of the girls, especially one, got on my nerves so much that I questioned my morality at one point. Any fans of the anime, well, you could agree with me on most of these points I say anime, here. I have not read the manga, and I know it is considered vastly superior. I will not let this anime cloud the idea of me ever reading the manga, do not worry. I just have a heavy disliking towards this anime in particular, but I'm sure the manga is better. It has more characters, too, so I would love to read it someday.  But, anyway, the core story is nothing too special at all. Rather, this review will specifically center on each character in the show, since it is based on a dating sim manga or something from what I hear, so characters should be the primary focus in this review. In fact, the story is so bizarre that I would need to write a whole separate thing to cover it, which would take too long. However, this will still be pretty long as is.  So, the characters matter more than the actual ""plot"" that the show has to me, enough to write about them instead. So, with that being out of the way, we will go from least likable to most likable; only including in a few of the minor characters, but mostly focusing on the protagonists. However, I will go off a little bit about the core so you understand some of the incentives here.  Keitaro, the main male lead, made a promise to a little girl that he would go to Tokyo University with her when he grew up. However, he failed his entrance exams three years in a row and is still looking for this little girl. He unexpectedly becomes the manager of a dorm that is only for girls. Of which, a few of them are pessimistic about.  (WARNING: The following character I review here will be considered the worst on the list, and I say some really harsh things here, though they are all justifiable. If you wish to avoid reading sad things, move on ahead to the next choice.)  Naru: 0/10  Ah, boy, I really wanted to skip this one and just leave the rating, but she is apparently one of the main protagonists so I have no choice here, really. As you can tell from the numbers, I barely have any liking towards this character. Let me review it in quick spurts.  Funnily enough, she looked very tranquil when you first see her and she rubs up against Keitaro rather quickly. She sees him in the hot spring bath and decides to approach him. I do not remember why, but she abruptly pounced on him after that and, basically, her character is set from this point onward.  And, now let's review the heavy negatives about her:  - With only a literal few exceptions, Naru continuously punches Keitaro and claims he has ""no excuses"" for any of the ""perverted"" things that he did; ultimately meaning that, say the girl is the lecherous one, Naru would still blame Keitaro in some way, shape or form; with a brutal punch to the face. - Anytime that Keitaro explains himself, she ultimately gives him the cold shoulder. Even if it is obviously the girl at fault, she will not buy it. Even if it is so obvious that it could hit her in the face, literally, she still does not buy it.  And, though I already mentioned it, I want you to really read this one out and tell me if Keitaro is the villain here; as this will be the one primary example I show on how Keitaro is almost always innocent.  Naru finds him in the same room as Kaolla's big sister, with her sister on top of Keitaro. No, no, this not one of the few exceptions I brought up where Keitaro is a pervert, cause Keitaro is actually tied down to the ground and can not move. Naru sees them, and decides to PUNISH KEITARO. I (...) you not, she actually blames him for this. Well he was kidnapped, a kidnapping that she witnessed, she blamed the tied up Keitaro for this deed and basically let the kidnapper get away with him.  Towards the end of the anime, she develops a sadistic love for Keitaro. I say this because she barely shows any true love for him besides when she did not know it was him in one episode. Ultimately, she is fully quick to judge him on everything and never once trusts him. Yet, despite this, she technically ""ends up"" with him at the end of the anime as he chose her over the other girl, whom I will get to in a little while.  Honestly, I could go on much longer, but as I said, I did not want to extend a hate rant for too long on here so that you can get to know the other characters. I will try to say one positive thing about her so that I am not hated upon by the fan base. So, hmm, I honestly can not think of anything. This is not a joke, I can not think of anything positive about her at all. After all, let's review what I just said:  - She never once believed Keitaro when he tried to explain a situation, let alone listen to it. So, yeah, she definitely started the generic harem trope. - She never punishes anyone else as brutally as she does Keitaro. Hell, I bet he did worse in his exams because he suffered brain damage. - She is overly sadistic, probably worse than Mio from MM! if I am being completely honest here. That is no exaggeration.  Though she has, somehow, had positive scenes with Keitaro, they basically mean nothing due to the fact that she forgets most of them and only remembers the ones that are vital to the story. She can honestly be so bipolar at times that it is not even funny. Her little sister, however, is much more accepting of Keitaro (yeah, I know, she is adopted, but still) and even hugs him for comfort. What made me so happy in this moment was that it lacked any form of interruption from Naru to immediately be an idiot and not figure out that the situation is just normal bonding. Honestly, I am glad she did not ruin that, but I was thinking she would because, you know, Naru.  She has a freaking ZERO on this review. I do know that the manga is apparently better than the anime, though, and that the characters developed better. So, this review is only based on the anime side of Naru, which I despise more than any other character in anime. Do not think I am judging her based on everything. Though, as painful as it was, I did promise I would watch the entirety of Love Hina before reviewing, though I will be honest and say I wanted to end the anime after the FOURTH episode to write this review. It was that bad already to me.  She is honestly worse than Haruhi to me. I never thought I would dislike a main character more than Haruhi, but Naru actually managed to take the spotlight. Enough where the anime that she is from was rated a lower score than I did for Haruhi and this is sad because I thought she was the worst female character I could come across. But, I was wrong. Haruhi actually has a bit of kindness in comparison to Naru.  Anyway, I will just stop here.  Masayuki and Kimiaki: 2/10  Honestly, I thought these guys were pretty decent at first since it looked like they supported Keitaro, but very quickly, they begin to bag on him like Naru does. Only once, however, do they get violent with him and call him a pervert and all the usual insults that Naru calls him. For the most part, they are okay, but I disliked their abrupt changes in character to aid the situation at hand. I was here thinking they were actual friends of Keitaro, but they have actually managed to screw him over a lot. They helped him out occasionally, so I gave them a decent score because of that.  Sarah: 3/10  Honestly, if Naru was not in the show, I think Sarah would be the worst female character to me. Literally a character introduced into the show just so that Keitaro can never have a break from any form of torture, the story goes like this. Keitaro needs a job, so he eventually runs into her father, Noriyasu, whom gives him the position after finding him in the lake. Well he is drying, he encounters the little girl in his car, whom we find out is his adopted daughter. She immediately takes action, like Naru, to mindlessly beat on him, though her father is oblivious to it all the whole time and assumes she is ""warming up"" to him.  However, her rating is noticeably higher because she is justifiable due to her being a kid after all. That is, with most of what she does, anyway. She is even positive to Keitaro much more on a few situations and she is disgruntled due to her issues with her real parents. So, you can show real sympathy towards Sarah because of this. I really can say she has some positives about her. But, Naru only has no excuses because of how reckless, sadistic and pointless her morals are when she is so clueless to most things around her, given her age.  Kaolla Su: 5/10  She is not a horrible character for the most part, and is also pretty aggressive towards Keitaro like everyone else. However, she is fairly young, so it is justifiable. She is intentionally reckless, so most of the time, she can also hit somebody else during her mischief beside Keitaro and even stirs up trouble for herself when things go too far. She is apparently a genius, though, so this confuses me on how grownup she really is. She is capable of building robots that can do absurd things and apparently knows her entire future. It is pretty impressive.  My biggest grief towards Kaolla was when she was teasing Shinobu about her kissing troubles; going so far as to molest her unexpectedly when she was not looking and steal her first kiss, making her break in tears, though Kaolla looked a bit sadistic well doing this and still did not show a frown or anything well Shinobu was in pain. Even if she is as young as she is, she is a genius after all for the most part and I feel like she should have known better than to do something that was so precious to Shinobu. Ultimately, Shinobu never kissed anyone else after this episode.  Motoko: 6/10  I thought Motoko was pretty similar to Naru at first, cause she was very negative when we see her for the first few times. However, she progressively develops well as a character and is not at all a bad one. Her only real trouble is that she, too, judges Keitaro too quickly like Naru does and can easily be considered just as bad as her if you only watch a little bit of the anime.  However, she has an episode dedicated to her, and she is actually pretty shy and timid once she no longer possesses the power of her blade; which happened when she was unable to focus. This resulted in the reminder that she is only a teenage girl, after all, as she was very scared in situations where boys would gang up on her when she was defenseless. Oh, and she had a very bizarre episode where one of her friends suddenly became evil and told her to kill Keitaro, and she forgave her anyway. Pretty strange for Motoko to do that.  But, I liked her development and she is a decent character.  Mitsune: 7/10  I do believe she is the only girl who is Keitaro's actual age, Mitsune (from what I can remember, she is indefinitely called ""Kitsune"" in the anime) usually only teases Keitaro and is not sadistic in any way. When Keitaro saw her once in some pretty revealing clothing, Kitsune never once manhandled him. This really shows the maturity in her age, because she is just as old as Keitaro after all. She only likes to tease the other characters at times, but is never truly aggressive or violent towards any of them.  Honestly, until today, I thought she was a lot older due to the way she was drawn. Yet, as I said earlier, she is the same age as Keitaro. She likes to get drunk a lot, never does any of her actual work and is almost always around just to mess around. Overall, I have a neutral opinion of her, but she is not nearly as bad as the other characters.  Shinobu: 8/10  The only one to see Keitaro's kind side before his mean side, she understands Keitaro. Like, actually understands him. As in, whenever she sees him in a situation, she is more quick to be sympathetic. She also has a little school girl crush on him, and the age of consent in Japan is within her age range, so I suppose she could technically date Keitaro if she wanted to.  She has the generic shy girl tropes, such as being scared a lot, always sounding scared and is overly sympathetic at times. However, she is a well rounded character, and not just because she has the most round face in the anime. Her personality is likable, so much so that I still hate Kaolla for what she did to her now that I think about it more. She did not deserve that.  She had a troubled past with her parents, but Keitaro was the one that saved her from them one day when she was crying. He drew a sketch of her, and I believe this was the only time I ever honestly saw him draw anything in the anime. I never knew if he was a profound artist, really, but he drew a really good portrait of Shinobu so he easily could be a professional.  Mutsume: 9/10  Honestly, she does not get a perfect score only because she was not in the anime enough. So, that shaved point stems from how, despite being the deuteragonist here, she was absent for quite a while after her introduction. I thought she was a minor character at first because of this.  However, she is presumably the little girl from Keitaro's past and suddenly becomes quite prominent towards the end. And she is pretty similar to him in every way, also sustaining actual damage during dangerous situations, something that no other girl apparently gets. So, I really wanted her to end up with him.  Hell, when we first see her in an entire episode, she is basically with Keitaro and Naru during their journey of finding themselves after they failed the exams. She has anemia, so she had to be with them, but still. She actually is the first to kiss Keitaro, and might I add, she gets really into it. Like, full on french kissing him and moans, too. It is quite unexpected of her, but it was strangely fitting of her character.  She is never once negative towards Keitaro, though maybe cause she is the same age as him. This anime really did highlight how the high school girls are extremely timid, well the mature ones are, well, not. And, showing their age, assess the situation more respectfully in comparison. Actually, it is funny that I say this, cause despite Shinobu being much younger than anyone else, she is pretty mature for her age. But, yeah, Mutsumi is no exception within her age demographic. She is nice, honest and is apparently really intelligent; only failing her entrance exams as much as Keitaro because she fell into anemia every time and could not return her results.  She is just as clumsy as Keitaro as well, and is similar to him in every way. Honestly, anyone would root for her more than Naru. She is just a very good character and, funnily enough, has reverse situations where she falls on Keitaro and does something awkward to him. Of course, Naru believes it is him and gives him a firm punch to the face every time.  Oh, and she also stole Naru's first kiss as well. She full on frenches her as well as moans, for some bizarre reason. However, she did it for a much shorter time, well with Keitaro, she kept going. So, who knows what would have happened if Naru never stopped them.  Keitaro: 9/10  Just like Mutsumi, I shave a point cause of his delivery sometimes not being at the right place, but he will have the longest description of anyone here.  Honestly, Keitaro is so honest with himself that it hurts that Naru is as mean as she is. I will point out the negatives first, such as how he can be a bit lecherous at times. Speaking of, in one episode, when he was normal for a little while (they explain why, though), Naru actually tried to lure him to her by taking off some of her shirt, only to be ultimately rejected by him. So, Naru could be just as perverted as him in a few situations.  But, Keitaro is ultimately a very honest male character, and also the king of ""most misunderstood male character"" because all of his intentions are pure as can be. A few notable ones include:  - Any time he sleeps near a girl, where the girl did not crawl up to him first, he actually restricts himself with rope to fight temptation. Naru only saw this once, and still considered him a pervert afterwards.  - In one episode, when Matoko was hugging Keitaro for comfort (though not the same way as Mei was), Keitaro knew she was demanding comfort on a more physical level and pushed her away; hinting that he is fully capable of controlling his sexual desires.  - He listens to the girl, like a dating sim male character would, and actually warms up to them really quickly. And, when the girl actually listens, she does as well. It is quite touching when these things do happen and I wish it happened more often, but, you know, Naru.  Keitaro is not a bad guy at all, which results in Naru's hate for him being full on arbitrary prejudice. I honestly believe Naru has some form of mental illness as a result of how brutal she is towards Keitaro. Being the kind of the harem trope, I am not surprised. But, it was much worse than I had priorly anticipated. MUCH, much worse.  But, yeah, this will spoil the ending, but apparently, well Naru and Mutsumi were there when Keitaro made that promise, he did so to a ""third"" girl. That is the idea here, though I still think it was Mutsumi. After all, she did full on french him abruptly, and also kissed him on the cheek when she was a kid, so come on. That little girl has to be Mutsumi.  Conclusion  Does Keitaro ever kiss Naru? Actually, yes. Firstly, Naru is the one that actually initiated it and it simply resulted in Keitaro following the generic ending of going after her, despite Mutsumi saying that she was willing to provide for him and show much more love.  This made, absolutely, zero sense to me. Honestly one of the worst endings an anime could ever have to me. You have two girls, the one you wanted to be with and know she is there, even showing you that she still cares a lot and would be willing to do so for a great time to come; and one that is extremely prideful and rude to you throughout the time you knew her, but is apparently a bit perverted herself. Would you pick the mean girl? If you are masochistic, I suppose. I mean, as long as you can talk to her sometimes, and have some moments with her and, as long as she can not see your face directly, she can be just as nice.  But, Keitaro honestly deserved to be with Mutsumi much more than Naru, which the ending basically implied happened. In fact, right after the conclusion of the anime, there is a bonus episode where Naru is absent almost the whole time and, right as she says goodbye to Keitaro to visit her parents, she gives him a mean look. What the hell? So much for loving him, I guess. She is still just as mean as she was before. On the bright side, she was absent nearly the WHOLE TIME. That episode was a blessing.  Also, I want to note that at one point when Mutsumi sees Keitaro punched directly in front of her by Naru, she immediately goes to comfort him. After all, when he was punched, his head smashed into a wall. She actually showed remorse for him, rubbed his head and comforted him. It made me so angry that she never ended up with Keitaro.  Lastly, another reason why I would shave a point off of Keitaro is because he still chased after Naru, despite all the crap she put him through. It reminds us that Keitaro is basically a saint here, cause he managed to appreciate the very minimal amount of positive nature that Naru had over her, basically, evil aura that is around her all the time otherwise. He saw the kindness first, so this is actually good to his character, still. But, I feel like he should realize when a girl is worthy of his love, and Naru is not. Mutsumi was much more worthy, on top of being exactly similar to him in many respects. Oh, and actually going to his aid when he was punched. Nobody else did that.  I am very sorry, about how angry this review sounded, but this anime just made me really upset and I feel it deserves negativity where it is due. I do not want others to fall into its trap, unless you like harems I guess. I will not judge you for that, but to me, it is sad that an innocent male character gets beaten up so heavily. I like the trope better when the male character has actual perverted traits, which justifies the girl being rude to him. But, Keitaro was heavily abstinent, honest and knew when a situation would require him to set aside his desires to help.  With the characters all out of the way, one reason why this still has a decent score from me is because I actually liked its soundtrack, thought the art was a little advanced for its time (enough where I did not believe it was from the nineties at first until I looked it up) and, well, appreciated how Keitaro never cracked under the pressure the entire time he was brutally abused.  So, if you really, absolutely, positively have nothing else to watch, and just want to brush up on your history and know where all those harems originated from, I recommend you watch an episode of this every other day; only one, to make sure you do not develop too much hatred towards some of the female characters. I advise it heavily for your health.";Not Recommended
8;Love Hina;Fear_the_Reefer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fear_the_Reefer;1;"They say it’s a waste to live in the past, clinging to people you once knew and dreams you’ve outgrown. To live in the moment, and make plans for your future, are the cornerstones of responsibility, and you can never truly grow until you embrace them. But what if the past IS your only hope for a future? What if the only person who ever loved you was a brief acquaintance from your childhood? What if the promise to reunite as adults, bound by a common goal that will ensure their love will one day last forever? It’s easy to find the idea of someone devoting their adult lives to such a fleeting moment of happiness laughable, at least until you meet Keitaro Urashima, a 20 year old loser with a heart of gold and a body that would put a crash test dummy out of work. As a child, he made a promise to a mysterious young girl with whom he’d shared an unexpected connection. Upon realizing that they’d probably never see each other again, they vowed to one day get into the prestigious Tokyo University, a college that they heard has the power to keep loving young couples together forever. That actually sounds kind of romantic, right?  Well, it loses some of it’s luster when Keitaro, as an adult, has decided to work around his pesky undatability by holding onto this 14 year old promise well into his early twenties, optimistically believing that the love of his life is waiting just beyond the entrance exams of Tokyo University... Exams he has no hope of passing. Yeah, his ambition would probably be an admirable trait if it didn’t involve the Japanese equivalent of an Ivy League school, and even moreso if Keitaro himself wasn’t intellectually suited for, say, a for-profit school, or a community college at the very best. Nevertheless, he tries and fails, and when he refuses to set his sights any lower than the top, his parents realize with what I can only assume was dawning horror that they’re going to be taking care of their son for the long haul, and instead decide to ship his unemployed ass to the family hotel, Hinata Inn, to study while work as the building’s new manager! What they don’t tell him, however, is that Hinata Inn has recently been transformed into a girls’ only dorm, and it’s home to a flock of ferocious females who aren’t shy about letting him know where his boundaries lie. With these tough temptresses attempting to murder him over every little misunderstanding, will Keitaro ever be able to chase his dreams, or will he be too distracted by the angry teenagers chasing him?  Love Hina is a bit of a rarity in terms of production history... It was animated by two distinctly different companies, Production IG and Studio Xebec, the differences between them being like night and day. Production IG has a reputation for showing us the best visuals that the current technology of whatever year it’s working in have to offer, and this was no less true in the year 2000. Xebec, on the other hand, is to animation what a child with a plastic steering wheel attached to it’s carseat is to driving... Except with actual control over the car. These two radically different agents mix about as well as oil and water, making it embarrassingly easy to tell who’s behind the visuals at any given time. Now, to be clear, the animation in this show is never what you’d call “good.” It clearly had a lot of budget issues to deal with, which I’ve heard is partially responsible for it’s failure to secure a second season before it got canceled. It’s passable about half the time, with good old IG doing their damnedest to not let the series look as cheap as it was, and for the most part, it kinda worked. They did what they could to limit obvious corner-cutting techniques, animating character movements and framing conversations in such a way that key frames never become too oppressive, and awkward motion isn’t too distracting.  On the other hand, we have Xebec, who did the rest of the series, and to say they didn’t handle the fickle nature of the budget as well as IG did would be a generous freaking understatement. I guess the best example of the kind of job they do would be episode 16, the Monkey King stage play. This episode doesn’t just abuse key frame, it cuts back and forth between the SAME key frames, at one early point shooting it’s main characters way out in the background, with the entire rest of the frame filled with a simple beach landscape, the tiny characters barely moving as it cuts back and forth between this frame and another slightly more interesting one. It’s eventually revealed that the reason these excessive shortcuts were taken was so Xebec could show some action scenes towards the end, which probably would have made it feel justified if it wasn’t for the fact that the action in question isn’t even all that great. It’s not terrible by any means, but even a novice animator knows that it’s not worth letting 90 percent of your anime look like crap just to save your budget for a few mediocre fight scenes.  So yeah, the worst thing you can say about the animation over-all is that it’s inconsistent, but when it’s bad, it’s painfully bad. The same can be said for the artwork, which... Like the animation... Is at best, passable. The backgrounds are serviceable enough, as while they never really feel detailed or immersive, and extras existing in the background never really move or feel lifelike, it’s never so bad that you can’t imagine characters existing and living in them. They’re fine. The characters, however, run into some serious issues here and there. While it’s not a consistent problem, I do recall several instances of characters appearing off-model, frozen in time, or having the incorrect bodily proportions. There was one particularly egregious frame towards the end where Naru’s little sister temporarily went from a normal middle school physique to an inexplicable D-cup, and that’s not even at it’s worse. Motoko, the swordswoman character, had her face altered for this adaptation in a way that makes her look almost frog-like in the early episodes. Thankfully, that’s really the only deviation from the original character designs that I noticed. Anyway, the artwork is largely fine, but any given time, you’re only one rogue pause away from seeing what can only be described as bad fanart.  But you wanna know what’s consistently awesome, unlike the visuals? The music. Love Hina has a fantastic soundtrack, with it’s only real massive downfalls being the fact that you can’t really find all the sample tracks online, and the fact that several more recognizable tunes get recycled ad nauseum throughout the series. Not that the second issue matters, because the music is good, and you’ll welcome opportunities to hear each track multiple times. Unfortunately, the best track only plays once, and I can’t find it literally anywhere. It’s a solemn piano piece that plays in episode 12 between the opening theme and the title reveal, and I know I’ve heard it in some other anime before, but no amount of searching has gotten me any closer to it. The rest of the music, which has been equally difficult to match names to, is overflowing with effort and personality, from the frantic upbeat songs to the beautiful insert songs that were all sung by the cast, and especially the more soulful tunes that get used for more sad or romantic moments. Songs dealing with individual characters carry the flavor of said characters, like Motoko’s traditionally eastern sounding themes and Kaolla’s exotic ones.  The opening, Sakura Saku, could almost be considered an ode to the fast forward button, as it just feels... Fast. from the song to the visuals, it’s an incredibly fast paced op where everything seems to be trying to catch up with each other. I get the feeling that this tone matches what Xebec and IG THOUGHT they were going for with this anime, but in reality, it doesn’t really match the tone of either the original manga OR the final product. It’s like, this is the op they commissioned when they though the show they were going to create was going to be slapstick, zany antics and physical comedy all the way through. Having said that, as fast an OP as it may be, it also comes off as a bit lazy, as it recycles visuals from the show... A pet peeve of mine, if you’re wondering... And otherwise introduces the entire cast through framed faceshots, a staple of the harem genre. Honestly, it’s a pretty annoying op that I found myself skipping over and over. The ending theme is better, employing a slower and more groovy song as it slowly pans across a single still image of the main female cast on the floor covered in nothing but loose white sheets, and while it feels completely out of place, it at least pleasant in comparison. Although, yes, I skipped it just as often.  The English dub has actually achieved notoriety over how terrible it is, as I don’t think I’ve seen a single reviewer attempt to recommend it over the sub... But honestly, I don’t think it’s really all that bad. Now once again, it’s not what you’d call good, but several of the performances are at least accurate, and the ones that aren’t are the product of bad casting and direction, although even in those cases I can kind of see what the director was trying to do. To start things off on a relatively positive note, Derek Stephen Prince’s performance is more or less what I hear in my head when I read Keitaro’s dialogue in the manga, and he’s able to stretch what should be a throat destroying role to some pretty diverse places and situations. He’s a good actor, but that doesn’t really make up for how annoying Keitaro’s voice sounds both in my head and in the show. Marginally better, albeit on the same note, is Bridget Hoffman in the role of Shinobu, the shy middle schooler who had much easier role to perform. Her waify Yamato Nadeshiko pitch would be a bit too grating for the original Shinobu, but with the bulk of her character development either removed or straight up replaced, she fits the part nicely.  When I’m having a discussion about bad, mediocre or middle-of-the-road voice actors, I always manage to shock the room by bringing up the prolific Wendee Lee. Yes, she’s had her fair share of outstanding roles, but she’s also been dragged down on too many occasions by poor direction choices that she just couldn’t manage to save. In Love Hina, she plays the energetic Kaolla Su as well as Su’s older sister Amalla in a dual role where she was asked to perform with an Indian accent... Even though the character is not Indian, and the dialogue even goes as far as to blatantly STATE she’s not Indian. Of course, there wasn’t much available in the way of other options, and there really isn’t a known accent attached to her people in them anga, and to her credit, Wendee does pull it off... When playing Amalla. When her range is stretched too far by the combination of acting, using a difficult accent AND playing a hyper character, the end result is just terrible. It’s still better than Barbara Goodson’s inexplicable southern drawl that’s supposed to act as a substitute for the Kansai accent, but ‘better’ is a relative term here, because they’re both virtually unlistenable.  And if you thought my criticism of Wendee Lee was hard to take, wait until you hear Mona Marshall playing Motoko Aoyama. Good God was this an awful casting choice. I’ve criticized her before for having a little boy voice that doesn’t sound remotely male, but that’s not to say the voice sounds like a natural woman, either... And she uses that exact voice to play Motoko, the kendo-obsessed girl and my favorite character from the manga. Every single word that comes out of her mouth sounds like it’s coming from the wrong person, like she’s the sad victim of a rogue ventriloquist. Rounding out the rest of the main cast we have Julie Ann Taylor doing a fine job with Mutsumi, playing her appropriately as a klutzy airhead, and Dorothy Elias-Fahn as Naru. This is one of Fahn’s two biggest credits, alongside Meryl Stryfe from Trigun, and to say the two characters are similar... Shouting, critical nags attached at the hip to doofus heroes... Is a bit of an understatement, but since Naru isn’t as well-rounded or fully realized a character as Meryl was, there’s also the problem that she doesn’t really click with the character as fast. She enters the role as a stuck-up screaming Tsundere, but to be fair, she does settle into the role as best as she can as the series progresses... Possibly even moreso than the character really deserves. It’s a dub that takes some tolerance and getting used to, but yeah, there’s no real reason not to watch it subbed.  Before I start to look more deeply at Love Hina, I should probably start by saying some things about it’s creator, Ken Akamatsu. As one of the founders of the modern harem genre, Akamatsu is a renowned mangaka whose works have been well received both critically and commercially, and his influence can be seen just about everywhere. He has seven unique titles to his name, but since Mao-chan started off as an anime, Kids Game is difficult to find and the less we say about Itsudatte My Santa the better, we’re going to focus on the way his work has evolved over the course of four of his most well known works; AI Love You, Love Hina, Negima, and UQ Holder. The first thing that I’d like to call attention to is that throughout his career, Akamatsu has had a penchant for inventive action scenes, PG-rated fanservice nudity, and deep, complex exploration of characters who seem at first glance to be nothing more than cheap tropes. Well those and all the weirdness, but the weirdness is largely unique to each title. It’s interesting to look at his body of work over the years, how it’s changed from title to title, but the most easily trackable change comes with the theory that he uses his fanservice as a crutch to keep readers interested throughout the story.  AI Love You was basically a rip-off of Ah My Goddess, with High School Keitaro in the lead role and Skuld being swapped out for a little boy. Not gonna lie, it’s pretty bad. The only thing it really has to offer is a generic slice of life story, disturbingly sexist undertones, and a lot of bare bottoms. It’s follow-up, Love Hina, had lot more effort put into it’s plot and story, with Akamatsu’s trademarked fanservice put into a more consistent context and more practical use as other elements and themes were experimented with. When Negima came around, Akamatsu didn’t even want to make a harem, wanting instead to try his hand at the shounen action genre, so he worked around his contract by using a beefed up harem as the roots and origin of such a story. Since the shounen action and magical adventures wound up being the most popular aspect of Negima, he wound up creating his most recent effort UQ Holder, a sequel to Negima and a pure shounen action series whose occasional fanservice feels more like a half-assed obligation than anything the writer’s really invested in. My point is, he’s grown as a writer, in maturity, craft, and many other areas. But Love Hina is still one of his earlier works, so you kinda have to expect an immature world-view going in.  Since Love Hina is the work that made him famous, it is the one most synonymous with his name, and it’s achieved a sort of iconic status in it’s own right, particularly as a gateway manga for a surprising number of otaku from both sides of the ocean. It’s appeal can best be explained by the way it utilizes it’s target audience, teenage boys and those who think like them. It works the best on readers who are lacking in experience with anime, manga and sex, and unless you’ve already spent your youth on it, it’s a surprisingly easy story to grow out of. Young readers are sucked in by the promise of crazy comedy, sexy antics and the bare bottoms of seven radically different female characters... But instead of just milking these impressionable young readers for cash, Love Hina introduces them to extended arcs, complex character writing, and a sense of conflict and themes that comes off as natural and never forced. For example, Keitaro and Naru aren’t just thrown together as the main prospective couple... In a house full of people who are only staying there to run away from something, they’re the only ones who are also running towards something, making them the most compelling members of the cast, and even when they’re battling against the literal force of fate, you still wind up rooting for them. There’s a lot more to this manga than just fanservice and slapstick, and it stays with you years later.  How well does the anime translate these qualities? Well, let me ask you this; after writing more than sixty anime reviews, how many times did I break the review to talk about the manga the series was based on, and why it worked? I did that here because there are tons of reviews that will tell you Love Hina doesn’t work, but I haven’t really come across any that went into detail about why. The manga works because in between every big memorable moment, there are volumes upon volumes of character development and a very specific order to the events which unfold. Because of this, it represents the best of a lot of otherwise regrettable tropes. Shinobu is the best “notice me sempai” girl, Keitaro is the best of the ‘obsessed over a childhood love’ characters, etc. Out of all the changes that the anime made, more of them being completely harmless than you might think, the absolute worst thing it did was rush the story, ignoring all of that glue and focusing solely on those big moments, and showing everything out of order. The characters are there, but the familiarity is gone. There’s no magic left in our bond with them, and with such terrible execution, nothing feels like it’s happening at the right time. This is a devastating problem for a story with so many imperfections that it needed that glue to cover up.  You can argue until the cows come home about Ken Akamatsu’s level of maturity, but he was not a stupid writer. One of the biggest complaints anyone has about the anime is how much abuse Keitaro suffers at the hands of his love interest, which is a complaint that isn’t heard nearly as often from the Manga’s readers, despite it happening about as often. This is where fanservice comes in. In the manga, almost every time Keitaro’s assaulted, it’s accompanied by either a peek at some panties or a flash of some flesh, and due to the static nature of a manga panel, the presumably 14-year-old reader has the option of lingering on the naughtiness, already perfectly framed, and then just glancing over the punch/kick/sword slash. In the anime, almost all fanservice is removed... Hell, girls don’t even enter the hot springs without towels until the halfway point! The abuse is left to it’s own devices, no distraction offered. This is why, among people who’ve only seen the anime, the character of Naru Narusegawa has the unfortunate stigma of being despised by otaku the world over.  I’ll try not to give too many examples of the disastrous changes the anime makes, at least in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but there are some that must be addressed. Keitaro lying about being a Tokyu U student is supposed to be a major plot point, one where he digs himself in deeper with each interaction, but in the anime, it’s swept under the rug soon after being brought up. Replacing the original Shinobu introductory arc with one that involves her parents feels forced and unnatural, especially since the most essential part of Keitaro’s lie was the way it affected her. There’s an incredibly important moment during a beach storyline where Keitaro is screwed by his friends into royally pissing off Naru, and it’s supposed to be a major speed bump between them that lasts three whole arcs, one of them being completely non-sensical for the sake of levity. Here, that levity arc is played first, and the initial friction arc is combined with another arc(that’s been shifted to three other characters) before being abruptly resolved under some generic fireworks. There are several new characters added, including a new romantic rival for Keitaro, Motoko’s harem of admirers, and Naru’s little sister, but none of them add anything to the story outside of writers’ conveniences.  Several new ideas, like Naru becoming an idol singer and Motoko dreaming she’s in a fantasy RPG game, are just as pointless, and often confusing in their logic. Even when the anime does something genuinely good, it’s still dragged down by mistakes that are even worse. There’s a tight focus on the mystery of who Keitaro’s promise girl is, and the love triangle that blossoms from it is handled well, unless you’re watching the episode where it’s suggested that she might have just been a haunted ball joint doll. The effect Motoko’s sister had on her life is explored thoughtfully, but we never actually meet her, so it ultimately falls flat. Kaitaro’s incest crazy sister was thankfully left out, which I’d give them major credit for if it wasn’t for the fact that A: She wound up getting her own movie and B: They wound up giving Kaolla and her siblings an incest episode that was even worse. The story wound up being incomplete because of budget issues that made it unfeasible to continue onto a second season, but if the right material had been cut, it wouldn’t have been an issue. The three movies that followed didn’t do the ending justice, rather they just animated some popular storylines that were left out. Seeing how ‘Read the manga’ type endings have affected me in the past, you can guess what my thoughts on this one are.  Love Hina was originally available from Geneon, and after they went out of business, it wound up being rescued and redistributed by Funimation. The original Geneon collections are still available online, such as the Complete collection set and the Perfect collection set, which includes the OVA episode and all three movies, or you can buy the two collections that Funimation has released... A thinpack box set with cover art that tried to make the material sexier than it actually is, and more recently an ‘Anime Classics’ collection that proves just how far they’re willing to stretch that term. The three movies can be found individually or in a box set, and while they’re technically out of print, they’re still fairly cheap online. The manga from Ken Akamatsu has been available stateside for so long that you can find the entire 14 volume set on Ebay for as low as 35 dollars, which is a deal I’d highly recommend. AI Love You is a bit trickier to find, and is thus a bit more expensive, even at only 8 volumes. A two volume light novel collection is also available stateside.  The word I feel best describes the Love Hina anime is incompetent. It does absolutely nothing right, and while it’s fairly easy to tell that it respects the source material, it’s just as obvious that it doesn’t understand the source material. The only episode that I found any enjoyment in was episode 12, which had me laughing out loud multiple times and sucked me into it’s story, with a little help from the aforementioned music. Aside from that one exception, every single episode of this turkey is tied for worst, and they all fail in such unique ways that I could have reviewed every single one of them on it’s own, had I wanted to. The comedy isn’t funny, the romance isn’t romantic, the drama has no stakes, the characters have no development, and I have the strangest feeling that they intentionally meandered throughout the entire run, thinking it was entitled to a second season that never happened, and were thus in no rush to reach any conclusion. I was willing for the longest time to give this title a few pity points, based on it’s good intentions, appropriately goofy nature and killer soundtrack, but that incest episode just sealed the deal. I give Love Hina a 1/10.";Not Recommended
9;Love Hina;TheNextThing;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheNextThing;4;"This is one of the shows that when I was first getting into anime, everyone had seen. For me, it’s one of the classics, one of the foundational texts, a precursor to all the stuff that’s come out in the past 10 years. As such, it was my duty to see it. When they were kids, a boy and a girl made a promise to get into Tokyo’s most prestigious university. But now the boy has forgotten the girl’s name, and he’s also failed the test to get in twice. Anyway, he ends up being the manager to an all woman’s boarding house and this is a harem show and he’s completely spineless and also a pervert and did I mention that there are hot springs out back and did I mention that each episode features him stumbling and falling and grabbing someone’s breast and or opening the door and seeing someone right when they’re undressing; yeah, so that’s that. The show’s worst aspects are definitely it’s most slapsticky, or when the show loses the emotional focus of the story (the growing attraction between the two main characters, one of the greatest tsunderes ever created). It wasn’t quite a disappointment because it’s what I expected, but you know, you always want these things to be better than they really are.  copied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com";Not Recommended
10;Love Hina;MKSTEEL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MKSTEEL;4;Beautiful character designs and smart music choices are let down by an over-the-top cliched Harem narrative that rarely lets up on the slapstick nonsense that constantly occurs with annoying regularity. Female lead Naru was grating and obnoxious as a MC, and I often found I was more interested in her sometimes-rival Mutsumi, who seemed infinitely more interesting as a character. The other dorm residents were a pile of cliches I found forgettable, as I can barely recall their names. Everything the series does as a Romantic-Comedy are things I have seen done elsewhere in Harem/Romantic anime with far more panache than Love Hina manages. When I first bought the series, it played better, but has not aged well in comparison with other titles in the Romantic genres of anime.;Not Recommended
11;Love Hina;FilthyEagle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FilthyEagle;2;"I first saw this anime when I was young in the TV, I started watching it and I really got into it. Ths story and overall was nice, I just liked it.  Then one day I went with some friend to a manga store and decided to give the manga a try. I couldn't believe what I was reading. The art, the plot, the characters, everything was great. I felt in love with the manga. After I finished the last volume I started feeling empty and just wanted to see it again, and there was when I realized what a piece of rubbish this anime is.  They fucked up the characters, they gave Keitaro (The protagonist) an even dumber personality that was unnecessary. And talking about unnecessary what was going through their minds when they added more characters that have nothing to do with the plot and are just annoying and useless? Let's just make a new character and give him a entire episode, what can go wrong? Then the art, come on just look at Naru's face in the manga and in the anime, even without watching an episode you could tell what is wrong. I'm not going to spoil anything in case someone really want to see the anime and happens to read this, but why do they have to even change the end of the story? Do yourself a favor and read the manga.  I don't want to be ""That guy"" that says that the manga is better, but in this case it is. Most of the anime adaptations are great even if it's not the same story as the manga, but this anime is a good example of a really bad adaptation of a great manga.";Not Recommended
0;Love Get Chu;kakyoism;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kakyoism;9;"So far the only full-fledged story that deals with the life of Anime voice actors, or, Seiyuus (There is REC, but not as dedicated as this one). Despite the fact that the artwork of this series is of average quality, and that filler romance takes up too much time, it does present a lot of realistic aspects of the Anime voice acting industry. Highly recommended to Seiyuu fans yet do not expect super intelligent storyline other than how up-and-coming actors(actresses to be accurate) struggle through their green days.  Story: 8/10 Mixed with somewhat cliche comedy and romance, what's good about the storyline is that it faces the true problems of the industry such as commercialization of voice acting and more emphasis on the look of the actors/actresses. Professionals have to move to front stage to cater to the enthusiastic fans curious about other aspects of them that they don't necessarily excel at, e.g. singing. The experience of humiliating interview, the heart-pressing training school days, and the embarrassing first-job, etc. all depict the hurting truth in this career: Here talented+diligent people take pain with little gain other than small niche popularity. Yet as in most Shounen works, the protagonists managed to find their own positions eventually and started to take off with their childhood fantasy.  Comedy elements mostly center around the #1 protagonist Momoko, a mindlessly ambitious girl that you saw a lot. Her ignorance of life style of Seiyuu conveniently serves as most audience's perspective; that gives you a bit of RPG flavor.  The romance (a love triangle) between two actresses and a young Anime art designer is kinda filler material and I understand that romance is a must for stories like this. Fortunately, the boy in love also provided enough inspiration to our girls in focus.  With a luxurious 25 episodes, the story is at first pretty episodic, then when the romance sets in, it becomes a little draggy, but over the course a lot of character introspection enables us to realize the &quot;3D&quot; Seiyuu's fear and joy, often obscured by the happy shinny 2D characters that they give life to. The ending is very creative in my opinion in that it tries to demonstrate the power of voice acting in a visual fantasy and surely was a lot of fun to me. Overall the story works for what it is.  An interesting setting: the agency that the protagonists work for is called Lamda 8, while in reality, some of the cast of the series are signed to the famous agency called Sigma 7. So apparently a semi-pun.  Art: 6/10 You will see typical Shounen style drawing but the number of colors used are fairly limited. Good things is given that Seiyuus often work indoors, there are a fairly elaborated outdoor settings as well. Character faces and body figures are nothing special. You still see the typical big eyes, slim body for example.  Sound: 8/10 What can I say? Given that this is about voice acting, you get to hear quite a few top-notch actors doing what they do and they really mean themselves here! Most of the five female protagonists are newbies but I really enjoyed 高本めぐみ(Takamoto Megumi)'s performance; it was passionate, cheerful, and sentimental at times. Check out her voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage (http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably be surprised how this young girl can be multi-facet in styles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forward to her further output (There will be one in which she leads again early 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played their part properly, as true veterans in the field XD.  Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would be anther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where she proves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voice quality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists gets put on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice.  Character: 6/10 I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of the industry; a lot of character development should be left with a question mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effort than the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (Ochiai Yurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in real life, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in the later half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子, こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star 坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocal talent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space to grow.  Enjoyment: 10/10 Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME because you don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history that deals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehow realistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched it twice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again.  Overall: 9/10 In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's a must-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lot about Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series. I do hope that there will be more of this kind in the future. But I doubt it. So cherish the opportunity!";Recommended
1;Love Get Chu;_Arcadia0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_Arcadia0;8;"Love Get Chu ~ Miracle Seiyuu Hakusho ~  So this is the first all-out seiyuu anime that I have seen. Airing in 2006 in Japan only, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. I originally wanted to watch this because of the title Love Get Chu….. and the OP that I found. It was enough to make me go “Hmmm, yes this might be fun”.  Love Get Chu is about a group of girls trying to become seiyuu (voice actors/actresses). It’s a very coming of age, slice of life, comedy type of anime. The girls that we’re introduced to are not experts; rather, we watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school. The girls themselves are pretty great, they’re all very different personality wise, but they’re also full of clichés, so if you hate that, this probably isn’t for you right off the bat. We have our super Main girl, the star of the show, the airhead who’s entirely naïve, the natural klutz and the one who is always ready to cheer everyone up; Momoko Ichihara. We also have the shy, quiet and reserved girl Rinka Suzuki, the tomboy Tsubasa Onodera, the observing intelligent girl Amane Oohara and the childhood friend Yurika Sasaki.  There is also a male lead, the guy who is a part of a love triangle, the one who wants to become an animator, the filler; Atari Maeda. I call him filler because he’s honestly not needed for Love Get Chu. Most of the time he’s just sort of “there”. Sure there are episodes where he helps Momoko get to know herself better or where Momoko can rely on him sometimes, but by the end of the 25th episode, I was rather tired of seeing him. He’s the childhood friend to Yurika and the love triangle involved Yurika, Momoko and himself.  The story in Love Get Chu is that of what I imagine other seiyuu like anime are, but since this is my first time watching one, I have no direct comparison. I think the biggest issue Love Get Chu has is identity. It starts off as a “we’re going to become seiyuu” and “we’re all rivals” sort of thing. Of course by episode 5, they all become seiyuu and the anime takes a turn for the hardships that are included to become one and the difficulty it is to be a really good seiyuu. It then goes into idol territory and tries to bring up some sort of antagonist; at least that’s what it looked like. I can’t even remember his name; I swear his name is only said like 10 times or something. There are these business and political aspects to Love Get Chu which just show up for seemingly no reason at all. If the entire anime had focused on either becoming a seiyuu, idol, or a combination of both, instead of shoehorning romantic elements and some fake antagonist, I’d give it an 8 or more.  It’s a little funny, thinking about the way Love Get Chu started and ended, they could be considered different genres really. The beginning has all this great work, lovely animation, great face reactions, super funny scenes and antics between the girls. A little further than halfway through and despair and sad things start to happen, of course it doesn’t last long at all, but my problem is “why”? Why bother having it if you’re not going to expand upon it. Same with the romance elements and things. I’d actually have preferred it if Yurika won Atari; her tactics were slimy and really bad, she took advantage of Atari being drunk and not remembering anything to make him hers. Things like that, which when typed out (and watched too) is 100% dark when compared to the Love Get Chu I watched in the beginning. Like I said, I think Love Get Chu had an identity crisis and just couldn’t figure out how to make 25 episodes of worthwhile content; would have been better off being 1 cour.  Art style, depending on how you look at it, could be considered bad or good. Airing in 06, most people would expect something nicer to watch, but I actually liked the very early animated art style. It’s cute, the eyes are extra big, the mouths can get crazy wide and faces are different. The entire aesthetic looks really pretty and the outfits the girls wear, oh my goodness, super cute stuff. If there is one part of the show that I really really liked, it’s the art style, the beautiful bright colors, the clothing, the way the world looks; I loved watching Love Get Chu, that’s for sure.  Sound and things: An anime with a huge focus on seiyuu, so the best thing is how different each seiyuu can sound. There is one specific episode that really highlights the powers of a veteran seiyuu, I won’t spoil it, but being able to do 5 different sounding people, that was really cool to listen to. BGM is very normal and nothing to praise, except for when the sadder things start to happen, the change in both tempo and expected music is very stark and different. OP and ED are pretty amazing. The OP is what made me want to watch Love Get Chu, it’s cheerful, it’s super happy and the animation to go along with it is fantastic. The ED, which took a little bit to warm up to, is what I would say J-Hip/hop or something; once the beats drop and the vocals kick in is when the ED shines and makes it good to listen to. It’s also accompanied by Usumaru, Momoko’s keychain mascot usagi doll who dances on screen, so it’s super cute.  Over all, I think Love Get Chu is a very good anime, it probably does things differently than other seiyuu shows, since I figure this is a genre that’s hard to really make interesting. The “dark” business and politics of hosting and managing seiyuu is rather unnecessary, but appreciated since it shows some different things. The romance is okay, or more like mediocre; the way Momoko breaks down is very anime, very exaggerated and most definitely not real; the way she handles the truth however, can be very real and that’s a very delicate aspect of a girl’s life to pull off, so good job on that front. 8/10, but only because talking about the art raised it a number.";Recommended
0;Love Get Chu;jpmc;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jpmc;4;I didn't expect to have to do a review, and since this show is fairly unknown, I think it wasn't necessary, but I needed to share my impressions with someone. I usually expect an anime with a rating of 6 to be either hidden treasure (Futakoi Alternative, Uta kata) or a great idea poorly executed but still retaining memorable features (Geneshaft, Divergence Eve). Love Get-Chu is the latter, but without the memorable aspect.  Love Get Chu is the swan song of Radix studio, which like every studio, has at least one undeniable masterpiece that won't be forgotten as long as there are people watching anime: Haibane Renmei. But it's not a tuneful and worthy one, so it can't even be considered a swan song. In short, it is the story of a group of young girls wishing to become seiyuus. The story goes on well and interestingly in the first half, until episode 14. Then the love triangle involving the main character drags things out and when we finally get rid of it, the last episodes descend to the ridiculous in an insane championship to decide who will play the main role in the most awaited anime in history. If you're a fan of seiyuu and voice acting, the first half involving the slice of life and the whole career description will be pretty good, followed by a bearable ride to the end. If you're anyone else, the first half will be good or decent, and the rest unbearable or dragged out. Interestingly, Shirobako is a mirror image of what Love Get Chu could have been like if it had been performed well. The fact that it's the male lead who declares himself at the end and makes things happen is noteworthy. I suspect that if the show was better realised, perhaps the same story would only need 12 or 13 episodes, not 24 ( the last one is an extra).  After that show, Haibane's studio went bankrupt and became Studio Seven, which produced other kinds of masterpieces, but it's still a sad ending and a terrible death.   ------------  Eu não esperava ter de fazer uma review, e como esse show é bastante desconhecido, eu creio que não era necessário, mas eu precisava compartilhar minhas impressões com alguém. Eu geralmente espero que um anime com nota 6 seja ou tesouro escondido (Futakoi Alternative, Uta kata) ou uma grande idéia mal executada, mas que ainda guarda características memoráveis (Geneshaft, Divergence Eve). Love Get-Chu é o último, mas sem o aspecto memorável.  Love Get Chu é o canto de cisne do estúdio Radix, que como todo estúdio, tem pelo menos uma inegável obra-prima que não será esquecida enquanto houver gente vendo anime: Haibane Renmei. Mas não é um canto afinado e digno, logo, nem um canto de cisne pode ser considerado. Em resume, é a estória de um grupo de moças desejosas de se tornarem seiyuus. A estória segue boa e interessante na primeira metade, até o episódio 14. Depois o triangulo amoroso envolvendo a protagonista torna a coisa muito arrastada, e quando finalmente nos livramos dele, os últimos episódios descem ao ridículo num campeonato insano pra decidir quem fará o papel principal do anime mais esperado da estória. Se você for um fã de seiyuu e voice acting, a primeira metade que involve o slice of life e toda a descrição da carreira será muito bom, seguido de uma viagem suportável até o fim. Se for qualquer outra pessoa, a primeira metade será boa ou decente, e o resto insuportável ou arrastado. Curiosamente, Shirobako é um espelho de como Love Get Chu poderia ter sido se tivesse sido bem realizado. O fato de ser o male lead quem se declara no final e faz as coisas acontecerem é digna de nota. Suspeito que se o show fosse melhor realizado, talvez a mesma estória necessitasse apenas de 12 ou 13 episódios, e não 24 ( o último é um extra).  Depois desse show, o estúdio de Haibane faliu e virou o estúdio Seven, que produziu outro tipos de obras-primas, mas não deixa de ser um final triste e uma morte terrível.;Not Recommended
0;Love Forever;Muffed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Muffed;6;Hello, my fellow degenerates,  Today I bring you Love Forever, a hentai I want to forever never see again.  Story: Love Forever is about a girl dying and the boyfriend (our MC) forgetting who she is and slowly regaining his memories over the episode. He is suspected as the murderer as she was found dead in his room with him unconscious also in the room. He gains power from an angel to fight the demon who possessed his bestie who also fucked his gf in demon form I'm pretty sure.  Art: Actually the animation all around is pretty good. H scenes are good and the action parts are at least generic shounen quality. We even get to watch a character get fucking punched through the chest. Character models are good and backgrounds are nice.  Sound: VA work is good overall. Music is also good. Moans are a bit lacking though I'll be honest.  Character: No one is dislikable and the antagonists are fun to watch.  Overall: From a technical point it's good, but it starts out with a sex scene which I always hate because I need to get in the mood of the show first, which leaves one scene of a reasonable length to enjoy. Definitely fappable, but needs better moans.  With love, Muffed :3;Mixed Feelings

Also when it comes to a 5 or 6 showing for me they tend to be ones that i would not mind if it ended.  What else can i say without much in spoilers? hmm... If you want a one track line character story development you are out of luck. At least three different mini stories are involved. Would have been more visually appealing if they all connected but they don't.  censorship: some say that is what they enjoy most from this hentai field for this anime i didn't mind it.  people that may like it: hmmm.... if you are familiar with the jump style of young and the restless at least you won't be thrown for a loop.;Mixed Feelings

On the surface, before watching it I thought it was going to be ridiculous Ninja Slayer from Animation level bad but ironically funny. My initial impressions were entirely wrong.  Despite looking like it was created using PS1 graphics by a brain damaged monkey. I was surprised and found that despite having no dialogue, much sound or any text that a lot of the story, plot and lot development was conveyed in a intellectually ambiguous manner.  AND this is only a 2 1/2 minute ONA mind you. But it's dense and a lot of why the characters are doing what they are doing can be gleaned by careful analysis.  IMHO this goes beyond any inherent shock value of a horror anime it's art DAMMIT! It's deep and meaningful!;Recommended

Imagine how boring the world would be! You wouldn't have guessed that X happens in this anime. Though, with this being a Takena piece of media, you should have some knowledge that something dumb will happen, but not in a way you would have expected it exactly. I like weird things. They are unconventional. And as someone who isn't afraid to embrace weird, ludicrous, downright stupid stuff. I can say that ""Love Bites"" passes in all of those categories.

4;Love Bites;Pantherz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pantherz;10;"I am speechless...  As a huge fan of the anime ""Love Bites,"" I cannot recommend it enough. From the beautiful backgrounds to the lovely girl characters, this anime has it all.  Firstly, the backgrounds are truly magnificent. They are so beautifully crafted that it's almost impossible not to get distracted by them. The attention to detail is impressive, and it adds so much to the overall atmosphere of the anime. Each scene is set up so perfectly that it feels like you're actually there, living and breathing in that world.  Secondly, the girl characters are an absolute delight to watch. Their charm, charisma, and social skills are top-notch, and their overall pretty looks just add to the already immense character development. You can't help but feel attached to them and their stories.  But what really sets ""Love Bites"" apart is the storytelling. The director is a master at weaving together compelling and emotional narratives that keep you hooked from start to finish. Watching this film leaves you wanting more, and more, and more, and more, and it's all thanks to the director's creative vision.  I am so grateful to live in the same time frame as this revolutionary anime piece. The director is truly the best of all time and to ever grace this earth with their creative vision. ""Love Bites"" is just one example of the director's mastery, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.  In conclusion, ""Love Bites"" is a must-watch anime for anyone who loves beautiful backgrounds, lovely girl characters, and compelling storytelling. The attention to detail and character development is impressive, and the director is truly a genius at their craft. I cannot recommend this anime enough, and I urge you to give it a watch.

0;Love Bites;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;1;Rated a Solid 1 There was no spoke dialogue. Nor was there any imprinted.  The story was quite confusing. You the viewer have to determine it. From for example to what the note said down to what gender the character was reading the note. Granted some questions are answered later on but that is only a couple of them. I still have 10 or so unanswered. The story is never a success if the reader is left confused.

1;Love Bites;Fall;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fall;2;Love Bites is a 2 and a half minute ONA created by a YouTube user who goes by the name of taneka. Typically, he created claymation horror animations--this is one of his first ventures into MMD animation. Love Bites is a shock horror animation, and if you enjoy that type of thing, go for it. If you don't, ignore it. You're not missing out on much unless you fall in love with the guy's animations. Supposedly, his claymations were better in quality and creativity. I haven't had the opportunity to check said claymations out, so I can't give you a first-hand recommendation. I enjoyed this animation for the black humour aspect since I'm not into shock horror. The black humour is somewhat tasteful, but I don't want to glorify it too much. There's not a lot to say here, really. The art is bad, the animation is bad and the sounds are bad. However, they are endearingly bad...to an extent. Some of the lacklustre animation is (un?)intentionally hilarious, which added to my enjoyment. Story and characters are fields that don't apply to Love Bites.  Love Bites is a short animation that you can find on YouTube. If you're not adverse to poorly-animated and badly-rendered gore, you don't have much to lose.;Not Recommended
2;Love Bites;Chen_the_cat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chen_the_cat;1;This anime is an absolute blast! At first I thought that it would be bad as the animation looked bad but the story more than made up for it. This anime has more twists and turns than a twisty turny thing. It constantly keeps you on your toes throughout the entire 2 minute run time. The lack of sound makes it both a 0/10 and a 10/10 existing in 2 states as per the laws of quantum physics until it is observed and collapses in to one or the other. The characters were artfull in their humanity. I especially liked Kazuma who, whilst being a self insert MC, was also able to convey true depth.

Edit 2: That's still not long enough and I don't know what else to write. The video uses 3D animation, it looks awful and I'm not even sure that the assets are 100% original.

4;Love Bites;_cjessop19_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_cjessop19_;3;GOAT Takena strikes again.  This show perfectly encapsulates how a Dorodere character should be written, developed, and implemented into an anime. For those who don't know what a Dorodere is, it is a type of character who acts nice and sweet on the outside but are deeply disturbed from inside.  In this slice-of-life thriller horror series, we follow two nameless high school girls, where as the plot progresses, we see their true natures, which is truly outstanding as the show shines during their conflicts. Not being able to talk adds a layer of mystery and intensity, as their true personalities that could be heard through their voices are intentionally blocked to evoke those kinds of emotions for us viewers,  The thing I was surprised the most about this series is the major plot twists in the middle and towards the end, truly revolutionary and it's not often you see twists like that in shows that are in MAL's top 50. If you can move past and ignore the jarring PS1 CG graphics, this will be a blast to watch.  Overall, it's a must-watch series and I highly recommend it. I'll give this a 3/10;Not Recommended
0;Love Bitch: Yasashii Onna;TheAceAttorney;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAceAttorney;7;"On the surface level, another hentai about rape and bad people.  PLOT SYNOPSIS Chisato is basically in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend (Guy A), when another man enters the picture who appears to genuinely care about her (Guy B). Guy B walks in on them going at it in the bathroom, only to watch from the sidelines. Chisato gives Guy B the look, indicating to him that she knows he's watching and not doing anything. At the end of the scene, Guy A tells Guy B that he knows he was watching, and that he will screw her that night and there's nothing Guy B can do about it. Basically, Guy A does this to show he is the Alpha male. And Guy A goes through with this ""plan,"" and invites his friends over to gangbang, while he takes pictures and sends them to Guy B. Guy B can only despair, while he masturbates to the photographs. An unprecedented time shift occurs, where Chisato tells Guy B that Guy A broke it off with her. Guy B proceeds to confess his love to her, they get ""active,"" and then the hentai ends on a rather sinister note: Guy B briefly is displayed in the same light as Guy A was; i.e., someone who has power over Chisato. The hentai's closing words come from none other than Chisato: ""I've found another.""   ANALYSIS These are the takeaways you can get from this hentai:  1) As soon as someone gains power (in this case, Guy B), they will drop all preconceived surface attitudes and become those they stole power from (Guy A)  2) For those of you who are unaware, a femme fatale ""Fatal Woman"" is a character trope which refers to a woman who utilizes her sexuality in order to gain power/to accomplish her goals. I make the case that Chisato, IS such a femme fatale. Think about it. Assuming that Guy A was in a similar position to Guy B, before becoming the Alpha male, it makes perfect sense. She plays the act of a submissive woman seeking to use the innocent men around her in order to satisfy her sexual urges. The line ""I've found another,"" seems to all but confirm this. She's found another what? She's found another victim. Another male to ruin.";Recommended
1;Love Bitch: Yasashii Onna;Pablo_ibo2x;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pablo_ibo2x;9;Even if the title says Love bitch but believe me this hentai is not really about a bitch. So to start this review I have to say first that this review is not going to be long since it's only one episode and the episode is only 16 minutes long. I discoverd this Hentai while I was searching for related anime's to aisai nikki for my website(sites.google.com/view/yax-yamikage) and when I first saw it I thought it's gonna be a high school love shit or anything like that. But it wasn't I might say that this is the only hentai that might give a dramatic feeling (discode a futanari hentai is also dramatic). But what I think of this hentai is that it's a lesson to females, what I mean is that females should not trust every boy around her. An d that is something very important in this hentai. Anyway I think this Hentai is actually good and here is why............. Story I might give the story a 7 or 8 out of 10, And I really mean it! The story has a good beginning and a good ending even tho it's only one episode and the episode is 16 minutes long. It really teachs you something and it is FUCCING HOT. It's fap material even tho I didn't masturbate while I was watching it, but I really loved it. And this is one of the few hentais that doesn't have a lot of dialogues. I mean they do have dialogues while they are having sex but when they aren't they don' talk too much or too long and that is what a lot of people desire, because most of the people are watching it to fap. but I didn't watch it to fap I think of hentai more as ART than just animated porn and that is why I would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 because they could have told us more about the story. And all what I saw was people orgasm. Art/ animation I watched the uncensored version btw. I would give the art and animation a 10 out of 10 because as I mention before all the scenes were just people orgasm. So we did get to see a good animation. Sound I don't have a lot of things to say about the sound because who the fucc cares about the anime opening or ending. But because I wanted to write a review so I checked the opening and ending. The opening was FUCCING good and the sound was also good. The voice acting was really good I mean Ookubo, Aiko did a great job so I would give the sound a 8 out of 10 which is pretty good. Character Because it's only one episode long and only 16 minutes long we only saw a few characters and know only two names of them ''sato and chisato. I would give the Character a 6 out 10 (chisato a 1897265 out of 10) Enjoyment I really did enjoy it! I would give the enjoyment a 9 out of 10. Overall A 8 or 9 out of 10. I know it is high but for the animation and story and the lesson that it had for females made it a 8 or 9(I am a boy btw) And that's it thank you so much!

The light at the end of the tunnel one could say does not apply here. Story is rushed. The intro rather than having a proper this is so and so jumps straight to the action. The overall plot is basic. Once screwed always screwed. Has no more meat than that. It doesn't cover all main sides. there is three characters. And only two of them are covered.  Art Characters are nicely drawn. No skipping on background. Transition are nice but could be improved slightly.  Character Very solo based. What i mean is if you bought bread you are happy because you can get a dozen or so sandwiches from it. Imagine there was just enough bread for a sand which. yes, you get what you wanted but you could have gotten more. Depends on your preference i guess. Already hinted at lack of background on characters. Given that it forces to ask why?  Enjoyment If you don't mind darkness and selfish attitude by all means enjoy.

0;Love All Play;KANLen09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KANLen09;4;"Love All, No Play. Piss off.  To wait more than a decade for a relatively unknown and underground work to get adapted, I really question who was in the right mind to green-light this project, given that there were already better alternatives like Liden Films's repertoire of badminton anime. This is novelist Asami Koseki's only work that was in Poplar Publishing (which publishes very old kids IPs from the 90s to the late 2000s) that was seralized from 2011 to 2014, and I'm just gonna assume that the sales figures for this were decent to OK (since it's ""big"" enough to get an anime adaptation), or is that some big shot wanted to see this come to fruition, and such is the case of Love All Play here. The only problem: Liden Films has redefined what to expect for badminton anime going forward with Hanebado! and Ryman's Club, and animation prowess certainly beats story elements to a point where the current trend has been stuck ever since.  Love All Play presents itself as your sterotypical school sport, chock full of characters that are meant to grow on you as the series progressed from start to finish, and in the space of 24 episodes covering the entirety of the 4-volume novel (which is best assumed since this is a one-and-only job), it certainly has done that. The issue is that why is this only released now is just as baffling, as if it was released right at the tailgate of the novel's end in 2014 would be just about perfect to have an anime adaptation on it, but given how long this took to get one, I would assume that it's the connection to the recent Tokyo Olympics (which sure isn't the case) to then finally have a use case for this anime to come out, it sure was ""years in the making"" that got stale when it came out, and staying the same when it finishes this season. And even if it was released in the past, it would've been doomed from the start to be largely forgotten in time to come.  Just about the only good part of the show was in its characters, which in their portrayal, were actually period-correct to the time when the novel came out: the bunch of newbies entering high school for the first time, being rookies at a sport for the first time, hanging out with friends and family, and especially the matches which help everyone progress a step further. And to be fair, this is old-school storytelling at its finest, though these days people (even myself) don't really care for the allure of the oldies and classics, unless if it's a well-regarded one (e.g. Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura (All Stars) next season). And here to tag the story is the new group of rookies with Ryo Mizushima, Shohei Sakaki, Koki Matsuda, Taichi and Yuji Higashiyama, and Akira Uchida, the 6 newbies who found themselves being chosen by their school Yokohama Minato's badminton team, going through the normal pacing of practice after practice to improve and make themselves useful in making their school a household name from the ashes of sunkenness. Oh, and also enjoy their youth. I do find that the badminton team seniors, mostly Kento Yusa and Yusuke Yokokawa are both an annoying dirtbag and a respectful Senpai respectively, though overtime they do show well of their camaraderie with one another that's been in the works since they joined the badminton team. But the whole love interest section of the boys being cheered on by their classmates which raises the aspects of romance, while that is also period-correct to the setting, it unfortunately becomes a sore sight that I'd wish the focus went onto the actual badminton instead of the slice-of-life elements. But then again, this is school life at its most humble, so it's there. And most certainly is the whole ""school goddess"" thing of Ryo's sister Rika being the flower worth only the attention of Yusa. Again, no faults there, it's just how everything is brought up in the dailyness of school life.  If this anime came out in the mid-2010s, then Nippon Animation and OLM's Team Yoshioka's collab would've served a nice niche since there wasn't anything to compare to at the time. But this is the 2020s, and it looks awfully outdated by today's standards with such a lack of emphasis on the badminton segments, which is the core function of the show. Even the OST sounds unimpressive at best (though I loved the 1st Cour's OP, that was really nice coming from composers from sumika).  It's all-in or go home. Wholesome camaraderie aside in a competitive sports show that exists only on the school level, there's just not much going for Love All Play now, and I'm willing to bet that this show would be easily forgotten, both in its source novel and the anime in time to come, which is never a shame. What's a shame is that I felt like I've wasted 6 months of time watching this mid-tier show that should've came out a pretty long time ago, and then only to be left in its forgotten state. It's just boring by today's standards, and I want my precious time back.";Not Recommended
0;Love 2 Quad;Mazohisuto;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mazohisuto;8;When you read the synopsis of Love 2 Quad then actually go and watch the show, the only reaction you’ll have is “Huh?”. You will experience the purest, unadulterated form of confusion as you start the show, hoping for some sort of explanation halfway through but you keep marching forward and by the end you still have no idea what is going on. I was going to play the visual novel so I could provide the viewers of this hentai with some reprieve and quench that curiosity as to what the hell the story is actually about however I am sad to say that I could not find an English translated version of the visual novel. However disregarding the absolute lack of story in the show, the pacing and visuals were still onpoint with some of the greatest voice acting I’ve ever witnessed from a hentai.  Story : 4  The synopsis provided on hanime.tv shapes this hentai out to be some wacky time travel mystery organization fighting an out of this world enemy adventure however we barely get any of that from the hentai. Even within the first episode, we are just thrust into the thick of it with two characters we are never formally introduced to with the “flashback introduction” creating even more confusion. By the second episode, you will definitely feel like you’re not supposed to be watching this, as if you had randomly clicked on the 14th episode of a 25 episode story-driven show with nods to characters and past situations that the show is expecting you to know. While this may work for the fans of the original visual novel, for the unfamiliar this all comes off as a hentai with just a trace of storytelling put into it jumping from character to character. So unless you actually played the visual novel, then this hentai will be just downright confusing.  Art and Animation : 8  Now as I mentioned in the introduction, while you may not understand what the hell is going on as you ferociously beat your meat, at least you’ll have a good time not understanding what the hell is going on. Visually this is definitely an above-average hentai and once again shows how older hentai was visually superior to what has come out in recent times. From the character expressions, backgrounds and animations nothing feels ‘budget’ and it never takes away from the experience which is what I believe visuals in hentai should aim for. It isn’t like I don’t want some ufotable UNLIMITED BUDGETWORKS type of hentai but if we’re being realistic the artstyle and animation should at least not detract from the hentai watching experience and Love 2 Quad’s art and animation do not disappoint.  Characters : 7.5  The characters along with the voice-acting were truly the highlight of the fap for me. While I often gush about a hentai being able to convey great character development efficiently given the nature of hentai running for few episodes where most of their screentime consists of fucking or being fucked, this show has some truly spectaculary VAs that brought the characters to life. While contextually I was lost, every moment with Honoka or Ermalit helped build a strong image of who these characters were, how they related to our MC. We were able to see, in Ermalit’s case, the struggle manifested within her psyche that our MC somehow saved her from which shows her true feelings towards him. We see towards the final act how this comes full circle as she expresses her deeper feelings towards MC-kun and lets down the walls she held up from some unknown past trauma. In Honoka’s case, much like Ermalit’s tsundere archetype, we are treated to a great incarnation of that beloved younger sister archetype we all know and love. In both girls' cases, there isn’t one outright thing that makes these things special but rather it is a slow burn build up where the characters aren’t special, rather we find value in the sum of the parts. Every little thing they do, from how they speak, how they act, how their inner monologues go slowly builds a beloved character in our mind that differentiates from the moulds these characters are initially cut from. All the silly things Honoka does, how she treats MC-kun with this feeling of unease and trepidation at losing him, how she fapped with his boxers over her head. In all that hilarity, we find something not quite relatable but still endearing in an imouto, so while he does fuck her and I wouldn’t do that in reality, you come out with this adoration for the smol imouto who is trying her absolute best and you can’t really fault her for that can you?  Voice Acting Performance : 10  (Ok I know they aren’t siblings but they give off a bro-sis dynamic so just go with it)  So while there was great character execution, I’m not quite ready to give it an amazingly high rating because much of that character comes through in the voice acting and boy is this one high class affair. Both main female character VAs poured their everything into this performance and you can just feel it as you get such a strong image of these characters from their very first line of dialogue. With Ermalit, you are introduced to her with a cold, masochistic line oozing with her very disgust for you yet you can feel it isn’t quite as harsh as it first appears. Layers and layers of the character are prevalent in each line of dialogue and as we unpackage that complex performance then does it become so brilliant. At no point does Ermalit sell some utter hatred of you, in fact you know that she does like you quite a great deal yet if you look at it from a surface level that is nowhere to be seen. Yet when she has a bad dream, in one line you sense her vulnerability and like a perfect embodiment of a tsundere, the VA is able to snap between those two sides seamlessly without it feeling unnatural.  While casually browsing the anime’s page this, the reason why she was voiced so well becomes all too apparent. There, like a rare gemstone, I saw it “Hiromi Igarashi”, an actual VA’s name. Such a rare sight to see a VA who has done other non-hentai works being in things as big as Overlord and Isekai Quartet to the legendary Oni Chichi franchise’s leading lady. Obviously she, unlike some voice actors (yes I’m looking at you Daisuke Hirakawa voice of epic gamer Kakyoin who voiced Tamotsu from Boku no Pico), actually isn’t ashamed to voice a hentai and thus she is able to put a great deal of passion into her voice acting performance no matter the medium.  On the other side of the spectrum, we have an uncredited VA who voiced little sister Honoka or better known as “The rapper Eminem is too afraid to diss” because she’s spitting out more words per minute than Twista (ok I don’t know anything about rap I googled “fastest rapper” and this is what came out). This is initially what inspired me to watch this hentai as I saw a clip of Rap God Imouto over here and I just had to watch it and for me it is pretty fucking funny but it also helps convey her timid nature and how she’s always trying to please her MC-kun. When she’s with him clearly her mind is going a mile a minute and all she can think about is to please the person she loves most in the world. These are probably two of the best voice acting performances I have ever encountered in my hentai journey.  Enjoyment : 8  I thoroughly enjoyed this show, it has great characters, great animation, great art and some top notch voice acting. All that’s holding it back is that I have no idea what the hell is going on and I wish I could help but I don’t speak a lick of Japanese and couldn’t find an English version of the VN. I’ve already gushed about the voice acting but that alone should get you to watch the show as it is also genuinely quite funny with some absurd scenes like MC-kun getting a girl off using the built-in bidet while Honoka just watches. This is a pretty solid watch if you don’t mind not knowing what is going on in the overarching story but it's a wholehearted recommendation from me.;Recommended
0;Love 2 Quad;Kiba_Snowpaw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kiba_Snowpaw;9;"Greetings once again, my dear packmates! It's your favorite fur-ocious critic, Kiba Snowpaw, back with another exhilarating anime review. I have been roaming the wild worlds of anime, manga, and gaming since the '80s, so I know my way around the snowy landscapes of this realm quite well.  Today, I am howling about a series that, I must admit, has a risqué element. It's called ""Love2Quad,"" and it's one anime that, while filled with steamy, explicit scenes, delivers much more than just erotic content. So let's tuck into this, my fellow wolves, but remember, this one is for the adults in our pack.  Now, I must say, I don't typically delve into the hentai genre, but this anime caught my attention and piqued my curiosity with its interesting blend of romance, comedy, and erotica. It's akin to encountering a rabbit during a hunt, and it turns out to be a shape-shifting fox in disguise. What an adventure, am I right?  First off, let's talk about the characters, the heart of any good story. At the center, we have Ermalit and her boyfriend Toudou. Their dynamic, which starts off as a bit aloof but physically intense, evolves into a deeper bond. It's like watching two lone wolves circling each other before finally howling together under the same moon.  Ermalit is an intriguing mix of some well-known characters. She is petite like Saber from ""Fate Stay Night,"" yet voluptuous like Sena Kashiwazaki from ""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai."" She's not just eye candy either. Her character provides moments of humor, charm, and boldness that shine through, making her an engaging heroine.  Toudou, on the other hand, seems pretty average at first. He plays along with Ermalit's antics but, as the story unfolds, shows a more tender, caring side. He’s like that lone wolf who finds his way back to the pack and proves to be a faithful companion. He may not be the most alpha male, but he brings balance to their relationship.  Now onto the story itself. It's like trying to track a deer on fresh snow – a bit hard to follow. Still, it revolves around the couple's sexual life, which has an intriguing mystical element to it. It seems their passionate encounters power up Ermalit for an unseen battle. A curious concept, indeed!  The art and animation are truly noteworthy. The shading, the facial expressions, the attention to detail in the character designs - all of these aspects make it visually pleasing. It's like watching a picturesque snowfall at dawn. A truly breathtaking sight!  Voice acting? Top-notch. Ermalit's voice has a unique blend of warm yet sexy tones, a pleasant break from the high-pitched screams we often hear in this genre. It's as satisfying as the sound of crunching snow under your paws on a quiet winter night. Ah, music to my ears!  Sound effects, however, are subtle. While this might disappoint those of you expecting loud, juicy noises, it allows for more appreciation of the dialogues and characters' voices.  When it comes to censorship, it's there but quite minimal, giving you a peek-a-boo effect, allowing your imagination to fill in the blanks.  The story offers several steamy scenes, each unique and enticing. However, be warned, my furry friends, some might find certain elements a tad uncomfortable. The highlight for me? When Ermalit unzips Toudou's pants with her foot. That's some clawsome dexterity!  Despite its erotic elements, Love2Quad is not devoid of humor. There's this loli character, Chitose, who provides much-needed comic relief. It's like a wild hare suddenly popping up during a serious pack meeting.  Sadly, there are a few shortcomings too. One scene ends abruptly, and some might find the sensual pace a bit tedious. It’s like chasing your tail, expecting a thrilling hunt but ending up going in circles.  Yet, with all its ups and downs, Love2Quad has left an imprint in the snowy landscape of anime. It's tastefully sensual, subtly powerful, and has a unique charm that's hard to resist. Therefore, I give it a proud 9 out of 10 paws up!  So, my fellow wolves, if you enjoy a unique blend of romance, comedy, and sensual scenes with cute and likeable heroines, then ""Love2Quad"" is worth a howl. Just remember to keep an open mind and don't let the explicit elements deter you from enjoying the story.  Until next time, keep your paws warm and your spirits high! This is Kiba Snowpaw, signing off with a heartfelt howl to the moon. Stay frosty, my friends!";Mixed Feelings
1;Love 2 Quad;inuyashaxears;https://myanimelist.net/profile/inuyashaxears;6;"Overall 6: It's a good show so long as you don't care about the premise and either like or don't mind looking at dicks. I don't fall into either of those categories and therefore didn't like the show. This show honestly made me wonder if it was targeted at girls due to the number of dick shots.  Enjoyment 3: This is what dropped my rating. A dick on my screen is a turn off. This show has a dick on the screen at least as much as it has a naked part of a woman on screen. I rarely got the desire to fap and, when I did get the desire, they quickly threw in a closeup on the guy's dick to kill my boner.  Story 5: It is said that there is a battle going on, but that can be ignored. Episode 1 features a guy and his girlfriend who acts like a sadist but wants to be dominated. Episode 2 features the same guy, but this time with his lustful sister who talks quickly and often. the closest thing this show has to a story is demonstrating the girls' personalities.  Art 8: I felt this was better then most hentai. For instance, the censor was more accurately formed to the necessary parts, the skin was smooth, and nothing stood out as bad art.  Sound 7: The voice actors were good. However, the girls were given extensive lines during the sex which meant there was more of them talking than them moaning. The girls also matched the scene which led to a girl with her mouth covered having a muffled voice.  Character 8: The guy was unremarkable; his soul purpose was to have a hard on and accept sex. Girl A was bipolar in whether she wanted to be dominant or submissive. Girl B was more of gag character in how much lust she has and how embarrassed she got over her brother's dick.";Mixed Feelings
0;Loups=Garous;Usachan88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Usachan88;9;I'd like to clear up a few things about Loups=Garous. First of all, I'm 99% sure Kono Ayumi (the blue-black haired character with short hair and yellow eyes) is a boy, not a girl--because he is always referred to as a guy in the movie. (But Wikipedia, My Anime List, and I think even the back of the DVD case say different, so don't quote me on that--but I'm pretty positive that if they talk about him as a 'him,' then he's a boy) Secondly, everyone has given harsh reviews and scores about Loups=Garous. When I started watching the movie, I based it on the 6's people would score it as. But I found that I really enjoyed the movie--the characters (apart from the main heroine, Makino Hazuki, who is extremely frustrating and very very useless) were very likable. If we say that Kono Ayumi is a boy, then he's super attractive (in a reserved kind of way.) Tsuzuki Mio is a hacker genius and consistently hilarious. Rei Myao (her name sounds like 'meow,' how can you not like her?) is a tsundere-fighter. Yabe Yuko, one of the victims, is sort of a non-character. Nothing much to say there. The art is different from most animes, but the facial structure and the eyes are still wonderful to look at. A great quality about Loups=Garous's plot is that it's understandable (not like The Place Promised in Our Early Days, which got great reviews but I couldn't understand--violins, numbers, airplanes...WHAT IS GOING ON?!) The audience can easily follow along with the ideas and clues given out as the story progresses, but they still have to do a little legwork and put the pieces together. The story progresses quickly and has some interesting factors--like a dance routine and a twisted screen-based society. Maybe this kind of movie isn't for everyone, but I hope that my review has convinced you to try it out with a more positive outlook!;Recommended
1;Loups=Garous;jimb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jimb;10;"This was the best i've seen. I love the theme of needing to communicate above all else. There is a valid world of schoolkids and an organised society with bizarre elements that don't need a total plot to create. Great voices in the dub, I certainly watched the boy ""kono"" as a boy and would find it helpful and downgrade it if he really is just a girl they call a boy. imo. Lovely and then a real adventure which probably is not bad for the young but i've no children to be saying this. However as in a child or adult life death is a threat then to realise it in a dramatic way where the children have volition instead of just crazy superpowers is worthwhile and there is the larger story of group bonding and individual learning that is an enhancement of the character of each of them.";Recommended
2;Loups=Garous;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;rate of 7 (good) seen via english dubbed  Have you ever wondered given the rise of technology would life be improved if life was entirely monitored? that concept and more is asked and answered in a regard in this film. As the movie unfolds some aspects you can deduce others you have not been give the full picture too. While the rest leaves you curious even when the movie had ended. For example is their a male kid lead or is there not? the answer could go either way. Or, was that place mentioned in flashback in the end a true statement for that place and that time?  Alas what held back a higher rating? the answer is lack of follow through. There was two endings in my eyes why they extended it i am not sure. Their extend version did solve anything new.  a helpful piece of information the wolf mentioned in the intro is not a werewolf. Some might say i spoiled it but i disagree. One can not say i told you something when it had no part in the movie at all. there is another form on the word wolf is all i am saying.;Recommended
3;Loups=Garous;Faylicia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Faylicia;7;I really enjoyed Loups-Garous but the story was extremely confusing and it had lots of gaps and that kind of annoyed me (so I got the book). Story: The story is very intriguing and interesting but after some point things are just going too fast and a lot of information is merged into just one scene. Therefore many things don't make much sense and end up being very confusing. Art: There wasn't anything exceptional about the art. I wonder if a more realistic art would have suited the script better but I really liked the character design. Sound: I personally don't know much about sound but I thought it was good. There wasn't anything very memorable about other than the ending though. Character: I really liked the characters in this movie. I found them very quite interesting actually. They all had some unique characteristic about them even though their personality was rather stereotypical. The main character though, Hazuki was quite different. Many people might find her annoying but I actually sympathized with her, she was standoffish, confused and didn't do much in the progress of the movie but I though that she matured throughout the story. Moreover, I think that she is portrayed in a very realistic way as a girl living in that society, in those circumstances and having the problems that she has. Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the movie but I believe that the creators failed to recreate the story in the book in an understandable way. However that could simply be because of the limited time of the movie. I think the story should have been split in two or even three movies.;Recommended
0;Loups=Garous;LucidFilms;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LucidFilms;6;What to say what to say. First I hope that you guys can forgive my English since it's not my native language.  The anime:  As I read the synopsis I was thrilled, it felt like an awesome idea. But as soon as the anime started it started differently as the synopsis said it would. Well I kept watching and got a bit annoyed by the main characters. Hazuki is really insecure and not even funny, sexy or cute. I had no resemblance to her in any way. The other characters were boring, not even interesting. Myao is that typical anime girl who fights and kicks ass but we know nothing about her while Mio is the typical screaming attention girl who has probably a interesting history but we don't know anything about that. And then we have the silent scary female witch really looks like a guy Ayumi. Ayumi is boring not even interesting, you won't get any dept from her. You don't know why she lives alone and who she is. Witch really annoys me. Overall the main characters are weird and form a boring group as they try to find who the murderer is.  During the story we see a system that observes the everyday life of people, the first thing about this concept what bugs me is. Why do the people need this? There has been some kind of virus but there is actually no information about this virus. In the entire movie there isn't once mentioned why this system is what it is. Witch leaves a big gap in the plot of the anime.  What annoyed me even more was how little we see of the world they live in. We see the same street like 4 times and they always meet at the same place also I'm really confused about the everyday life of those people. Let me just say that it doesn't give you the satisfaction it leaves you with questions about this phenomenon.  The story itself started of interesting, there has been a couple of murders and there is a little twist at the beginning. But during the story it gets really obvious who the culprit is. It even get's so obvious that you start looking in the least obvious way. The whole reason why the murders are happening is vague and well even sick but not in the twisted way we like blood and gore no but in a really sick and not even awesome way.  What annoyed me the most was the character Mio, how can a girl at the age of I don't know 12? Hack a entire system. She is a computer nerd who lives in a different district (why they have poor and wealthy districts is unclear and how this city they live in works isn't explained) and is able to hack into police records and street views etc. We get to see so many people and so many events but yet almost non of it is explained. The main story line builds up pretty nice the first half hour. But after that it is just boring. And it even gets more boring, the ending is so lame and stupid that your glad it only took 1.5hours to get there.  Doesn't this anime have any good features? Of course it does, the music is nice not special but I liked the rock and the songs they played. Story is boring although it starts interesting. The art is nicely done, I have seen better art, but the art job sure wasn't bad. Enjoyment? although the beginning was nice it later on began to become a real bore.  Verdict: Well I can't really recommend anyone this anime. There isn't enough blood and gore, or a really scary thriller storyline to enjoy. It isn't sexy or funny. It's just another anime movie. I give the anime a 6, since they got my attention the first half hour and the art and music were nice. The characters were boring but that isn't the biggest let down, the storyline is such a let down that it ruins the entire anime. What could of been a awesome anime with a great concept, turned into something predicable and lame at the same time.  This anime is a big bore but if you have nothing better to do and you don't have any hopes up for this anime, it can be decent to watch.  Cheers Lucid;Mixed Feelings
1;Loups=Garous;vanmarckestevy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vanmarckestevy;6;Saw this on Production I.G.'s work list for 2010 and got curious. The story revolves around 3 young girls and a teenager caught in a world where monitor's have replaced real contact (not entirely). Hazuki (One of the young girls) has a Communication dissorder. Another young girls calls herself loups=garous,another is a pretty good hacker and the teenager is a fighting machine. And this is where the anime movie goes wrong You can't just put ideas together without a coherent story. The emotions are there,the action too, the characters (undeveloped), the setting , but it just doesn't add up to a whole. Very dissapointing. The loups=garous itself is an easy way of wrapping it up but the beast has no content. Good to pass the time but barely one layer of interesting stuff Why does production I.G. lend it's name to this?;Mixed Feelings
2;Loups=Garous;BlaizeV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlaizeV;5;Loups=Garous has an interesting enough premise but when the back of the Blu Ray case gives more setup and back story than the film does then you know there are going to be issues.  Supposedly this film is set in a future that after a virus decimates the population those who remain live in a society where their every move is monitored and even contact with close family members is done through computers. Commuting out of the house is normally reserved exclusively to a trip to and from a numbered community centre. I’m pretty sure the virus isn’t mentioned at all in the actual film itself.  The film is quite slow paced and surprisingly lacking tension. The plot should be interesting but is developed with such little fanfare it just felt like it was going through the motions. In a big brother society, where people only communicate online and where even the police cannot gain your full trust you’d think seeing our main characters venturing out at night against the rules to meet and in the process trying to get to the bottom of a murder case that threatens to take them out one by one would be quite gripping. So it’s astounding really with a plot like that this film felt so plain and frankly occasionally boring for the majority of it’s running time. It's not helped by the fact the characters all feel flat and lifeless, I didn’t connect with any of them.  The animation style is quite peculiar, occasionally I questioned to myself if I was watching a Flash animation, albeit a very well polished one. The character design was strange and cheap looking, the eyes especially were just dead.  In the end it built up to something that left very little impression, The main villain is revealed to have a damn dark secret but it again was revealed in a shock lacking manner. Dramatic change to the world has apparently occurred before the ending credits but that change isn’t exactly apparent. Like I mentioned the film goes through the motions and simply ends. Moments that should have been quite dramatic weren’t, the final showdown was over before it begun.  It’s just a plainly executed thriller, the potential is there and that kept me watching, It’s not terrible but it just leaves little to no impact on you.;Mixed Feelings
3;Loups=Garous;WeiWeiWei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WeiWeiWei;5;"Ok... I guess it's kinda because i'm writing a review many years after the anime aired, but still it was 2010! (...) I can't help but feel disappointed... Because I have ""survived"" many older series that had better plot, soundtracks, art etc.  So when i started to read the wikipedia page about Loups=Garous it felt like an awesome anime. But the film doesn't mention viruses, an dystopic world or a post-apocalyptic one, you have to read the synopsis to realise that they are living in a ""dystopic world where their faces must be covered"" I didn't feel anything special about the characters, even though they met each other in person, i couldn't see anything from their facial expression that indicated that meetings like that was something unusual/ forbidden! The film was quite slow and didn't felt like a mystery, thriller or something ""dark."" Instead the atmosphere was kinda happy, with cute ""mascots"" and pretty girls x) The biggest problem i guess about the characters is that they don't start to evolve, i guess they are quite static, the main character can't do anything and always just stands there/ sits down -.- They don't have any depths, we don't know anything about their background... Sure we get a flashback, but it's still quite vague.. The only thing that i really liked was the ""sound,"" perhaps it's because of the rocking soundtracks x)";Mixed Feelings
4;Loups=Garous;angelorchid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelorchid;6;"The premise for the movie is compelling but the actual execution of it was not. The events didn't really seem to flow smoothly together and it felt like a lot of things were missing or unexplained, which left me confused and unsure of what the plot was. The supporting characters felt sort of one-dimensional, like they each had only one defining character trait, and the protagonist Makino didn't seem to have any character traits at all; it seemed like she was only there to tag along instead of having a clear role.  After reading the book that it was based on, I think the biggest mistake that the movie makers make was trying to adapt such a long book by cramming the contents into such a short time. The movie's art, soundtrack, and voice actors were nice so it's really disappointing how much it is dragged down by the amount of plot and characterization that is missing. The movie is is okay but I think it would have done better if they had tried adapting it into episodes instead.";Mixed Feelings
0;Loups=Garous;hazardousbacon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hazardousbacon;2;This is the worst anime movie I have ever seen. Character motivations make no sense, the story just meanders and it all falls extremely flat. I finished the movie literally less than 5 minutes ago from writing this and i am struggling to remember what happened. The whole 'killing children' premise is laughable, with motives being weak, and the original plot point being dropped almost immediately for a boring stereotypical villain, with their dialogue being 100% exposition. The only moment I enjoyed was towards the end, when the villain was silenced in an unintentionally laughable manner. Not worth anyone's time, effort or money. It really is a shame. There is a really good premise at the heart of this film, but it does everything in its power to ruin it.;Not Recommended
1;Loups=Garous;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;3;"Animated by Studio I.G. which is superb when it comes to making science fiction settings. They rarely create likable characters though; they feel like robots or generic puppets most of the time. It worked fine for Ghost in the Shell but it is iffy in all the rest. Directed by Fujisaki Junichi, whose only other work was Blood+. Not much to say about him, other than he likes to direct dark and violent shows with schoolgirls.  The setting is the only interesting thing I can find in the whole film. It has to do with a future society where peace has been established and the time when people had to kill other people, or even animals for food, is now just a thing of history. There are some though who still commit atrocious acts; they wear masks and are called wolves. So basically we have the heroes, who grew up in a constantly monitored, secured and almost robotically emotionless world full of fancy hi-teck gadgets, suddenly being pitted against a violent society of unregistered people and murderous beasts from a world that was supposed to now be long gone. It is interesting to see these opposite ways of life in a conflict.  And this is where all the positives stop since all the rest is one big mess. Here is the horrid black list of the things I disliked.  1) So here you are watching this film waiting for cool stuff to happen and in just a few minutes WHAM the harsh reality hits you in the face. All the main characters are part of the plague that kills modern anime: Moe schoolgirls. Damn what a drag, they killed the mood. Sure, having cute / frail / innocent girls going through an emotional hell before getting all horrified and bloody may sound like an instant hook for most casual viewers but it has been done SO many times that now it’s just ridiculous. Plus, the characterization is almost always close to zero as moe is nothing but simplistic personalities and squeaky voices. And indeed, with only one movie worth of duration none of the characters have the time to be anything other than generic moe schoolgirls. They don’t even change clothes when they are not at school for Pete’s sake.  2) The foreground artwork, and especially the character designs, is lazy. Apart from being mostly overused caricatures of schoolgirls, there is also very little to no details on them. The visual effects on computers and gadgets are cool but the characters have no interesting uniforms, no complicating facial structure and barely any shading or lightening on their bodies. That makes them look like a lifeless-looking gag manga. I mean just look at those lazily drawn faces!  3) The soundtrack is full of girly J-pop that nobody will give a damn about. Where is my epic chorus / synthesizer music you bastards? This is a sci-fi movie!  4) The dialogues felt really artificial. The moe girls constantly repeat the questions as if they don’t understand anything and need to spend most of the duration in breaking the fourth wall just to explain how some common-knowledge issues to them need elaboration. It felt totally retarded. And sure, it fits to have a bunch of oblivious cute girls being gaga with everything but it doesn’t make the plot any better. Here you have an elaborate sci-fi setting that would normally be full of complicating notions and what you get is a bunch of dumb girls going “Duh, food? Duh, mystery? Duh, hacking? Duh, kidnap?” For 90 minutes!  5) The plot is retarded. You just have no idea why something happens the way it does and not in a more logical way. - People are kidnapped and the police don’t even know they are missing for weeks, despite having security cameras in every room and road, and despite everybody having a GPS signal on them. You would at least assume the teachers or the parents or the eye witnesses would report to the police how some of the people they know haven’t shown up for weeks or that they saw them being attacked. And no, you get squat! How the devil is this society working if they have so many security systems and yet they can’t do the simplest thing? How did they even reach to such a blissful state if a common kidnaper can do anything he likes and nobody will report him? - A bunch of dumb schoolgirls who are bored of their boring controlled lives are otherwise outsmarting the system and deal with all sorts of mysteries and criminals by just walking around and making a few simple questions. You can’t believe how retarded it feels to have such characters being fifty times more effective than the otherwise awesomely controlled status quo. And as usual, you have no bloody idea of why they never inform the police or anyone else for what they discover that can endanger the lives of millions. - You also have no idea of what is going on with the storyline. You see a girl being attacked but saved at the last moment. Yet in the exact next scene, she is kidnapped for no obvious reason. And when they finally save her for the second time, they let her recover in an open remote bedroom for a week, while they are practicing a teen band song for kicks. Ain’t they scared in the least for what the hell just happened? Why didn’t they tell anyone about it? What are the police doing all this time? How did the movie swift from horror / sci-fi / mystery to a fluffy K-On clone? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Wait, now the girl is attacked for the third time? So much for being more cautious you dumb girl! And then more attacks and stuff that make no sense. I can go on forever with how terrible the storyboard is. Especially the ending where the motives of the villains are revealed. God, what a shitty asspull was that? - What is even dumber than all that is how the whole fuss was resolved by just one character who was just killing anyone getting in its way. Everybody else was just a stunt and eventually useless to the plot; all it took was to take a knife and start killing anything that moved. Thank you very much for the cheap way out and the trashing of the rest of the already generic cast. And the funniest part? Said character was not even the protagonist. The protagonist was in the contrary the most useless of all the moe girls who did absolutely nothing other than crying and running away in the whole damn film.  One of the shittiest anime movies of recent times and a shame to the already large bad roster of I.G. titles.  And now for some excused scorings.

0;Lost Universe;kawaiimisato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kawaiimisato;9;Meet the reincarnations of Lina Inverse (if you dont know who that is, you are behind the times) and some of the crew from the good old days of slayers.  Lost universe is not related to slayers, that is, except for name similarities and personality parallels.  This show is a comical space adventure revolving around three characters who are mercenaries more or less. In the show they are called Contractors i believe, they go around taking jobs so they can feed themselves.  There isn't really a plot in the beginning but as you get into more, secrets are revealed and plot comes out. dont expect a wowing plot, this show is for entertainment and a good time.  The animation is very good, and the use of CGI mixed in is done very well. The style is very typical anime.  Unfortunately i have only seen the dub version, but the voices are actually well matched and they did a good job. Although Millie can get annoying at times.  The characters are all very likable, they will definitely grow on you and you get some depth out of them, but not a whole lot. The farther in you go, the more serious things get from tone to actually story, but there is always room for the comic relief.  The ideas and concepts of the show are all very cool and interesting, the show just doesn't utilize them for an epic space show. despite that, this show is very good, if you liked slayers, you will definitely like this.;Recommended
1;Lost Universe;DueTomorrow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DueTomorrow;8;I picked this up after seeing the original Japanese intro several years ago and gave this a shot. Like most people, I saw this after seeing Slayers, Next, and Try.  This actually does take place in a similar (if not the same) universe as Slayers, with most of the voice cast also being the same. Not surprisingly, a lot of the humor style was the same but there was a lot more emphasis on an underlying story which is emphasized more later. It reminded me a bit of a Slayers Next style where bits and pieces are planted here and there while hijicks run awry...at least until near the end. One thing Lost Universe does better than Slayers though is it shows more sides to the characters.  The main characters are pretty well rounded out, except Millie but most of what you need to know happens later anyway. You start feeling for some of the characters though, and by the end of the series I starting getting kind of attached to some of the characters. The antagonists on the other hand range from dull to pretty messed up.  One big determining factor of how much a series impacts me is the ending. Lost Universe does a great job cleaning up all the loose ends and making the story and characters make sense. The ending is very bittersweet, while leaves questions, they're not ones that you need answers to. It's nice to see series that doesn't make you wonder if there might be a sequel or not.  What bugs me if anything is the art. The art is pretty rough, similar to Slayers but sometimes felt inconsistent. Sometimes I can't tell if there's more Yashigani than just ep. 4. I might just be bothered by the way the eyes are drawn. Of course, the CG sequences are dated, but can't be helped.  Another annoying factor is the voice acting, particularly for Kain. He sounds like a choked chicken and at times it gets grating to the ears, especially how many times he yells throughout the series.  Little nitpicks aside, I very much enjoyed the series. Check it out especially if you've seen and enjoyed Slayers Next and Try.;Recommended
2;Lost Universe;camay1997;https://myanimelist.net/profile/camay1997;8;It's hard to believe this series is nearly twenty years old. The CGI looks on par with anime from the decade that followed it. Now before I start heaping praise upon this series I will point out my bias here. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with space battles or sword fights, and this series has both. Looking back, this series helped create my bitterness about anime cliches. Because this series has none of them. It's not set in high school nor does it star high schoolers. It doesn't center on unrequited love. Not once did I call for Bright Noah. None of the characters are simply eye candy. And I don't have to endure some boy with a girl's name hollaring about justice, friendship or how they're gonna single handily rid humanity of it's enemy. It's just a simple fun space adventure. The key is it never alters it's tone. It's an action comedy (they were all the rage in the 90's) and it never forgets that. Every episode gives you the action and comedy. It's not perfect, though few things are. For starters very little is explained in this series, that's a mild problem for a sci-fi series. I had questions, and I'd like answers. I got a few, but not all. While the CGI looks good, the animation shows it's age. This might turn off viewers who don't have a sense of nostalgia for 90's anime. There's one other flaw I want to mention and that's the use of Noo as the principal villain. If you don't know who Noo is, watch Captain Herlock: The Endless Odyessy. I'm not going to spoil it here but needless to say Hal Jordan is over qualified to solve the problem. Watch it if you're out of new series to watch. You won't be blown away, but you will be entertained.;Recommended
3;Lost Universe;Metazoxan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Metazoxan;8;Space the final frontier. The space genera is about as vast as space itself and no matter how many series you see you can always find a new one that you can find fun.  Now to talk about lost universe. First I'd like to say that if you are familiar with the slayers series then you should watch this. But if you didn't enjoy slayers you should still give it a shot.  STORY: The story for this series is rather good. Our main characters are involved in a battle that will decide the fate of the universe but the audience doesn't know it until close to the end. It's high points are it's comedy and fair use of foreshadowing and it's low points are a few plot points left a little vague or underused. But over all the good outweighs the bad.  ART: The art is one of the lowest points of this series due to it being a bit dated but it's certainly not bad and if you watched the first couple seasons of slayers then you've got a good idea of what to expect.  SOUND: I normally don't focus too much on music and sound effects but nothing stood out as bad or anything. Although some of the voice acting in the english dub had a few flaws and I normally don't say that much. Kain's voice is okay but most of the time his battle yells sounds terrible and anytime his childhood self talks in a flashback I wanted to shoot the kid. A few other voices sounded a little off at times but unless your the type to nitpick at this stuff you won't really notice too much.  Characters: This show has a well balanced cast. The main characters are both typically quirky and refreshingly interesting at the same time. You can tell what kind of people they are when you first meet them but they still have their secrets that you would never guess until they start to finally reveal them. The only problem is that the villains are mostly either lame or left rather vague even the final boss is a little lacking. But despite some flaws there is nothing terribly bad about any of the cast.  OVERALL: This is a series that is sure to entertain anyone who likes space/adventure anime. Even if some of it's flaws bother you it has enough good points to make up for it for the most part.;Recommended
0;Lost Universe;Bishounen_Hunter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bishounen_Hunter;5;"Lost Universe is an OK anime. Only OK. It's tries to be funny but comes off more annoying that funny. There are times when it's actually funny but the overdose of sarcasm and cheesy tongue-in-cheek dialog mixed in with the [deliberately] bad acting makes it all seem like the writers and/or voice actors didn't take the show too seriously. Lost Universe is along the same lines as Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop [but nowhere near as cool or bad-ass!] It's about a small group of bounty hunters aka “trouble shooters” who fly around deep space doing odd jobs in order to get paid.  ~ Art/Animation Average 90s style art. All the people had pointy cheeks, pointy chins and large geometric, pointy eyes with crazy hair of varying colors and shapes. There is some nice CG work in this series but it may be before CG became really popular and common for everyday TV series, so overall the show just kind of had that very flat old-school look.  ~ Sound Um, it's not the most splendid music in the world, This anime made me realize something....that at some point anime music has become a stand-alone product. Modern anime music is now good enough to market itself as a viable product which you can buy as a CD or MP3 and listen to on the [INTERNET] radio. The music on Lost Universe is not this type of music, it's strictly on that cartoony level and it doesn't ever go beyond that. The English voice actors were a trip [or maybe just tripping!] I don't know if they were being that bad on purpose or not! If the show was a bit older I'd say they were genuinely bad...if it were a newer series then they were definitely being cynical. This show seems to be a bit of both, CRIKEY!!!  ~ Story I believe this is the first anime I've ever watched that seems to fall into the “parody” category because it's clearly poking fun at the Space Adventure / Sci-fi genre [shall I count how many Star Wars inferences there were?] Like I said earlier, Lost Universe is about a small group of wannabe bounty hunters who go sailing though outer space taking all of these low-paying, high-risk jobs they can manage just so that they can put food on the table and buy ridiculous weapons. There does seem to be a bigger plot wherein there is some sinister organization with evil spaceships and such lurking in the shadows trying to foul up everything for Kain and his ditsy crew-members. But alas, with all the campy voice acting going on, the show quickly becomes oh-so-very annoying as it progresses with it eventually losing focus [along with the viwer's attention] and finally ending with the central plot falling off to the wayside. They say ""too much of a good thing can harm ya..."" well in this case, it's the cheesy-ass humor.  ~ Cast/Characters And the best character award goes to: Kali, the creepy Faux “English” woman walking around smashing up stuff with her whip. She has got to be the looniest assassin in all of anime-world. First of all she's got this wacky and somewhat slurred British accent, WTF dude, like seriously lay off the brandy and peppermint schnapps BEFORE you go to work, hon. And if that didn't make her already deranged enough then there's the fact that she walks around town with that whip trying to kill people, like really....just use a gun, lady! Then there's wannabe that Luke Skywalker, Kain Blueriver, complete with fake light-saber and dorky cape. He's not bad to look at but he's no hunk either...he gets a 5 on the Bishounen Hunter scale. Rail on the other hand gets a 7 because he's dark, a brunette and suave...except when gets a face full of coffee because of his clumsy-ass, lovesick assistant. The two main dingbats that make up Kain's crew are an even mix of funny and annoying, most of the time they sound like Edith Bunker's younger sisters...what total airheads! Even though the green-haired one is supposed to be a computer she's still an airhead!  ~ Is it worth it? No, not really. it's not that it's a bad story, but the voice actors went a little overboard with the ad-libbing and cheesy lines....this may have worked with Ghost Stories [which is like, some underground anime cult hit now or something.] But that type of humor overwhelms this show and before long you stop rolling on the floor with laughter and start rolling your eyes. This is only You-Tube or CrunchRoll worthy.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lost Universe;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;5;"For a spinoff based off Slayers, Lost Universe was a bit underwhelming for me. Lost Universe basically starts off being a comedy/ adventure series in its first half focused on the missions that Kain and Millie partake in as trouble consultants, a number of which being a bit on the bizarre side much like Slayers. Unfortunately, the comedy here felt a bit flat for me as it didn't really seem to be poking fun of anything other than the quirks of the characters (Millie's bragging of being the ""best in the universe"" and Kane's obsession with his cape) and the nutty situations they dealt with, which were more obnoxious than funny for me. Slayers worked for me in the comedy department because it was poking fun of medieval fantasy/ adventure titles with its major characters quite aware of a number of the cliches for which they were dealing with. Lost Universe lacks that charm and it was what led me to take a while to get around to finishing the series without putting it on hold in my stockpile.  The second half held up my interest a little better as it explored the major conflict in which Kane deals with in the form of the crime syndicate Nightmare and their gathering of other Lost Ships like the one that Kane is in possession of. It provides a reasonable amount of fleshing out on Kane's character and explores what led him to seek revenge on the syndicate. The series would slowly unveil the motivations of the syndicate and the nature surrounding the Lost Ships they desire.  Still though, the major characters representing Nightmare mostly fulfill stock archetypes you would expect in conventional sci-fi titles serving either as mooks for their boss, desiring planetary/ galactic domination or wanting to flat out destroy everything that exists, making them quite shallow and not so interesting in motives or personality like Xellos or Rezo from Slayers. Not to mention it seemed like the series had quite a bit it was trying to explore yet so little time to provide reasonable substance. The final episodes of the series noticeably rush through their revelations and conflicts without any solid buildup, had some details on prominent characters left unexplored (Millie's past and how Raily came across some major information for later in the show) and seemed to lack a proper ending as it was hinted there would be more to Kane's adventures beyond this show.  The drawing style for Lost Universe is similar to Slayers, which shouldn't be of much surprise to Hajime Kanzaka fans since he created both shows. The animation for the series tended to be quite inconsistent at points, especially as I've heard that this series ran through a number of different art directors throughout the show's run. Close-up shots of characters made use of a bright color palette on occasions yet reverted back to a more subdued color tone in medium and far camera shots. There were some occasions where I seen scenes where the details of characters and scenery take a hit quality-wise and they were back to par in the next scene. Animation sequences with spaceships quite often switch between use of traditional hand-drawn animation and subpar CG animated renderings of the spaceships. I can forgive the CG animation considering the early use of the technology for a TV anime, but not the inconsistent quality that I could notice with the title's animation throughout its run.  Overall, I was quite disappointed with how subpar Lost Universe was as I was quite entertained with much of the Slayers franchise. While this series has some decent elements with its plot unveiled in its second half, the flat comedic delivery, inconsistent animation and lack of time to fully explore its world and characters were major issues for me with Lost Universe. I wouldn't consider this too memorable compared to the other TV anime titles that make up the Slayers franchise.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lost Universe;susonauta;https://myanimelist.net/profile/susonauta;4;"A simple sf story about a young boy a young girl and a extremely cute computer.(one of my favorites characters ever) Soon they will became friends and companions while defeat the enemy on board a spaceship, more less in a similar way, the plot is repetitive and predictable some times.  The anime tries to make the relationship between the characters deeper but it fails. In the end the interaction between the characters is childish.  The ships design isn't so bad but nothing special, scenery is really bad but since most of the time you won't notice the background it's OK, the bad dynamics of the vehicles made me difficult to really get absorbed by the story.  There are also good things I like not feeling stupid for not understand a new philosophy based on the thoughts of one of the characters, and I almost forgot it make me cough. No, not cough! laugh.  I enjoyed because I like adventure anime, because... I will never hold the controls of a space ship; not to mention in the presence of a goddess and a cute blondie fighting with me facing the future, writing my own destiny bla bla bla  That's all Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to Swordbreaker airlines, Captain Suso and the crew members hope you have a pleasant flight.

1;Lost Universe;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;4;If you're expecting this series to be on par with The Slayers... it's not.  This anime is a revenge story with Kane Blueriver a swordsman who wishes to kill his enemies. However like The Slayers it tends to shift between serious & comical scenes, yet the comedy in Lost Universe was a personal flop to me. Most of this is due to the lack of likeable characters & the smaller roster compared to Slayers. In this series we only have 3 protagonists who aren't that interesting. Kane passes of as the would be son of Lina & Gourry but for the most has this running gag of being obsessed with his cape. Milly Nocturne has the egotistical nature of Lina but none of the charm. Lastly there's Canal Vorfeed who just comes off as supportive & energetic but doesn't offer much.  Lost Universe is simply too long to tell its story with events being delivered slowly with cheap gags, poor action & boring characters. As a fan of The Slayers, I expected too much from this series. The anime does deliver some interesting sci-fi but could explored better in other animes. There are also some references to Slayers Try but isn't really noticeable (its the lost ships names).  Overall the anime is a very poorly made version of The Slayers. I'm a fan of English, Spanish & Japanese dubs but the English version took A LOT of liberties with its dialogue giving itself a dub that's so bad that it might be good. I would recommend watching The Slayers, Cromartie High School, Binbogami Ga & Gintama for great comedy anime.;Not Recommended
0;Lost Song;taelhime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/taelhime;8;Lost Song is by no means a revolutionary anime that's going to change the game forever. That doesn't mean that it isn't still unique and surprisingly enjoyable. In fact, I would say it's that surprise itself that lends a hand to my enjoyment of the series overall.  I went into Lost Song with low expectations, given from the first few episodes it seems to be a standard fantasy era war show without any interesting gimmick that made it stand out. Only reason I kept with it was because I watched with a friend and we wanted to predict what would happen.  Predicting what will happen in Lost Song is a feat that proves much more difficult than you would expect. As I said, it was the surprise of how much we couldn't predict what would happen that made it so enjoyable. Partway through, the series pulls off one of the best plot twists I've encountered for such an unassuming series, and it's how discreetly packaged this show is that made it such a wonderful, delightful surprise.  That isn't to say it's only the surprise that makes it interesting. You find that groundwork had been laid out this entire time, and unbeknownst to you, a well crafted and clever series had appeared beneath your feet before you knew what you were watching.  All I can say is to give Lost Song a chance, and it certainly won't disappoint you. I wish there had been just a bit more time for better pacing to give a few more characters some spotlight or unfold a few more threads they'd lead with and tied off loosely at the end, but all in all, it's still satisfying and a very fun ride until the very end! The art is decent at worst and great at best, the music is enchanting, and the two protagonists are the characters who really sell the story. Lost Song is the hidden gem of its season.;Recommended

And it was a good choice! I loved the art style and the story in this anime a lot. It was different in story wise that i usually watch but i found it enjoyable and interesting.  About mid-way they put in a plot twist that was best i have seen so far and it just made me want to watch this to the end.  There was little confusion in the last few episodes that could have been put a little better but still the story was clear and the ending was kinda sad but hopeful.

2;Lost Song;Nilsou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nilsou;10;"My note : 10/10 : masterpiece. It is difficult for me to understand why Lost Song have a so much low notation on MAL. The anime have several flaw, but it is filled with good idea, with good songs and with love. For me, it is sufficient to have a 10/10.  Lost song is, imho, very well writen, with many surprise and switch in the scenario (like in Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica for example) but more importantly every little details in the firsts episodes have a signification or are a metaphor, and after rewatching the anime I realized how well writen it is in its very little details, down to the choice of the title.  It is very surprising because Junpei to Morita (which seems to be a men duo of director) have not done a lot of thing in their career.  Moreover, apart from the writing, it is important to note the genius inspiration that they had in the choice of the actors : The seiyuus chosen here are not really voice actress, but rather singers known for great songs in a lot of animes openings etc. The choice to construct the scenario and all the anime around those two women, are a great idea. The result is some of the most beautiful song of the animation, embedded in the hearth of the anime scenario. Great !  Despite all this good points, the anime have some flaws : for example, there is some « naivité » in the beginning that could be repulsing and seems amateur, but truly, it is not. One other problem is that, like in Steins Gate, the beginning of the anime is more or less designed to be « classic » to enhance the contrast with the second part. So, by design, it could be difficult to watch in the beginning of the anime.  But well, the very good points of the anime, from writing to songs are widely sufficient to put this away.  I strongly recommend to watch Lost Song, it is a masterpiece.";Recommended
3;Lost Song;MelissaRaid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MelissaRaid;10;"This is a spoiler-free review!  Lost Song has to be one of the best anime I have watched in a long while. It started off slow and, unfortunately, I dropped it in the middle of the third episode. I did, however, decide to pick it up the day before the final episode aired and I'm glad that I went back to it.  First off, as I said, the anime started off slow. If you're thinking of watching it, hang in there until episode 7. If you finish 7 and still think it's not worth your time, then go ahead and drop it. With episodes 7 and 8 your understanding of how things were happening is turned on its head. For that alone I loved it and, in the end, I decided to give the story a 10. It's not super unique, but unique enough that I think it stands out and I highly recommend it, even to people who aren't anime fans.  The art is 9/10 for me. The animation is very clean for the most part, but there's small inconsistencies from time to time. The character designs are rather simple, but I think that it helps add charm to the anime in its own way. The lighting is done well and the 3D that is here and there meshes very well with the 2D The backgrounds are beautiful and the animation for the opening and ending songs are great. The ending even has subtle changes in it if you pay close attention!  For the sound I give this anime a solid 10. This anime isn't a ""musical"" exactly, but it does have singing tied into it, obviously. There's a song sung about once or twice per episode, but nothing too overwhelming. The music and singing in this anime are top-notch-- even the minor characters that only join in on singing a few times have nice voices! If we manage to get the boxed set of Lost Song overseas with the OST, I'm more than willing to spring for it.  Characters I give a 9/10. They do typical tropes very well, but Finis was a great character and she's stuck with me as being rather unique. Some of the minor characters are even fun-- like an old man inventor with a parrot in a cage on his large backpack and a croissant on his walking cane that he randomly takes a bite off of while sitting in on a conversation.  Enjoyment of this anime and overall, my score is definitely 10/10. I loved this anime so much and I hope that it gains popularity in the West so that we can see it released on BD/DVD. Everything meshes together so well and the plot twist that I didn't expect made me glad that I decided to go back and pick up the anime rather than dropping it altogether.  TLDR: Give Lost Song a chance! Try to stick it through until the end of episode 7 and you'll be rewarded!";Recommended
4;Lost Song;ismichi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ismichi;9;"This show was handled rather well, especially in hindsight. There were some flubs which made the writing come across poorly if not actually so, but overall it worked with what it was doing.  There will be partial spoilers in my quick summaries for each rating. I'll try to be fairly vague with that stuff tho  --  STORY (9)  I feel the story it was aiming for was implemented well through-out and, especially in hindsight, anything that felt off made a lot more sense. But it takes until a major event for this to begin making sense unless you already know about it or are just that good at picking up the subtle hints.  Tho there were some things that didn't work quite so well despite that, such as if something repeats itself then it should never have been so similar as if it were the original.  And in regards to recanting memories after a big event, without them having to show everything, it was off-putting. Some serious liberties were taken to keep it interesting, concise, and simple. But the tone was off from the rest of the story and so I felt it wasn't done well and it still bugs me. I'm also not a fan of memories in which stuff not actually experienced was shown so, again, it wasn't done well and is a big reason I'd never give this a 10.  .  ART (7)  There were moments where there were some animation issues never corrected after broadcast, such as chunky hands for a bit and face markings disappearing for one scene where frames weren't reused. Overall tho there's nothing so distracting it can't be overlooked.  Design-wise, I yawned far too frequently for. Some made sense given their character and their place in the story, but most I just didn't care for. It gave a nostalgic feel tho so it wasn't unbearable while watching. Just nothing I'd have watched the series for, which is probably not a good thing in regard to marketing.  .  SOUND (4)  Honestly, for a story in which songs are so vital to the plot, they were seriously lackluster. While they had a style of their own instead of just throwing in some modern or retro sounds, there was so little that felt it was magical or even memorable.  There was nothing special or awful about the quality, sfx, or bkg music either. Other than Tamura singing tons.   .  CHARACTER (6)  The sisters bored me from the get-go. Would've enjoyed it much more if they didn't just toss them in and kept them, as they gave the ""one-off"" vibe far too much even to the end. This forcing of a ~symphony~ honestly lowered the quality of the cast. Without them, it probably would be more along the lines of an 8.  The rest of the cast was fine tho. A good chunk of them actually grew through-out and very few remained static. There were many one-off characters but, given the adventure/traveling type plot, it was reasonable and didn't hinder anything.  .  ENJOYMENT (8)  I could ignore the sisters being worthless to the story, and the annoyance of a kid genius, and even the random writing flubs.  The second I got the reasoning for some inconsistencies, I was constantly thinking back of them while finishing the show; the way memories (not flashbacks) were recounted allowed time to actually remember what I was binging.  The fact that the songs were so unremarkable - especially the duet - lowered this rating from a 9.";Recommended
5;Lost Song;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;8;"Konomi Suzuki and Yukari Tamura singing a duet together? LA is in!  LA saw Lost Song well the first half of the anime as a rather predictable music fantasy anime with all the cliches down pat, but the later half...well it was ambitious to say the least and that ambitiousness both confused and kept LA interested for the long haul as well as somewhat redeemed the cliched beginnings, key word being ""somewhat"".  Spoilers Ahead!  So the first half of the anime has MANY of the cliches in a typical fantasy medieval setting just with the twist that ""songs"" are incorporated into the fantasy setting, characters being cliched to all hell and back and seeing plot twists coming from a mile away. The plot was projected right down the step it had to be taken to say the least but this wasn't helped but the cliched characters, especially Prince Lood voiced by Yuto Suzuki being the jerkass prince towards one of the main characters and fiancee Finis voiced by Yukari Tamura and his rather stupid moments making him intentionally unlikable to every notion in the process. Character wise, the characters did as expected even down the simplest action at times and MANY TIMES LA predicted right what was happening. The character dynamic for the most part had a very black and white morality to it all, like Rin's growing company along with Finis and Henry Leobort were the good guys while EVERY ONE ELSE were evil and that just made the plot so obvious so much. Rin and Finis were the narrative focus and the main characters of the anime thus are good, Rin voiced by Konomi Suzuki was oblivious and was a glutton and loves to sing as her trait while Finis was the damsel in distress with no sense of direction. Henry Leobort voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita, Finis guard was the typical white knight and the perfect foil towards Lood. Rin's company, Al voiced by Misaki Kuno the gadgeteer genius, Pony Goodlight voiced by Chiaki Takahashi the alcoholic who doesn't want to be called old, and finally sisters Alyu and Monika Looks voiced by Asami Seto and Yuu Serizawa respectively as the genki talkative to the shy intorverted sleepy archetypal sisters. The only character LA really liked was Finis' maid Corte voiced by Ai Kayano, being Finis' protector and helped WHENEVER she could and definitely deserved MVP during the first half not to mention she was so likable to a fault. So with all this being said, the second half changed EVERYTHING LA said about the first half to the point of redemption of the anime's story it had going for it.  The second half by all means ""redeemed"" LA faith to Lost Song if anything it threw a curveball into the clicheness Lost Song had but even then with this LA would say because of the second half, the first half was the building block and setup to what the second half had going for it. LA will say talk potential spoilers right now, so look away or WATCH THIS SERIES NOW then come back!.  Ok, so Lost Song incorporates ""time travel"" into the mix and this can either go in the way of Steins;Gate and bring in a good time travel story, or on the other hand, bring in one confusing plotline that can end badly but like LA said Lost Song's setup paid off for the most part and the anime thought through all the time travel hijinks leaving NO plot holes as far as LA knows as LA theorized and tried to get the story straight for a LONG time before LA concluded that the time traveling plotline had no plot holes. See from what LA could gather Lost Song incorporated converging timelines along with it's time loop in order to tell it's story and allowed the story to fit into itself properly, that and LA wasn't trying to be bias that ""just because this theory works, no plot holes, no problems"", LA thought through it from alternative timeline theories to in media res, or split segmented storylines, but it was for the most part the one theory that made sense to all this was the branching converged timeline theory (LA only say this as Lost Song NEVER properly say what kind of time travel shenanigans it did to the plot and expected us to follow through...see that how you will, this along with LA's branching converging timeline theory as LA won't contest this theory is definitive) and because of this HUGE revelations made the link to Rin in the process. In terms of characters, the majority of the cast had some stake in the plot or improved the character through some plot twists about them later, the only two LA really didn't see improving were the Look sisters, yes they helped out Rin's cause, but not much after that. The greatest character development would go to Finis mainly on what she went through and her degradation of her personality to where she got to, nonetheless from damsel in distress to a major factor and stake to the plot in which HER drive caused it all was a massive improvement from her first half counterpart and even though Finis was a heavily flawed character especially with her beliefs and plans she had going for it, Finis nabbed LA's favourite character overall, this is helped that she was the most fleshed out character from the entire cast.  Ohh and the second half gave us a MUCH BETTER villain in the form of Bazra voiced by Tsuyoshi Koyama, though his motivations were alot more ambitious than Prince Lood, jerkass for the sake of being a jerkass, Lost Song's villain department nonetheless was cliche all around unfortunately as much as Bazra was an massive improvement in terms of villainy.  The animation done by Dwango and LIDENFILMS was visually striking to the eye for the most part, from the great amount of backgrounding to the colorful character designs. The animation all around was consistent and this is especially with the character designs which for LA was the highlight of the series next to the beautiful backgrounding work it had. The the other side of the spectrum however, the CGI royal orchestra was annoyingly blatant to say the least, like LA will say this time and again but DON'T PUT HUMAN CHARACTERS THROUGH FULL CGI UNLESS THE ENTIRE SERIES IS CGI, it just made them stand out even more is what LA is saying but the CGI on some of the mechanical structures gets a pass and was at least incorporated right. Nonetheless, the animation was crisp, exotic and interesting to watch for the most part.  Voice acting, well this is interesting to say the least, well you know Konomi Suzuki is voicing one of the main characters, you may know Konomi Suzuki as the singer of several OP's like Absolute Duo, Ange Veirge, Freezing Vibration, Madan no Ou to Vanadis, No Game, No Life, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu and Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!. LA was a HUGE fan before her role in this anime and her first debut in voice acting...was decent all things considered and was a good decent debut role to be put in an anime that had elements of singing in it. Now as much as Konomi Suzuki was interesting to see in the voice cast, Yukari Tamura utterly steamrolled any other voice actor in this anime without a doubt, Yukari Tamura did her expected stuff and LA loved her portrayal as Finis and by all accounts Yukari Tamura had the most diverse range in voicing Finis throughout the anime, again expected of a veteran like Yukari Tamura. Misaki Kuno crossdressing as Al was interesting as well, though it had Misaki's typical high pitched vocals, LA was still fine with Misaki and had some oddly good chemistry with Konomi Suzuki. The only other voice actor LA would talk about would be Ai Kayano being the extremely supportive character of Mel and Corte and LA didn't even noticed Ai Kayano was pulling double duty not until LA saw the VA cast list. The singing portions for the most part was great, coming from singers in general of both Yukari Tamura and Konomi Suzuki, LA thinks this was expected to say the least. The voice cast is utterly amazing to say the least, even towards many of the minor characters and even the villains, this voice cast was exceptional with the tremendous help of Yukari Tamura keeping it all together (Can you tell LA is a fanboy of Yukari Tamura?).  The finale, tied up many of the loose plotlines though the later half of anime was already doing that with Rin and Finis but nonetheless, the finale DID fill in the remaining plotlines and was bittersweet to say the least but with a good side to it all in some sense if the anime had anything to say about it. Lost Song IS an original anime thus had some decency to give us a full story and end it when it need to and it did just that.  Lost Song is something of a hidden gem, hidden from the already cliched plot from the first half which detriments the anime even further but nonetheless the anime's second half redeemed itself quite well and effectively made the first half something of building block to the overall story as cliche as it is and no LA isn't saying it because LA was a fan of both Konomi Suzuki and Yukari Tamura thus gives a pass to the story, Lost Song's second half was where LA interest skyrocketed, theorizing and gotten into many of the main characters and what their plans or plot twists what were to come were in the process that was almost unpredictable with the first half as predictable as that was, was made as a leverage in making itself better in the process as well. Sure Lost Song isn't the best thing LA saw in the season of Spring 2018 but nonetheless it had a solid structure to itself and it KNEW what it wanted to tell as at first cliched then turn confusing and risky as it was at the end of it all. Lost Song is seriously a hidden gem of an anime and ambitious to a fault that LA at first discredited as cliche...as much as Lost Song has some clicheness to it, it DOES NOT take away the the latter half's success and intrigue that it followed through with vigor.  Lost Song is one of the more ambitious yet risky animes LA had seen for the Spring 2018 that actually pulled through all it's ambitious and risk into making a fully fleshed out and satisfying story and characters and because of this, it definitely gets LA's hidden gem of Spring 2018.";Recommended
6;Lost Song;Pike27;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pike27;7;"INTRODUCTION:  Lost Song's setting is your typical medieval fantasy world - a huge kingdom, small villages and conflicts between the different countries. The plot revolves around Rin, a young girl who dreams to sing with the orchestra at the capital, and Finis, a naive and charming woman that simply enjoys singing, in times when the menace of war comes closer by the day. What is special about these women is the fact that their singing is magical, as it shows on the first episode, and it quickly becomes a tool to move the plot forwards.   PLOT:  The anime starts well enough: side characters are introduced and some difficulties are overcome. At this stage, it feels just like a generic anime - there are some overused tropes and stereotypes thrown into the mix, which does not improve the experience. All in all, the art and the sound are pretty good, though the side characters feel a bit bland. Besides Rin and Finis, the main characters, I could only really care about Henry Leobold, a just, strong and courteous knight from a rich and honorable background. Regarding the antagonists, their motives are also cliché and predictable. I couldn't feel anything towards them (they were indeed quite generic), though they can make us react accordingly once in a while.  Then, approaching 2/3 of the series, the plot twist happens. Mind you - it is not a plot twist, it is THE plot twist. It definitely is one of the best I have ever seen. It made me realize how well-executed the anime has been up until that point, which I was blind to due to the lack of knowledge. It instantly made me hooked to the show and, for that reason alone, I am inclined to eventually rewatch the series. After that point, the whole main plot does become more interesting. There is room for character growth during the end of the anime and it does happen to some of them.  My main disapproval is that Lost Song remains with those same cringy tropes and some lackluster scenes that made me roll my eyes throughout the entire show. There was one specific scene that had some good tension built up only to end up in an infuriating ""I can't believe that is what happened"" shortly thereafter. I had to pause and take a deep breath at that moment. My feelings towards the ending are mixed, as there are some truly great moments, though it lacks in other parts.   CONCLUSION:  All in all, Lost Song has a fine story with a HUGE plot twist - and I mean it. Its art and sound direction are amazing, as it revolves around music and the special effects by them created. The main characters are interesting, though almost all the others suffer from the same things: they are lackluster and quite annoying, having some non-important subplots that just take screen time. I feel that Lost Song could have been a much, much better anime if only the side characters were more interesting and less focused on unnecessary drama. Still, it was an enjoyable show - if you are in doubt about it, it is worth watching due to the plot twist alone, although try not to expect much about the anime.";Recommended
7;Lost Song;earl_of_sandvich;https://myanimelist.net/profile/earl_of_sandvich;8;"Lost Song is like a fantasy game from the 16-bit (SNES) era. You have abilities, you suffer a tragedy, you have an adventure, and you realize that there is more, much more to the world than you've ever imagined. It reminded me of Terranigma, but with more singing.  If you're looking for a fantasy/medieval anime and you got burned badly by Grancrest, I highly recommend Lost Song. It doesn't try to shove 10 volumes into 24 episodes (which is more like 4 volumes and change if you value quality, and A-1 or the production committee clearly didn't), there is believability in the plot and characters as a result, and the thematic elements give the story a clear direction, but allow for the plot to take a sudden turn. Plus, there are bards. You can't have a proper fantasy/medieval anime without a bard somewhere. Honestly, I kinda wish that this was a 2-cour anime so that loose ends could be tied up, but evidently that wasn't in the budget.  Visuals are, in my opinion, the show's weakness. Aside from Finis, the character designs are like a shonen manga artist designed all the women; From certain angles and using certain expressions, Rin's face looks almost like a guy with a wig. Then there's the designs for the supporting women... Uh, tone down the cleavage, guys. Those tops look insanely uncomfortable. It's like someone in the design team wanted to see breasts, but the studio forbade them from showing nudity. The show doesn't take a lot of wide shots early on for a very good reason that is revealed midway through the story. Once you start seeing them in the last couple of episodes, pause the playback and take a look around.  It would be a travesty if a show about a ""lost song"" had mediocre music or vocals. Rin's voice actress has a superb singing voice, and Yukarin as always delivers a solid performance as Finis, and her ""Song of Endings"" is one of her best songs yet. Unfortunately the soundtrack isn't particularly memorable, but at least it's not as ridiculous as the Symphogear franchise.  Solid 8. I wish the show were longer (the plot twist felt rushed and there are loose ends), and the character designs weren't that great overall; good singing and execution otherwise.";Recommended
8;Lost Song;Respatiih;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Respatiih;9;This is the kind of anime that has no business making so much sense as it made. Beautifully crafted story, made me invested to the main characters. I wanted the villain to fall and I cheered for the main characters to succeed. And the twist is freaking divine. Everything perfectly fits and you could see that they're building towards it from the very beginning.  Though, I think the primary plot itself is nothing special, and dare I say, rather weak towards the end. The ones who needed miracle and salvation the most laid unsaved and without miracle, and this perhaps highlights my own lacking more than the anime, but the ending just...doesn't shake me enough.  If you consider watching it, do it. You won't regret it.;Recommended
0;Lost Song;lastfight5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lastfight5;6;If there's one thing I have to say about this anime: It's incredibly generic. The music and art is very nice and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it seemed like the anime played way too safe to the point they're not taking any risks.  Story: This part is its weak point. The story felt like those generic original stories you find on Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev trying to be the next Disney movie. Because it is. It's very predictable to the point that you can just go in blind and able to make an accurate picture of what's going to happen next, plays way too safe and the context of the story has been done a million times over every media you can imagine. Now, that doesn't mean they screwed up the most generic story a 5 year old can think of, which thankfully they didn't, and I do like to watch it when I get home from uni, there is this plot twist that kinda got me off guard and I thought this anime starts getting interesting, but other than that, it doesn't have anything that'll excite me.  Art: I find the art style to be pretty good. The environment is pretty and the characters look nice. Although that chest on Pony is distracting and out of place for this anime. The animations, I had to say is alright. Most part, the animators did well, but there's some part that are choppy that my eyes snap to and I get distracted because of it. Like someone disappearing on a horse out of thin air. I didn't know how that happened since it's 2D.  Sound: The music is pretty good. Konomi Suzuki's and Yukari Tamura's singing were pretty excellent and I do find the OP and ED catching and got me in. But compared to other animes of the season, the music is generic. As for the sound effects.... ehhh alright I guess.  Characters: Just like the story: incredibly generic and you can predict their personalities just by face value. That glasses boy? An aspiring scientist and the smart guy of the group. The knight guy? Knight in Shining Armour that's always good and the princess falls to. That General? General Ripper. Hell, even the two main characters? Pretty much Anna and Elsa in anime. Hell, you could tell their personalities just by their attractiveness. If they look good, that's because they're good. If they look dark and/or ugly, expect them to be against you or dicks. That doesn't mean I don't like them (in fact I do like the glasses boy who wants to be a scientist and the smart guy of the group, and Anime!Anna), but nothing about them is any original. I've seen these tropes applied to these guys with slight variations.  Enjoyment: While the genericness of the story and characters distract me a lot, I do enjoy the anime especially for the music and maybe the art. I've heard that this is Konomi Suzuki first take on being the MC of the anime and honestly, she did alright.  Overall, this anime is generic and doesn't stand out in that season. It tries way too hard to be a family friendly Disney anime, but it comes off as a team of amateurs trying to write a story that's BEING a family friendly Disney anime. If I wanna watch something similar to this, I'd go and buy a ticket or stream some Disney movie like Frozen, or go to Wattpad, Fictionpress or Quotev and read their stories there.;Mixed Feelings
1;Lost Song;Catastroprobeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Catastroprobeme;6;Lost Song is very cute but also a average anime.  For the first 5 or 6 episodes this show carries itself very well with the lovable main charterer with the cute supporting cast and songs and has a very cheerful story but after the plot twist in episode 6 the show gets very confusing and doesn't explain the change very well and expect you to just adapt to the new change in statues quo. The plot twist in episode 6 also ruins on of the relationships that a pretty large amount of screen time decanted to it too and try match up the guy with one of the supporting cast which I could see someone drop the series because of that although that really isn't a flaw but it could be handled way better then it was and for anyone invested in that relationship it was pretty annoying but it did make sense on why they did that. And this is probably more of a personal preference kind of thing but I wish it had a bigger verity of songs instead of the 6 or so that we had. They started to get repetitive by near the end of the series but besides that they where all very good.  Despite how much I enjoyed Lost Song it still has some very big issues and I wouldn't be surprised if someone dropped Lost Song by the 8-9th episode but I would recommend watching it;Mixed Feelings
2;Lost Song;SRMcQuillan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SRMcQuillan;6;Upon finishing Lost Song I had a hard time sorting out my thoughts about the show. I honestly could have landed anywhere between a 4 and a 6 on this series, and by this time next week I may have completely changed my mind on that ranking. In the end though - or at least for now - I settled on a 6 because there's clearly a lot of passion behind this show and in its best moments it does shine. In its worst though it is fumbling and almost laughable.  It's always nicer to finish on a high note, so I'll start with where this show falls down. Part of its problem is it suffers from an overabundance of earnestness. The result of this is that its fumbles end up far more noticeable, because they are treated with such drama and seriousness.  Beyond this, the show struggles to really establish any particularly interesting characters, and most of them come across as recycled tropes and not particularly deeply evoked. As a protagonist Rin is fine, occasionally charming, but mostly nothing you wouldn't expect and haven't seen many times before. Finis starts off as almost painful to watch, but as the only character that actually gets significant development, becomes somewhat more interesting as the show goes on. Al barely warrants mentioning, Pony Goodlight's (what?) only remarkable trait is how she avoids wardrobe malfunctions.  Of the two villains, Prince Rudo is the more interesting for how thoroughly unlikable he is made. The characterisation is not nearly as well done, but there's more than a little of Joffrey Baratheon about him. Other than that the other key antagonist is, like many of the other characters, an archetype that's far from original.  The plot starts of wholly unremarkable, but gradually builds to something reasonably interesting around the halfway mark, before subsiding back into mediocrity for the series' end.  So what did I like? Well this is a show about music and the music is excellent - or at least the big insert songs are. The OP and ED are forgettable (I literally can't think they sound like as I write this), but the two main spirit songs in particular are great. Which is good, because in a show like this, they really needed to be. The first of these is the Song of Healing, which features in the first episode and is every bit as stirring and uplifting as one might hope. The second comes around the midway point and represents the high point of the series. Indeed it almost makes you forget about the painful amounts of cringe that undercut what should have been a dramatic moment immediately prior to it.  Ultimately this is a show that tries hard, and it managed to gain my attention at times, whilst utterly losing me at others. It did stick around in my mind though, so there's something to be said for that. It isn't particularly original or daring, but it has its charms. This isn't essential viewing, but it isn't a waste of time either.;Mixed Feelings
3;Lost Song;Hiutsuri;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hiutsuri;6;I was able to predict the ENTIRE show on the opening alone. I didn't get it all right, enough that I was more than a little annoyed.  That being said, it was still fun to watch, and some of the music is great. I rewatched a few episodes just for the music. It is not really all that revolutionary in it's story. Like I said, it's something you could predict, however, it's more creative in it's delivery than many of the stories like it.  I'm not going to go much deeper, but I'll leave you with this, if you have ever felt that music was powerful... there are a few things you will enjoy.;Mixed Feelings
0;Lost Song;NalarueAni;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NalarueAni;2;"My favorite part about anime is when music, specifically singing, is a main focus. Japanese voice actors work tremendously hard to deliver their lines as realistically as possible, so it's a real treat when I get to hear their characters sing on top of that. That's what I was most excited about when I happened across an anime titled Lost Song on Netflix one day while I was cooking. The narrative told by the synopsis proved to be very intriguing as it described a setting in a fantasy world where two women are blessed by the power of song in a land where war is about to break out. Captivated by the apparent uniqueness of the story, I pressed play without hesitation. Across the twelve-episode journey, I quickly found that the anime wasn't as great as I intended it to be.   Story | 2/10 Lost Song tries and fails in many aspects that are more successful in other popular anime. It plays with drama, comedy, and suspense. The problem Lost Song has with these tropes is that the story is so poorly configured that the tropes hardly work together in a seamless manner. Plot twists are tossed around from left and right in the midst of dramatic moments, each with an introduction that acts as if they're these huge, surprising discoveries that should be completely unexpected to the audience. I, however, found each plot twist to be entirely predictable due to the fact that the foreshadowing of events was less subtly hinted and more obviously thrown in your face through character interactions and expressions. For example, when I heard a line such as, ""Don't ever sing the Song of Mortality,"" it became detectable to me that the song would be sung anyway at some point, because why mention the song and how dangerous it is if no one is going to sing it in the future, right? That kind of dialogue, while sometimes can work in favor of foreshadowing, is used a lot in this anime, making it too easy to guess what will happen later on. This is a problem I noticed as a recurrence throughout the first half of the anime, and I was extremely disappointed because being able to predict future events in a show takes away the excitement involved. It also proves that not much clever thought was put into the story as a whole.  On the other hand, the various bits of comedy that were included only seemed to be added as a means of preventing a moment of awkward silence, or as a means of slowing down a scene that was becoming too dramatic. The delivery of these jokes also felt forced instead of natural, and none of them really made me laugh either. Having a character scream out, ""There's food!? Where? Where's the food!?!?"" ever so often when another character randomly mentions food is not funny. Having a character attempt to explain why something isn't scientifically correct while the other characters interrupt him with, ""We don't care,"" isn't funny either. If anything, these types of lines are childish and cringy, and there's nothing funny about an adult or teenager acting like a child. Plus, I've seen these exact same jokes before, so these aren't even original. I know comedy isn't a huge focus within Lost Song, since it isn't even listed as one of the genres, but there are hundreds of other anime that EXCEL in delivering good comedy when the focus also mostly revolves around drama and suspense.  The story development in general isn't the best either. Pacing fluctuates between harshly rushed to push out as much information as possible and agonizingly slow as a consequence. Rinse and repeat. On top of that, the anime takes a drastic and questionable turn at the halfway mark where the story becomes way less predictable and a LOT more confusing. I can understand that the creators of this anime wanted to inflict shock within its audience by making such a sudden change in the story, but to me this change was too much for the type of setting presented in the beginning and felt as though the same idea could be accomplished with a change that was toned down a bit. Essentially, it seems like the story presented in Lost Song is trying too hard to achieve a ground-breaking plotline. By attempting to wow its watchers with such drama, heartbreak, and unexpected events in its twelve-episode time frame, the anime ends up tripping over itself and instead showcases a chaos of ideas and characters that aren't deeply explored.  A last point I would like to mention before moving on is that Lost Song tries desperately to appeal to all audiences. On the surface it looks as though the anime is aiming for a younger female demographic with its shoujo-like art style and lack of raunchy themes, but with added gore, profanity, and a female character with breasts so big they look like they're about to spill out of her clothing, it seems like the anime is also trying to bring in an older female and male audience as well. This desperation to create an anime worth watching by all was so obvious that it was infuriating and distracting to the narrative trying to be told.   Character | 2/10 Throughout Lost Song, the story switches point of views between the two main characters: Rin and Finis. Besides their ability to control the elements with their songs, there's nothing about these characters that really stands out. Rin is optimistic and kind-hearted, and Finis is a naïve damsel in distress. For the two characters that are supposed to carry the whole story on their backs, the types of personalities they were given are ones that are extremely overused and boring. The goals they have are also entirely lackluster, and they give off the impression that the only reason these motives exist is only to advance the story. Rin's character in particular wants to find her true purpose in the world, which isn't a goal that encourages character development. Thus, Rin doesn't really develop at all due to the fact that she's already a ""good guy"" who has almost no reason to change or redeem herself. Finis, on the other hand, goes through a rapid development once her goal is hindered by the enemy of the anime. If done correctly, I might have thoroughly enjoyed Finis's sudden change in character considering it was probably the most interesting thing that happened. Unfortunately, with Finis's development came the unsatisfactory warping of the plot. The added confusion alongside her change really made it hard for me to appreciate the only piece of character development that was delivered.  As for the abundance of supporting characters, it was easy to see not much thought was put into them either. This part of the cast is one full of stereotypes; the glasses character is the smart guy, the knight is the savior, the ugly guy is the villain, etc. so there's not really anything interesting about them. Over half of these characters are added with zero purpose to fulfil the plot other than using them to make conversation when things slowed down. All of these useless characters could have been cut from the anime entirely, and their screen time could have been replaced with scenes that explained the plot better or improved the pacing. Some anime do a great job managing a large cast of characters, but this isn't one of them.   Art | 2/10 I really hate judging an anime for its art, especially the older ones, but the art presented in Lost Song is utterly amateurish for the era of its release. It's 2018. Earlier this year we saw Violet Evergarden, and only a few weeks after Lost Song ended came Banana Fish. Compared to those two, the art style and animation of Lost Song looks as though it was released in the early 2000s. Multiple times throughout the anime, the movement of the characters felt really choppy and the least bit smooth. This was especially a problem when the characters were walking. It's clear to see that the animation budget was almost entirely spent on the animation of the characters singing, because it was only during those moments where it felt like the animation was somewhat up to par with other 2018 anime. It hurts me to say this, but I also didn't like how the character designs looked at all. Besides the villain being purposely made unsightly, I didn't find the rest of the cast to be pleasing to look at either.   Sound | 2/10 The music within this anime was what I was most excited for and most disappointed with. Lost Song features several insert songs that each represent their own power. There's a song of fire, water, Earth, wind, healing, and mortality. Some songs were more catchy than others, but none of them really stood out to me as exceptional compositions. Though the characters looked like they were having a blast singing their songs, I couldn't say I felt the same way while watching them. Rin's voice was tolerable since her character is a bit younger, so it makes sense for her voice to be higher pitched, but I wasn't particularly a fan of Finis's voice. Her singing was extremely nasally, and it was clear to see that she was trying to hide the fact that she couldn't really hit the high notes by making her voice go softer. The softness in her voice also takes away from the power of the song, which is incredibly unfortunate considering Finis is the one who sings the most powerful song in the anime. Moreover, when both Rin and Finis sing together, their high-pitched voices tend to blend in with one another instead of being distinctive. I really think that they should have cast a VA with a bit of a deeper voice for Finis, like Saori Hayami (VA for Yunhua in the anime Kanata no Astra, she also sings in this anime on two occasions) for example, not only because she could probably hit the notes better and make the songs more powerful, but her voice sounds a lot more mature for someone like Finis. Either way, for being the selling point of the show, the songs in this anime failed miserably at meeting my expectations.   Enjoyment | 1/10 This was not a fun anime to watch. The plotline and characters are packed full of generalizations and stereotypes, and the whole premise of the story just jumps all over the place. Honestly, if someone told me that a child wrote the script, I would believe it. As a female approaching my 20s, I saw no appeal for this anime beyond what I read in the synopsis. So much could have been done to improve everything we were given, but with the evident low budget this anime seems to have, I can see why it turned out this way. Lost Song was a one-and-done for me, so I have no plans of ever coming back to it.";Not Recommended
1;Lost Song;Entraya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Entraya;3;Let me see, lost song is a unique experience unlike any other, it is so entirely devoid of any redeeming qualities that watching it becomes disorienting, as if it distorted reality itself it with its badness  it is consistently awful minute to minute, never a dull moment, in fact watching it is like getting your delicate brains repeatedly poked with a porcupine quill, it will make you laugh but its more the kind of mirthless desperate laughter of getting strung up and tickled with a feather in a dark, dark dungeon  it is a show about song, and the singers are bad, and the songs are bad, and the sound design overall is bad and it makes you cringe because you're overly aware that real life people are singing it badly and having to pretend that they're not bad, it doesnt even deserve more imaginative writing on my part than just the word 'bad' which also accurately describes the monotonous badness of the show  watch it with a friend and alcohol and you will have a great time though;Not Recommended
0;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;ReyvinHill;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ReyvinHill;5;This is a review of the anime only. I have not read the manga.  I marathoned this in almost one sitting. It had a lot of potential that it never lived up to, and in the end, was extremely disappointing. As other reviewers have mentioned, this should have been done in more than twelve episodes. I have not read the manga so this review is of the anime only having no other information than what was presented in the anime.  What I liked about it:  1. It had an all-star cast of seiyuus. 2. The character art was well done. 3. The story had a ton of potential. 4. There was a lot of action.  What I disliked about it:  1. It moved too quickly from the mid-point on. It was clear that a lot of important information was being left out for the sake of saving time. 2. There were too many cast members to go into depth with any of them in such a short amount of time. I didn’t get attached to anyone and it’s rare for me to not get attached to at least one character. 3. The ending didn’t resolve anything. All the questions were left unanswered and there’s no promise of a sequel. It made it feel like a giant waste of time.  STORY: The story had great potential but was never fully developed. Motives were never explained. People became attached to one another with no explanation as to why. Characters made choices that were never fully explained. Every episode brought new questions but never answered any and the ending didn’t either. (It could be argued that some of the questions were answered but since those “answers” were just insuations and speculation, I don’t feel that they were answered. I want evidence.)  CHARACTERS: The characters could have been amazing, but they weren’t. There were too many in too short of a time span with nowhere near enough development for me to grow to care about any of them. The most interesting character to me was the tattooed hoodie guy and I never found out a thing about him! That drove me crazy and not in a good way.  ART: I liked the character designs. They were nothing special but they were pretty. Some of the blood armor, or whatever it was supposed to be, looked pretty awesome, Kark’s in particular, but most were just abstract and odd. I felt that could have been done better. Some of the monsters had really great detail but some were just awful. The female detective's gun holster looking like a bra was so stupid it was distracting.  MUSIC: I didn’t like either the OP or ED and skipped through them every time. The music during the anime itself didn’t strike me either good or bad. I don’t remember it all.  Overall, I don’t recommend this anime. It’s really great for the first several episodes but then it gets confusing and the ending not answering any questions at all just made it feel like a waste of time. I'm honestly surprised at how poor this was given the caliber of the seiyuus and the high-end production companies. I'm not sure what went wrong but it sure went wrong.;Mixed Feelings
1;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;BloodyRoseKrsnik;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BloodyRoseKrsnik;5;"Story: 4/10 The story started out very promising. You start off with an action packed fight scene, showing a previous ""play,"" where you then go to the current play. You start to look out for the important characters, but from there it really just goes down hill. The story felt like it was all over the place, where you would end one episode and suddenly you were at a totally different scene.  *Spoiler* One of the episodes ended with a fight scene at the school, and then the next episode it started up with the team, with members you ""technically"" didn't know were part of the church, destroying these historical sites. *End Spoiler*  Scenes like this really created a disjointed scene making it overly confusing as to what had happened in between scene jumps. The story itself also seemed lacking in substance. It kept talking about how the past was the end all be all. Your fate can't be changed, but we never understood what the previous fate really was. We saw one whole scene, and all other previous fates weren't even mentioned until the last 2 episodes.  The only interesting thing about this anime was the morally ambiguous sides. This anime, unlike others, didn't present a good or bad side. They presented teams that had their own reasoning behind their actions. This allowed you to choose a side where as most anime predetermine your ""favorite"" team.  Art: 5/10 There is nothing really spectacular or notable about the artwork. Very average, but not terrible.  Sound: 5/10 Similarly to art, there was nothing truly awesome or notable about the sound. I did find that in the dub, the characters voices didn't really suit some of their characters. I felt like there could have been better choices.  Character: 4/10 There is very little character development. Chihiro got the most development and even that, for almost 10 episodes straight, they hinted at the same thing over and over. If they hadn't kicked the poor dead horse so many times, it would have been an earned reveal. It even lead Kakihara, to being a babbling nuisance. He kept harping on Chihiro, blaming him for everything and it was to the point that this interesting character, became annoying and you kind of wanted him to die. As for the others, they got little or no growth. We don't get to explore their powers, we only explored Chihiro. Most of the characters just appeared with no explanation as to who they were or what they could do. We just knew that they were 10xs weaker than Chihiro and would probably just be killed out.  Enjoyment: 4/10 I did enjoy exploring this anime. I kept looking forward to new episodes to see if there was anything really redeeming about it, but there wasn't. I honestly thought this anime would turn out to just reset time and un-screw everything up. I did truly enjoy figuring out who to side for since both sides had their faults, but other than that, nothing really stood out.  Overall: 5/10 It was just a poor anime. The story could have had so much potential, but assuming do to little budget, there anime's run was short. It felt like to fit the entire plot in 12 measly episodes, they had to rush the plot along. Leaving a lot of things disjointed and not enough to time to explain anything or even provide character development. There was just so much to digest in this anime, that this series is not suited for a 12 episode season.  Recommendation: I still recommend watching this anime, see what you think. It was still a fun few hours of my life, but I definitely would not go back and re-watch this.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;KANLen09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KANLen09;1;"The immediate look at my incredible judging score SHOULD immediately tell you everything that happens within the series, it is a laughably non-embarrassing total misfire, a miscalculation and perfect wreck of a fairly popular TCG that's left in Japan (and I don't care).  Before I start getting the hate, let me give you the context of what the original Lord of Vermilion TCG is about: *Goes to Wikipedia to check out*  Now, the anime adaptation by Asread: *Read the entire MAL synopsis*  Hmm...seems a bit different eh? Whatever it is, the story doesn't make the series more interesting, and while it is true for most card game adapted anime out there (Yugioh at least tried and it as an amazing childhood show for me), this show just made the story exposition throw out the window almost apparently and went in its own incomprehensible direction. That is not the vexing part, not just yet.  The characters, be it of the faction they are part of the series, aren't very appealing at all, and that has been the constant ever since the opening of this show. Let's take the MC Kamina Chihiro for example. Voiced by the ever popular KajiKaji, this is another wasted talent of his part here, because this is one of the times of which his voice-acting doesn't really match well to the unimpressive cast of characters, whom are always at his throats. The list of character VAs are again impressive, but similar with KajiKaji's situation, they absolutely trolled this show to bits.  Speaking of the MC, his goal of alliance between good vs. evil becomes a stepping stone for him to transform to the Lord of Vermilion (which ends up killing people anyways). If you need a show that kills its characters faster than it should, this is the perfect trash for you.  The production quality is absolutely perfectly horrendous to the point of being watchable until your eyes close and burn at the insanely boredom-filled execution it does. I have never trusted in Asread to perform another quality show, and 2016's Big Order just is an experience that while similar to this, I'd much rather you watch Mirai Nikki (made by the same studio, only leaps and bounds better). Not to say that I'm a fan in the first place, but I'd question you: ""Why the hell are you watching this?""  If there was anything to go by for this series, it's the music, and it's hopelessly the EXACT same circumstance to sell the show. The OST from May'n and JUNNA are good, but I'd question the same intent as the rest of the show. I thought that with Mahoutsukai no Yome's OP lineup, it was yet again another 100% perfect replication where May'n's songs are lost-substance average-sounding and JUNNA's the better of the two.  I'm glad that many of you heeded my advice, and right now I'm telling you: This is another bestest shovelware from the worst season of the year, and I'm officially done with this shitshow. Thank the Heavens this abomination is over...";Not Recommended
1;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;Flexstyle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Flexstyle;2;To sum Lord of Vermillion up it would be: A rushed mess of a series with so many unnecessary, undeveloped characters and unexplained plot points.  The show was trying to be more complex for its own good and the pacing was too sporadic that it missed out important details that could have made this a solid show.  Story: 5/10 The red mist has suddenly covered Tokyo. We have several factions, but the main two are the church and the Science Research lab. The church’s goal is to destroy Tokyo in order to save the rest of the world and usher in a “new world”, a utopia paradise led by the LoV. The Science research lab reject this philosophy so they started the great collapse (the red mist, earthquakes and monsters appearing). They use humans, turning them into monsters in order to kill all the hero candidates so they don’t create their “new world”.  I like this concept where both factions are presented as morally grey. There’s no good Vs evil here, just two groups trying to fight for their ideals in order to save the world using different methods.  Characters: 3/10 Our main protagonist is Chihiro- a whiny, emo teen who’s a hero candidate and a potential Lord of Vermillion. Most episodes we see him fighting or questioning himself, other times it’s screaming people’s names and just standing there while they’re fighting which becomes annoying, e.g. Yuri and Cedrid start fighting in the garden, instead of going heroic mode to stop them he stands their screaming “Cedrid!”...  Koetsu is Chihiro’s best friend who pretty much fades into the background after the first 3 episodes to focus more on Yuri.  Yuri is our female lead in the opposing faction that’s being used by her evil scientist father and has some apparent romance with Chihiro. I don’t care for Chihiro or Yuri’s relationship. It’s poorly developed and just amounts to them having a couple of tea conversations in a garden, so their love for each other seems forced. We see a quick montage of them playing together in the orphanage, but not enough for me to be invested in their characters.  Then there’s detective Kakihara. His fixation in wanting to prove Chihiro killed his own father is annoying and his reasoning being stemmed from his suicidal parents that he thought ‘abandoned’ him, doesn’t justify the years of harassment towards Chihiro.  Suffice is to say, the characters aren’t this this shows strong point. I’m not going to bother going through all the characters because most are either one dimensional, irrelevant and useless to the story or die off before developing enough for me to bother remembering their names.  Animation: 4/10 The animation is subpar at best. There’s no bad CGI so I guess that’s good.  Sounds: 3/10 The opening visuals look interesting. Too bad the opening and osts are bland and forgettable  SPOILERS:   Chihiro saved the world by becoming the Lord of Vermillion and changing the world line.  How did Chihiro become the LoV? It was stated all the hero candidates had to die, yet Chihiro had a nakama moment saying he’ll save everyone and boom nakama powerup to LoV.  The scientist could have been a compelling villain, but instead he turned into a obsessive, delusional mad scientist hellbent on being with Mitsuki. We don’t even see his and Mitsuki’s relationship, so his motive was underwhelming.  The artificial daughter of Mitsuki and the scientist came into the plot out of nowhere in the last 2-3 episides so i don’t care about her. There was no hints of Koume (our scientist assistant) being a ‘defected’ version to the artificial Mitsuki. Again, we do not see their relationship growing up in the orphanage, so her inferiority complex towards towards her is underdeveloped and shallow.  The guardian of the states are useless, one dimensional characters I don’t give a shit about because they do nothing except antagonise our protagonists who are trying to help.  The hooded guy seems to be the final villain, but he did fuck all except give evil laughs in the corner the whole season. I don’t like the open ending because I’d rather they let this show to be forgotten.;Not Recommended
2;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;Desuicide;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Desuicide;3;For a quick review of this anime: Don't watch it.  The story may seem even a tad bit interesting at first but it hardly takes any time to realize that it is horrible. The characters are very dull with many character cliches, deus ex machina moments, and overall bad writing. The animation/art definitely isn't the worst out there, but it definitely isn't very good. They outline the backstory of each character poorly and don't give us any backstory at all for other characters. The only reason I watched this really is because I was around 4 episodes in and wanted to finish it for completionist sake, otherwise would have dropped it.;Not Recommended
3;Lord of Vermilion: Guren no Ou;AomiTatsuya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AomiTatsuya;3;"Honestly it was rushed more than a sale in a market. They introduce the characters in the starting episodes and kill them one by one. Even final destination gives a breather. The end was so bad that i thought of never giving a review. But i wanted my fellow otakus to be wary of this thing they call anime. Don't judge an anime by its opening. I learnt a lesson watching this. The first 2 to 3 episodes were very well made, i hoped to have a good feel at the end. But the main mastermind still was left standing after the death of the MC. There was only one main Protagonist. They wasn't two protagonists like some animes where one can continue, where the dead one left. Man left with an empty feel after watching this. They tried to create a cliche scene already shown in my favourite ""Buso Renkin"", but this end scene was just poop. Worst ending for an anime. Can't even call it a cliff hanger. Thank god they didn't think of making another season. Well they can't as they killed of the MC and didn't even hint he survived at the end. Meh just watch something else.";Not Recommended
0;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note Special;Fotsuan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fotsuan;8;"(MY REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Following its 2019 TV debut, Lord El-Melloi II Case Files is back to surprise us with a Christmas special episode / short movie. It's not about the festive day itself; it's more of a Christmas gift to Type-Moon fans. So if you're reading this and are not fond of the Type Moon universe / Nasuverse or do not really care about Waver and the Clock Tower, don't bother watching this amazing episode. On the other hand, fellow FZ and KnK fans... have fun!  The story unfolds in the Clock Tower and has a strong nostalgic vibe. Not in the same fashion as the TV series - this time, Waver literally wakes up finding himself in the body he had at the Holy Grail War. There are one or two more reasons (that I don't want to spoil) this episode has this vibe but besides that, the mini arc's structure is familiar to us; it has a villain who uses Magecraft to achieve a goal, backstories, character interactions at the Clock Tower (Waver, his students, Reines, Gray etc) and of course, Waver solving the case and explaining the ""whydunit"". There is also something that took me aback and made me enjoy the experience even more; but if I mention it, it won't be a surprise for you!  The aura and atmosphere are sometimes melancholic and sometimes hopeful; the main idea and Waver's philosophical aspects radiate a feeling of hope and support that striving for the best is an honourable way of living, even when life gets hard. Like in most Type Moon works, in this episode there are many magicians who have taken the wrong road. Some of those are Kayneth's ex-students and Waver's former classmates we knew nothing about, so there is lore and information about new characters from the Clock Tower.  I don't know what to say about the soundtrack - Yuki Kajiura is my favourite composer, and once again she is exceptional here. The ending song sung by ASCA once again is, this time, a different version of the original opening with added lyrics and trust me, it is the icing on the cake. But besides that, there was the perfect music inserted throughout the movie too. The music, combined with the direction, pacing, dialogues and aura I've mentioned before, are enough to make the experience a blast.  To conclude, I've witten this review just to express my satisfaction over a short project like that, and ensure you that watching it will be a great experience. That's the reason I'm writing this simple and informal review, because I'm sure some of you will understand me or want to read a review like this one as well. I want to express my congratulations to Studio TROYCA's work, and I hope this was not the last Lord El-Melloi II Case Files anime to air. We want more!  Thanks for reading.";Recommended

The story shows what would happen if Waver Velvet were to be that 19 year old from the past again. He and his Servant Gray try to discover who it was that made him what he was before, and for what purpose. I really liked this special because, it showed more of Waver's life in the Clock Tower as a student and his beginnings as a mage. The art looks a little bit better than before but the animation is the same. And the soundtracks from Yuki Kajiura are goated as always.  Overall, I think this was a pretty good special to wrap up the year 2021. If you are a Fate fan and want to see more of Lord El Melloi then I strongly recommend it.;Recommended
2;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note Special;LoliSlayer_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LoliSlayer_;7;Its been a while since I watched the anime so I have no idea if this applies only to this special or to the entirety of the series but here I go anyways.  Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Tokubetsu-hen is what you get when someone tries to cram as many ideas into a story as they can without taking the effort to flesh any of them out. The explaination of the primary magic used in this special was lackluster at best, making me confused on what was going on, especially with the way that it twists what kind of magic projection magic is. And as someone who has fallen way to deep into the fate rabbit hole, many of the uses of magic seem completely unfeasable in the magnitude of their power. The story is also extremely rushed, as many of the characters are only fleshed out from small snipbits of their lives which stops one from truly getting to know the character other than the most basic info about them. Like there is only enough information given to have a prelimilary understanding of the motives of many of the characters, but thats all that they have. The anime expects its veiwers to piece together what kind of person each character is, but not enough to make the characters actually seem human. Plus there is kind of a reliance of tropes in the story, as many of the main plot points in it are as generic as they can be. but hey tropes are tropes so i can let it slide a bit.  overall, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Tokubetsu-hen could have been a much better story if it had a longer run time in order to fully flesh out many of the characters, but being limited to being a special stopped the story from ever expanding its roots and becoming something other than a pretty basic story.;Recommended
0;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note Special;the7threvival;https://myanimelist.net/profile/the7threvival;5;I am baffled by the high ratings for this special. I really enjoyed the main season but this was just not it.  The story just felt rushed and roughly put together. I felt like the cases in the main show, even some of the ones lasting just one episode, flowed better than this one. Here, details were skipped explaining why certain aspects were happening or who some people were. And the “reasoning” of the “antagonist” was just overly exaggerated and not properly dealt with at the end.  Apparently, one would better understand the end if you’ve watched some other Nasuverse shows.  Overall, very disappointed. At least the art was good.;Not Recommended
0;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Hakamori to Neko to Majutsushi;LightningComet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LightningComet;7;"Fate/Zero has got to have a spot on many people's favorite anime list, and I am no exception to that. Needless to say, when I saw that a sequel/spin-off OVA to the series was announced, and produced by studio TROYCA no less, I was excited to check it out. I decided to see what it had to offer, and I have to say, I had fun with this episode.  Bad stuff first: its story is not really anything to write home about, and it can be summed up in one sentence. Waver Velvet is disliked by his co-workers, superiors, and successor to the point where they are actively conspiring to murder him. And that's pretty much it. Nothing special, but a decent enough introduction for the real first episode. I get the feeling that this was ultimately for people like myself who had never read the light novel, and was simply a means to an end, that end being to show us the good guys and the bad guys, as well as getting us caught up on Waver's current situation. I will say this, though: perhaps having a prequel akin to Un-Go's prequel, showing the audience how the main hero got to where he's at would have been a bit better. Oh well. At least this episode will likely feel more consistent in pacing than Un-Go's OVA did with its series, as much as I still love it.  Now onto the parts that are good: the artwork is absolutely fantastic.  Re:Creators looked good, like, really good, but its backgrounds were nowhere near the level of this episode. Clearly, and the end credits, I think, will back me up on this, TROYCA got some help from ufotable to do those backgrounds. The character designs were on point here, a definite step up from the train-wreck that was Unlimited Blade Works. I mean, my God, why is everyone's head an actual balloon in that show? And how do you screw up Rin's hair like that!?!?! Anyway, Waver's design, uber-long hair aside, was rather striking: the lines on his face were quite reminiscent of Kayneth's design in Fate/Zero, and I really appreciated this subtle expression of how far Waver has fallen since his youth. Not sure why Gray needs to where a hood constantly, but her design is competent enough. As for the single action scene in this episode, man did they go whole hog on it. From the backgrounds to the character movements, to the CGI cars, everything looks incredibly detailed and makes for quite the exhilarating spectacle. Maybe it doesn't quite rival the Lancer vs Assassin fight from Heaven's Feel, but that was a feature-length movie, so I say ""apples to oranges"".  The music is also pretty good. I didn't find it too compelling or Fate-like for the first 10 minutes because there was quite a bit of comedy, but once the 10 and a half minute mark hits, the OVA becomes way more serious, leading to a fantastically executed scene with a genuinely great track to it. I found that one track to be one of the most memorable parts of the episode. Expect a number of string instruments (primarily piano).  Ultimately, this episode is meant to sell you this series: am I going to watch it this summer when it airs? That's... a bit difficult to answer. The problem I have with this is that I didn't really find anything profoundly meaningful about the whole thing. I didn't see any real kind of message for the audience to receive, and I am apprehensive to hold out hope that the show, even with its greater number of episodes, will do anything differently. But you know what, even if it doesn't become a profound, thematically engrossing series, that doesn't mean I, or any Fate fan, can't enjoy this for what it is. I don't know if I'll complete it, but I will definitely give it a shot.  Happy Watching! - LC";Recommended

Let's just call it the Case Files Special. This is an introduction to the upcoming Case Files anime, which is scheduled to premiere in July of this year.  The story itself is relatively self-contained, and there is not much to comment on. It is a singular special episode meant to introduce the series, after all. Which it does exceptionally well.  TROYCA have knocked this animation out of the park. Ufotable are the long-standing vanguard of Fate adaptations (just check out the latest Heavens' Feel movie), but Troyca has done a fantastic job replicating the atmosphere both of London as a city and the Clock Tower/Mages' Association as a chaotic organization of nobles tugging and pulling and not much actual stuff getting done. Also, glorious animation of Waver getting (repeatedly) pissed off. An angry, overworked professor is something to behold. Trust me, I know all too well. Sorry, Prof. Mitchell.   This special has several main characters, and several side characters that people may recognize depending on how far they've fallen down the Fate well. Rocco Belfeban, for one. For the purposes of this review, I'll just focus on the main Dynamic Duo and their (upcoming) superior.  Ah, Lord El-Melloi II. Don't drop the II, it's grating. Or Waver Velvet. Or 'that one support who never, ever gets a damn break' from Fate/Grand Order. It doesn't matter where you saw him; Waver's the same everywhere. An irritable scholar with absolutely no tolerances and the worst luck this side of an FGO player or a Lancer-class Servant-  I'm getting sidetracked.  Gray is Waver's apprentice/secretary/assistant. She's cute, and later events will shine a light on why she might look a little familiar. Stop bullying Gray, Waver.  Reines El-Melloi Archibald is Kayneth's daughter. Yes, Fate/zero's Kayneth. The one who was too prideful to realize that Kiritsugu was a man who took the term 'playing dirty' and dragged it through the mud then shot it in the head for good measure. Therefore, Reines is just as prideful and arrogant as her father. They grow up so fast.  Overall, this special serves as a very good introduction to what I expect (and hope) will be an excellent series. The El-Melloi Case Files are one of the most entertaining Fate spinoffs, and not just because it's not another variation on the Grail Wars, but rather because explores one of the most important factions within the Type-Moon universe that also happens to be rather under-represented.  Don't bully Waver. He's a good boy who does his best to try to give a shit.";Recommended
2;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note - Hakamori to Neko to Majutsushi;nazsa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nazsa;7;Fate/Zero is my all-time favorite anime and Iskandar (Rider) is one of my most favorite characters. He greatly influenced his weak-willed master Waver Velvet and taught him how to live freely with head held high. This anime features the adult version of Velvet in a kind of detective setting. So I was naturally intrigued and gave it a try.  Pros: Artwork is mind-blowing. Both character design and the background art are awesome. The action sequences are well-animated.  Cons: As a prologue of the upcoming TV series, it didn't do that well to pique my interest. So far, I am not sure what to expect from the following TV series.

Story: 6 i'm giving it a 6 because although Fate tends to be pretty well set with story and lore etc, this show seems to not show that much continuity yet, as a standalone episode it had a pretty nice plot and it's nice to see our boi Waver do his thing in the clock tower for once, but i fear it'll become repetitive later on. Art: 7 it's alright, i wouldn't call it foolproof but i liked how gray looked a lot and Waver, well he looks like waver... the people doesn't look completely dead inside and specifically the shadow shown later in the episode looked believable enough. the cars looked acceptable. Sound: 8 nothing wrong here tbh, i would rate it higher if there was anything completely outstanding in regards to the sound, in fact it was just what i expected and i'm completely fine with that. Character: 9 the characters really require you to have watched at least enough of fate/zero to know who Lord El-Melloi or Waver is because most of their backstory comes from there. but if you have watched that and knows how great a character he is you will understand how much i love waver as a character. I personally was a little disappointed that we didn't see more of him than we did back then. gray is cool as hell imo i really look forward to seeing her character pan out, and why she is there etc. those two kids, i really hated them during the first half of the episode but later on, when i saw their determination i grew to look past that as well. Enjoyment: 10 this is a little biased like the other ratings actually but then again as a fate fan i really always loves to get a laugh out of an anime, and i got a laugh every time i saw waver be his usual ""trying to be good at his thing but still fails"" self. overall: 8 it's decent, i'll say this now, the story doesn't seem so compelling as of now which i fear might actually be this series downfall because as my animu knowledge goes this has the potential to end in a repetitive format towards the middle of the series. but i think just because of the characters i'll end up seeing past that and enjoying the characters instead.";Recommended

That said the story of that episode is nothing great, it shows us that while Waver situation may have improved he still looks down upon by other mages and has made enemies some of it who even try to kill him, but nothing more. Aside from Waver and Grey (his disciple), most characters are only introduced by their link to know characters or their position in the association.  But once again story or character development clearly are clearly not the goal of that episode which is just here to give a quick introduction on what happens to Waver, the situation with his disciple, the setting in general, and the art and sound; the rest can be left to the real show.  The atmosphere is also looking really good, kinda similar to ""The ancient magus bride"", and it's cool for once to get a Fate series not center on a holy grail war of some sort, since the only other I can think of are Kara no Kyoukai which is only loosely connected to fate and Fate food and Carnivals phantasm which are comedies.

Even though the characters seem distinct enough, the series' entire 'atmosphere' feels a little more muted than usual.  ◧ Character development: one episode cannot suffice in order for me to make an assessment, but the protagonist's character traits, temperament, self-image are roughly outlined through his interactions with some of the deuteragonists and through the use of biographical flashbacks.  ◧ Soundtrack: seems to be comprised of orchestral music (violins, violas, percussion, flute, piano, etc.) with some of it being slower in tempo, while other pieces are more upbeat.  ◧ Plot: it seems to pick up a decade after Fate/Zero in London, but there's nothing else to speak of besides the sense that a new antagonist may be lurking in the shadows  ◧ Action sequences: besides 45"" worth of a car chase, there's nothing much to speak off but it was choreographed well enough to warrant further engagement with the series.

The story revolves around Waver Velvet. The first half of the season acts as a build-up until the eventual climax on the train. The ending scene really touched me.

The animation is smooth other than some stiff movements on certain parts.  Sound: 8 The seiyuu did a great job on this series. Waver's seiyuu did a really great job on his voice.

It has been such a long and terrible time since I have come a across an anime with so many lovable characters. From Waver (Lord El-Melloi II) to Gray, to Karabo and everyone else. Every single character at least to me was absolutely amazing. Their motive their actions decision to choices all seemed so real and in character. I have seen hundreds of anime where characters do stupid shit or annoying or out of character garbage that makes no sense. I really wish I could write it down to explain it but I would much rather have a conversation or even go through scene by scene of the whole show and individually explain why I love each character and why I love their actions. Each character has a certain charm that absolutely made me love all of them I honestly don't know how to put into writing but I will try my best. And when (minor spoiler) the train stopped I literally got up and begged that no other character would be killed off.  I could not believe it myself! I wanted not a single one of the characters to die that is crazy thing for me to want while watching anime.  I felt like I went crazy writing that so let me clear my head and continue. Waver was my second favorite character from Fate/Zero after his servant Aleksander the Great or Rider to make it easier. They absolutely stole the spotlight in that series( one of if not the best big bro little bro dynamic/ similar to Kamina from Gurren Lagann and Takamura from Hajime no Ippo) and I was exited to see Waver again after having to drop the pile of garbage disappointing nonsense of a series called Unlimited Blade Works which was garbage and left such a bad taste in my mouth having to drop the 4 different times I tried to watch.  But this series is just without a doubt plane and simply amazing.  Waver has this charming knowledgeable but somewhat sad air about him (because of how his participation in the Holy Grail War went I truly feel like he did nothing wrong but he has genuine regret that honestly made him even more likable and understandable). But for me and I hope other who watch this will truly admire and all the other characters played off of him perfectly.  This anime had perfect interactions between character. They felt like real people not characters from a story. Interactions that were never forced annoying or illogical like many on top of many anime are. All interactions pushed the story forward. Right now as I write this I still don't know how they were able to make every single character even the villains but they certainly did. I have never liked so many characters in one anime as much as I do in this series. Truly well done. I would honestly love to go through every single character and say why I love them individually if I had the time.  The tone of the series was serious but it had many light-hearted moments and moments where the viewer can smile or even laugh that also fit in perfectly and was never out of place. In an early ep there is a moment when Reines get sick and is in a room with Waver alone and makes a joke that makes Waver blush. That is one of the most perfect moments of comedy and warm moments I have ever seen in any media from anime to live action to movies to books. When she said that and you saw that Waver blushed and acted as if he was that teenager talking to rider from Fate/Stay you know it is the exact same character just older. That in and of itself is also a truly amazing feat. And I believe that only a cold hearted person who does not know the meaning of friendship would not understand. It was a beautiful moment.  Another thing about the characters that you see is the love waiver has for his students. It also does something else with this that I've only seen in one other anime in which Waver is the weakest person in the series. That is made clear but you can see how much each and every one of his student love and cherish him. He cares for, knows, understands and talks to his students because he was once in their shoes. I love Waver or Lord El Melloi so much. Again only in Hunter X Hunter have I seen a main character who at all points throughout the story is the weakest. He is not overpowered hes not a chosen one; he is just a person like anyone who is just kind. Watch this series please trust me.  Story: 9/10 The story isn't a game changing new story but it was amazing I would love to give it a 10 out of 10. But I will have to re-watch it 2 more times before I could do that. I only give 10s to series that I have re-watched at least 2 times.But I do know for certain within the next few months I will be watching this series again. I don't want to ruin anything so watch the series.  Sound: 10/10 I guess I don't really care. It could be mute and I would still watch. But it was good. I am eagerly awaiting the dub though.  Art: 10/10 It is Ufotable if it wasn't a 10 that would be a surprise.    Enjoyment: 10/10 Through the roof through the sky and surpassed my expectations. Like I said I dropped Unlimited Blade Works which was such a disappointment and seeing this it turned my frown upside down. The characters were so good.    Watch this series please to show anime creators what we want in anime.";Recommended
2;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;jimfaindel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jimfaindel;9;With each new entry, it becomes clearer to me that the Fate series has grown aware of its own shadow. Back when Apocrypha came out, I described it as a love letter to the entirety of the Fate canon. In contrast, I believe that Lord El Melloi II and his case notes are its shadow. And a shadow aware of its existence as such.  A war survivor following after the shadow of a king long gone, not one, but two different shadows of kings, dreaming with the shadow of a love they assume unattainable, yet worth fighting for. Lingering shadows from time past, and the looming shadows of the fights yet to come. Its no surprise that little Waver became a detective, living his entire life looking for a light amidst such shadows.  Even the production of this show seemed aware of the legacy they had been granted the opportunity to belong to, and saw themselves as working under the shadow of a giant. I believe that is why, given the chance to create original stories for the start of this adventure, all they conjured up were shadows of other tales, past, present and future.  Nearly all entries in the remaining fate lore end up touched in some way by the shadow of this work, and in that sense, it achieves the greatest peek any shadow could aspire to: tracing the limits of the light that spawned it.  This show was a shadow of all that I loved from the Fate universe, and in that, I cannot hate it in the ways it is cast over such love.;Recommended
3;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Agent_Redacted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Agent_Redacted;10;Remember that one retarded kid from Fate/Zero? Waver Velvet? I do. He was probably the reason why I enjoyed Fate/Zero less. I don’t like his character. I don’t like it at all. So what is he up to now? Well...  He became a Lord of the clock tower. He turned more mature, grew, and now he looks even better than his old self.  This show is pretty much about the after story of Waver Velvet. “The Conan of The Fate Series, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo : Rail Zeppelin Grace Note.”  Honestly, this show wouldn’t be as fun as is if Gray wasn’t there. Gray - the descendant of Saber, Lord El-Melloi II’s assistant and student. She pretty much carries about ⅓ of the show by simply just showing off her Noble Phantasm.  The “mystery” thingies aren’t too bad but they’re also quite bland. The last investigation this show did was actually pretty confusing because the revealed perpetrator was some lad I didn’t even know and he wasn’t even introduced within the show.  Another bad thing about this show is the English accent. Gosh. Fuck me, man. They were so cringe. Agh. I can’t. I. I just can’t.  Other than that, it’s pretty cool to see how much Waver grew and how he’s following Alexander's ambition. It’s also pretty cool to see a relative of Saber who can use a Noble Phantasm.;Recommended
4;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;AmericanSomnium;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AmericanSomnium;8;"El-Melloi as a series has a lot of things going for it considering it's a spinoff of a massive franchise. I mean that half sarcastically, everyone knows Fate at this point however that's only what draws people in. What keeps them are well developed characters and/or amazing visuals and battles. El-Melloi does both of these well, with a lot of visual and lighting effects that come off pretty well in most fights(a noticeable lack of CGI which I always love), and I genuinely want to see the development of the cast of characters. Waver returns from Fate/Zero in a strong upfront drive: to make his king proud. The giant arc of his development is him trying to find what his liege from Fate/Zero would want him to do to further their goals. It's honest in the simplicity of what Waver needs, yet still touches on so many magical concepts that the main series' never really have time to delve in to. Although it is based on a game, the thought that went into the series seems further than a cash grab (I'm looking at Fate Apochraphya), yet it still saves time by introducing typical characters that have appeared in much more than this single anime (i.e. Luvia, Waver, a Sabre-knock off, etc.). Truth be told, I kept telling my roommate ""Yeah I'm just watching Sherlock Holmes but if it was a fate anime,"" and I really mean that. The sense of mystery and intrigue that goes around the entire Clock Tower is engrossing. In fact, for most this is the first real look at the Clock Tower politics besides some small ending bits from UBW. Overall, this series is just a really nice tie-together between Fate/Zero and Fate/SN to really establish why the Grail War was so small in future, or why so many families were apathetic towards another so soon. If you've invested heavy time into the Fate series, ""Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note"" is a great way to fill the void between now and the third Fate Heaven's Feel movie.";Recommended
5;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Sevendusk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sevendusk;9;"Rail Zeppelin is a show that requires prior knowledge from Fate/Zero, as it is the continuation of one of its original protagonists. Unfortunately, as a show it doesn't work strongly on its own as the gravity of Waver's situation is only felt through having experienced Fate/Zero. Despite it, the show does still feed the audience bits and explanations for Waver and Gray's backstory and intentionally shows us the meaning behind their struggles.  In its own conception, Waver Velvet aka Lord El Melloi II, has his own baggage and potential for growth. It is without a doubt one of Type-Moon's better written characters as he has his weaknesses, his goals and self-awareness. There are many themes that are thrown around Waver's characterization. He struggles to become a better Magus due to his own natural limitations, but has talents that lie elsewhere. Namely his detective work within the magus world, as well as being able to gather the talented and teach them. This parallels Iskandar's ability to gather followers, hence why Iskandar saw such great potential. Waver is a relatable character that struggles against the unattainable while being very well aware of it. The show itself is more a character study on Waver's lingering feelings after Fate/Zero. He struggles with his regrets, and he essentially grieves for the Iskandar that accompanied him in the events of Fate/Zero.  Gray is our female lead, although a saberface-meme by the definition of the Fate fandom, she stands apart with her personality. She is our sheltered character who struggles to find her own purpose in relation to Waver; paralleling Waver's own struggle to find his own purpose despite his own failings. Manufactured/crafted in order to recreate King Arthur in form, she was saved from that existence by Waver and given the opportunity to find her place in the world at his side.  Each episode initially feels episodic, but it eventually shows its hand that it's been building upon each other. The show, or even the series itself borrows heavily on Sherlock Holmes. Adashino as an unromantic Irene Addler, Gray as a sheltered Watson. Doctor Heartless as Moriarty.  The animation is without a doubt remarkable, considering that it's helmed by TROYCA, a studio partially founded by one of the original directors of Fate/Zero(at the time he was with UFOtable). Sound and music are irreproachable. The OP's sequence, although not a vocal song, is reminiscent to a James Bond film's opening sequence. ASCA's Hibari for the ending song is a soothing ballad, that represents well Gray's fragile nature.  What stands out for this anime is Reina Ueda's voice acting for Gray as it highlights her vulnerability very well. It is easy to forget all the saberface jokes and all the plot points that demonstrate her connection to Arturia/Saber, considering how well they set her personality apart, especially with the emphasis put on by the voice actress.  Overall, it's great for a Fate fan, as it does tease bits of lore such as mystic eyes, overlaps/alternate with certain elements from Fate/Apocrypha. (For example Caules from Apocrypha is present and is the heir to his family earlier than the events of Apocrypha). It is however not a high paced anime, and therefore it is not for everyone. Being someone who doesn't usually read Light Novels, the show does entice me to want to read the original source of the Lord El Melloi II's Case Files series.";Recommended
6;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;tpv0rtex;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tpv0rtex;9;The thing I loved most about this anime is the art: the rich colors, the deep detail, the hyper-realism sometimes. It is set in present day, yet the visuals & attire feel Victorian - suitable to a Sherlock Holmes feel.  I was also captured by the idea of Sherlock Holmes operating in the world of magic. I am a big Holmes fan. And the adult Waver character captured many Holmes-isms (tall, dark, slender, brooding but given to sudden intense outbursts, a lot going on under the surface, more concerned about the case than his personal safety), but was still obviously its own character, not a mere copy.  I felt the plot was interesting enough. I was distracted enough learning about the magical world to not notice/care about any leaps or weaknesses.  The second thing I most loved was the character, Gray. She embodies such extremes that it’s fascinating seeing how she holds together.  Here’s hoping for more seasons!;Recommended
7;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;otaku_J-san;https://myanimelist.net/profile/otaku_J-san;8;Another installment in the Fate universe and from someone who enjoys the fate series, I really liked what they had to offer, it's an all rounder 8 for me, but for those who aren't versed in the fate universe I don't recommend this cuz the world, characters and the plot will feel unappealing and you'll find yourself not knowing what's going on most of the time, but for those interested let's get a bit into details:  Story:  The plot takes a bit of an episodic form, every episode or 2 centers around a case related to magic and mages,(except for last case which is 6 episodes) and Waver (now Lord El Melloi II) takes on these cases, by orders of his adoptive younger sister. now the magic aspect for me is still complicated so I'm not sure I understood all the deductions, but it's interesting to watch how they work it out as Waver's past is catching up to him, there is more to these cases than meets the eye. so I personally enjoy the mystery element of the plot. also the pacing was very good, I like that the cases didn't feel rushed.  Characters: there is lot of nostalgia if you're fate fan, most characters are well known, and most were in cameo in previous works so it's interesting to see more of them, and if you're a fan of Fate/Zero it's a quite a scene, the transformation for Waver and seeing him in a new light.  Art: The Art was surprisingly very good considering the studio isn't a major one animation was okay/good I guess, battles aren't flashy or as good as Ufotabe of course but I guess that's okay cuz the show is not about flashy battles.  Sound: OST was one of the best thing this anime has to offer and I don't always pay attention to OSTs but it stood out for me and OP/ED were brilliant.  Enjoyment: I think it was enjoyable enough, but due too it's episodic nature it can get a bit boring at times but at the end it was worth it!  story: 8/10 art: 8/10 sound: 9/10 characters: 7/10 enjoyment: 6/10  Overall: 8/10;Recommended
8;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;ilFappolo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ilFappolo;8;"Let's make one very important thing clear right away: this anime is tailored to the most seasoned fans of the Fate franchise and in general of the Nasuverse and not for those who have only seen the animated routes of Fate/Stay Night and Zero due to the presence of characters and references from various spin-offs of the series. Furthermore, we must not be misled by the name ""Lord El-Melloi II's Case Files"" and expect an investigative anime that involves the viewer in the search for the culprit while formulating hypotheses as to how the crime took place. The central theme of the anime is Waver Velvet's maturation after the events of the 4th Grail War shown in Fate/Zero.  FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.  The anime is divided into two parts: the first which, in small stand-alone investigative cases, acts as a worldbuilding and presentation of some characters, and the second in which the main events of the anime transpire.  Earlier I wrote that you shouldn't approach this anime with the desire to see cases like those of Sherlock Holmes because the main issue is that Lord El-Melloi II is set in a world of mages. The magic in the Nasuverse, as far as I know, has never been precisely framed with a list of specific spells, rules or limits and therefore turns out to be beyond its users. As a result, the cases presented in this anime become impossible for the viewer to solve. On the contrary, if you look at the anime because you are fascinated by the Nasuverse and its magical system, the cases and the plot can be pleasant and interesting, in particular Rail Zeppelin's arc which explores aspects related to mystical eyes. A flaw of this arc is certainly the main villain, Dr. Heartless, of which the viewer is almost totally unaware of until his appearance in episode 12 and, until the end, very little is known about him. I hope for a second season that better characterizes this individual since in the finale he and Faker manage to escape and it is said that Heartless and Lord El-Melloi II will be destined to fight again.  As already mentioned before, the central theme of the work is Waver's personal growth after the farewell with his Servant, Iskandar. The protagonist, despite having now become an adult, remains trapped in the past and suffers from this due to the frustration of not having fought in the Holy Grail War but of having remained a spectator. He feels that he is missing something to be worthy of being by Iskandar's side. Although he knows of the enormous danger, he is willing to assert himself by fighting another war, but above all to see his old friend again. During the anime Waver matures and understands that his place is not on the battlefield, but behind the desk: his path is the teaching and education of young people. He manages, in this way, to untie himself from the past and to move forward and feel worthy of being a companion of Iskandar. And this is precisely the teaching that this anime wants to transmit: we must find the strength to get up and always go forward, chasing our dreams.  Speaking of the rest of the cast, the secondary characters do not have a deep characterization like that of Waver and turn out to be very forgettable, except for some characters who, like the protagonist and thanks to the teachings of Waver, manage to mature too. In particular, during the course of the episodes, Gray's maturation path is interesting, leading her to understand herself and her desire to assist Waver.  As for the artistic side, drawings and animations are discreet but nothing exceptional. I found the opening titles (ep 1) that flow during the battle between Iskandar and Gilgamesh fantastic. A note of credit goes to the settings, the backgrounds were well made and very pleasant, in particular those of the train. The opening has no vocals but this does not mean that it has less value than the ""classic opening"", indeed, as a lover of OSTs, I love this opening so much that I have never skipped it. In general the OSTs accompany the scenes quite well and there are some that stand out among the others and that I would gladly hear as ""they are magicians"" or ""we call him heartless"". The voice actors all did a good job, in particular Ueda Reina who was able to perfectly interpret the character of Gray and giving to ""Rhongomyniad!"" the same vibes as ""Excalibur!"" of the original Saber.  In conclusion Lord El-Melloi II's Case Files is aimed at a small target of people because to enjoy it at its best you need a fairly broad knowledge of the Nasuverse and it turns out to be a good anime if you look at it for the maturation path of the characters but an anime not successful if you look at it for the cases themselves.

9;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;SCUBAST3V3N;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SCUBAST3V3N;7;This story, follows Waver Velvet, and his assistant Gray, as they engage in solving mysteries, the main one being Rail Zeppelin Grace Note. I was super excited for this anime after watching Fate/Zero, because Waver and Iskandar were my favorite duo in that- so, a story revolving around Waver was a pleasing sight.  Story: The story felt a little spontaneous to start, they kinda attempted to warm you up to the cast and paint an initial picture with some less relevant cases to start, and eventually it transitions into the main case, Rail Zeppelin Grace Note. It does a relatively good job of keeping things interesting with a minor plot twist here and there, but nothing too crazy.  Art: The art gets the job done. For a story from the Fate universe, there isn't a ton of combat, so in that regard, the art and animation is a bit tame. It does have its flashy moments where the artistic talents are shown off a bit more indepth, but outside of that, the character art and animation was solid all the way around.  Sound: This was okay as well, nothing too crazy, the OP was catchy in its own right, even though, it's not what I think of, when I think about anime openings. They used their soundtrack effectively to portray the feeling of mystery, or danger, when it was prevalent. The voice acting was good as well, but nothing too insane.  Characters: I loved the character work here, and, I hope to see Waver and Gray again in some other rendition of the Fate series. I loved the cameos of characters from all the branches of Fate, you had characters from Apocrypha show, some from Grand Order, and of course, the main character being from Fate Zero. It was a joy to see characters show up, and tie into this side branch.  Enjoyment:I really enjoyed this anime, I think it got a tough bill of goods, considering, it was always watched right after Kimetsu no Yaiba on Saturdays, but, in it's own right, it was solid. Like I said, the story follows some of my favorite characters in the entire Fate universe, so, i might be slightly biased based on that.  Overall: It gets a 7/10. I think, the score is just a bit lower, because everything was a bit tame for the Fate universe, you had tie ins, and explanations of things that happened in that world, but, there wasn't a ton of action revolving around that. I'm hopeful that we'll get to see some of these characters again, when Fate Grand Order kicks off in the fall season.;Recommended

Other than the final battle the fight in episode 1 was cool I like Karabo he seems like a nice guy The art is pretty and reminds me of violet evergarden Waver's character arc was good Also, the same studio that did beautiful bones Sakurako's investigation  CONS After the entire series, we still don't know a lot about Gray They don't take enough time to develop the cast so they're all really forgettable. Outside characters from other series and FGO I don't know them at all. Like Svin and The other guy, I can barely remember. Also the pink girl. The final battle is super dull and doesn't feel like a fate fight with a lot of action and a bunch of fancy camera work. Not that it's totally bad but I thought it could be better. A lot of BS pulled out of nowhere like the train having a giant laser powered by eyes You cant actually solve the mystery yourself because the show doesn't give you proper evidence to solve the mystery and pulls crap out of nowhere.;Recommended

In short: What is this anime? It's a show with a really weak, boring, flawed start, which later - after getting to the point, the titular Rail Zeppelin - evolves into something epic. The pleasure I got from the finale was just out of this world. What this anime could've been? A great series which would lock into your memory for months. A series which wouldn't require you to read lore explanations. A series that you just wouldn't want to drop at any point.  Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is a TV anime series produced by Troyca (IDOLiSH7) and directed by Makoto Katou (Re:Creators, Yagate Kimi ni Naru) based off a light novel ""Lord El-Melloi II-sei no Jikenbo"" written by Makoto Sanda. The series is a spin-off of Fate/Zero, which is a prequel to the most popular visual novel in Japan, ""Fate/stay night"". The plot takes place somewhere between 2001 and 2004. The main character, Waver Velvet, AKA Lord El-Melloi II, is a lecturer in the Magus Association headquarters, the Clock Tower. Because of his debts he, together with a girl named Gray which is his assistant of sorts, has to help in many different crime investigations.  I'm gonna start with flaws, because most of them are located before the Rail Zeppelin part (I'm going to call this part ""the introduction"") started. To begin with, Gray. Gray is the biggest plus and minus at the same time. Her voice actor did an excellent job. It's so thrilling to hear her fluently switch between high-note screams full of despise and whispering the level unlock chant. That alone got me madly hyped during the final fight. On the bonus note, she sometimes sounds like my favorite female VA ever, so that's even better. However, while we are at it, I have to mention this: Engrish. I know how R and L work in Japanese so I can let sketchy R pronunciation pass, but ""kuleiv"" (crave) killed me.  Gray's personality (or rather its remnants that we got to see) is also a big advantage of her character, if not the whole series. She is quite a bit toned down when Waver is around, but when he isn't she gets really interesting. Her personality isn't easily explainable, I can't even assign any character archetype to her. I'm just gonna say she is charming, but not stupid, as the most of alike her are. One example of that which comes to my head is that she once bought a gift for Waver, but was too anxious to give it to him. She tried, but time and time again she would back out a second before making the move. She finally managed to give it in the last episode, and the wait was rewarded with a really happy scene between the two. Additionally, Add (10/10 pun, ik). This happy little cube (or a scythe. Or a shield. Or a giant King Arthur's lance) and its interactions with Gray aren't the most common thing, sadly, but my god are they funny. I sure got a good laugh at least twice, especially in the last episode. Its irony and friendly taunts are just on point.  Wasn't I supposed to be complaining? Right. First fatal mistake of the series (funny, like, isn't something fatal supposed to be singular?): Gray's backstory - or rather the not-so-total lack of it. When it comes to backstories there are two options: give the viewer at least the amount of a character's history that you need to and then use it to thicken the plot, or don't give the backstory at all and don't use it as a story expander. Can you guess which one Troyca chose to go with? Anyway, you are wrong - they chose neither of those. I know this series is based on 10 long novels and they just couldn't possibly have fit her story in full, but I just don't understand their move here. Why would you unveil just a little of mystery (that Gray was rescued by Waver from some village - like I myself couldn't deduct that he saved her from how loyal and attached to him she is), but then full-fledged use it in the darn climax of the series? I just have too little information to understand what the priest said to her just before he died - I only understand that it was important. Oh well, at least it was short enough to get me just a little mad. Another got-me-irritated thing: everybody is speaking Japanese, for no apparent reason. The action takes place in Great Britain (and Iraq), why wouldn't they be speaking in English? I've seen only two series with the action going on outside of Japan, the other one being Great Pretender. In the latter authors were able to justify making everyone speak Japanese, why couldn't they do something about it here? It's such a tiny detail, but it breaks the immersion a bit.  Let's get away from the characters for a bit and talk 'bout art style (and the technical execution overall). I like it. Characters are a tiny bit plain; I'd like for, for example, Waver's coat to be a little bit more detailed, but on the other hand, Gray's outfit is quite pretty - although until like the 11th episode I haven't noticed that it was a dress. Next up - animations, camera movement, CGI, color palette, shadowing. These are all really nice. Not amazing, no, but for a low-budget adaptation to a spinoff of a prequel, they're great. Colors are nice and more on the colder side, which fits the mood well. Oh, and I'm impressed with how well did they manage to animate magic. Normally it's nothing hard, but when you are restrained by the way it works (eyes glow = on, eyes not glow = off), animating it so captivatingly is surely hard. Also, god damn was the final fight beautiful, no other words to describe it. Lastly, the soundtrack. It's no Monogatari Series, but it's great nevertheless. Only the opening disappoints.  But I said this anime is flawed, didn't I? As for now, I brushed off every flaw I pulled out, right? It ends here. The second fatal mistake. The one which actually influences on the score I'm going to give, the one which made the introduction such a hassle. Lore explanations. Sounds stupid. Everyone loves to experience some juicy lore. I also do. Some context: I am a Nasuverse (is El-Melloi even a part of Type-Moon? I don't know anymore) fan; I watched Fate/Zero; I saw Fate/stay night both in the original and adapted form; I watched Kara no Kyoukai. In short, I have a bigger than average knowledge on how does magic in Nasuverse works... and I heavily struggled to understand Waver's explanations of not only the lore, but also on what just happened and why it happened (heh, whydunit). Thus, each and every episode of the introduction is just a big question mark to me. Things, however entertaining they wouldn't be, are happening pretty much randomly and Waver is pulling his brilliant answers out of thin air. Even my initial (after episode 0) impression was ""I'm hooked, but I'm not really sure on what exactly..."". Of course, our heroes gettin' on the magic train didn't change anything in that regard, but the explanations then were easier and happened much less often. Wow, who could have guessed that not trying to pack 700 pages into 40 minutes of screen time would make everything clearer. Ah, this really aggravated me. Listen, I've seen Danganronpa, I can sense when something from the source material is getting skipped. In Lord El-Melloi my plothole detector was ringing a lot more than it should. Example? I said this before - dying priest's words. They were darn important, but without context provided from omitted parts, they just made no sense.  Ok, I'm good now. Let's praise it some more. Humor. It's great! You already know my opinion on Add, but it isn't the only comedic aspect of this anime. I swear, I have at least five saved screenshots of Yvette's dialogues and more or less the same goes for Reines (her jokes just couldn't age any better). A subtle reference to the F/sn (""King Arthur was a guy, right?"") made my day once.  We are getting closer and closer to the meat of the matter, but just one thing before that: Waver. I didn't like him at first because he was kinda cold and seemed haughty, he also definitely ain't my favorite Fate/Zero character, but after we got to know him a bit more and learn of his depression after Iskandar's sacrifice, it's easy to start feeling sorry for him. He often spaces out during lectures or unintentionally lets his sorrow out, those moments were sad. On the other hand, his brain is just massive. Remember ""Murder on the Orient Express""? He would've solved that case in a day.  Oh, but I'm getting ahead of myself. The plot. Or rather just the part that is understandable and not rushed (let's keep a conspiracy of silence over the rest, hm?). The titular ""Rail Zeppelin"". Incredibly captivating, making you think, inducing heart-throbs and thrills. A quick summary: Iskandar's coat (very powerful and even more important magic artifact) gets stolen and the thief leaves Waver an invitation to the Rail Zeppelin, a mystic eyes train. Mystic eyes are like superpowers and on this train is the only place in the world where you can buy/sell them (yes, sell eyes. Your own, of course. This happened). Not so long after the train gets off, a murder happens, and the victim's head is nowhere to be found. While the mystery of the crime slowly unveils, the thief from before attacks Waver, seriously wounding him and knocking him unconscious for some time. While he is unavailable the train suddenly changes tracks and goes into a cursed forest. The rest is solving the mysterious murder and theft, which are strangely connected to each other. It seems pretty basic. Like just another detective story. Let me assure you, it's not. The viewer is kept in suspense to the end (hell, even after it, the epilogue leaves just another cliffhanger!). Whydunit and whodunit are supposedly unveiled multiple times, but the real answer remains to be seen. It isn't, however, only a crime investigation. There is another plot thread - a direct attack from the thief. There are some fights (better or worse, depending on the story progress - at first they are kinda static, the characters would just grapple with their weapons and talking over it. They get more creative and nonlinear with time), and there is an absolutely epic final battle scene where Gray uses her full potential (I mentioned this moment like 7 times already, that's how good it is). I liked a lot of little things about narrative. The narrator does not give us any more information than Gray knows (Gray, not Waver, because he knows everything), which does happen from time to time in other series and aggravates me heavily. When there are two plots threads happening at the same time the one we are following would constantly switch in a Hollywood-like way (the camera moves and the scene changes etc.). Flashbacks are greatly balanced, they are never annoyingly long. I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil all the plot lol.    It's getting kinda long, isn't it? Let's get to the verdict. 8/10. Why so high? Hm. You know, I tend to say that ""a good series can be destroyed by a horrible ending and vice versa. In the end, the part you are going to remember the most vividly is going to be the climax"". This is true here. Is this series a masterpiece? Nah. It's flawed, rushed and it just doesn't have this 'something'. The first half is mostly forgettable, because you can't remember something without understanding it. There is nothing really fresh or innovative here, everything I have seen before in one form or another. Before the Rail Zeppelin part started I thought of giving it a 5/10 at most. However, the ending - especially the climax - managed to change this series for better. Again, no masterpiece, but a great way to spend four hours. Must-watch for a Fate fan. Watch out for the cliffhanger - it's spicy. I'm hooked. I would happily read the books... but they are getting translated at a speed of a monkey with a writing machine. I guess I'm better off learning Japanese on my own...  Gray... Rave... Crave... Deprave... Grave... me. Grave for you.";Recommended
12;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;DollParanoid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DollParanoid;7;I like this anime for it's art. So...  1. Art. These anime has very beautiful opening & ending. I can add a point for them. Wonderful backgrounds. Many frames so beautiful that I want to take them for wallpapers. The characters have nice designs. I understand that it was taken from the original source. But it was not screwed up. At times there are problems with the movements of the characters, it is not realistic. But it is a problem from the beginning of the anime. It does not apply to action scenes.  2. Story You have to watch Fate/Zero to understand the anime. The plot blends several detective stories that later become a whole history. The stories are spiced with anguish of the main characters. The anguish will be resolved by the end, but I cannot say so about the detective line. And you cannot guess who is the criminal, because you have not enough knowledge. This is why the detective-story is not very good. Overall, following the progress of the investigation is somewhat enjoyable -- if you ignore that almost all minor characters become detectives too... And other minor characters are strongmen. And there are strongmen-detectives. Sometimes I thought it was a parody of a detective story. Perhaps it was intended?  3. Characters The main characters. Waver looks & acts like quite alive. Also he often crouched in fdeshbacks with story, that had long ten years ago. But he lives, changes, develops, and in general, he is a man of integrity. Gray is a kawai girl with a powerful weapon. She is boring, melancholy, strongly devoted to the Lord. She could be ok, but according to the plot, she has a prototype — epic hero. And she is completely different in character from this hero. Also about appearance. There is a hint of an explanation as to why this could be. The anime includes a hint of an explanation as to why this could be. But only one hint. Reines. I like her. She has her goals, preferences, friends, enemies. But she is not so originally. As for the minor characters, I found a few interesting. At first it's Melvin. He is not often shown, but he has its own story and It looks like he has hidden character traits and motives. Second. Karabo: he acts in an unusual way for a representative of the church. His actions are unpredictable to the end. Flatt & Svin I found boring.  4. Music The music in this anime is very beautiful.  5. Enjoyment If you are interesting in Waver's fate, and if you would ignore periodic problems with drawing movement and the number of detective characters, you can get pleasure. Also, you shouldn't expect much from the end of the anime.;Recommended
13;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Triggerfish124;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Triggerfish124;9;"An adaptation of Fate/Zero, this anime is highly enjoyable for those who enjoy the fate world. Instead of focusing on a glorious treasure, this anime focuses more on the life of Mages and the strife they go through. The anime goes through several murder mysteries that make you realize its not just enemies that have to fear mages; their friends and families are not as safe as they would prefer to be. Before beginning this anime, watchers should make sure they have a basic understanding of how the Fate world works as the anime takes you through one fantastical scenario after the next. Although the main character does explain his thought process in finding the culprit, similar to novels for Sherlocke Holmes (mc even says Elementary a few times lol), the magic and mysteries in the Fate world is quite advanced. I found this anime to be a lovely change of pace for the Fate World and am sure for people who like fantasy, mystery, and character development, you will enjoy it as well.";Recommended

This anime was a unique take on the Fate series. From all the action based anime with a little drama we got a from the fate series, this was a mystery based drama with action sprinkled in there and I was here for it. One problem with the story was how confusing and hard it was to understand the mysteries in this anime. Trying to grasp the root of the mystery was really hard and I could only get about half of it when the case was solved. One thing I did love about the story was the world outside the fate stay night series. Information on Mage society and the infrastructure on how they live was intriguing. Character interactions was the highlight of this show. I love how people act with Waver. They sprinkled in a few funny moments that made me chuckle. One thing I love about this show was Waver maturity. He went form daddy step on me energy to Oh Oh Oh STEP ON ME DADDY and I fucking love it. Just seeing the inner chad in him just pop out was one of the greatest highlights of the fate franchise for me. Ost wasn't memorable for me but the OP just makes me want to bust. Animation was also very clean. For a studio that wasn't ufotable I am impressed. I really have to say I am grateful that this series was created.;Recommended

0;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;5;Like the sands of an hourglass, the Fate franchise almost seems to be timeless since it started. It’s 2019 and we now live in an age where another one of its light novel series gets an anime adaptation from the Nasuverse. Taking place years after the events of Fate/Zero, you have to wonder how the show will be able to keep up its hype. This is especially true with a protagonist like Waver Velvet, a professor from the Mage’s Association. But with a sigh of regret, I am rather flabbergasted at how this Nasuverse anime ended up being no more than mediocrity.  Watching Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo Rail Zepplin Grace Note feels like you are thrown into a world where you need at least some prior experience with Nasuverse. If you have no experience with Fate/Zero, then I would highly suggest at least reading some insight about that series. Before getting to the juicy part of Lord El-Melloi, I should also mention the series is seemingly divided by two arcs. The light novels is still ongoing in Japan with 10 volumes running so common sense logic designates this show as an incomplete adaptation. That’s not a main problem but it doesn’t stray from the fact that the anime feels like an advertisement. My impression from the first few episodes is based on the introduction of the characters, in particular members of the Mage’s Association. Waver Velvet feels like a character who practically lives with his job. As a lecturer of the Clock Tower, the man has a reputation and is well-known for his knowledge of magic. Rarely showing emotions and devoted to his work, Lord El-Melloi may be a character that the audience won’t be easily accept or relate to. On the other hand, I do appreciate a protagonist who is has a strong head with knowledge. Lord El-Melloi II may not be an easy person to make friends with but he is an extremely valuable asset to the Mage’s Association.  Nasuverse contains an expanding lore that can be rather complex if you’re unfamiliar with its franchises. This anime won’t be too easy to understand at first based on its magic system. Some episodes uses a method of ‘show and tell’ while others vaguely touches upon its branches of magic. However, I do feel that the anime contains a feeling of mystique at times. It seems the anime wants the audience to figure out how things work before certain concepts are explained. In fact, the first half of the show has weekly mysteries that connects to the series’ overall themes. It isn’t until the second half where we get an ongoing plot, known as the Rail Zepplin arc.  With that being said, there’s one main character I’m sure fans have taken notice from the start. Gray, the hooded girl with “Saber-face”, is the apprentice of Lord El-Melloi II. Coming from the countryside, there’s a certain level of mystique about her character that will get the audience curious. The relationship she shares with Lord El-Melloi II is that of a master-apprentice. It’s straightforward with the two collaborating on missions although sometimes, it’s shown that Gray can let emotions get the best of her. This is noticeable in some episodes when Gray is anxious about Lord El-Melloi II’s safety. Their relationship is not fully developed in this anime and stands out best at mediocrity. This is in similar stance to Reines, the bloodline successor of the El-Melloi household. Throughout the show, she has a brother-like relationship with Lord El-Melloi II but the anime doesn’t make the pair significant enough to appreciate. In fact, I think this is one of the main weakness of the series. It lacks character relationships that are meaningful to talk about. From start to finish, I can’t recall any character pair that makes the show worthwhile to watch. This is a bit ironic considering some of the previous Fate series usually has character pairs in the form of servants/masters. Even Fate/Apocrypha has character relationships elements that are worth talking about. In this show? Not a chance.  In addition, it’s worth noting the anime reintroduces some of the previous characters Fate fans may be familiar with. Characters such as Luvia and Kairi makes appearances with various roles that sometimes feel like they can overshadow the protagonists. New characters such as Flat Escardos and Olga also has more personality than the main leads. It’s a sad state of affairs when the main characters can’t carry an anime together. Perhaps the better question to ask yourself in this case is how much we should appreciate the plot. An important arc known as the “Rail Zepplin” takes place in the second half of the series with high stakes and mystery. It also takes place on a unique train that gets darker and darker with each progressing episode. Hell, the arc even adds elements of murder suspense that turns the show into more of a thriller. However, the overall execution turns peculiar turns with introductions of characters such as Hephaestion. The mystery involves with a murder case and the Mystic Eyes that fans may draw references from the Garden of Sinner franchise. But with all due respect, putting Lord El-Melloi on the sidelines weakens his character importance even more. Instead, the anime decided to gives more role to Luvia and Kairi during their investigations. Gray herself deals with Hephaestion who develops a sort of rivalry between the duo. The overall Rail Zepplin arc really depends on how you’d appreciate it but at the end of the day, mixing different kinds of genres together without character development is no good.  Even as the show retains a rather serious mood, there are occasionally tongue and cheek humor. The anime plays around with some character gags such as Gray’s unfamiliarity with being normal. There’s even one particular episode where she goes shopping with her female friends. Other times, we get characters acting like goofballs such as Flat at the academy. Ironically, the Mage Association hardly feels like a school and more about preparing students for mages. Outside of Lord El-Melloi II’s class, you don’t get to see other professors or classes being taught. This isn’t Hogwarts, folks.  Studio Troyca helms this show and visually, it retains a familiar look with its other previous projects. As the director, Makoto Katou designs the characters with similar style but also visually enough to make each unique. Lord El-Melloi II is perhaps most noticeable as someone who looks like an older adult and genuinely gives the impression of a professor. Plus, let’s not forget about the technical quality. If there’s something to brag about the show, this is it. The production quality looks like poetry in motion. The battle cinematics looks like watching a film on occasions especially in the second arc. Each fight is impactful and draws out the abilities of the characters. If that wasn’t enough, we do get to see flashy weapons used such as Gray’s signature scythe. Fan service does exist although minimal and isn’t distracting. The show relies much more on its visual dynamics than showing skin. And to top it off, we also get a stylish OP song without lyrics but with a mesmerizing tune.  As a fan of the Nasuverse and some of its previous Fate franchises, Lord El-Melloi felt like watching a long movie as part of an major saga. With 13 episodes, the anime didn’t have enough time to develop its cast or craft storytelling that is worth remembering. However, I do have to give credit about the show’s technical elements thanks to the work of the director and studio. With all that being said, this anime is probably worth watching if you’re instinctively curious about the expanding Nausverse. But if you’re someone expanding a lot from this show, you should turn back now.;Mixed Feelings
1;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;CorkMars;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CorkMars;6;"""You've really done it this time Waver! What in the world is going on here?"" My thoughts exactly Melvin. What in the world is going on in this series????  Ah, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note, this is I think the first time ever I have given an episode 0 a higher score than the actual series!! I have long awaited this anime as a big fan of Fate anime series, and summer 2019 seemed like it was going to be an incredible season!! For nearly a year I looked forward to Lord El- Melloi, Vinland Saga, and Mo dao zu shi season 2! You can imagine how heartbroken I was when all 3 of them were total busts. Fortunately the season did feature a couple sleeper hits in Given and O maidens in your savage season, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.  Who would I recommend this series to? Well the answer is simple, readers of the light novel. That, and people who want more of the loli from Gosick, just with a bigger forehead this time.  I couldn't at all make sense of the plot in this show. Episodes 6 and 12 especially were just moronically written. Perhaps if I had read the LN, and was familiar with every last corner of the Nasuverse, I may have enjoyed it more.... But that's a lot to ask of a viewer.  Studio TROYCA though, I do not think is to blame. They have proved themselves time and time again as probably the strongest up and coming anime studio in Japan right now! In 2018 they animated two major domestic hits in Idolish7 and Bloom into you. Neither of these got very much attention in the west (aside from that ass Gigguk randomly shouting out Bloom into you as he does with every seasonal show), but were very popular in Japan. In fact I highly recommend both Idolish7 and Bloom into you. They were put together fantastically well. Lord El-Melloi II was as well, at least in terms of production. TROYCA alway animate faces extremely well, displaying a lot of emotion and subtle changes, this holds up in El-Melloi as one of the show's strong points. The voice acting is also really well done.  “You are correct Magus. And I have no intent of listening to any more of your nonsense.” The above is a line that doesn't make any sense, just like the rest of this story!!! Sometimes you just gotta ask yourself, what the hell is this plot?  The last 5 minutes of the series was the best part, as all I really wanted out of this show was to see more Waver/ Iskander banter.  Even if you watched Fate/ Zero, there is absolutely no guarantee that you will understand this series. If you don't care about plot than this series is well put together otherwise. Waver also is very attractive which is a plus. Gray was nice but I don't really understand why they chose to keep her hood up the entire series, except for one short scene where Waver scolds her, for reasons that were either never explained, or simply went over my head. Some of the Mystic eyes introduced in this show were kind of cool, but the 6 episode arc concerning them was chalked full of inconsistencies which was truly a bummer for me. Plus the antagonist of this arc had two different colored eyes which always bugs me in anime.  Edit: It really didn't help that the this show premiered every week immediately after Kimetsu no Yaiba lol.  In conclusion, you should watch this show only if you've read the LN, or are some sort of Nasu expert. Just being a fan of the anime side of Type-Moon may not be enough...";Mixed Feelings
2;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;AnimeBW;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeBW;5;...are we done here?  No, seriously, are we done here? Have we, at last, reached the limit of how fucking ridiculous light novel names can get? Was it not enough to inquire after the morality of picking up girls in a dungeon? Were the rascals not satisfied by dreaming of bunny girl senpais? Didn’t we all suffer enough on the death march to the parallel world rhapsody? Must we now be tormented by this ungodly amalgamation of letters and symbols arranged loosely into some perverted fascimile of a descriptive title? What’s next? Are we going to start throwing in parentheses now? Percent signs? @ symbols, dare I ask? How deep does this rabbit hole go? When does this nightmare end? When do we wake up? WHEN DO WE WAKE UP?!?!?!?!  *sigh*  Anyway, let’s talk about the latest Fate spinoff, henceforth referred to as Detective Waver because fuck me if I’m indulging this bullshit any more.  Gripes about the title aside, if there was any way to get me genuinely excited about a Fate side project, following the life and times of Waver Velvet would be it. The snot-nosed brat’s journey to maturation and humility was one of the best parts of the original Fate/Zero, telling a fantastic coming-of-age tale in the skin of the most enjoyable buddy comedy this side of Death Note. His story had tragedy, humor, heart, genuine pathos, all the building blocks that make this bloated franchise work so damn well at its best. And best of all, he was a character who still had so much to explore. Who wouldn’t want to follow this blubbering dork into adulthood and see him try to put everything he learned from Iskander into practice? Who wouldn’t want to peel back his psyche even further and explore how the boy he was influenced the man he became, and how deep those connections might run? Who wouldn’t want to see Waver Velvet move on, find closure, grow and evolve while still being the same lovable punching bag he always was? Honestly, I can’t think of many better places for a Fate spinoff to go than this.  So it’s a real shame that it ultimately doesn’t work. And the problem, sadly, is simple: it’s a property in the Fate franchise, with all the frustrating, bloated baggage that brings with it.  Structurally, at least, there’s a lot of promise to Detective Waver, which sees our favorite son inducted into the El-Melloi family as a way of repaying his debts to his mentor Kayneth, who you may remember as the least interesting part of Fate/Zero. Now a member of high mage society, Waver must balance his personal pursuits with the politics and backstabbing of the countless ruthless factions vying for power and influence. By day, he’s taken on Kayneth’s role as academy professor, but his real profession, as the name suggests, is acting as the Sherlock Holmes of the Fate world. The first half of the series is episodic in nature, each episode focusing on a new magical mystery that Waver is called out to solve. Meanwhile, a larger plot builds up in the background, eventually taking over the second half of the series for a massive, six-episode whodunnit. Accompanying him in his sleuthing are a handful of Fate crossover characters that you thankfully don’t need to be familiar with to enjoy their presence here (Luvia the wrestler is an absolute peach), a couple students from Waver’s class who enjoy tagging along his missions, some political wheelers and dealers, and Gray, a mysterious hooded girl who considers Waver her master and is easily the best part of the series. Seriously, she strikes such a great balance between adorable, goofy, badass and haunting, and every time she was on screen was a delight.  In fact, there’s a lot I liked over the course of this show’s first half. I liked the overall aesthetic and animation, which does a damn fine job replicating the hazy grandeur of Ufotable’s Fate properties (Troyca in general is a damn fine animation studio). I liked the camaderie between the characters and how willing this show was to lean into the goofier sides of the franchise. I really liked Waver himself, who, while still recognizably being the Waver of Fate/Zero, has matured and taken on some incredibly interesting dimensions. There’s a running undercurrent of PTSD metaphor, how Waver’s obsessed with finding some way to speak with Iskander again and reconnect to the greater Grail War mythos, despite it clearly having a negative impact on his mental well-being. It’s a damn well-realized portrait of someone grappling with the past, trying to figure out where their place should be in the world now that they’ve decided they want to be part of it. For the most part, it was what I always wanted from a Fate spinoff. It was enjoyable, it was lighthearted without being devoid of weight, and it legitimately fleshed out the parts of the mythos I had emotional investment in.  And then it got to the second half, and the whole thing fell apart.  See, as much as I was enjoying myself in the first part of the show, there was one aspect that wasn’t clicking as well as everything else: the detective stuff itself. Which for a detective show is kind of a problem. See, because this is a Fate spinoff, all the detective stuff that should be the draw in any good mystery show- the clues, the misdirections, trying to piece the evidence together for yourself alongside the characters- is tied up in the mechanics of the Fate world and its magic systems. And I’m sorry, but let’s be frank here: Fate’s magic is bad. It’s a convoluted mess of pretentious-sounding phrases and ideas with no set rules outside of “whatever the fuck we want it to be”, which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if it weren’t for this franchise consistently trying to build so goddamn much of its structure out of it. It’s impenetrably dense, unfairly obtuse, and you need a PhD in bullshit lorekeeping to even begin to understand it. And every single mystery in Detective Waver, from the murder weapons to the motive to the sleuthing mechanics to the reveal itself, is built out of that bullshit. Thus, there’s no way to get invested in solving the mysteries, because there’s no way for you to actually solve them, because the answer to any question is always just whatever magical bullshit sounds cool to do.  Still, this wasn’t too annoying in the first half of the show. Because the adventures were all so episodic, it allowed the stories to flesh out the characters and have fun beats in between all the magic stuff, focusing more on the actions the cast took en route to the mystery than the mystery itself. They were character pieces that just happened to have dumb, nonsensical mysteries rolling around in them, and it made it easy enough to just enjoy the emotions driving the plot while appreciating the cool magical bullshit for what it was. But once you get into that six-episode mystery plot, everything collapses under the weight of too much bullshit. The obtuse mechanics and unreliable lore completely take over, shoving the characters to the sidelines as the plot piles on complication after complication, each question making less sense than the one before and each answer raising a million more questions in its wake. It gets bogged down in complication, and the easy charm of the first half is lost in favor of exhaustion and boredom. Even as Detective Waver tries to keep the character beats flowing, they’re squeezed out by the sheer amount of disconnected stuff this plot throws at you. So in the end, once again, the greatest weakness of a Fate spinoff is that it’s too bogged down by Fate Stuff(tm) to relax into being it’s own thing.  Look, I’m a huge fan of the core Fate timeline. What Ufotable did in bring Zero and Stay Night to life wasn’t just epic, it was the kind of awe-inspiring urban fantasy that truly captures the grandeur and majesty this genre is capable of. But these classics weren’t built on mechanics and lore. They were built on characters and themes, emotions and hope, triumph and despair, stories of people with dreams and desires fighting to realize them in a world that sought to stamp them out. It was epic not because of the convoluted rules holding everything in place, it was epic because of the stories it told within those rules, the people that brought those rules to life. Detective Waver could’ve been the spinoff this franchise deserved, a story that truly did justice to the heart and humanity of Fate at its best. Instead, it gave into all of Fate’s worst instincts yet again, leaving crushing disappointment in its wake.;Mixed Feelings
3;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Animeprophet951;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animeprophet951;6;"Let's start by pretending that this show isn't trying to be a mystery show, a task which itself is pretty difficult as ""Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note"" is 50% mystery and 50% fate sequel/spin-off. What's left of it?  Well, the art's great and polished like one would come to expect from the fate franchise at this point. The sound is eh...I don't think any insert theme stuck out, though the voice acting was definitely not bad (Waver's last line is so well voice-acted that it almost got me to bump the sound a little higher) and the intro was decently catchy. Nothing atrocious there. Character-wise, there's variety and expression, and while basically none of them had development, one did have some: Waver himself. Still, the way every character is portrayed is certainly colorful but also so very... 'anime'. There are complex characters that express themselves normally, trope characters that express themselves entirely through anime gestures, and then there is this weird thing this show has which characters which do have complexity yet seem to express themselves entirely through anime phrases and expressions. It's hard to explain, and I don't entirely hate it, but does hinder a bit their chances of development throughout.  With this said, the show seemed like it was designed (again, still ignoring the mystery part) by someone under the premise of a bet of how many fate references can we stick in one show. These come in two times: a stream of exposition about random trivia on fate and niche mythology facts, and more direct references like character cameos and its very own saberface (come and get your own for just 298 Yen!). They are mostly integrated with the story and definitely get to show their cool side in a way that I hadn't seen or hadn't seen enough of in other fate properties. As for the lore dumps...  This is where we bring back the mystery element, because ""Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note"", DEFINITELY wants to be a mystery show, it makes no secret of it. It employs a very traditional mystery structure including straight up using the formulas for a couple of mystery classical set-ups. It also continually uses thoses ""whydunit"" and ""whodunit"" and so on..phrases. I think I made my point there. The show, on the other hand, completely misses the point (of a mystery).  L.E.M.II.S.N.J: R.Z.G.N. wants to be a mystery, however it botches the most basic elements of what makes a good mystery. The show always centers its mysteries on elements of the nasuverse lore, sprinkled with a few random mythology facts or rumors to make itself seem more clever. However, either it assumes the audience is informed of these things, or it doesn't want the audience to be able to follow along with the plot until things are resolved by our protagonist in the end.  I repeat: this show fails at the most basic elements of a mystery. Sheer curiosity might generate a bit of intrigue for you, but I'm not genuinely going to be questioning myself about how something is done if the answer is always going to be 'magic' and the only reason I have to think any of what I'm seeing on screen is at all odd, out of place or ""mysterious"" is because characters state it. Nor will I ask myself ""who did it"" once I learn that they can pull a new potential perpetrator out of their ass without ever introducing them.  It's impossible to follow along with the gathering of clues and trying to guess, as even if you are the most hardcore fan of fate lore, you still need to know basically everything about every mythology in the world to be able to guess the answer to some of these questions- when they are even answered. Throwing dice to see who might have done is about as reliable as trying to do it yourself and since the answer is often something out of the blue without any basis on what came before it, it's hard to even be surprised by it.  And of course, there's the resolution of the mystery itself, which as already mentioned a few times is often pulled out of the writer's ass and while it does tie the threads together, we need Waver to explain how. Through exposition, sorry, MORE exposition.  All the explaining bogs down the pace of the shown and what action there is isn't executed all that well either most of the time, with tension being constantly undercut by random spells of unpredicatble nature at best, and pseudo-philosophical concepts that sound like a kid who thinks using bigger words will win them the argument.  If I had to boil down the problems with the plot down to one single thing, this is what it would be: The complete inconsistency of the nasuverse's rules creates a disconnect between the set ups an pay-offs in this show. It thinks that by being fate it can keep you excited as long as it is pulling stuff from the fateverse, that you will feel it is earned as long as its coming from that fandom universe. It thinks that you will be happy with the explaining as long as it is referencing something from fate, that you will be happy with any way for the plot to be resolved as long as it is somewhat tied to fate, that any characters just needs to belong to fate to be interesting. Because of that, it can't make good set ups and payoffs, which means it does a horrible job as a mystery, which in turn really stands out because it sells itself as a mystery show.  Despite all of this, I still found myself entertained by the show, and it was one of my favorites to accompany weekly. I was always eager to see the latest episode when they came out. However, I was still bothered by how cheaply they used fate's content, and it put a bad mark for me on what the show is without the awesome concept of the holy grail war at its back.";Mixed Feelings
4;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;6;"For Want of a Nail...  Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is really a who's who of Fate characters especially if you'd seen OR played from the Fate franchise but for the most part it focuses on Waver Velvet or Lord El-Melloi II taking on supernatural cases while still being a teacher in the Clock Tower. It's not until halfway that the ""Rail Zeppelin"" comes into play and gives us an entire arc which focuses on Waver's main focus and goal come into play.  So for the first half of the anime, we see Lord El-Melloi (can we just call him Waver from this point?) takes on isolated supernatural cases. The only thing these separate cases does is to introduce characters, be it cameos from previous Fate installments or show off what the ""Waver team"" can do while tackling the supernatural case, he of course has some rivals like Hishiri Adashino voiced by Yuko Minaguchi an officer of the department of Policies of the Clock Tower and is the polar opposite in terms of investigations thus her clash with Waver.  The second half is a little more focused and changes the plot structure to be more like an arc focusing on Waver's prized possession of Iskander's cloth being stolen and this thief now boarded the ""Rail Zeppelin"", something like a ghost train to the dead BUT holds an invitational auction selling and ""buying"" Mystic Eyes and it's up to Waver to find the thief and of course...murders and strange occurrence happen while on board. This arc does by all means gives us alot of development of Waver as well as his apprentice Gray voiced by Reina Ueda but once again gives us even more cameos from other installment as well as those cameos doing thing sin the background that has links to all the incidents happening in Rail Zeppelin.  Waver and his want of a nail is pondered as well as tested against with the thief and the strange occurrences in this arc while Gray having a mild crush on her master while other characters test and is intrigued by her ""status"" is brought upon as well. In terms of characters...most of the main cast is developed and a bit fleshed out but oddly enough LA's favourite character is actually a cameo character from a previous Fate installment..that of the wrestling Mage Luviagelita Edelfelt voiced by Shizuka Ito from both Fate Illya and Fate stay night unlimited Blade Works, she was just a fun character and Reines El-Melloi voiced by Inori Minase was similar to Luvia as well as always was interesting when she was on screen.  Now as for the mystery element of this anime, well it's mixed to say the least mainly for the fact that the first half's isolated mysteries don't give us the audience much if any hints and how the mystery unravels itself is all kept until the end with Waver's deductions thus we can't really connect with these mysteries as well, the only exception for LA being the shopping mall mystery as the hints were there. As for the Rail Zeppelinn arc, well since it's an arc with tons of foreshowing as to who the culprit of the entire installment is, the mystery though rather convoluted since the mystery tries to bring light to MAGIC but for what's it's worth they didn't exactly handwave it away...but likely will confuse you with the magic mumbo jumbo and how it all connects, the mystery at worst is confusing, at best is barely manageable as a mystery and of course Waver has EVERYTHING prepared and hid it away from the audience until it's needed. So yeah the mystery element to say is mixed and it doesn't do the anime any favours and much like Higurashi trying to unravel magical phenomenons into rational real notions killed the mystery, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note does it to try and enrich the Fate lore but at the expense of making a rather magical mystery even more magically confusing....it's Fate guys...it's Fate.  If your wondering how many installments have links and cameos to Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note...well Fate Zero, Fate stay night Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Apocrypha and Fate Grand Order and no you DON'T need to watch these in order to understand what's going on in Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note, though it more or less hints that THEIR roles from that installment in question instead. In a ways it seems that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is like a codex for the Fate franchise to keep up to speed with the Fate lore or know more about it.  The animation done by TROYCA was actually very well done, form the crisp character designs to the great backgrounding as well as the magical effects of this anime was great in all respects. Even though Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is something of a spinoff from the Fate franchise, TROYCA still put in the leg work in terms of animation.  As for the voice cast..well we have a large cast but LA might as well do the standouts MVP's and for LA...Shizuka Ito as Luvia (of course), Reina Ueda as Gray, Inori Minase as Reines, Yuko Minaguchi as Hishiri and finally Daisuke Namikawa as Waver.  As for the final villain, he DOES tie things not only the Rail Zeppelin arc but some of the isolated mysteries as the man behind the man in orchestrating everything and thus the rest of the final episodes of the Rail Zeppellin focuses on stopping the final villain, he or more or less his Servant, Hephaestion is actually the more interesting villain oddly enough all due to her screentime and presences all the while the final villain is the cackling ""world dominating"" villain that Waver needs to take care off, while Gray fighting Hephaestion is the highlight of the Rail Zeppelin arc.  If anything along with what LA thinks that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is a codex for the Fate franchise, LA ALSO thinks this will maybe' get people up to date for the Fate installment coming up, mostly Fate Grand Order Camelot and Babylonia...but that just may have been LA.  LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note tried to be so many things at once, one part magical mystery anime, one part Waver's story after Fate/Zero and one part a codex for Fate and became a jumbled mess of what it really wanted to be and let's not get started on the mystery element that did itself no favours. If this was JUST an anime about Waver wanting to reunite with Iskander then it'll be fine heck throw in the mysteries in but when it tries to be a pseudo Holy Grail War while being in a murder mystery genre then LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note failed to notice what it was trying to be, it crossed the boundary if anything. Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note was a jumbled mess of a mystery anime but an even bigger crisis of having an identity and piggybacking off Waver to achieve it's overly complex convoluting confusing plot.  Waver deserved better...";Mixed Feelings
5;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;CrusaderElly;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CrusaderElly;6;"Awww! What a shame! I was so hyped by the idea of a miniseries that was cannon and followed Waver Velvet from Fate/Zero.  A nice little detective show with more background on the clock tower and characterization; no need for much fighting, just cool deductions and Waver being Waver and squeeaaa! ^_^  And y'know Waver was real cool. Glad to have his original voice actor back. It's amazing to hear him do the old-Waver (very fitting), but also still be able to do the young version every now and then where needed. I also love Waver as a character. He's bitter, filled with regret and guilt, hard to make friends with, calculating - but when you do get close, he's a real nice guy who's trying to do the right thing. So much so, he takes on debts that aren't even his'! And I love how he solves his (and others') issues.  But!  In the end, the show didn't work for me. Art and sound was fine. Loved Waver and accepted Gray. I enjoyed it somewhat just because I crave Fate, but I also missed a whole bunch.  Basically, the crimes are too convoluted or filled with mumbo-jumbo that I just don't get any of it. Maybe I'm just dumb; but it feels like the show expects you to know the entire nasuverse, high-end astrology, and a whole bunch of weird rituals to have just a vague idea on what's going on.  I didn't understand the villain or his plot, I didn't understand the fights, I didn't understand the motives or methods, I didn't understand the noble phantasm, none of it. And that made it all just a blur..  On top of that, most characters aren't great. For one, I think the show expects you to have seen several spinoff series, or otherwise be heavily invested in Fate/Grand Order and the like. I recognized a few characters, but most I didn't. And all of them get far too little time, so that I don't know who they are, or their motivations, or really get a feel for them. Which is a shame, because some of them had real promise. I liked the 'filler' episode in the mall, which actually focuses on the three girls hanging out, and allowing us to get to know them. Wish there was more than that!  Finally Gray - she's a new character and she's a Saber-lookalike because reasons. Now, the reasons are actually fine enough, with a bit of head-cannon. I also think she's different enough as a character, to actually be a character. That said, I think she had more potential. I feel like she was only there because we needed another Saber-face, and some action scenes. But I think there was no need for the weird fights, and thus no need for her. If only there was more time!  She's pretty cool tho.  So yeah! Waver's cool. If you're a total fan and/or you know everything about F/GO and all that stuff, go for it! But I can't advise it as a standalone series, to my sadness. :'(";Mixed Feelings
6;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;Mr_Yaz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mr_Yaz;5;"Reviewer's note: This is my 20th entry into the Fate franchise.   ✪ Genre: drama, contemporary fantasy, detective, magic (magic school, spellcasting), seinen, superpower, with elements of comedy and action (swordplay, gunfights)   ✔Positive Aspects✔  ◧ Animation: the series roughly follows the character design standards set by the previous studios, a combination of colors of moderate to low saturation/moderate illumination with the internal and external environments being more muted comparison. Even though the characters seem distinct enough, the series' entire 'atmosphere' feels a little more muted than usual.  ◧ Soundtrack: seems to be, mostly, comprised of orchestral music (violins, violas, percussion, flute, piano, etc.) with some of it being lower in tempo, while other pieces are more upbeat. Also, I've noticed a track or two having Middle Eastern influences.  ◧ Concept: this may have been the first spin-off work that overtly displaces the Fate franchise's general premise, that magicians are searching for the omnipotent magical artifact called ""Holy Grail"" by summoning Heroic Spirits and fighting it out, in favor of a detective story in the Holmesian tradition early on, and in the Poirotian tradition later on.   ✘Negative Aspects✘  ◧ Plot: there's not much to speak off. The first 6 episodes are stand-alone, clearly meant to introduce as to the way the protagonistic duo go about their way, while the next 6 episode constitutes a narrative, sort of. Even though I am fairly acquainted with the franchise, this spin-off introduced so many new elements that I did not manage to grasp them all in their entirety, since I've finished the series with quite a few questions.  ◧ Character development: once again, there's not much to speak of. Even though the series uses the first 6 episodes to introduce as to the protagonists and deuteragonists, and their way of living, there's only a depiction of their character traits and temperament without anything substantial. Further into the series, there is some biographical information given but it is quite limited and somewhat perplexing.  ◧ Action sequences: since the importance of fighting is downgraded and is substituted by Holmesian detective work, it's no surprise that the action scenes are generic, mostly based on a third-person camera perspective. There are few quick zoom-ins/outs, no alternating between different camera 'heights' during battle, and certainly no Michael Bay-influenced, heavily distorted & slowed down sound effects at the beginning of and moments before the impact of high-energy attacks (which are no more than a handful).   Overall: A combination of multiple deuteragonists with both heroic and villainous qualities, along with countless, new story elements and a significant reduction of action scenes in favor of the detectivization of the story, makes for a very substandard end-result.

7;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;lllee13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lllee13;5;"I was a bit unsure of whether I wanted to review this series, partially because I watched it spread out over a decent amount of time, and partially because I am not as well versed in Fate lore as I could be. I have not read the F/SN visual novel, and I have watched only two of the animated routes (UBW and HF), as well as F/Z. Still, I was familiar with Waver's story going in, and I thought that would be enough to understand this series. I was wrong.  Rail Zeppelin (I'm not typing out the whole title) is less the mystery series it claims to be and more of a 13 episode convoluted dump of Fate lore. Dozens of people, organizations, magic abilities, and artifacts are mentioned so rapidly I could hardly keep track of what was going on. The first half of the show consists of episodic mystery storylines which in theory would be easier to follow but in practice introduced too many moving plot elements. The second half, taking place on the Rail Zeppelin train, follows a single storyline, but the amount of different events going on at the same time was dizzying. It is not a mystery whose solution you can guess by paying attention to the show. Plot twists are introduced seemingly out of thin air at least three times an episode. This may not be an issue for some, and if you don't mind that, you are perfectly valid and may wish to check out this show if you're a Fate fan. However, while I personally am rather poor at guessing plot twists or solving mysteries ahead of time, during a good mystery series I can look back after a reveal and go ""Oh! THAT'S what that was about!"" With this show, it's nearly impossible. Not to mention the countless moments where characters are shown to have predicted many complex and improbable events in advance. Again, this is more of a personal pet peeve of mine. It's much more compelling when a character encounters a shocking roadblock and must adapt or risk a terrible failure. Plus, given how convoluted the events of this show becomes, it breaks my immersion when characters has a ""just as I planned!"" moment for something so unpredictable. Finally, while keeping this complaint as vague as possible to avoid spoilers, a series falls flat for me when the grand reveal of the entire series involves an entity which was completely unmentioned by the plot until the very end of the show. While this show sets up such a moment with heightened drama and tense music, I could not care less about the reveal since I had no investment in what was involved.  One more extremely nitpicky thing. The ""WHYDUNIT"" and ""Grave... crave... deprave..."" moments were so comically clunky that they killed any drama I might have felt during whatever scene was going on.  There were a few things I did enjoy about the show, however. Waver was one of my favorite characters in F/Z, and I loved seeing his journey continue here. Seeing how much of an impact Rider left on him was emotional and interesting to watch. Gray was also an interesting character, though I found her somewhat sadly underdeveloped. The art, animation, and music are gorgeous, and I really liked the opening and ending themes. I liked some of the side characters like Melvin and Caulas (though most of them just irritated me). Some of the humor fell flat, but there were some genuinely funny moments too.  Overall, if you are a Fate fan, this series might be worth checking out for the lore, character building, and beautiful production quality. However, don't expect too much of the story.";Mixed Feelings
8;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;SenpaiSkye;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SenpaiSkye;6;This is a really interesting spin off concept. As a fate fan, there a lot of hits and misses in this family series but I am actually looking forward to see how this one plays out.  You see a lot of conglomeration, especially of character uses in this, that are easy to miss if you are not paying attention. I just finished re-watching apocrypha so it was fresh on my mind when I saw some pop outs in the background.

0;Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note;SennorPing;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SennorPing;2;"-Spoiler free review, because I couldn't spoil this even if I wanted to- With a title that slips out of ones mouth as smoothly as corroded razor blades, Lord El-Melloi II Case Files: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is a mystery thriller attempting to follow in the foot steps of it's much more successful and smarter step brother, Fate/Zero. Lord El-Melloi (I respect your time so I'm not going to use the full name) only fails to be smart, successful, and entertaining.  It is blindingly obvious that the people behind this project wanted to work on any of TROYCA's other upcoming shows, or do accounting work, or do anything else. Although I think this show is bad, I believe that it is not the worst in the Fate franchise, that award rests firmly in the greasy, grimy hands of Fate/Extra: Last Encore, as Lord El-Melloi has the virtue of having 1 and a half good episodes.  And now, since I'm not smart or creative enough to write a review normally, here is my MAL formatted review.  Story: 2/10 If there are any major plot points, they sure aren't worth remembering. The Train arc is the only one that lasts for more than one episode, and all I can remember is that ___ died, ___ lost his eyes, ___ killed them, and there was maybe one or two fight scenes. Virtually nothing is memorable. It seems like this show's only reason for being is because someone thought a mystery in the Fate universe would ""be pretty epic."" And I think it could have been, were it in the hands of people who knew how to write a story instead of a plot. Watching Lord El-Melloi feels like you're watching a plot synopsis, with all the depth of a nano particle.  Art: 8/10 It's Fate. It always looks good. Decent art is the only consistency in all of the Fate franchise. Good art should never be any shows best quality. Good art and a good soundtrack should complement the story, not be the only passable things present in the entire production.  Sound: 5/10 Just take the last paragraph and replace the word art with soundtrack.  Character: 2/10 Everyone present besides Waver and Gray are only present to give Waver and Gray an excuse to do things or are one of the three comedic relief sidekicks. If they had changed every characters name every time their name was spoken, I would be none the wiser. No one is worth remembering, especially when the revealed big bad guy at the end of the only arc that matters is a character you've never seen before.  Enjoyment: 3/10 Like a prostitute made of Vaseline, it can barely grab your attention and it sure can't hold onto it.  Overall: 2/10 The fact that this isn't the worst part of the animated Fate franchise really shows how far it's fallen since its inception. Also, a murder accomplice gets off immediately with a plea bargain and is not punished by the law or by their school. This doesn't really affect the quality, I just thought that it was funny.";Not Recommended

When start watching this make me feel like, how could this anime have not been so popular. Which is unfortunate Sadly this is probably going to be a sleeper for most people for a while since it's a Chinese production.  Art: Overall the art isn't anything special. Luckily it isn't bad at all, but that doesn't mean it lacks moments where you know that with better animation the whole anime would be better.  Sound: There isn't really anything special about the sound choices of this anime, it is all pretty standard, and nothing will surprise you, but it does do its job at some parts and doesn't take anything away from the anime, while also not adding anything of much value, past the mere basics.  Character: Some of the characters have a lot of personalities and unlike the normal emotionless MC, Lu Mingfei isn't like them, showing his emotions. The same with the side characters, they all have decent personalities.  Overall: I gave this anime overall a 9, The genre and main character really boosted this as a whole and made it much more enjoyable to watch than one might think. I hope the sequel will be better, when the story proceeds to continue.;Recommended

Exceptions like Link Click, The King's Avatar, MXTX' and Daily Life of The Immortal King are the sole exposure for non-donghua anime fans. I had a hard time relying on machine translation dubbed sites, each week, each episode. If you are about to start this, do watch it on a site which allows only official or fan dubs.  Here's my actual opinion on this show; ♟Be sure to watch the episode 0, it gives good context about what's going on.  Plot: Our man, Lu Mingfei, yes, Lu, is a loose cannon who joined Cassell College, which his dead parents supposedly were a part of. The framework of the perspective he views the world evolves. It's now a magical but limited outline where powerful and immortal dragons are at war with the humans. The college is the supreme alliance for humans against the threat. This first season spotlights the college life, and provides us more information about this world's system through his pov.  Story: It might seem a clusterfuck of overpowered characters battling each other out, and at a super high pacing. Very unoriginal and generic fantasy scenario to begin with. Nevertheless, the developments are bizarre and thought of.  Characters: There's a variety of characters to begin with and more get introduced over time. The existence of factions dividing them is an interesting note.  Action and Art: Confidently, the one of the only reasons I enjoyed Dragon Raja. Sick animation and sound effects, desperate bunch of pathetic humans using modern tech to counter an immortal Dragon. Twists involving an ally turning his cloak to the humans. Wow. As for the art, good budget and mix of 3d to 2d.  Music: Sawano. Hiroyuki.  Dialogue: Trusting the machine dubbing, the dialogues weren't anything special. Far fetched and artificial. However, certain wholesome interactions between the main duo are sweet. The voice acting too is sexy.  Ignoring everything else, most importantly, red heads are a dying breed. Protect. And impregnate. A hot character design in my perspective, Motong Chen is everything you need her to be. An older sister with a hot voice acting, she carries this show.  Finale - '...this loneliness. This isn't ordinary loneliness, its desperate loneliness.' A dramatic and scary experience.  Bonus: The sequel was announced a fortnight back in a Tencent Video Animation Vision 2023 conference, and I was unaware about the season 2 announcement. No English or other official source teased it.  Dragon Raja was good enough to generate enough hype for the next season.";Recommended

He's content to spend the rest of his life in mediocrity, until one day an event happens that causes him to accept enrollment at Cassell College, a school where they train soldiers with superpowers to fight in a war between dragons and humans.  Characters: The characters are well written and interesting. There's Lu Mingze, the strange boy appearing in the MC's dreams that calls him elder brother. Zero, the mysterious blonde haired girl with no name who invites the MC to dance. Chu Zihang and Cesar, the two top students at the academy who are absolute badasses with crazy-strong superpowers. The characters keep the story engaging, as I find myself watching more of the show so that I can learn more about them.  Animation: They went all out with the budget with this one and it shows in the high quality of 2D animation. The characters are drawn in high detail and even small movements of their hair and hands are thoroughly animated. The action scenes are smooth and fluid while maintaining the same level of detail.

The MC could be very interesting, but he gets his op powers just because, with no real growth, while still whining and being dumb. His personality is inconsistent, one moment he cool like a cucumber, the other he panic and cry like an idiot without any actual reason, he wants to be better, but he doesn't, just goes with the flow even though he seemed to be realistic, scrutinizing at first and even awakened some interesting power inside his body (the shooting moment), but it just didn't play any role later on.

I must say, the first movie realy dont help all that much. There is lot of nicely animated characters, that are truly undeveloped, but visualy and character-wise interesting. There is a quest and there is realy straight forward story, with some predictable character developements... well... It definitely is not one of the sharpest tools in the box.  For the things that i liked on the other side, even if It isnt best movie... Action is very good, visuals are well made and there is even bit of a romance going on. There isnt any unbearable fanservise and its made in a way, that is KID FRIENDLY.  Note: the character animation resembles the new Tinkerbell movies. :)  So in conclusion... if you are not expecting anything deep, smart and complex, but want to enjoy some nice animated fantasy movie, with well made action scenes.. this is the right stuff, than can even be watched with the kids in the room. :);Recommended
0;Long Zhi Gu: Poxiao Qibing;Deago;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deago;3;As a former Dragon Nest player who is familiar with the game's story, lore, and characters, I have to say Dragon Nest: Warrior's Dawn is yet another failed video game adaptations. It's a Chinese-American animated 3D animated moviethat attempts to capture the essence of the popular video game Dragon Nest, but ends up falling flat on its face.  The story, or lack thereof, is a convoluted mess that takes place before the events of the game. Apparently, there have been countless wars between races like humans and elves (because wars are always more interesting when they're never explained, right?). Suddenly, a big black dragon awakens, and a chosen few warriors are tasked with eliminating it. Each of these warriors conveniently represents their respective race. But here's the kicker: among these so-called 'elite' warriors is an untrained newbie. Yes, you heard that right. A complete and utter amateur somehow manages to weasel their way into the mission of a lifetime. The writing in this movieis as poor as it gets, and the plot is about as predictable as the sunrise. Characters meet by chance or are magically placed in convenient situations.  Argenta, Geraint, and Velskud, beloved figures from the game, are reduced to pathetic shadows of their former selves. Their personalities are butchered, their motivations are shallow, and their overall portrayal is just downright embarrassing. It's like taking iconic characters and twisting them into unrecognisable caricatures. Bravo, Warrior's Dawn, for successfully ruining the characters we once held dear.  Now, let's talk about our 'hero', Lambert. Oh, Lambert, you energetic battle maniac with no backstory, no development, and no discernible purpose. Unlike the protagonist of Dragon Nest: Shungeki no Sedo (because one Dragon Nest adaptation clearly wasn't enough), Lambert is a two-dimensional husk with about as much depth as a puddle. We have no idea where he came from, why he's swinging a sword around, or why we should care about him at all. But hey, who needs character development when you can just throw in mindless action, right?  Ah, Liya, the token 'developed' character in this mess. She's related to the elves' hatred of humans, which could have been an interesting exploration of discrimination and its consequences. But alas, Warrior's Dawn prefers to skim the surface and avoid any meaningful exploration of themes. Instead, we're treated to a predictable romantic relationship between Liya and Lambert because apparently, saving each other's asses is the quickest way to fall in love.  And let's not forget the side characters, or as I like to call them, cannon fodder. They exist solely to fight, talk trash, and scream at each other, because unity and camaraderie are overrated, right? Who needs compelling side characters when you can just have mindless brawling and incoherent shouting?  Moving on to the technical aspects of this train wreck, the English dub is mostly decent, except for the screaming. As for the background music, it's adequate. Nothing memorable, but at least it doesn't actively detract from the already abysmal experience. But hey, it's not all doom and gloom. The art is stunning, I'll give it that. The backgrounds and towns look exactly like those in the game, which is impressive. The character designs, especially for the main characters, are fantastic. It's a shame that the story and characters couldn't live up to the artistic prowess on display. And let's not forget the thrilling action scenes, because mindless spectacle can sometimes make up for a lacklustre narrative, right? Oh, and let's not overlook the occasional comedic relief and lame accidental boob grabs. Because nothing says quality storytelling like juvenile horny fanservice humour and objectifying women.  Dragon Nest: Warrior's Dawn is a shining example of how to butcher a beloved game and turn it into an incoherent mess of a movie. It's a showcase of missed opportunities, lazy writing, and characters that are mere shadows of their former selves. While the art and action scenes may provide fleeting moments of entertainment, they can't save this train wreck from being anything other than a disappointment. Save your time and sanity, and steer clear of this cash grab. Your love for the game deserves better.;Not Recommended

1;Long Zhi Gu: Jingling Wangzuo;Zmijozel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zmijozel;9;"Seccond movie made from the Dragon nest game environment realy hit the sweat spot of mine. In contrast to the first movie, this story is centered around less characters, which given them more screen time and room to interact and develop. Even tho, Story-vise it isnt anything outstanding and it uses all the old movie/anime clishes, it realy doesnt loose its momentum, and throw you into the seat and wont let go, until the post credit scene, which leaves you with the funny smirk on the face. This kind of storyteling realy makes it kid-friendly, even taking in consideration it gets somehow scarry at some point of the movie. As far as the animation goes, when i first saw the characters in the first movie, I cannot help but to think of the new ""Thinkerbell"" movies. Which means that for me, getting used to the animation style wasnt realy all that hard. Visuals were overall great and the action scenes were breath taking.  I realy hope, there will be more movies in this franchise. It has potential, and delivers some nice DnD action, that isnt full of the ""fanservise"" in the way it is in almost all new anime...  I do recommend to watch it, if you like shows with the feal of the Dungeon and Dragons.";Recommended
0;Long Zhi Gu: Jingling Wangzuo;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;6;"When taken into consideration that this is intended for younger audience, this movie certainly isn't bad. It's not great or original, but it's fine enough for things like family movie night.  The story is somewhat cliché, but that's only to be expected with movies like this. And at least it is not as much of a copypaste as it could be. It includes one of the most overused and annoying tropes of allies getting into a fight/disagreement, usually over a misunderstanding that could be solved with actually explaining stuff to others. But at least this time it's not done as just a cheap way to increase the drama as the finale is getting closer and with the conflict not adding anything to the value - in Dragon Nest: Throne of Elves it is the main theme that starts pretty early, so it barely gets a pass from me. Other than that, this is basically a typical ""good guy protagonists vs plotting villain"" animated feature.  What I liked the most about this movie was the animation, but I am a fan of 3D CGI, so if you don't like it you'll most likely have a different experience watching it. The action scenes are fluid and not chaotic. The character designs also aren't bad, especially the protagonist's love interest being quite cute. It does this one annoying thing though, which is scenes where objects are hurled towards the screen in slow motion in manner that was obviously meant to showcase the techonology for 3D glasses, but it looks weird when watching the 2D version.  Overall, I liked this a bit more than the first movie.";Mixed Feelings
0;Long She Yanyi;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua is adapted from a novel but since I have not read it, I will not comment on how well this does as an adaptation.  Now onto the review; my review can be summed up into 3 words: HOT MODERN GIRLS!!! The end, that's all folks.  On a more serious note, the basic plot summary is as follows: The story takes place in what appears to be a modern world similar to our own (but with somewhat supernatural martial arts). Our MC, Wang Chao, is a recent high school graduate (at least seems to be at 19 yo) now attending either college or technical school, who is lost and confused, like many of the modern generation. He lacks confidence, direction and is picked on by others; he wants to be a hero much like Bruce Lee(?), but lacks both the skill and means (he's poor) to do so. One day during his daily commute, he notices a woman exercising in a park and instinctively feels she is not ordinary and thus watches her practice. This eventually leads to the two interacting and the woman, Tang Zichen, to teach him the basics. After the basics, she decides to teach him as a disciple after testing his character and thus Wang Chao now step by step, enters the martial arts world: the business side, the martial arts side, and slowly but surely into the more nefarious, darker side.  The plot primarily follows our MC, Wang Chao, and it is clearly meant to be a story about him; we can clearly see this as there are quite a few scenes focusing on the womans' sex appeal, much like what a ""horny teen"" would focus on, especially when Wang Chao is either distracted or flashbacks by the MC. This donghua can be considered a story of Wang Chao's journey into the martial arts world; as his skill increases, he is qualified to meet with more skilled and influential practitioners, and thus the world we see/understand grows. The story is well-paced and Wang Chao's growth as a person is quite believable; he goes from a low confidence nobody to become an overconfident and naive fool who gets taken advantage of, but at least he learns from it and comes out better by the end of the donghua.  The action/fights are quite well choreographed and smooth. While not a martial arts expert myself, the theories and fights seem to have at least some basis on what we have in real life. The character models are beautiful and environments are beautifully rendered. There is a great competition and fight to cap off the season, with a lead in to an obvious season 2.  Overall, great prologue/season 1. I highly recommend this if you like wuxia/martial arts themed stories.";Recommended
0;Long Riders!;JustAnotherShiro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JustAnotherShiro;8;There are many anime about girls doing some specific activity, with that activity being just excuse to show cute and heartwarming moments. While Long Riders! doesn't lack those aspects, in my opinion it's first and foremost sports anime and should be treated as one - more about it later.  Story is as simple as it gets. It follows Ami as she starts her adventure with cycling and slowly gains experience and becomes better. There are many cute and relaxing moments, there is comedy too, but main focus is cycling itself. It's exactly why I see it as a sports anime: Long Riders! puts heavy focus on bikes and cycling. It does excellent (and I mean it) job at showing emotions one feels during their adventure as a cyclist: first bike, feeling of freedom, first 100km and so on. This anime also surprised me with how accurate it was about technical side of cycling. Every episode shared information that you usually learn yourself over time - and managed to keep it natural, without turning into some trivia show. I'm sure person who wrote it had personal experience with bikes - he wouldn't be able to share it so perfectly otherwise.  Sadly, characters are weak point of this anime. While they fulfilled their roles, there was nothing interesting about them. Ami was the only character that got some development. I found all girls rather bland and uninteresting. If this was purely cute girls SoL that'd be a deal breaker. As a side note: despite being college students they felt like any other group of highschool girls.  I have mixed feelings about art. Backgrounds were really pretty and seeing those bikes made me pause to look at details, but animation, especially moments of mixed CGI and normal animation, was lacking. Character design seemed slightly weird at first, but after getting used to it there were no problems. And surprisingly there was pretty much no fanservice. Unless, like me, you get turned on by bikes.  Being cyclist myself I really enjoyed it and expect to rewatch it multiple times. Outside of things mentioned earlier, I also found Long Riders! to be very inspirational. I can't imagine any fan of cycling that wouldn't want to stop watching and go for a ride. Now, I doubt someone not interested in cycling would enjoy this anime. I'll repeat myself here, but it's not exactly CGDCT SoL show. If you came here for cute moments, then I'm afraid you will be mostly bored with all the bike talk.;Recommended
1;Long Riders!;Salokannel2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Salokannel2;9;"""Let's enjoy cycling!"" - the catchphrase on the title of this anime. It actually describes pretty accurately what you can expect from Long Riders! With beautiful visual, relaxing atmosphere and cute girls this anime promises you a trip around the beautiful Japanese landscape. The story primarily focuses on giving you the best introduction to what cycling for fun is like and it did it pretty well at least in my opinion. I enjoyed the hell out of this anime.  You can actually call an anime successful if it gets you interested in the topic it presents - this time it is cycling and to be honest I actually am currently pretty interested in riding long distances just because of this anime. With a concept I am so familiar with I didn't actually think much of Long Riders! when I first saw it nor did I expect to learn so much about bicycles and cycling in general. I Thought this anime as more of as an side dish alongside the other seasonal shows but it actually turned out to be one of my favorite shows of the Fall 2016.";Recommended
2;Long Riders!;AnimeFan48;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeFan48;7;Story: i mean there really is no story honestly to this anime ami is walking to college one time when she sees a random person riding on a bike and then she gets the sudden will to try and start cycling and after that she will easily learn about how to maintain a bike and certain stuff about bikes and stuff like that and that's about it.  Art: Ok so ill first start and say that the CGI here isn't the best but it isn't that bad either could have definitely been a lot better (even though i don't care how the art looks) but still it good have been better as for the art overall its really good and not the bad or terrible.  Sound: now ill say here (before i say something about the OP and ED) the Voice actress here were really good here but i could see how they could kinda be annoying (with the characters not shiting on the voice actress at all) but some of the character can kinda get annoying but not to that point but yeah as for the Op and Ed they were both good but nothing id download though.  Characters: Yayoi is one of the main female leads and well like what someone said she pretty much the large breasted girl here in the anime she (like most to all the girls in the anime) have the happy attitude to them. Ami is another of the female leads (considered to be the actual legit main) is well a pretty happy go lucky but is usually overwhelmed a lot and what not when she learns new stuff about bikes and what not basically ami in a nutshell. Aoi is another female lead and well again mostly happy and go lucky and Ami's best friend (she of course gets more friends but at the start of the anime she is probably her only friend) again like most she does kinda get embarrassed here and the like all the girls here but again all of them are good. Hinako is another female lead and well she can kinda be abrasive (its not the bad but like to a extent she can be) and like the rest just a happy go lucky person. Saki is the last female lead and well she is a pretty hungry person and (and also shows up a little later in the anime) again another happy person nothing more.  Enjoyment: What i liked: i mean the comedy is here (not as much) but when it was it was really good and also the for being enjoyable it was really (even though i don't cycle it was still enjoyable to watch) also learning about different stuff when it comes to bikes and how to be prepared for certain stuff when dealing with your bike was really interesting. What i didn't like: ok so the comedy here wasn't really there if at all again the few spots it did have comedy it was really good but again comedy wasn't there as much and also the CGI isn't the greatest either here probably my only real complaints with the anime.  Overall: im giving this a 7 ( i probably would have giving this a 8 if the comedy here was there and was really good) but again comedy is decent at best also if your into cycling or not you'll still enjoy this anime as did i its a anime that is worth the watch for sure.;Recommended
0;Long Riders!;Tenth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tenth;6;"*I'm by no means a bicyclist and haven't even touched a bike in years so don't expect any in-depth details or knowledge from me, I'm only in for CGDCT*  Long Riders, a 12 episodes anime airing in the Fall 2016 season that should have been done in December like everything else with the same amount of episodes but went through a production hell with episodes being delayed and struggling to even make the animation decent. Seems to be a recurring thing with Studio Actas from what I've seen from them with Regalia being the last I saw from them, halting the production too. But now it's done so I can talk about it.  Plot/Characters:  When it comes to plot in a bicycle comfy SoL show there really isn't much to say that doesn't combine it with the characters as it's all about the characters and their motivations or well...mostly just our protagonist motivations. We follow the newbie Ami who always had an interest in cycling but never really dared to get into it until it kinda randomly happens in the first episode with her already experienced bicycler friend, Aoi deciding to help her out with Ami's decision to get into bicycling. And then on from there it's kinda just all about Ami learning new things and what to buy, meet more bicyclers that then teach her even more new stuff to improve etc.  The thing is that this is a comfy SoL so there really is not any competitiveness since Ami is new to all this and is learning throughout all the season as a hobby atleast at the start, so which is why there really is not much to say about the plot in this, there is basically none. It's mostly just info dump after info dump and hell even I learned about a lot just watching this actually. On that front it's great and you see Ami definitely develops into a great character by the end of it, loved how it all came back together at the end with everything she learned.  Even though I like Ami and her learning and me myself as a viewer on that, here is what's really worst about this show. The supporting cast, they are basically just pure info dumps characters with no development whatsoever throughout this show. They all have their cliché trope personality like the short abrasive blonde and her mature busty ""ara ara"" friend and then later on another black-haired character that looks way too much like Aoi so I mistook her several times.... they are all just sorta there giving info and there was no ""breather"" episode where they didn't bicycle and just talked and get to know each other much on a personal level, I found it kinda baffling how they would just help each other out so much given how little they really knew about each other. It was obvious though they wanted Ami to get all the focus and develop her the most since she was the most inexperienced. But they most likely would have given the supporting cast more personality and background if they got more episodes than 12, assumingly.  Animation & Sound:  Well like I mentioned at the start of the review this sure had a lot of struggles, this could only look decent at best but those best times didn't happen much even after those two delays around the start and the middle parts. The funny thing is that they put out a recap episode of SoL show with no plot like that would ever be needed. Anyways the eyes could look real derpy sometimes so they sorta looked cross-eyed or that the lip-syncing was not all there and looked weird etc. And the 3DCG elements which they used from time to time when they were bicycling looked real choppy like 10-15 fps which still not many can make smooth these days. So lots of awkward scenes like that but I will give them this, the last two delayed episodes did look great, I didn't spot any awkward animation even with the 3DCG moments so good on them really using that time to make it look good.  To round it off I consider the last two episodes to be the best out of the whole show both animation wise and how it ended, too bad the quality wasn't like that throughout and it probably won't get a second season, oh well I did enjoy it for what it was even though it lacked on several levels.

1;Long Riders!;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;6;"Ummmm Long Riders, LA thinks Bakuon!! will like to have a word with ya.....  Ok so right off the bat, LA thinks to compile how LA feels about Long Riders is through it's strengths and flaws, like typical LA?...shall we?  Long Riders' strengths have alot what usual slice of life, ""healing"" animes partakes in but under a complete amateur by the name of Ami Kurata voiced by Nao Touyama wanting to learn about biking and later on marathon runs for biking. As much as Long Riders' characters aren't the best connected, they still have their camaraderie through their running gags and their conjoined interests in biking. The running gags aren't that bad in terms of comedic stance either. Such running gags as Ami spending ridiculous amounts of money to buy ""upgrades"" for her bike, Hinako Saijou's secret part-time job, Saki Takamiya's almost bottomless stomach and finally Hinako and later on Saki's teasing to Ami about more ""advanced"" marathon biking, the running gags are slightly overdone but they DON'T overstay their welcome. The animation quality can be dodgy at times but the beautiful scenery of Long Riders is decent at best (not Amanchu! material, but still beautiful scenery of Japan's many landscapes nonetheless) The final strength to Long Riders would easily be Long Riders being a biking ""healing"" anime can quite easily be one of the more relaxing anime out there but with one little catch, but LA will be talking about that right now.  Ok, now flaws, LA will immediately talk about Long Riders' constant delays when it was released in Fall 2016, in which LA can't even see HOW they got into constant delays, quietly annoying LA in the process (3 times in total with the final delay of the final 2 episodes delayed til the first quarter of Winter 2017), next flaw is the god awful implementation of 3D CGI on both the models and the bicycles at the same time, sure LA ignored them at first, but further down the line the CGI became BLATANT and worse to the point of being unnecessary of even having the CGI as the traditional animation transitions were better quality in certain frames than the CGI'd frames which brought focus to the awful CGI. Next is well, characters, sure as a group, their camaraderie and friendship is ok, ok when their talking about biking and whatnot, but their friendship outside of it is minimal at best resorting to again the running gags and their love of biking LA said above. Ami is your ditz, Yayoi is your ojou, Hinako is your genki yet slightly brash one, Aoi is your caring one and Saki is your aloof one...wait those are the main characters from K-On!-!?...well these kind of archetypes are to be expected in these kinds of anime. Finally, Long Riders' BIGGEST flaw is that Long Riders is a certain case of curing your insomnia considering how extremely slow pace and how they portray their biking. LA isn't kidding, there were many cases where LA felt like dozing off. LA knows that healing anime can brighten your day up by showing typical day to day activities of the character's hobbies and whatnot.....not darken your day by closing your eyes because Long Riders was ridiculous in this. Worse yet it that due to LA's thinking and to the point of making LA sleepy when watching this anime, it felt like this anime didn't have much to unpack considering it's lacking content and it's narrow focused narrative. However to defend the insomnia-curing pacing a little is that, LA can guess some of the audience might actually enjoy the slow pacing and LA was one of them but later on it just kinda hit LA and LA started to notice it through LA dozing off...to each their own with this flaw is all LA is gonna say.  Even though LA already talked about the characters in the flaws sections, LA does kinda want to get into more detail about them. Ami Kurata is LA's favourite character for one all due to her infectious enthusiasm towards her liking to biking and she is your audience stand-in due to her being a newbie to biking, add with Nao Touyama's vocals and you have LA's favoruite character, thankfully she does bounce off well with Hinako Saijou voiced by Rumi Ookubo, usually since she too is the genki yet more abrasive one compared to Ami but has some good comedic moments together with the rest of Fortuna (the main cast's biking group name). Aoi Niigaki voiced by Hiromi Igarashi along with Yayoi Ichinose voiced by Yurika Kurokawa having the most limited screentime individually all due to the fact that Yayoi is the satellite character to Hinako and Aoi to Ami, they both do have their moments though. Finally we have Saki Takamiya voiced by Yoko Hikasa, the aloof ""expert"" of the group who arrives much later and was already friends with Hinako and Yayoi, also her appetite is essentially her quirk as she talks about great food or is eating in most of her screentime outside biking and Saki is the embodiment of the great food you'll eat if you want to marathon bike in Japan. Dynamically, the Fortuna group is somewhat loose with their friendship all due to the anime's narrow-focused mindset on biking through giving Ami LOTS of obstacles in her wanting to really get into biking (from her lacking stamina and needing upgrades for her bike) and everyone being absent-minded to Ami until she gets into trouble which allows the rest of the Fortuna group to expound on more biking facts and tips and all this compensates with the characters' running gags which is decisive if it works or not. As for LA, LA just didn't mind the characters and their running gags that much but they weren't the best dynamically-close net group and individually they are lacking a bit more personality besides their character archetype and their love of biking.  In terms of animation by Actas and LA already said about the awful 3D CGI as well as the stunning backgrounds in which the characters are technically rewarded with it as well. The character designs are expected moe though slightly bland at times (LA saw Ami's character designs as well as Hinako's to be the most defined with Aoi and Saki's character designs being the most similar to each other though easily known who's who by their hair style and what's in front of them) the non-CGI biking scenes aren't that bad either as they are technically in constant motion and all and there are some blend to CGI with that but even those moments are ok animation, but coupled that with awful 3D CGI animation (to the point the 3D CGI almost looked like early PS2 smooth animation which isn't a good thing by the way). Overall Actas did a mediocre job for LA, LA didn't hate it as it compensated both ways but not giving it too much grace to completely ignore it's flaws.  In terms of voice acting, well here comes the obvious again but LA's favorite voice actor went to Nao Touyama in making a typical ditzy character somewhat endearing and for a typical genki character, Nao Touyama definitely had RANGE making for great comedic timing and sometimes outlandish genki moe vocals work, Yurika Kurosawa had tendency to be even more high pitched like Nao Touyama and it's her default ojou vocals at that but it wasn't to the point of annoyance. LA found Rumi Ookubo, Yoko Hikasa and Hiromi Igarashi's vocals to be decent at least and the entire cast's vocal chemistry made the vocal cast pretty well done (if you can manage the squeak from Yayoi, bit from Hinako and Ami anyways).  Long Riders being a slice of life healing anime, LA can be lenient to this anime from it's simple plot of a girl wanting to learn biking and later on gather a group to do it with her to it's lacking character personalities, Actas' constant delays to this anime and LA likes this anime for doing what it's suppose to do, to ""show that biking is a fun thing to do, to explore, to eat and just take in the sights"" just with a *ahem* small fee for bike upgrades and it IS relaxing HOWEVER not to the point of insomnia curing pacing, disjointed group dynamics within the characters AND it's awful and awkward 3D CGI animation. Long Riders isn't a horrible anime per say as LA makes it out to be, flaws and all. It just became mediocre at best by the finishing line with it's strengths and flaws and just how LA felt about this experience as a whole and is what unfortunately how Long Riders just turned out to be. This coming from a person who initially really liked Long Riders for the better part of 6 episodes and wanted to see a decent slice of life healing anime about biking. Long Riders isn't horrible....boring sometimes maybe, but mediocre at best.  Anyone want to watch Bakuon!!?";Mixed Feelings
2;Long Riders!;RESOLVING_POWER;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RESOLVING_POWER;6;I watched Long Riders. Here are my thoughts:  Overall low-budget visuals. Which is kind of a shame because this is the kind of show that would benefit tremendously from high visual production value. Crude CGI is frequently used during the biking scenes, and in general there are many 'quality' moments. For the record, I watched the Blurays.  I was happy to see that a decent amount of attention was paid to technical aspects of biking. It did feel like the creators actually did cycling as a hobby. That kind of authenticity is a major plus in my mind. Serious performance cycling has always seemed like an interesting hobby to me, so naturally I was interested in watching this anime. I was glad that it took the hobby seriously and made it a significant focus of the show, instead of just using it as a superficial excuse for another cookie-cutter CGDCT anime.  The characters are very bland, but it's a non-dramatic sports show so I didn't expect otherwise.  This anime pretty much did what I expected. It's basically a biking-with-friends simulator. It was fairly comfy. Aside from the biking theme, which I did enjoy, it felt like a generic anime with no other noteworthy qualities.  OST and voice acting were unremarkable. I liked the OP song though. The various subtle sounds of cycling were handled alright as well.  Road cycling in real life terrifies me for safety reasons even though I enjoy biking in general. It was nice to live vicariously through this anime, even though it was kind of mediocre.   My personal overall rating: 6/10 It was adequate. From an artistic perspective this anime is bad, but it does a good job of exploring the cycling theme in an authentic way. My enjoyment was mostly derived from using this anime as an activity simulator.  If you're looking for an anime that genuinely focuses on the activity that it's supposed to be about, then Long Riders might be worth your time. However, if you're looking for memorable characters, or a good story, or nice audiovisual production, then you're better off looking elsewhere.  I ship Ami and Aoi together. The naive girl and the mature girl together is an appealing character dynamic.  I liked this anime more than its motorized counterpart, Bakuon. Long Riders was comfier whereas Bakuon was filled with unfunny comedy and didn't focus on actual (motor)cycling enough.;Mixed Feelings
0;Lolita Anime;eririri;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eririri;7;"Being the first animated hentai series, Lolita Anime is perhaps most often watched nowadays for its historic value. Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by.  Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions.  Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.";Recommended
0;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;8;For years, the concept of a 3rd season of Log Horizon seemed like a pipe-dream. After the author went through a tumultuous tax-evasion case the series went on a hiatus and most of the momentum seemed to have been killed. Seasons 1 and 2 were extremely well received and offered a unique political and economic style approach to the isekai genre. When we got news that season 3 had been green-lit, I couldn’t believe my eyes, but it immediately became my most anticipated sequel.  Unfortunately, this third season of the beloved LN series failed to capture the glory of its first two seasons. All the same themes that we know and love about Log Horizon are there, but they just don’t feel the same. The first arc is a political power struggle that’s pretty good, but nothing amazing. The second mini-arc focusing on Krusty was really what most fans of the series were looking forward to seeing adapted, and I do think that was a very enjoyable set of episodes, the peak of the season for sure. The finale arc was also pretty fun and gave some really nice shine to Minori, who has always been my favourite  Log Horizon has always been a slow, dialogue driven show. But this season just felt 100x slower. I also felt that the quality of episodes was inconsistent. Episode 11 for example is amazing, definitely the best episode we’ve had since season 2, but then the episode before that was pretty “meh”. If I had to identify a reason as to why the season was so inconsistent, it would probably be because of the small amount of content that was available to adapt. As I mentioned earlier, the author’s tax-evasion situation really put the series on hold and it’s only recently got back to being updated. Therefore, parts of this season were always going to be stretched and paced weirdly, which showed.  Overall, the pacing issues are definitely noticeable in this season of Log Horizon. At times things seem to be dragging on forever. But, the highs of the season, such as Krusty and Minori’s mini-arcs really were enjoyable to me and made me nostalgic of the first two seasons. The finale single handedly raised my score for the show. Hopefully, the series begins to get more consistent updates and we don’t have to be left in limbo about a potential season 4 as long as we were for 3. If you’ve seen the first two seasons and liked them, it goes without saying that you should watch the latest season, just be prepared for a drop in quality.  Log Horizon season 3 gets 8 round tables out of 10.;Recommended
1;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Eanki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eanki;7;"A couple of years ago, I watched a YouTube video about Isaac Asimov and sociological storytelling. That video links a blog from Scientific American, “The Real Reason Fans Hate The Last Season of Game of Thrones” by Zeynep Tufekci, which posits that it’s not just bad storytelling –its because the storytelling style shifted away from sociological storytelling to focus solely on psychological storytelling. I have never actually read the blog until I watched the first episode of Log Horizon Season 3 And that is when it struck me: I may have found one thing that helped in giving people the feeling that Season 1 and Season 2 hit differently. Season 1’s two starting arc focused heavily on the sociological side – or rather, the main cast, the adult cast as they say, are better suited to a more sociological framing. The youngling cast arc are more psychological in nature. Season 2 even at its best arcs was framed around the psychological storytelling side – yes, even the “adult cast”. Maybe it was not made to be told that way, but it was framed that way.  Before we dive into it, we should start with definitions first because this might be confusing since these are not exactly literary classifications, just some shorthand that has been used by some people.  Tufekci wrote: “In sociological storytelling, the characters have personal stories and agency, of course, but those are also greatly shaped by institutions and events around them. The incentives for characters’ behavior come noticeably from these external forces, too, and even strongly influence their inner life.”  In what he calls psychological storytelling, the story is primarily about the characters as individuals and their internal struggles, change, and development. In sociological stories, the incentives of a political or social system helps determine the choices a character make.  We can see an extremely basic example of “sociological storytelling” in the Player Killer group who ambushed Shiroe, Naotsugu, and Akatsuki in the forest way back in the first couple of episodes of the first season. That PK group settled down and even created their own merchant stall. Was there some character defining revelation on that night they got beaten that taught them PK is bad? Maybe. Maybe not. What did happen though is that after Shiroe’s food revolution and creation of the Round Table, there was little incentive to be rogue player killers and a lot of incentives to be peaceful and engage in trade to make oneself rich and also not bored out of their minds. That is “sociological storytelling”.  Now I don’t subscribe to such clear-cut divisions between two storytelling methods because stories aren’t just one or the other in my personal experience; it’s a little bit of both, with one side being the more dominant over the other, a fluctuation that varies from story to story. Often, even in the same story, there are characters whose stories are sociological storytelling dominant and characters whose stories are psychological storytelling dominant. What I just want to do is establish the shorthands I will be using: “sociological” and “psychological”.  Now on to the review. There are three major arcs to this season, one too much for a 12 episode season. The first arc of the third season was poised to be a sociological dominant storytelling. It promises the fracture of the current status quo and the collapse of the Round Table. This is not a spoiler; this is a tagline the whole third season runs with. It both achieve and did not achieve its goals. The first arc was so confusingly and infuriatingly half foot in, half foot out of the status quo fracture. Season 2 set up future plot threads to shake the status quo and one of them, this one, resulted in much ado over nothing. For an arc with a sociological setup, there was only one sociological status quo change involving the People of the Land. It is not so much under-delivering on the premise of the collapse of the Round Table, although it was under-delivering, as it was postponing a reckoning and just leaving a thread for a future plot thread to be revisited. This arc does leave some truly potentially big plot threads open for future use and two big game mechanics related shenanigans. Enjoyment of this arc may hinge crucially on whether you enjoy speculations and theories. If you just want a solid enjoyable arc, this arc is not it chief.  The worst part of the first arc was that it was rushed. It is okay to be just a setup arc. It is not okay to be a setup arc that was also rushed and not fully fleshed out. For a political game with potentially huge plot relevant stakes about the future of Akiba, there was so little intrigue and games. The “winning tactic” was a basic twist anybody could see coming with the wording of the rules of the major arc event. The real status quo change that affected this arc involves the Fairy Rings but the season does not explore it further. It is for the future seasons. And the collapse of the Round Table that could have been rooted in the sociological issues it failed to address was answered instead using a psychological factor: one character really taking on a firm stance on where she wants to be.  If your enjoyment of Log Horizon resonated with my intro, this may not be an enjoyable season for you. The second and third arc of the season are psychological dominant storytelling. However, if your enjoyment of Log Horizon predicates on the gaming aspect or the character development aspect, then the third arc may be the arc for you.  The second arc is nothing grand initially but it does introduce both the Moon in slightly more detail (well, glimpses more like) and a potentially game-changing mechanic with regards to the People of the Land. Knowing the author, it will be something that will come again in the future and it may not always be a helpful mechanic. For now, this mechanic and the Fairy Rings of the first arc serve only to positively help the characters we are rooting for. Hopefully, these setups pay off and the third arc gives me hope that it will.  In the third arc, Log Horizon seemingly returns to a semblance of form by introducing an arc that can stand on its own and exploits a game mechanic to turn the tables on the players/adventurers. Log Horizon revels in using a new interpretation of previously introduced game mechanics to expand the details of its world. This is worldbuilding by extrapolating the many ways how a mechanic affects the world and it is peak Log Horizon in many ways.  Log Horizon is back!  And I cannot wait where the setups in this season take us next.";Recommended

3;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;sixfourone;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sixfourone;8;"Let’s make this review short.  If you’re looking for a show that has lots of action like Sword Art Online, this show probably isn’t for you. There are a lot of dialogues; discussions about politics, economy, and other topics will likely bore the typical viewer that enjoys watching action-filled shows. The show also requires you to have watched the previous seasons or at least do some online research to get an idea of what’s happening.  Going over the technical aspects of the show, the sound and animation are just average compared to the other popular shows airing in the same season. Pacing is also an issue for some viewers.  The show has a lot of flaws and will not appeal to everyone. But if you’re still willing to give it a chance, Log Horizon has also a lot of things to offer.  One of Log Horizon’s greatest strengths is its worldbuilding. Dialogues about politics, economy, and MMORPG mechanics aren’t just there for show. It plays a role in advancing the story and helping you gain more insights into the world of Theldesia. The way this information is explained isn’t forced and is simple to understand. It also adds depth to the characters by letting you know their motivations behind their actions.  Another great thing about Log Horizon is its strong MMORPG elements. The way the MMORPG concepts in the show are explained and applied tells you that the author is someone who has played MMORPGs. Most of the big fights in the show are often portrayed through raids that involve many characters fighting a stronger opponent.  If you’re someone who appreciates the little details that contribute to worldbuilding, you’ll enjoy the dialogues about politics, economy, and MMORPG mechanics that separate the show from the others.  Some may find the story this season to be weaker compared to the previous seasons, but that doesn’t mean that it’s a bad story. The first half can be a bit dragging for some with all the dialogues, but you'll see more action scenes in the second half of the show.  If you're a long-time fan of the series, definitely give this one a try.";Recommended
4;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;ylight67;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ylight67;9;"tl;dr: if you enjoyed the first two seasons, you are going to enjoy this one as well  The first 4-5 episodes felt pretty slow and weird (I can't put my finger on exactly how it could have been better) and some conclusions I've seen were concerning as if they were just looking to quickly wrap up the series. If it was another 25 eps long season (so perhaps if they waited more for the source material to progress), it would much easier to swallow. To be fair, though, they gave us a little bit of everything and the season came to a very good ending, in terms of content, so for a season of comeback, I believe it is satisfying and is underrated generally. That being said, there must be at least one more season released in the future, whether it'll be the final one (probably will be), doesn't matter.  Anyway, as a final note, I might add, if you contemplate to watch S3 because so far you liked the series the way it has been, for what it is, you are absolutely going to enjoy it. If you do so because you have expectations (you know what I mean), you might end up getting about 85% disappointed.";Recommended
5;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;RyanSpring;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RyanSpring;7;I quite like Log Horizon and my overall feelings about the series as a whole really haven't changed much since I watched the very first season all those years ago. The series does a number of things particularly well. It is well animated and features a vibrant, colorful, expansive world. It has a consistently standout soundtrack and some pretty banging intro/outros that really get the juices flowing. It has a HUGE cast of characters and deliberately moves at a slow pace in order to develop those characters, develop the world itself and expand on the various systems both politically and in terms of gameplay going on behind the scenes. This final point is both its biggest strength and its biggest weakness and it's where I'd like to start out our discussion about the third season.  The first season of Log Horizon was a meaty, thorough 25 episodes, but since then seasons have been a mere 12 episodes each. When the cast is this enormous and the pace is deliberately this slow, greatly exasperated in this case by the half decade long wait in between seasons 2 and 3, I can't help but be left feeling unfulfilled and wanting more. We waited six years to introduce all of two plot points essentially and the entire first half of this season is devoid of combat or dungeon exploring whatsoever. Normally, with a higher episode count, this isn't an issue at all and these arcs are a nice change of pace and a great opportunity to enhance the deep lore of the series and develop characters, but with just 12 episodes it feels like there is no choice but to cut corners, rush things and pick and choose who you want to feature. There simply isn't enough time to give all the meaningful characters meaningful screen time or to continue with all the previously established plot points. Many characters and subplots are forced to take a back seat for the time being.  It's hard to know how much of that I should hold against the anime itself. I'm a bit of an apologist as I know there are various issues out of the control of the creators of the anime such as a lack of source material, with the original Log Horizon web comic not being updated since 2018 and with no announcement regarding if or when it will continue, the author running into some fairly serious legal trouble and, of course, simply budget restraints from studios in what is, ultimately, a for-profit business. I think the people creating this anime have done the very best they can with what they were given to work with. Nevertheless, pacing issues, some characters and plot points being left behind, feeling there are too few episodes/not enough meat on the bone to justify a six year wait and a distinct lack of combat in the first half of the show are all valid criticisms one could direct at this season.  My fear for this series as a whole is that it almost inevitably will not end in a satisfactory manner, and that's if it ends properly at all, as it's possible it may simply stop one day. In the worst case scenario, maybe that day is today. I also fear that I'll be old or dead by the time this concludes. If they're pumping out a mere 12 episodes every half decade or so, it's going to take a very long time to conclude all of this. My sincere hope, though I live in the real world and know this is very unlikely at this point, is that they'll drop at least one if not two full fledged 24 episode final seasons, conclude things the right way and let this lore rich, deep, ripe with potential series walk into the sunset the way it deserves to. For now, this twelve episode third season felt like just a little taste of something far bigger and better, but it sucks to have to wait who knows how long just to take another small bite...

Heroes with simple goal who push forward no matter what? Thanks, we don't this here.  Log Horizon is one of the few anime series that show development of every character and development in this case doesn't mean ""new skills"" or ""new equipment"". Each character grows as a person and the story is not just ""side vs. side"" but characters and their beliefs colliding.

7;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;astralkill00;https://myanimelist.net/profile/astralkill00;10;"*this may contain spoilers or probably not* Its a jest... >_>  As a fan of the franchise Log Horizon, I really like the theme world building that has many possibilities in its own without needing any other anime to based it from (I mean, who would? Only a judgemental person would do such a thing). Each story has different goals in mind and we have different upbringings–meaning to say, a gamer or not–makes the audience feels like you are one.  I was really in the dumps when the 3rd season really took its time to get animated and since the pandemic, more and more animation got delayed or worst, got suspended but I am glad Log Horizon is still the same ever changing, inspiring story that I love and adore.  For the most part, I always took a glance, as a judgemental person whether the art styles is good or not but nowadays I learned to try every different anime out there whether they would be a good story but has bad animation. This series however is neither of those and I am happy to announce that this is on-line (or should I use ""in-line"" instead...?! XD) from the previous seasons and gets better by the episode. I mean, who would not love the story that has good plot, story wise, world enchanting and especially the characters that are growing to be a better individual instead of clinging from their previous lives. This is one of the things that I love and enjoy while watching every episode. What will happen next, what twist and turn, what romcom that will happen...  Now about the art styles, its much the same as the previous ones but better... especially, Akatsuki and Minori is more taller than before... *slurp*-oops...  Now let's talk about the theme songs... Opening song is so AVERAGE that it makes me not feeling good about it but wait, in a perspective of a person that do not understand the language of Japan–of course you would feel that way but when looking up the English translation of the lyrics, its actually a decent song that it wants to portray but was lacking in impact, really. However, the Ending song... This one hits the spot in my heart. Just hearing this even without understand the lyrics makes my heart aflutter, so many feelings sprouting and many memories getting realized that I am blessed with these friends and families alike.  The story is still an ever changing one so its gets better though I really recommend you guys to rewatch the previous episodes like 2-3 times whether it is Subbed or Dubbed, I think you mostly forgot most of the wonderful things that transpired on those days when you watched it or are there people here who watched the 3rd season or continuation of the 2nd season without watching the previous season? My condolences.  I am a bit sad, why you ask... Because its already a long time since I saw this franchise getting animated and now that we have it, its only 12 episodes–its TOO SHORT, I need more action, adventure and friendship (WORLD BUILDING)!!! I am a lonely person but I can really relate to this story, seriously!  P.S. Next time, make a theme song like *database, database, I'm living in a database* song. That was the most fun song I ever listened in this series but the ending of this series was totally worthwhile because so much has happened that our characters are getting better each day including the NPCs–the Land of the People.

8;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;MasterPoke;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MasterPoke;9;"Look, let's just all take a step back an level our heads for a moment.  This revival season had a mountain to overcome from the outset in the form of expectations. Let's also not forget that both of the previous seasons had a good amount of content and 25 episodes apiece to flesh themselves out and work their ways into our hearts, and that the vast majority of us are going into this new content with our nostalgic ties already firmly in place. The big moments/events that stuck out, the unique characters we grew to love and their development, and whatever else was special to you about the prior seasons that made you so excited to see the next chapter in this saga when it was announced.  Was this season perfect? No. Was this season ""Log Horizon"" at its core? Yes, with a few things that felt a little bit different. Did I like this season? Absolutely.  If this is the bridge between the void season 2 left years ago and the hope I have for season 4 and beyond, I am more than happy with it. I wasn't expecting perfection. Heck, I've been telling my friends since I heard about this happening that I wouldn't care if it was a total flop- I would just be thrilled to go on a nostalgia trip and see some of my favorite characters brought to life on screen again. I'm glad there was more to it than that, but I think looking at it that way really helped me to reign back in my expectations before I watched it, resulting in a much happier experience.  My overall score of 9 is because I don't feel that this detracts from the first two seasons, and that's what I gave those. If I wasn't considering them, my nostalgic feelings would still force at least an 8 out of me- and if I didn't have those, it would probably be a 7 to me. The series is finding its footing again- I'm not going to knock it over while it is trying to stand up. Especially considering how happy I am just to know that it still has the limbs to try.  Additional tidbit- That damn slow theme over moderately emotional moments still makes my eyes sweat a little bit. Some things just don't change, I guess.";Recommended

Specially when it comes to first season i just seen it like 8 times.  Story: It's good, they are still trying to find their way to home and find also a way how to not let all they love behind them since they might not belong into this world their friends who are from peoples of land.  Art: I think it's weird when i compare it to second season i don't know why maybe it's just me.  Sound : It's just good as always they are picking good tracks for Log even i miss database.  Characters: It was a really good ride to be honest. Even to be honest i miss Krusty since he is still my favorite character he at least get some screen time so i can't be mad.  Characters bit evolve and that's Rundellhouse he become more mature and stop just joking around, specially i liked his approach even towards Isuzu and Minori, he was really good in this season. Touya didn't really change but when it comes to the kids he is probably still one of my favorites. From elders it's obviously Krusty and Naotsugu, i like other characters too but these are my top.    Enjoyment: Development of story is something that I'm still enjoying every time i see Log Horizon since they are not going with linearity but they spread to every corner possible... once it's character development and relationship. Sometimes it's politics and sometimes just power and chasing the straw of possibility to get finally home. Not everybody is same and there are lot of characters with lot of different views on the world that they live in. This is what makes me enjoy this anime more and more...  Overall: 8/10 Reason why is pretty simple this part was mid development between more important stuff that are going to happen in next season. Overall I'm happy with new season and hope we will see soon another one.;Recommended
11;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Mazenoo_16;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mazenoo_16;8;There is no doubt that “ Log Horizon “ is one of the most underrated series of all time of this industry. Surprisingly, Log Horizon a unique anime series that seems from its central theme it is normally dependent on fights, epic battles and moments, high animation, and so on. But that is true partially because this anime fundamentally takes a political tendency and it depends on situations analysis, strategic planning, and political formation, establishing treaties and charters with the study of community stratification, supported by diverse, appropriate and loveable characters. And all of these aspects will give you as an audience, a distinctive conflict inside a unique world that connects seriousness and realism with the world of MMORPG games.  The big problem which faced this series was when the “ Studio Deen “ get the anime instead of “ Satelight “, since that time, you can recognize the clear differences between the first and second season, and this third one, these differences are not in the capacity or production quality, but in the way the work is presented and the quality of its adaptation from the light novel in an interesting way. Whereas concentrating and highlighting on the side events will create a slow and boring story plot.  If you realized what I said above, we can talk about this season and evaluate it accurately.  Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai (Third season) on one hand and frankly, for new viewers will appear boring and have a slow plotline, so they must watch the previous seasons. But on the other hand, this Arc is a very acceptable and reasonable condition by the central theme and the conflict of the story. Significant political changes have taken place in the Round Table Alliance, and the number of economic and logistical problems has increased inside Akiba city, most of the Adventures (Players) no longer enjoy the game and they feel hard to live in this world, and this makes characters Arc turned out extraordinary, I was very impressed to see such a complex relationship evolve from two very different personalities. What a culmination of everything Einz and Shiro have become. Also, I observed many other types of development of characters, such as Princess Rayneshia when she takes a brave decision to refuse her noble family's traditions and joined the Round Table Alliance, but the important one was the Akatsuki and Minori romantic confession in the last episode. So I think the story gets 9/10 and characters 9/10.  Music 8/10 and Art 8/10  The Music and Art both of them were really good, everyone missed Database but the new OP “Different” by BAND-MAID and ED “Blue Horizon“ by Miyu Ooshiro are very awesome and one of the best OP and ED of the Winter season.  Overall 8/10: Log Horizon is a completely balanced anime series consisting of Ambiguity 25%, Action 25 %, Romantic tension 25%, Comedy tension 25%, so definitely you will enjoy every single episode of it.;Recommended
12;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;StevyleSteve;https://myanimelist.net/profile/StevyleSteve;7;I'm a mega fan of Log Horizon as a whole, so this season has me a little on the worried side of things.  Story(6): This seasons stories start out extremely bad with an election arc. It is extremely boring with too many straight dialog while sitting around tables scenes. So many characters were under utilized in this arc. I'd almost suggest anyone to skip this arc(ep 1-5) Next arc was pretty OK, but its told in a diminshing kind of way. but it has a little more intrigue in it at least. The last arc is the best of the season as we get to see a good few developments in the existing cast and also that ending was pretty great, showing that LH handles romance better than most romance shows.  Art(8): This season has a similar artstyle to season 2 (same studio too) but its animation is pretty poor in comparison to the rest of the series. I loved the various character designs and outfits characters had this season which is par for the course in LH. LH has always had great setting and background designs too but this does score a little lower than previous seasons in that regard.  Sound(5): LH has had fantastic music for the first 2 seasons which is why this seasons music is so dissapointing. The newer music pieces sound out of place a lot of the time and im pretty sure they dont follow the main theme at all. They almost sound like stock music used in crappy F2P mobile MMO's. Voice acting was pretty good throughout. though i wasn't really floored by any of the performances, Minori and Akatsukis VA's have definitely improved since S2. Regans voice actor was changed and its not great imo. R.I.P. Keiji Fujiwara, you were fantastic!  Character(10): I am very biased in this area just because I like LH so much, I can't help but love all of the LH characters and they continue to be delightful to watch in this season.  Overall(7): This season could have done with a second cour like other seasons. All of the arcs feel kind of disconnected from each other unlike other seasons where they did a great job of weaving everything together within the season. I do hope we continue to get more seasons just because I love LH so much and want to see the whole thing animated but I'm a little fearful for that going forward.;Recommended
13;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Traxdize;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Traxdize;7;Safe to say, this season isn't as good as previous ones. But it doesn't mean it's bad. For me, the season started out pretty slow and boring. Even though the whole premise of the season is about the destruction of the round table, it didn't even take up half of the season. It just feels very anticlimactic. The Krusty Arc was pretty weirdly paced in my opinion, but it works. What saved this season for me are the few last episodes which were pretty great. Action isn't really visible in this season but watching a full raid scenario is always pretty cool. I don't know why, but the animation this season is a bit different. It isn't necessarily bad, it's just different from previous ones. Well, Studio Deen has been questionable as of late. One of the most visible flaws are the action scenes, which doesn't look very good at all. Opening and Ending for this season aren't bad. Still no Database though. Some dialogues seems pretty forced by the seiyuus, but all in all it's not bad just mediocre. Some Minori lines seems awkwardly voiced. Rudy is very great this season, I love it. He seems a lot more mature than before. There's also a lot more screentime of William which is very great. Although I feel that some characters has reduced screentime, such as Naotsugu or Akatsuki and Nyanta to some extend. At this point, I feel that Minori's fixation on Shiroe is very stale. I didn't really enjoy this season, but I could bear to watch it until the end so I guess I did enjoy it a bit.;Recommended

Art-Mediocre 5: Still same character illustration, no swim suit service and no fanservices either.  Sound-Mediocre 5: Same seiyuu and no convincing opening and closing theme.  Character- Mediocre 5: Nothing to say around here, since nothing has change when it comes to the character's personality.  Enjoyment-Mediocre 5: Too mediocre that I was able to simply just skimmed some episode.  Overall-Mediocre 5: Don't ask...another sequel?????I wish I could say ""Don't even think about it bitch"" but it looks like there is one in the works.";Mixed Feelings
1;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Genghis_Calm;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Genghis_Calm;6;I first got into Log Horizon because it was something different. There was some action, yes. But here we found more emphasis on world-building and character. If your mind wanders without the big fight of the week, Season Three is really gonna hurt. Season one introduced the world of Log Horizon and its characters. It established the story and carried much of that momentum into the second season. While good, this third season lacked a lot of that drive that kept me waiting impatiently for that next episode to arrive. This may be in no small part due to the stacked season it had the misfortune to air in. Regardless, there really did seem to be less strength this time around.;Mixed Feelings
2;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Losorst;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Losorst;6;In genuine honesty, the first 5 episodes were like a nice podcast, nothing really happened, it was fine and my day continued onward. Episodes 5-7 if I remember were fine.... After so is when the problems started, this writing is so draining to listen to and the comedy does not hit for me. 8-9 were so drawn out I literally skipped parts of it just to get it over with, sometimes even wishing to hear the ending theme. (BTW the OP and ED are fantastic, very misleading as it comes off as very hype). After 8-9 it picked up the slightest bit for the writing to crash then later. I don't enjoy the way the child adventurers act on screen at all, and having a season full of them is part of my annoyance. The animation was very poor and at best upper mediocre. I enjoyed seeing a season of the older characters but this could've been Krusty's OVA and done in 2-3 episodes and had left plot for the season, which it was severely lacking.  This really could've been like 3-4 episodes of the relevant plot. I do not understand the high scores for this at all, it stops being political and relevant after episode 5.;Mixed Feelings

1;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;awesomeszt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/awesomeszt;4;"I don't write much reviews so this could just be considered a rant after finishing this. First off, I'll start with why I liked this series. Season 1 and 2 of Log Horizon was exceptionally interesting, how the characters found loopholes and created new concepts was based on their understanding of the game. It showed that players with experience and knowledge had an upper hand of this generic genre and it was really fun to watch. Even the parts where they try to connect it to a bigger plot related to the real world. This season I could not enjoy at all, I was excited to see a season 3 but somewhere in the middle I lost interest so fast. Politics plot and the clashing of opinions in the round table were bearable, but everything after that felt like it was made just to make it reach 12 episodes. Don't get me wrong, adding politics into an anime does make it interesting but I feel like the execution was utter garbage. Based on the title, ""destruction of the round table"" you would think that the clans would be separated and gain individual influence for themselves. Yet, they tried to force the antagonist role onto one individual and ultimately destroyed the whole concept itself. It felt very forced and all the exciting elements of S1 and S2 did not show up at all. The foundation they laid out was never executed, where was the plot going? Nowhere. The whole story crashed, little to none character development (except for the children, which weren't the main characters of the show?), and don't get me started on the ""last boss"". The raid arc was painful to watch. The last 2 eps, I couldn't concentrate for more than 5 minutes without being bored to death. The last boss was really a disappointment, ""Lose hope, the one you hold in veneration will not show up"", I swear I have heard it say this line for more than 50 times and it gets old real quick. Before they started the fight, they decided to fight for themselves and not rely on their so called 'heroes'. Yet, they wanna weep about it when they get reminded of the heroes not coming. The last fight was such a letdown. This line. ""we can't evade the purple attack, but we won't get caught if we are far enough?"" How does that even work? First you show the villain damaging everyone in the room then you say ""oh just take 2 steps back"". The mechanics of it was so poorly executed I wanted to play it at 2x speed just to get it over with. TL:DR, mad cuz S3 was garbage, it had so much potential to grow. :'(";Not Recommended
2;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;ItsNevet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ItsNevet;4;"What a disappointing follow-up. I didn't hate it, but I feel so let down, especially because I loved what the previous two seasons brought to the table.  TL;DR: It presents interesting situations, but places the least likable characters in them and forces you to either sit through it or drop it and watch something else.  OVERALL - 4.4/10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  STORY - 6  The story continues from where we left off. Crusty is still stuck overseas, and Rayneshia is struggling with the royal family, who wants to marry her off. The first few episodes features some politics stuff, which I love! But after that, it strays off to focus on the children. I'll speak more on why that's a problem, later.  The rest of this section will go into more detail about what I stated above. Skip to the ""Art"" section if you want to avoid minor spoilers. Shiroe comes up with the perfect solution to please the royal family: let's hold an election! I thought this was honestly pretty cool, and it made me hyped for the rest of the season! But after the election concludes, there's no more politics. Shiroe doesn't do anything smart, or clever. We get a two-episode update on what Crusty has been up to in the middle of the season, and then the show spends the rest of it's time following and building up the kids. The way it forces the shift to focusing on the kids is also pretty interesting: a raid / dungeon is introduced, and a quirk of this raid / dungeon is that only low leveled players have a chance of beating it. However, the children are so annoying and shallow, that I can't find myself enjoying their screentime at all.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ART - 3  This season is overloaded with slow pans of stills, basic reaction shots, and so on. The art in Log Horizon was never really anything special, and I'm fully aware that Log Horizon isn't meant to be loaded with action, but if you're going to make me stare at slow pans of stills for the entire episode, I'd rather have watched paint dry. The shots are lifeless, and it makes it a slog to get through.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SOUND - 6  The sound is just average. The OP carries the soundtrack, and, as such, is the only reason I am rating it above average. The ED is good, too, and it does a pretty good job at winding down the episode. Log Horizon has always had some of the best EDs I've seen so far (musically, not artistically).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CHARACTER - 3  Hey, do you remember those mildly annoying kids from earlier that Shiroe and his guild saved from the other guild that was using them as child laborers? Yeah, they're the main characters now. They're all so... shallow. All of their motivations can be reduced to: ""I have a crush on [Person X], so I will [do Y] to make them happy."" They have no personal desires; only the desire to appease someone else. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the issue I have with it is that they either feature this exact same motivation, or the character simply aren't featured at all.  Minori: ""I have a crush on Shiroe, so I will learn how to be a leader to make him happy."" Serara: ""I have a crush on Nyanta, so I will learn housekeeping duties to make him happy."" Isuzu: ""I have a crush on Rudy, so I will treat him like a puppy to make him happy."" Touya arguably fits into this category, too, but he doesn't obsess over Naotsugu, and it's definitely a much more healthy relationship compared to the others. However, both he and Rudy don't get enough screentime, which is a shame, because they both have a potential to be interesting (with Rudy as a person of the land, and Touya living his life as a cripple before Elder Tale). It's *really* weird that they don't get more screentime, though, especially considering just how much of a focus the show puts on the children.  Aside from the children, the cast is still overcrowded and just as fragmented as ever, with tons of different sidestories happening at once. This wouldn't be a problem if these side characters got more than 2 minutes of screentime per season. No characters really received any development, except for the kids, I suppose, because they ""Gain individuality!"" or some generic shit like that.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ENJOYMENT - 4  The first few episodes honestly carried my enjoyment for this season. I had such high expectations, thanks to those episodes, that I was ultimately let down when, in the end, no progress was really made towards any of the problems from the previous season (Aside from Rayneshia's situation)";Not Recommended

Lemme keep this short, no point in wasting many words on this crapfest:  - 12 EPISODES: This NEVER works. Every anime with such a small number cuts corners, and this is a perfect example. Whole thing feels like a filler anime focusing on nobody NPC's nobody gave a shit about in the first two seasons.  - VILLAIN IN THE GLASSES: You'll need glasses to look for him because the protagonist acts like a backup character doing nothing but giving advice to NPCs while every generic random character takes the front seat, like you give a shit. No, you don't.  - STALLING: Like I said, this is a filler anime, it has a feel of it. Majority of time is wasted on ""romance"", where you already know the outcome but have to endure the banal-shit-boring female characters go all ""Omg you should totally propose"" for 12 FUCKING EPISODES. This is shit, this is worse than shit. This is BERSERK 3D level of shit.    At the end, apparently Shiroe declares his intentions to progress the main plot forward. You'd be surprised by that, because I didn't think they wrote any when it came to primary storyline, turning the whole fucking thing into a soap-opera.  THIS is what we waited for? I didn't, I can tell you that.  And why the fuck is it called ""Destruction of the Round Table"" like it matters? It happens in like the first 2 episodes and after that, all the ""LOVE"" shit infects the whole show. Majority of moments that don't involve girls talking about their feelings, is someone sucking up to Shiroe while he does nothing but file papers for majority of the fucking show.  You know what?

5;Log Horizon: Entaku Houkai;Rian706;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rian706;6;I really like anime, especially in the past when someone was trapped in a deadly game like sword art online.  For the first and second series, I really liked it, and even hope there will be a third season soon, because in the second season the story was hanging and still unclear.  But it's a thousand times a shame, the third season of the anime is very disappointing!  What's disappointing?  In general, this third season only focuses on side characters, and this is what happens in this anime, what do they really think about this third season? Even though the second season has reached its climax and is approaching the end of a mystery in the story behind being trapped in a game. However, they did not continue with this, and as if changing positions, the main character MEGANE or the person wearing glasses turned into an NPC figure, He rarely appears, as if forgetting his main purpose. In the second season, he disappeared and didn't appear much in the third season.  The point is, this anime is very disappointing, why does it have to focus on child characters? In my opinion they are nothing more than side characters and shouldn't be shown too much, or if you really want to display them at an event, at least choose the right place, as I said above In the second season the story had reached its climax, but here it tells the story to children which is very far from the main story.;Not Recommended
0;Log Horizon 2nd Season;mhoho88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mhoho88;8;Having finished the entire second season here are some of my opinions on how this season turned out. I have assumed anyone reading this has watched the first season.  Story: 6 (Fair)  The first half of this season focused in a lot more on the element of MMORPG raiding and immediately the pace of the show slowed down. With each episode covering usually two different scenarios within the world for our beloved characters to face. Overall I would say that if you're a big MMORPG player you'll connect with the characters more but if you're not then it will just leave you confused. By the second half we were given with a valentines day filler episode and an enjoyable Kanami episode to give an idea of what's going elsewhere in the world. Then the kids' arc... similar to the last season there was an arc to develop the younger members of Log Horizon and that was done pretty well. But here it just felt like they didn't grow much but rather helped reinforce their own ideals and morals in addition to giving very little back story to their lives in the real world. Overall it didn't add much to the story, however the inclusion of a certain character and introduction of another certainly helped but left me clueless as to their purpose of being there. However after that arc the story seemed to pick up but then felt drawn out with the addition of what felt like filler episodes. And then the final two episodes..... Oddly these felt like some of the more enjoyable and entertaining episodes of the entire season with elements left over that pointed towards a direction the story would take. This was what annoyed me the most since I enjoyed them so much I wanted a third season.  Looking back the same plot threads which were started were left unfinished (mainly because the anime has caught up to the source material therefore a third season is a long way off). The story followed a very heavily focused ''raid'' element and a few filler episodes. Overall enjoyable but with the filler episodes and poor pacing I give it a 6.  Art: 7 (Good)  I would give the art style a 7 because obviously there was a change in studio and possibly budget was an issue. In the end I got used to the changes. Animation was again not great but better in some places than others, the finale seemed to be where they did a better job at least.  Sound: 7.5 (Very Good/Good)  The OST for Log Horizon didn't change and since I enjoyed the first season OST as well, I didn't really have any gripes with it for the second season. Voice actors didn't change and the new seiyuu I felt fit their roles.  Character: 7 (Good)  There were quite a few introductions to new characters we had never really met aside from cameos and then some from the weird jungle of the anime rainforest. I enjoyed the new characters and they were extremely entertaining but the development of the characters were rather disappointing compared to last season. We're still left with a question of, 'What are they trying to do within the world.' We also got a little taste as to who the ''villains'' of Elder Tale are but their inclusion to the story was very minor.  Enjoyment: 9 (Great)  Even with the flaws of this season I still enjoyed it and being an MMOPG gamer I think it helped. I know many who would find this season to be a huge disappointment compared to the first season but considering what I suspect as being budget changes and a new studio I can see why. Comedic elements were still entertaining for me and the action and characters were still enjoyable.  Overall: 8 (Very Good)  With the inclusion of my own enjoyment I gave it an 8. A third season doesn't look likely to be soon because the LNs have now been caught up. I felt that maybe there wasn't enough material from the LNs to make a second season. Let's just hope they receive a better budget and have more material to work with for a third season.  This is my first review I have done and any constructive criticism on how to better write my reviews would be welcomed.;Recommended
1;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;7;"If there was one series that can focus down the MMORPG concept to its core, Log Horizon would be the first name to pop into my mind. The franchise based off of the light novel of the same name returns for a second season and remains consistent with exactly the way it was. Only this time, the sequel is operated by a different studio (DEEN rather than Satelight.). Still, some of the core concepts of the series remain and the sequel is by no means a mud puddle to be stepped on.  As a former MMORPG player from a popular online game, I was intrigued by the way Log Horizon is designed. The first season focused down on the world building and characters in a very concise way. When it came to mechanics, the show was like a professor on steroids with the info dumping and game concepts. Likewise, the sequel concentrates on world building just as precise as the first season with some other twists and turnabouts. A popular question that may come to mind is if it’s required to watch the first season? My simple answer is: of course. Watching Log Horizon 2 without finishing the first season would be like taking a math test without studying for the formulas. While the consequences aren’t disastrous, the sequel will be a much better experience if you completed the first season.  To freshen up a bit, Log Horizon takes place in the world of ‘Elder Tale’. The world itself is based on a post-apocalyptic setting where fantasy defies reality. (that’s actually a bit ironic considering the tagline of the show is ‘this is our reality’). But when you add in fantasy and magic, it becomes MMORPG in its most classic style. As you may expect, members of the famous Log Horizon guild returns. Characters you should be familiar with such as Shiroe, Akatsuki, Naotsugu, Nyanta, Tohya, and Minori are just a few to name. The sequel also opens doors to new characters such as the trap Tetra as well as conflicts that may change the story forever. What you should be familiar with Log Horizon should also be the style. In general, the series has a slow pacing. Some episodes will drag and ultimately will take patience to get through. There is also a much less focus on the real life counterparts of the characters as opposed to their online counterparts; do note that a few episodes does offer a glimpse at their past. Nonetheless, Log Horizon is a show more about its world and characters rather than just progressive story movement. It still retains its various political and survival conflicts but doesn’t push that as its main course.  In terms of story, the sequel offers various glimpses at different sides of the series. From a bit of murder mystery to dungeon raids, the series adapts many gimmicks. It also stays true with many of MMORPG’s mechanics such as gold farmers, bots, pkers, and of course death. And in similarity with the first season, the show continuously presents its mechanics in a way that should be straightforward to almost any viewer. Even if you have never experienced the thrills of a MMORPG game, Log Horizon should be like a sample to you for what it should be. Also more noticeable about the series revolves with the political affairs and economics mechanics. After all, the author (Mamare Touno) is also known for writing Maoyuu Maou Yuusha with its focus on a bit of those as part of the gimmick. But what Log Horizon does better here is the balance with its story. Each episode either tells its own story or transits into what it already has set up. It can also shift in many ways to convey various moods. An apex part of the story is during the first half when the series explores the concept death and its aftermath. At a more careful glance, it’s evident that Log Horizon has an exotic way to portray such an event. It adapts emotions with realism despite taking place in the fantasy. It recreates human emotions in a world where nothing is really real. And in retrospect, death in MMORPG is one of the most debatable topics of controversy. In this sequel, it hit the nail in the coffin with that concept.  With a large cast of characters, it shouldn’t be surprise if some gets neglected by characterization. The main purpose of the show isn’t to give every single character their chance to shine but rather a way for them to play a role. It should therefore be clear that some characters’ roles will have a larger impact than others. However, it should be treat that the sequel also focuses on other groups in Log Horizon besides just Shiroe’s party. Unfortunately, Log Horizon’s characterization can suffer a bit when it comes to dynamics. There’s not much change from the first season with character relationships. Most of them still goes without much development. Take the example of Shiroe and Akatsuki. Although they share some special moments in the first half of the show, their relationship doesn’t progress further than being close friends. Similarly, Tohya’s team still retains their adventurous nature but without offering big chances for its members on an individual level in terms of characterization; except perhaps Tohya himself. That’s not a huge issue overall for Log Horizon but may be a backstabber for some who are interested to see the development of certain characters. In retrospect, don’t get your hopes high.  A technical change between the first season and this sequel is the studio. DEEN makes it a mission to adapt this series and although makes some attempts, it’s not overall impressive. Some character designs such as with Akatsuki looks slightly different while faces suffer a bit of disfiguration. It is less noticeable on some parts during this season while obvious at other times. Naturally though, the series retains its fantasy landscape with its fantastic features. DEEN does make a good attempt at that especially during some of the more intense dungeon raids. I think the trend the series follows sometimes with its fantasy elements is to bring out their cleverness. By this, it means that every aspect of the show needs to stay true to its mechanics because MMORPG should be creative and open minded with imaginatively. Precisely, the artwork for this to work needs to be adapted with a precision. By the end of the show, it can be a mixed bag on some parts with its hits and misses.  Soundtrack also plays some key roles in the season. However, one might feel both excited and disappointed by the OP song. If you’re a fan of Database, then this should be no problem. But if you were expecting some new, then news flash: the sequel doesn’t get a new OP song. It’s something you’ll have to deal with this vulnerability when it comes to repetitiveness. Similarly, character voices return with their casting roles. Nothing much is changed although one particular character may rob more attention than meets the eye; or perhaps I should say a trap? But perhaps the most prominent key highlights of this season is the stronger usage of its OST. This is put into moments when the show really stands out at its best to portray a blending line between fiction and reality. The musical and soundtrack trends is effortlessly portrayed to adapt MMORPG. I couldn’t say this with confidence as the first season didn’t truly stand out in that field. But taking a closer look at the sequel, I can do now.  So what to think of Log Horizon 2? Is it better or worse? Well, there’s a lot of ways to put it. If you’re a fan of the first season (either the anime adaptation or novels, then this might be exciting news for you. However, the overall terms of this adaptation doesn’t live up entirely to the hype. Like I mentioned before, Log Horizon is a fantasy show, one that combines MMORPG elements and characters with its storytelling. Each character has a sort of role that connect with the overall story. And while artwork isn’t top notch by expectations, the soundtrack makes it up with its lovingly delivery. Yes, there will be some episodes that will make your face go awe while others will feel like a waste of time. But by this point, it should be clear at what that Log Horizon has more ways to go.";Recommended
2;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Raiye;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Raiye;7;Being a gamer myself, I'd always hoped for a decent MMORPG anime to be produced. Log Horizon S1 made itself clear that it was THE forerunner in the MMORPG genre. While it may not have been perfect, I believed it best and most realistically portrayed the experience of playing a MMORPG game.  However, S2 could not achieved what LH had done in S1. It was packed with filler episodes. It even swept some important characters under the rug.  Story: 5/10 The boss raid arc started strong. It mimicked what one would actually encounter while playing such a game. The teamwork, strategising, and skills used were enchanting. It actually made me want to play Log Horizon. However, Silver Sword guildmaster's(William) melodramatic breakdown was a tad too long for my liking - it felt like the producers purposely dragged that scene to fill up screen time. The raid also ended abruptly, and was rather anti-climatic. I thought that shiroe and the others would at least fight the last boss(some white winged angelic thingy) but was disappointed that it ended with just a verbal agreement between Shiroe and Kinjou.  The battle between Nelreth and Akiba was average. It did lead to Akatsuki's character development, but other than that this arc wasn't anything special.  Then came a filler arc - The journey of the 5 young kids of LH. Many viewers disliked it and found it hard to watch. I myself found it neutral, though it wasn't as enjoyable as watching a full raid take place(1st arc). This arc dragged on for too long, emphasizing too much on Isuzu's musical development. They introduced Roe 2, and although she seemed like she would be an amazing character, not much was talked about her apart from the fact that she was a navigator.  The last arc was another raid, but this time it was within the compounds of Akiba. It felt rushed and underdeveloped. More could have been said about the Raid Boss/Genius Monster/Old Man. This arc showed that Shiroe wasn't the all-perfect-planner that we thought he would be, and I appreciated that fact.  PLANT HWYADEN: What the hell happened to this guild??? The last episode of S1 ended with plant hwyaden potentially becoming a threat to the Akiba round table. Then it was swept under the rug for almost the entirety of this season. Thereafter, at the last few episodes, plant hwyaden suddenly wanted to collaborate with Akiba. What??  Art: 6/10 You could tell that LH S2 was animated by a different studio because animation became subpar. Some skills and magic spells looked good but the animation sorely lacked the consistency throughou the show.  Sound: 7/10 Reusing S1's OP made listening to the database chant a bit bothersome. I liked it at first, but after 50 episodes worth of such a chant, it became a bit mundane. I bet every one was hoping for a new OP made by the same band. Hell they should have used the song from Nanatsu No Taizai's second opening. It would have been awesomeeee. OSTs and the ED were average at best.  Character: 7/10 There were characters that were given proper development in this season, namely Akatsuki, Isuzu, Serara, Demikas, Isaac, William, and Shiroe. However, some characters which I thought would be fleshed out weren't, including members of Plant Hwyaden, Roe 2, Nureha, Kanami, and those people that were in the China server.  Overall: 7/10 Some may say that S2 was bad, because there were too many filler episodes. Be that as it may, even with noticeable flaws in this season, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I look forward to season three in hopes that they would answer the many questions that were left unanswered in S2.;Recommended

4;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Senpaiplsss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Senpaiplsss;8;*Some spoilers ahead*  So, after im done with this series, i'd love to watch the 3rd season and waited for it. But some sites said that there'll be no 3rd season because the author will postpone the LN whatsoever and if there'll be a 3rd season, it will be around 2018-2019 which make me sad.  The story of this anime is 7/10 for me. There's some hidden character as well as the inventions of things become much more in this season. However, the bad thing is -THE ENDING- is not the ending but it is. it might be confusing but thats how the ending is. Its really dissapointing to see when the MC and his friend finally find a way to achieve their goal, the season ended and no announcement of the next season.  Art and sound sits pretty well in this anime. I dont really like the opening-ending music but the sound in battle is pretty good and the arc is awesome  The character is 6/10 for me, the reason are: 1.MC Harem with 2 girls 2.The kids always bugging me like how mature they are despite being a middle schoolers 3.Akatsuki, my fav become pretty useless in this season 2nd and 3rd point might be because of It's the story, but the 1st point is really unnecesary and make me cringe everytime  Enjoyment 9/10. I enjoy this anime because its like SAO - REBORN kind of anime but being MUCH better (SAO is bad for me) and its so different than other anime So, overall i'd give this anime 8/10 point ,but i'd not recomend it to anyone untill season 3 is secured. bcs u know, i hate cliffhanger;Recommended
5;Log Horizon 2nd Season;NaminesGER;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NaminesGER;8;"First I have to say that I'm from Germany and my english isn't that good, but I try my best to make you understand. And this is my first review and I'm just telling you my opinion of this anime so let's get started.  Log Horizon many people describe this sequel as bullshit but I don't get why, I guess they didn't think about the anime. For me Log Horizon 2 is a good sequel, because it continues to the story and it shows you the mainstory at the last episode. So at the beginning of the 2nd season Shiroe tried to get some more money for the budget of the round table and so he did an raid with the guild ""Silver Sword"" and they had some troubles because they had to fight 3 Raid-bosses at the same time. They lost and didn't get an stragedy to win against them, that was Shiroes 1st dead and so we were able to see what happens if they die. After that the guild leader of Silver Sword hold an speech about him and his relation to the game, to make hopes for everyone so that they'll keep fighting even if it looks that they can't win. Seriously this speech was awesome as fuck, and the whole arc with the 3 raid bosses and the awesome stragedy based fights was awesome as shit. Then the side arc with Akatsuki in the main-role and the NPC who stole the armor of these guard's who saved the peace in the cities. That wasn't that awesome as the previous arc but it was good as well and they focused on the character dev. of Akatsuki. Now the arc with the kids of Log Horizon. They're on low levels and they don't have these one magical bag without a limit and so they went on a journey to get these bags. Another city started to cause some trouble and I still don't know what they tried to do or why they built that huge train for, this arc was just shit and I didn't get anything of it. This arc was a huge plotthole but let me see what this arc got. They told us something about the Odysee Knights and what happened to the other characters of the players, they met the 2nd character of Shiroe who was a woman and controlled by an bot and they're living on the moon. They focused on the character dev. of Suzu and Toya which was pretty interesting. In the last arc some monsters attacked the city and made the NPC's sleeping, so they tried to find out what happened. This arc was an perfect arc for the ending, because the end of that arc answered so many questions as example : Who the fuck is this one girl who was shown in the opening of Log Horizon 1 already? What happened to crusty? And what is their goal in the main story? These are just examples what the last arc answered to us. In all the Anime wasn't as good as season one but it was a very good sequel to the first season. Because of this season we know more about the characters, we finally know what the main story is now. I seriously can't get why people rate this anime so bad but well hope you liked my review. If you watched the prequel just keep going and watch the 2nd season.";Recommended
6;Log Horizon 2nd Season;SupraBlatt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SupraBlatt;10;"I'd honestly give it more than 10 if I could.  I really enjoyed the world build -- even though the anime had a slow pace, the two seasons taking over a full year of in-game-time, the build didn't focus on one main character and gave all the rest of events as given out, just in some dialogue like ""this and that happened in suskino"". Instead, the world was built from a character's perspective, whether it would be shiroe, tohya or akatsuki, and then it was built as a guild, as a city, as a server, and now as a whole world (and the moon).  Sure, there were politics involved, and large scale events, but that's the whole beauty of this world. A new world where people gain power and are no longer just tiny screws in a system, powerless to do anything.  I also really really enjoyed the MMO aspects of the show -- it felt just like watching a game, but better and far more realistic and engaging. It really fired me up to play again (hopefully I'd get isekai-d like this too :3); you could see the author played some traditional MMOs. The raid episodes were really amazing, seeing how all of them worked as a team together, after spending a month walking there together. Everyone were so friendly towards each other, just like game communities.  I also disagree with the widespread idea that the episodes on sia's brother were redundant -- right, they removed screentime from shiroe and the guild, but, they showed us a new side of the world too, the people of the land's point of view and the newely coming heir of the cowen family, who would rule the people of the land under eastel.  The Elder-Tale world is just about the real world, but better in every single aspect -- there are seemingly no diseases, time moves slower (12 times slower, meaning people could live up to 1200 years old!), no bugs (ffs bugs why do you even exist), people could gain power and most are using it for the better good, and of course, dying doesn't mean dying anymore, so people aren't afraid to explore and discover the new world they're in, or fight and stand for their own.  Overall I give the anime about 30/10, for the great world building and igniting me the passion to play MMOs again. Thanks, Mamare Touno, for giving birth to this series :D       Kanami best waifu OwO";Recommended
7;Log Horizon 2nd Season;KyotoKycco;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KyotoKycco;8;I thought this was a fine continuation of Log Horizon, even if not up to standards with the previous season. There was a crew of new interesting characters that they added that weren't hard to keep track at all.Following the story wasn't difficult at all despite the perspectives switching constantly.  The new people all had distinct personalities that differentiated them from the rest, while those that weren't really explored in the first season had their backgrounds and character fleshed out. The story was interesting enough to keep me watching BUT the whole season felt like a way to transition the story rather than real major plot development. The whole season had little progress in the actual story, but I believe things will be quicker in season 3 with the setting laid out.  One of log horizon's main attractions was it's setting in an mmo world. It did an adequate job in capturing the feel of MMORPGS with the backdrop feeling very natural, and it's plot smoothly connecting with it, while not forcing it into the environment.  The art and sound are up to par with the previous season so take that with what you will.  So all in all, this season was a slight disappointment, but given how high the standards were set, it's still very watchable.;Recommended
8;Log Horizon 2nd Season;EternalAnimeGuru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EternalAnimeGuru;7;Now his was rather disappointing. After the seeing the first season I had really gotten into it. If had a lot of great plot developments and the scenario's had a feeling of how a chess match unfolds, of course with more intensity though. Everything was not just about adapting to the new life but the adventure of it and the jaw dropping stagnates that Shiroe could weave. That however all kind of feel through in season two. The stories did not have as much weight and momentum to them anymore. The pull that it had in the first season that grabbed your attention became very watered down and diluted. It was pretty much a wash in the end in my opinion. I watch it all the way through hoping that it would at least give some decent sense of closure, yet that fell short of the strings of hope I held onto. It's like those blockbuster movies that do so great they decide to make a second. It's never as good as the first and always is a letdown in comparison. They have some good episode I give them that, so some may like to watch it. I suggest that for those of you that liked the first season a lot it would be best to just end with that and keep the memory of how good it was.;Recommended
9;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Icelord888;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Icelord888;8;While the first season of Log Horizon was good in general,the second one is a mix of moments of brilliance and failures. The show still manages to have a diverse cast of characters and make almost each one of them feel important and it also touches on some deep subjects like people feeling stuck in Elder Tale and wanting to return home to their loved ones or the sentiment of purpose episode 10 being especially noteworthy for any who played an mmorpg.  That being said the show has it's downfalls especially as you get to the end, it starts to shower you with childlike ideals and thoughts and the ending is... lacking and generic but it's not actually an ending it feels more like a setup for a third season which I really hope we will one day get.  To sum it up,this show may not the brightest gem of the bunch but it's still a gem and it's really worth your time watching it.;Recommended
10;Log Horizon 2nd Season;The_Fatness;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The_Fatness;8;Please see my review for Season 1 of Log Horizon for a somewhat brief synopsis of my background with MMORPG’s.  As I “finish” more anime, the style in which I intend to review is going to evolve and refine itself. As I will state in all of my reviews, I do not review with the intent of making someone else watch a show. Nor do I review with the expectation that ANYONE will agree with the conclusions and opinions laid out. My reviews are simply my experiences, reactions, feelings and most importantly my own opinions on whatever subject matter is being reviewed. If you read this review, and then watch the show and find yourself disagreeing with what I have said, that is because everyone has different opinions. These are simply my own, take that how you will.  I find that many Anime shows are doomed from the beginning. Every show that comes out now is constantly compared to any shows that came before it that are even remotely related. I’ve often heard of the “best” shows being referred to as a Meta, similar to MOBA games in where specific setups or characters are considered the “best” by everyone. If the newly found shows do not succeed in the same areas or ways that other shows before have, then these shows are deemed as failures. Why can’t each show be judged solely as its own entity without needless comparison to other series. I feel as though this is where I have an advantage thus far as I do not have a lot of experience to draw from. However, I intend to do my best to keep an open mind going into each and every new show that I watch. I would like to judge the show as it is, with all of its own components. Not what the show could have been, or should have been. I believe that each show is released in the state that the show creators wanted, if it wasn’t they would have changed it. What’s being portrayed to all of us through these works of art is the artists depictions of whatever story they want to tell. We should judge them as such. How we want a story to turn out, or how other shows have turned out should have no impact on whether or not the show is deemed as good. Disagreeing with an artists story is fine, but telling them their work is a failure because you wanted something different to happen is asinine. Try to look at it from the storytellers perspective, instead of what you want.  For me, Log Horizon’s second season was never going to maintain the same highs as its first. In my eyes, season 1 was everything it could’ve been and more. There was just too much happening and too many details that were vital for a first season to really let the show slow down at any point. However, as a continuation of the series, I find it hard to fathom that anyone who genuinely enjoyed the first season would not enjoy the second. The same complex details of the storyline and the depth of the MMORPG details are still present. While also committing to keeping each character that was already established interesting while introducing new characters as well. We see many of the very young and less mature characters really come into their own in season 2 and discover how capable they truly are. I find myself on the fence in that we don’t get as much character development as we do inside of the game but outside, but I don’t know if that is a good thing or not. I also find that every time I think I know who is pulling the strings behind the scenes or what’s going to happen, I am wrong. The show continually finds ways to surprise me.  The entire world of Elder Tale starts to really shape up by the end of season 2. You can really see what impact and relevance the ‘Adventurers’ are having not only on the world of Elder Tale, but on the minds of the adventurers as well. Throughout the season there are many new twists and turns that, for me, leave me wanting to watch the next episode immediately. I never found myself bored, or losing interest. I was always curious to see where things went or how they turned out.  Season 2 really continued to provide me with the prolonged feelings of nostalgia and enjoyment that season 1 gave. In certain areas of the season, it gave me even more than season 1. At the end of each episode I still found myself longing for a return to my glory days of MMORPG’s. I found myself leaving season 2 with little to really complain about or wish to see differently. However, I think that’s solely because I just refuse to try to see what isn’t there. I enjoyed what I was given by the creators, and whether or not Season 3 is an actuality I will be happy. I would love more Log Horizon as it has quickly become my new favorite Anime.  When you watch a show with expectations of other shows, I really believe it drags down the viewers ability to really take in or enjoy what they are watching. In the same light, going into a show with predefined expectations set by others is also a good way to know you won’t like it beforehand. I do my best to avoid any reviews, spoilers or opinions before embarking into a new show. I don’t want any second-hand knowledge to influence any opinions I have about the show. Diving into the world of Elder tale has been some of the most enjoyable watching of any medium I have experienced in quite some time. I have no doubt that my lack of experience in Anime and my bias towards MMORPG’s play a strong part in that. However, nothing can take away the enjoyment or satisfaction I got from this show.  While it may be counter-intuitive to what I said earlier, in my opinion, if you enjoyed season 1, you should give season 2 a chance. The world is too deprived of good entertainment, and life is too short to be picky about every little thing. I am thankful to have watched this show before watching many other Anime. I can only hope enough people out there will enjoy this as much as I have and the show will be allowed to continue for at least 1 more season.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I am always available via message if you find it necessary to tell me how wrong I am or how terrible my taste is, etc. Or if you’d like to discuss the show more, my past with MMO’s or just make a new friend.;Recommended

12;Log Horizon 2nd Season;LackOfARealLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LackOfARealLife;7;"Dear O dear... I really liked the first season of Log Horizon (I gave it a 9/10) but I have to say, this is a major step back from that. Everything that I enjoyed from the first season is watered down by a bunch of standard MMO fodder that I honestly cannot stand. I loved how unique and intuitive the first season was but it scraps that for some really basic, uninteresting crap that's all split up by the writer's failed attempt to tell two stories at once.  While this statement is relatively harsh given my score, do keep in mind that the only thing that keeps my score so high is the many things that the story and characters do right. However these things have all carried over from the first season so aren't really worth any independent merit as the whole point of a second season is to grow, innovate and most of all, improve from the first one.   Story - I praised the story of the first season for being very unique in the sense that it would take advantage of the MMO environment in more ways than one. Additionally, the politics and mechanics of the game were called into question with some fun and engaging plot devices that were caused by the sentient NPCs and asshole players.  What I just described was a 9/10 story in my eyes but now... Its f*cking non-existent! Rather than plays in politics we get dungeons and raidbossess. Also, I don't know about you, but I've never spent a month in a World of Warcraft dungeon and if I had to, I don't think it would require Lelouch Lamperouge to beat it.  ""Oh but you're just complaining about realism... that doesn't really matter in this situation"".  True... but this arc goes on for around half of the season and it only has a 5 minute payoff that doesn't even make a difference to the grand scheme of things. It's no better than filler material because the problem and solution is completely hypothetical, you don't see it, you don't notice it; the only way you can tell there is a situation is because the characters talk about it. Which is poor story telling to be honest.  The other half of the story is consumed by bland festivals and poor villains. Their only really excuse for there to be any threat is ""Oh well, you wouldn't do it in the real world"" which, when you consider the first season, is completely contradictory to everything the show initially stood for. I honestly hated the fact that we've barely scratched the surface of this show and we've already resorted to what is the equivalent of cheaters... Imaginative... right?  Another gripe I have with this seasons story is that a huge amount of significant plot is given to the children... THE CHILDREN. The most boring, standard, weak ass characters in the whole story. But I'll put that in the character section.   Art and Sound - The art is pretty much the same as the old season. However, the last season had one thing that this anime sorely lacks. Wonder. During the first seasons, we found our team going around to all these different places that had so much color and style but now we seem to be confined to the comfort zones of our animators. There are barely any new environments and any that ARE new are dark, dreary and generally uninteresting.  Sound wise, its pretty standard. Although I will make my obligatory comments such as 'the application was good' and 'it provided an extra layer to the environment', I actually thought it was actually kind of lazy. Especially the intro, which is the same one that they used in the first season... the whole first season. While it is kind of a badass song, it does get kind of tiring after a while. There aren't actually that many situations where I can praise the sound but It gets a decent score because I'm kind of a sucker for its style of music.   Character - I have to say, the characters are very good in this show. Even if they aren't presented as regularly as I'd like, they are enjoyable none the less. Typically, the characters are very unique and are extremely entertaining, they each have this 'secret bad ass' vibe about them and in some cases it does pay off.  Onto the issues I have with the characters: They have some extreme limitations in this season. Not only are they watered down to the extent that their awesome traits just seem like gimmicks but they also get pushed aside for some of the most infuriating 'shutterstock' characters on the face of the earth.  So. what with Krusty (one of my favs) f*cking off and Shiroe and his gang going off to fight the Balrog and his goon squad, we get left with all of the lame ass kids who decide to go on a road-trip. Nothing really happens here except for a small preview of the sh*ttiest excuse for character development that basically consists of 'I can walk'... cool. This entire section is put in so that we can get one small plot point that's equivalent to 'there is... no... Fedex...' and it just goes to show how everything in this season does a complete 1-80 on what we wanted after the first one.   Enjoyment - I won't deny that I did enjoy watching Log Horizon 2. That's not to say that I appreciated the things that changed... just that I'll tolerate them and although I've been very harsh in my writing, do know that this show still has potential. However the only reason I really think that is because this genre is kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.   Conclusion - If you really enjoyed season 1. Then go right ahead. However if you're not too sure about it then I would recommend that you review your options because the watered down story, distribution of the cast, development and all around structure of the whole thing turned out to be rather disappointing. However, that's not to say it's without merit. If you're still running on the highs that the previous season may or may not have given you, go for it. Just know that it doesn't really go anywhere";Recommended
13;Log Horizon 2nd Season;hexashadow13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hexashadow13;8;This is a direct continuation of the first season, though ultimately one that starts in a different direction for the most part. The first arc that focuses on Akatsuki with Shiroe and his raid going on in the background had a very different feel from the rest of the show. It maintains keeping multiple stories going on side by side. However, ultimately both of these begin to feel incredibly slow. Akatsuki's side seems to be very largely focused on developing her character. However, it takes far too long for things to happen, with her staying in a state of doubting herself and not really making any movement towards growing stronger. There is a turning point regarding such, after which things speed up a bit, which is primarily due to how it drops looking at Shiroe's side entirely until her story is finished, but it still ended up feeling somewhat slow. Ultimately it's a pretty strong arc in terms of character development, but one that was greatly marred by pacing. On Shiroe's side, the set up to the raid and explanation of mechanics starting off was interesting, but afterwards showing off the scenes of proceeding through the dungeon became a bit of a slog, which wasn't helped by how slow Akatsuki's side was moving. His side also reaches it's turning point at the same time as Akatsuki's and begins in earnest after Akatsuki's arc is over. It's at this point there's a major turning point, in that it gets a lot more interesting, with Shiroe finally showing off the strategic ability that was one of the best parts from the first season as well as a lot of good moments from other characters, such as William's speech in episode 10. From there to the end the arc is quite fast, and comes to a close quite spectacularly. The following arc changes the set up entirely, and goes back to the set up that Log Horizon's first season had towards the middle, wherein the focus is on the newbie players at a character level, wherein they get some solid development, while the focus on the high leveled players is more at a world level, developing things such as world mechanics and politics, primarily a build up to an impending conflict with Minami. At this stage, the main five as I like to call them get a lot of solid development, while also setting up the next arc. Similarly, what's going on behind the scenes at a high level is also quite interesting. However, following all this, the build up at the high level seems to take a back seat to things that were set up with the main five. This results in an arc that feels very much like a climax arc, as opposed to the first season, wherein it gathers most of the main characters shown throughout the show in one epic raid. This one starts off feeling a bit awkward due to Shiroe's indecisiveness, however this isn't much of an issue due to how this phase goes by pretty quickly and sets up the next phase incredibly well, which ultimately comes to a really strong conclusion and a good way for the season to end.  In terms of more overarching comments, this one explores more so the mechanics of the world itself beyond the MMO mechanics, and even how the game mechanics and real world like mechanics seem to act quite strangely at times. Most interestingly was the beginning of exploration of why they were there in the first place, which wasn't even touched upon in the first season, and whether they should go back at all, which is a very interesting thing to look at, and something that's rarely looked at in series like this. In terms of character development, the main character development arc for Akatsuki while not being that good as an arc did have good character development, and the development of the other Log Horizon characters was also solid. The character development outside of that was slow similar to the first season, but due to how most of the characters are old they didn't feel as flat, and even the introduction of new characters didn't make the show feel bloated like the first season began to. Bonus points for having a guy literally role playing as a ninja turtle. In terms of the story, it resolved things pretty well, with most of the minor and major things that felt they had to be resolved in this season resolved. Sure, the conflict with Minami hasn't even begun and they still need to figure out the secrets of the world and the Genius's, but it felt like where it ended was fine and a good place to begin another season.  In terms of art and animation, I think it might have improved, though not by much, and it still felt not that great. I appreciate the first season ED more now due to the insert with Isuzu. The new ED is pretty nice. With the OP, and it being the same as the first season, I went from being completely tired of it at first, to being fine with it by the end due to all the repetition.  Another solid season of Log Horizon, though one with a really slow start but a strong end.  8/10;Recommended
14;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Jersie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jersie;7;"A season 2 of Log Horizon was much needed, but the second season at least for me, it wasn't..bad it just felt like it changed its ""theme.""  But that's not too surprising considering a different studio picked it up (Studio Deen) so there's bound to be some differences. But anyway, main differences.  ~ A LOT LESS OF SHIROE'S WITTINESS WE KNOW AND LOVE ~ A lot more random character development ( aka filler) ~ A different feel to the series ~ More mysteries ( that aren't solved)  and other stuffs.  This series IS Log Horizon, but it didn't really feel like it. I mean the original season did manage to impress me because the characters were really enjoyable and engaging even without having that much development on their life out of Elder Tale, its just, I dunno, some of the development was good and I really liked it, but later on...eh.  But some of the little pet peeves that did bother me in the series was that 1. They used the same opening as the 1st season. (which is kinda ok I like it, but still thats lazy) 2. Some times the animations and stuff or just reeeaallly weird. You might not have noticed it but I did, I also just have these two screenshots on my computer, trust me its abnormal. (Lol if you'd like to see them you can ask me)   But overall, if we are not getting a season 3 of Log Horizon, and if we are and its getting adapted by Studio Deen again or even another different Studio... I won't give up on the series I will just Expect the worst and hope for the best. (And if it truly fails me I'm going to check out the manga)  Overall, I think you should at least have a steady transition before completely changing the feel of a series (Unless its a change that reveals a shows actual genre, aka School Live, Madoka Magica) The way it changes is strange indeed, with the climactic ending of the first season and the apparent new antagonist being introduced it seems like the second season would be interesting, but no...it then keeps switching, at one point, seems like all fillers, then it goes to something interesting, then back to fillers again and so on.  I didn't hate this season, it just didn't feel like Log Horizon. I even thought it was strange, I thought I lied to myself for a while because I thought all the characters getting development was great, but for some reason I guess I just didn't enjoy it. Many times I would be sitting through the ""development moments"" in a uninterested manner.  But this shouldn't stop you from watching it. This series started off strong, and I hope it can continue, every series experiences its bumps in the road, that doesn't mean its completely ruined.  So again, Expect the worst, Hope for the best.

15;Log Horizon 2nd Season;RyanSpring;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RyanSpring;7;"If you liked the first season you'll like this one well enough. It's worse, but only by a little bit, and while you may be a tad underwhelmed you won't come away from it feeling utterly disappointed either. It's basically a slightly worse version of more of the same.  Art-  If you liked the art before, which I did, you'll like it again here. The animation is crisp and smooth, the ""halfway point of this episode"" screens are still awesome and it still looks fresh and modern. That said, they did mess around with a couple character designs and make a few changes between Season 1 and Season 2, which is extremely noticeable if you're watching back to back, and as an in general I dislike when animes do this on principle and in this specific instance I don't overly care for it in practice either. Did Nyanta really, truly need a significantly bigger head? In my opinion, he didn't.  Sound-  My comments from my Season 1 review are all largely applicable here. In summary, the soundtrack is consistently better than good but worse than great, which in my mind is very solid and respectable. The voice acting is solid throughout. One or two characters are annoying but that's for reasons such as the character being young or the character being arrogant as opposed to a problem with the voice acting itself. I have no major complaints in this department.  Character-  Characters and story are where this anime drops off the most from the previous season. It's not a night and day difference by any means but it is a clear step backwards. With an already considerably sizable cast all returning from Season 1, the show opts to introduce MANY MANY new characters and this finally catches up to it, as there just isn't enough time to properly develop them all. It hits a point where there are just too many people in too many locations to keep track of and it feels like you're bouncing back and forth a lot and just a bit all over the place.  Likewise, unlike the previous season which had one pace and one pace only throughout (Slow, but it was consistent with it and I was fine with that), this season absolutely has some pacing issues. There are a couple of genuinely interesting arcs that I was really into (the serial killer arc and the raid on the Abyssal Shaft, both found quite early in the season, were my personal favorites) but there was also an episode where, quite literally, 20 ish of the 25 minutes was one single character giving a speech to the other party members and it was unbelievably dragged out, repetitive and boring. That particular episode is the worst in the entire series in my opinion. Also, the ending felt EXTREMELY rushed, which is a problem this anime did not have at any point up until then. They definitely could have cut some of the time off the slower, more boring stretches from earlier in the season and taken fewer shortcuts and logic leaps in the end.  Enjoyment-  As a fan of Season 1 I found Season 2 ""good enough"", but nothing beyond that. The ending in particular was unbelievably rushed and needed a good 2-3 episodes more than it actually got and that left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Regardless, if you enjoyed Season 1 I'd still recommend you watch this, though I'd caution you to temper your expectations.  Overall-  A slightly less good more of the same with higher highs and lower lows, Log Horizon Season 2 is a decent ride, and it'll be good enough to make you want a Season 3, but it won't blow you away by any means.  +A couple of great arcs and genuine high points +Characters you already know and love developed further +Same great sound and art from before, minus stupid character design changes  -Pacing issues, culminating in an EXTREMELY rushed ending -Too many characters in too many places doing too many things- simply too all over the place and too much to keep track of -Markedly less consistent than Season 1  OBJECTIVE RATING- Low end 7 PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7";Recommended
16;Log Horizon 2nd Season;XfizzyX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/XfizzyX;7;"To start let me say that I believe my review of LH 2 is biased based on season 1, if it were a standalone show it probably would have rated better. That said, if you are watching season 2 you probably watched S1. So this is both a comparison and an individual analysis.  Story: I found the story, while enjoyable, to be predictable and but with a few developments that kept it interesting. Just based on the premise alone I believe it would deserve a 4, while the developments on top of it add the additional two points making the story a 6. This season becomes much more involved with people of the land, but loses a lot of what made the story line important in the first season. If it weren't for our vampire onee-chan, the geniuses, and the final few episodes I would put the story at around a 5. -6  Art: Good, but nothing exceptional, around what you expect from a mid->high tier budget anime these days. Not much changed since S1, but somehow it seemed more lackluster than in S1- 7  Sound: SFX are decent but nothing special, I generally skip OPs and EDs as I'd rather spend my time focusing on the show itself, but the ED does a good job of providing a reminiscent yet light hearted feel to the end of each episode. I liked the OPs more than the average show I watched, and felt that they gave an engaging entrance to the episodes, although neither the OP or ED were engaging enough to make me want to watch them every episode. -7  Character development in S2 was lackluster compared to S1, and I felt that focusing so much on the children removed a lot of time that could have been better spent building plot. However The Addition of the geniuses, Isaac's progression, and the introduction of new characters with new architypes brought the otherwise mediocre 5 up to a 7, although I think a 6.5 would be more appropriate  Overall it was very watchable, and I enjoyed it, but compared to S1 it was lacking in many areas. - 7  Reference scoring: I rate 5 as ""Average"" as in my threshold for a show being watchable, this is the minimum score to avoid me dropping a show instantly. while a 10 is either best of the season, or best of the year. Sometimes there may be no 10s in a season, or a year.";Recommended
17;Log Horizon 2nd Season;SirQuartz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SirQuartz;8;"TL;DR: I found the second season of Log Horizon to be quite good.  The story is noticeably slower in this season than the first, and by that I mean entire arcs are shelved only to be returned to several episodes later. There's also just a lot more filler occupying most of the time spent in this season. For that reason, the writing doesn't feel as consistent or as well paced as it was in the first season. One benefit of the filler in this season is that many of the main and side characters who didn't get a lot of development or screen time in the first season, get WAY more attention in this season, and they all benefit from that. Many of their backstories and personalities/ motivations are fleshed out a lot more, so in that regard, this season does very well.  However, the story does seem to be all over the place at times, and the political aspect takes a backseat in this season. So if that was what drew you to this show, then this season won't do much to keep you interested. However, if you're interested in character development, especially for the characters who got almost none in the first season, then there's quite a bit here to enjoy.  The story lends itself well to people who don't mind a dialog-heavy show such as me.   In my opinion the art is not as good as the first season, but it's not a massive downgrade, and it's more than adequate.  Overall, I enjoyed this season quite a bit, and I look forward to the next season.";Recommended
18;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Traxdize;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Traxdize;8;"This season focused heavily on character development. By ""heavy"" i mean like every episode. There are many amazing character development moments this season like Akatsuki's, the juniors, and of course William's deveolpment. Heck, he had a whole episode with just him talking. The raid fights in this season was also very cool and that ""death"" scene.  I got to say that the animation quality was not as good as the first season, so i guess it's just decent. I especially despise their real world persona. I know they meant to make it as a kind of realistic touch but it just looks weird and awkward. At least Database is still here.  As I said earlier, this season focuses heavily on chara development. I grew to like Minori a bit more, even though Akatsuki is still best girl. Akatsuki also got a lot more involved with the cast instead of Shiroe only. One major factor is William's and Demiqas' development, it was very cool to see their development. Shiroe also had a lot of subtle but steady development.  I rewatched this series since Season 3 is coming out and I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. I highly recommend SAO but Politics.";Recommended
19;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Reconceptions;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Reconceptions;9;Honestly the season 2 went slightly downhill. The main character goes through dramatic development that doesn't even go close to his character at one certain point that I won't spoil. The season 2 is great but the story is based all around 1 arc for a long time from what it seems whereas season 1 didn't have that and was more original in that regard. If anything you'll get enjoyment from it and it definitely beats SAO series.   Other than that just be sure to watch closely from beginning to end as you will miss critical details on the long arc. The character development was okay but if it involved more of the original duo team this season would've been a lot better.;Recommended
0;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;5;"TL;DR: A disappointing second season that feels like the director & script writers had no idea where Mamare Touno is planning to go with the story of Log Horizon, so just adapted enough to pad out the 25 episode run time & hope that the audience figures out how it all connects together themselves.There are some good episodes & it explores interesting ideas (or brings them up, at least), but ultimately they don't add up to 25 episodes worth of content. Don't bother unless they announce a third season, & even then you'll probably be better off looking for an abridged version on youtube than watching all of this.  There are times when one wonders if the scriptwriters for a show & the author of the source material being adapted ever talk to each other. When series, particularly longer series, feel like they're becoming increasingly unfocused as the source material begins to run out, you'd think that the script writer & author would work together to at least come up with a framework for where the story is going so the adaptation knows what to focus on without deviating too much from where the author plans to go with their story. Sadly, it seems in Log Horizon 2's case, either nobody knows where things are going, or nobody is communicating it. (note this review assumes you've seen LH1)  Remember how LH1 ended with a climactic battle against the goblin king's forces whilst also revealing a new, human threat in the form of Nureha, guild leader of Plant Hwyaden who seems as powerful a mage as Shiroe? Well it seems the author or script writers forgot, because none of that really matters in LH2. Instead, LH2 focuses on three events that all feel like they're setting the ground for something big, but they don't know what. First is a mysterious player killer in Akihabara, somehow able to get around the zone's rules against combat between players. Following on from that (although both events occur at the same time) Shiroe seeks to deal with the financial problems the round table are facing by leading an epic raid on an El Dorado mine where all the world's gold is alleged to come from. These things concluded, the characters finally get around preparing for the prospect of war by...sending the younger guild members on a fetch quest so they can make magic bags.  All these stories continue Log Horizons rather enjoyable combining of a fantasy adventure setting with MMO rules, & the interesting ways they come together. The first story arc occurs against a backdrop the sudden & destabalising event of all the flavour text for the games many items suddenly becoming real, resulting in, among other things, Crusty being sucked into apparent oblivion by his weapon. Other issues not raised in LH1 are explored, including the idea of mortality & what it's actually like for the adventurers to die & how different people are responding to their being trapped in this new world. We meet characters that we wouldn't expect, such as a Chinese farmbot & Shiroe's alt character Roe2, who also seem to have come to life. Friction between the People of the Land & adventurers continues & we also, finally, start getting a hint at why the players of Elder Tale were sucked into the game in the first place.  Unfortunately, LH2 tends to skip over the more interesting parts while doing very little to try & tie everything together. In LH1 you had a real sense of progression between the different story arcs. Things started with everyone just getting used to functioning in this new world, which led to the Akihabara adventurers trying to better organise themselves, which led to their becoming diplomatically involved with the nearby PotL kingdoms & so on. There's no such sense of one thing building into another in LH2. Each story just kind of happens & ends with no real apparent impact. We're told it's impactful, sure. But the point is we don't see it in the same way you could in LH1.  It doesn't help that LH2 is full of what can only be thought of as filler episodes. LH2 is adapting two less novels than LH1 did (3 & 5 respectively), & it really feels like they're trying to spread less content over the same number of episodes. One particularly egregious example comes in the El Dorado raid, which involves returning Silver Sword guild leader William giving an episode long speech that boils down to ""I'm a sad loser irl, but in Elder Tale I feel important."" The raid itself is actually quite enjoyable, as it's fun watching Shiroe & the adventurers reacting to a raid zone that has been designed specifically to be unbeatable. The ending is a massive anticlimax, though.  LH2 also has an annoying tendency to introduce interesting ideas only to ignore them. The aforementioned Chinese bot character just sorta shows up for a bit before wandering off. Kanami, the tits & fists former leader of the mythical Tea Party shows up completely at random, first in a story one of Plant Hwyaden's leaders is telling another which gets cut off with a convenient ""I don't know what happened after this"" just as his story (which is the most interesting thing to happen in LH2 up to this point) was in danger of running into two episodes.  Adventurer mortality, & how adventurers see images of their real life in the time between dying & resurrecting, is touched on on a couple of occasions, most notably in the form of the Odyssey Knights; adventurers who seek out death so they can briefly glimpse their past lives before returning. Unfortunately, all the Odyssey knights are really used for is to let Touya give a boyscout speech about the importance of living. What the characters actually have to say about the subject is equally disappointing, the writing not being nearly up to expressing the complexities of the ideas being discussed.  Conversely, LH2 is happy to waste a lot of time on things I have no interest in. The magic bag fetch quest takes up something like eight episodes, almost all of which is spent just watching the kids of Log Horizon wander about being happy as Izuma learns to be more confident in her musicianship. We apparently only have five minutes for the round table to discuss ideas like how to deal with adventurers who can't cope with being trapped in Elder Tale, but there's time for an entire valentine's day episode. Considering the apparent impending war that was teased at the end of LH1, everything in LH2 just feels like it's trying to fill time & hopes you don't notice that for most of the season nothing really happens to progress the story.  Speaking of romance, LH continues having some of the most awful relationship writing in anime. Nyanta, everyone's favourite middle aged furvert, continues to groom little red moeblob Serara, which the other characters seem to find hilarious & sweet but I find disturbing & painful to watch. That oh so funny not-love triangle between a NEET (Shiroe) a shutin (Atatsuki) & an under-aged girl (Minori) continues to rear its ugly head as well. Oh & in case you thought the flirting between Naotsugu & Marie was too normal, worry not; for now there is Tetora, an idol who takes a liking to Naotsugu. This is apparently hilarious because Tetora is actually a guy but Naotsugu is the only character who doesn't realise. I guess it had to be made weirder because the relationship between Rudy & Isuzu has greater prominence in LH2 & there can only be room for one ""normal"" relationship.  Planet Hwyaden is a group that LH2 also completely fails to integrate into the story. Remember how Nureha seemed like she was going to become the antagonist of LH2? Well somewhere between that & the start of LH2 it seems something important got lost, because she is now the boot-licking bitch of some elf member of the guild, literally eating dirt off the floor. It strikes me that it would be quite an important piece of information to let us know how she went from one state to the other, but LH2 doesn't seem to think so.  Indeed quite what Planet Hwyaden are supposed to be doing in LH2 isn't clear. At first they seem to be built up as an example of how adventurers have responded to the challenge of organising themselves in different ways, taking a more authoritarian approach to governing than the more mercantile oligarchy, round table of guilds in Akihabara. But as the season continues & the supposed showdown between the two recedes into memory, it feels like they just become a stand in for whenever the show needs a bad guy. That is until the final arc pretty much completely abandons the idea of war between adventurers in favour of a new enemy, at which point one wonders why Plant Hwyaden were introduced at all.  Beyond that, I feel compelled to voice one personal gripe I have with LH, that being the continued degradation of Atatsuki as a character. It seems so long ago now that she started out in LH as a shy but pretty badass ninja. One of the things I didn't like about LH1 was how her development through the season felt like she was more & more being pushed into the role of the longing lover watching from the shadows. LH2 continues this with gusto, to the point that Shiroe can unironically say ""you're starting to become quite the ninja"" like it's not a massive insult. Between her & Nureha it's almost like the writers find the idea of powerful women as important characters too hard to comprehend.  It was perhaps a bit of a surprise to see LH2 come only a year after LH1 with the same number of episodes, given the comparative lack of source material to draw from. In addition to this, it kind of feels like LH2 either lacked the time & resources of LH1's production, or at least it doesn't seem to have been as well managed. Studio Deen don't have a Stirling reputation among anime fans, & while I can't say LH2 looks bad, it does feel a bit lackluster compared to LH1 (at least as I remember it), particularly towards the end where it feels they hadn't accounted for the action scenes that the story called for. Occasionally characters do go noticeably off model during combat or when viewed from an odd angle, which is always fun to spot. But given that LH is not as action focused as a lot of fantasy shows of it's ilk, one can forgive it for the the most part.  LH2, then, is another example of a second season that struggles to maintain the momentum of the first. Stuck trying to stretch less material over the same episode count as LH1, it feels like the writers just grabbed whatever they could out of the books with no real idea of how it all fits together in the grand scheme things. Had they been able to wait another year for more books to be written, or gone with a 13 episode length instead of 25, I think they could have told a more focused, concise story that felt like it was worth picking up after LH1. As it is, unless & until they announce a third season I see no reason for anyone to watch LH2. Even then, you'd be better off just reading the cliffnotes or watching an abridged version than sitting through all 25 episodes.";Mixed Feelings
1;Log Horizon 2nd Season;awesdh12;https://myanimelist.net/profile/awesdh12;5;I've watched the entirety of both seasons of Log Horizon and found the first season very enjoyable. It wasn't without its faults, but I felt that it made much much better use of its premise than Sword Art Online had, and avoided many of the character pitfalls that plagued SAO. However, I have to say that season 2 was a MASSIVE disappointment.  Story 6/10  There are several story arcs throughout the 2nd season of Log Horizon, but the lasting impression that they left was minimal. The story arcs for the vast majority of the season feel like they carry no importance at all but even worse, they progress at a snail-like pace. Episode after episode of filler were shoved through the season while the main story arcs seemed to be shelved for many episodes without mention before being returned to.  However, the season does tackle one of the problems that I thought was glaringly missing from the first season: the attempt to return home. However, this particularly story arc feels rushed because it's so short in comparison to all the filler episodes that came before it.  Another part of the story I had a massive problem with was when the show handed itself off entirely to the kids. This is my opinion, and some people may disagree, but I believe that the children in the show should be complementary characters at most. However, one story arc followed the children going on a quest by themselves for several episodes without any lookback at the others.  Art 7/10  I thought the first season of Log Horizon didn't look like anything special but I thought it was still very solid artwork. Some of the monsters looked really good and the action was great. While all that still remains for the most part, for some reason, many of the faces look very different. Nyanta, Serara, and several others look quite different from season 1 or even the first half of season 2. It may not be enough to be a deterrent, but it is quite noticeable.  Other than some characters looking off, the action was pretty solid, and the raid bosses looked great. Some of the copy & paste for the hordes of creeps looked meh but that's understandable.  Sound 8/10  Not really much to say here. Music is fine and voicework is fine as well.  Character 7/10  This is another part where I feel that season 2 falls short of season 1. It not only introduces many new characters, but also tries to retain every single character from season 1. This results in them really struggling to develop some of the characters meaningfully. One of the new characters, Tetra, doesn't really seem to have any characteristic besides obnoxiousness.  Also, of the villains, only one gets really significant screen time and explanations as to her motives. The motives of the other antagonists are left unexplained and it just seems like the show is struggling because it has too many characters.  Enjoyment 5/10  This was a personal thing, but I really loved Log Horizon season 1. I felt that it was everything SAO could and should have been. However, this 2nd season took a massive dip in quality. There were just too many story arcs that were unimportant and so many filler episodes just left me bored and uninterested. Also, there were way too many characters being introduced without proper development.  Overall 5/10  Very very disappointing. There were some bright spots and the very early parts of the 2nd season really lived up to the 1st season's quality, but then it takes a massive dip and becomes a boring snoozefest of endless filler episodes.;Mixed Feelings
2;Log Horizon 2nd Season;BanjoTheBear;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BanjoTheBear;5;"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)  Something that Log Horizon 2nd Season does that is somewhat strange is bring us into another world. Not just a new world in the sense that the anime represents such a fiction, but a world within another. The people of Elder Tales experience this world and discover what anyone would: that perhaps their place among it isn't right. This feeling of not belonging is something that is found not only within our own lives but within the anime as well. Indeed, in more ways than one.  STORY  Log Horizon 2 begins pretty much where the first season left off. There are still problems to be solved within the world they inhabit, with the ""Villain in Glasses"" doing everything he can to alleviate their worries.  This second season of Log Horizon moves away from the political subterfuge that the first season capitalized on for a somewhat simple reason: this is the continuation. The anime already has its setting, the characters, and a wide set of rules in place and therefore opted to focus on an actual narrative as opposed to using the politics as a vehicle for everything that was going on. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. And this is because Log Horizon 2 refuses to do anything with any of the outcomes or plot lines that it follows and establishes. For example, it brings up the idea of item effects becoming true -- a rather neat development. But why this is the case or ways in which this affects what is happening around them are left unexplained. A more prominent example is the civil war that occurs between the People of the Land and the Adventurers. It sounds like an interesting route to take, but is never looked at seriously and even discarded by season's end. This rational can be found with nearly all of what Log Horizon 2 has to offer -- the ""Geniuses,"" the Odyssey Knights, Roe 2, Kanami's events, training the People of the Land, death on the moon, etc. -- and only serves to make the plot seem incoherent in execution.  In order to have some kind of order, Log Horizon 2 splits itself up into essentially four different arcs: the Akatsuki arc, the Money arc, the Kids arc, and the Moth arc. Furthermore, each is categorized into two (given) themes: the first two are about ""rising once more"" while the last two are about ""running with friends."" And for the most part, this kind of separation works in the show's favor. Akatsuki's arc showcases her struggle, her need to prove her worth not only to the people around her, not only to Shiroe, but also to herself. She gets beaten, learns from her mistakes, and even perishes at one point. But that doesn't deter her resolve; rather, it bolsters her fortitude and allows her to rise to a new level both in body and in spirit. The Money arc, in a similar fashion, follows Shiroe, Williams, and Williams' guild as they fought over and over, never giving up or in. They band together to beat the impossible, which acts as a nice segue into the anime's second half and second motif; the notion of camaraderie. The Kids arc demonstrates the need to understand and nurture relationships between both the people you love and those you may not even know. And the Moth arc clearly depicts the idea that one almost never has to deal with everything on his or her own. That is, there are people around you who are able and willing to provide the support you need; you just need to ask.  Log Horizon 2 also manages to maintain a thematic presence between its respective arcs, too. And it's what was talked about in the introduction; not feeling like you belong. There are those times when it is difficult to understand the situation you are in or finding yourself questioning your own mindset, so you begin pondering what exactly the issue is. Log Horizon 2 does this for each of its partitions: Akatsuki wonders why she cannot be by Shiroe's side, Williams talks of finding solace in the gaming world, the kids witness a group of people who despise their position, and inkling feelings of wanting to return home loom large over many Adventurers. This kind of development is natural, especially in regards to that last point; literally being in a foreign land can cause any number of mixed emotions. But what each segment teaches is that it isn't so much worrying about belonging, but how you manage such a predicament in the first place. Which is what the previous themes aimed at doing; rising to the challenge and relying on the people around you. By following these two routes, belonging stops being an issue and starts being an afterthought. It doesn't happen instantaneously -- the Adventurers prove that finding one's place is a difficult process -- but when you do find that peace of mind, great happenings almost always await.  ANIMATION  Unfortunately for Log Horizon 2, the art and animation is severely lacking.  The art for the show, despite the world being so open and free, is filled with rather boring locales. Muddy caves, plain cities, and leafy forests are normally seen, but nothing is extraordinary. The real detriment, though, is the show's often distracting lack of quality. There are numerous occasions where characters are either malformed or given disproportionate features, causing their designs to be lacking in detail and attention.  The world within the anime lends itself well to interesting character designs, and therefore that is what's given here. Shiroe's signature white cloak, Akatsuki's ninja outfit, and Tetra's idol attire are easy examples of fun designs that fit the show's mood and provide the audience with the sense that these people really are just playing a video game.  Actual animation, though, is mostly below average. Many of the fights are given still frames or reduced actions that do not come off as appealing. And since a lot of what goes on within the show is dialogue between the characters, where only mouth movements are found, it only helps to accentuate the lack of animation during the battles that occur.  CHARACTERS  Log Horizon 2 is an anime with a large cast, almost too large for its own good. It isn't able to adequately peer at every character individually and instead sets its sights on two. One makes sense and the other is interesting: Akatsuki and Isuzu, respectively.  Akatsuki is a servant first and ninja second. As such, when she is left behind by her master, Shiroe, she feels conflicted. She cannot seem to understand why she has been delegated to such a role; that her place at Shiroe's side is almost unneeded. She feels completely weak, and when she is defeated in Akihabara it only helps to reaffirm this type of thinking. Yet, it's exactly what she required: within the dream-like world she meets up with the person she calls master. While there she learns that it isn't because she is weak that she was kept from fighting alongside him and the others, but because she is so strong, that only she could take up the task given to her, that Shiroe wanted her to remain at home. Upon reviving, she trains her heart out, and with the aide of those around her, she excels to new heights. She earns a special ""Teaching,"" protects the town, and most of all, is confident now more than ever in the abilities that she always had.  During the second half of Log Horizon 2, during the Kids arc, the show actually chooses Isuzu of all people to really focus on. Her class as a Bard isn't just coincidence; her characterization reveals that, in the real world, not only was her father a renowned musician but she had taken up the guitar as well to follow in his wake. But she laments of her father's lost fame and of her own inadequacies as a guitarist. She feels that what she has to offer isn't worth much of anything, especially if the person she always looked up to, someone better than her, was always pushed to the side. But as Rudy, her close friend, describes to her, it isn't about being good or bad at whatever you do that counts. As long as you try, that you give it everything you have without any regrets, is what truly matters. For his people are not capable of creating the tunes she can; she is to them as her father is to her. Meaning what she can do is not only worthwhile but unique, more so than she ever thought possible. And with this newfound vigor, she does what she can for the people around her, supporting them in the way that only she is capable of doing.  What both Akatsuki and Isuzu demonstrate, besides their respective developments, is something that many of the characters experience throughout the entirety of the season. And that is the notion of self-esteem. Having the confidence to do what needs to be done -- to get up when fallen, to rely on your friends, to do what is right -- doesn't always come naturally. For many people, it's a difficult feeling that isn't inherent and must instead be ""taught"" to those that don't have a lot of it to begin with. This occurs with the former two ladies. But there are also those who lose it after having acquired it -- Shiroe experiences such a dilemma near the end where he doesn't fully believe in the path he has chosen. Touya holds his ground against the suicidal knights, Nureha stands up for herself, and Demiqas swallows his pride to help the very man who humiliated him. Having the confidence to perform certain deeds can be difficult to obtain, but once it is found, and as the characters of the anime portray, it brings with it its own brand of goodness.  SOUND  The OP for Log Horizon 2 remains the same, which is a wise decision. It's catchy, it's fun, and it's the database; it is literally Log Horizon's signature sound. The ED is fine, utilizing cute singing, a simple beat, and dainty piano playing. It can be quite catchy itself, especially with the ending ""la's"" that are used.  The rest of the soundtrack remains more or less the same from the first season as well. It contains uplifting battle tones with hard guitar, drums, and choirs -- the ""Main Theme"" is both the best track for this example and the best track that the show has to offer. It also uses mysterious tunes during explanatory moments, slow guitar playing during sadder ones, and flutes during the nonchalant times. It's a nice OST that captures the mood of the anime quite well.  As far as voice-acting is concerned, those involved give around average performances. A special shout-out goes to Yukiyo Fujii as Tetora for her cracking voice while speaking.  ENJOYMENT  I found myself not quite enjoying what this one was doing, mostly because it transitioned away from the politics and tried too hard to bring in as many different elements as it could. On top of this, many of the battles weren't very impressive to see despite them garnering so much focus. Furthermore, while the Kids arc was nicely executed, it was still quite boring to watch unfold.  The only characters that I had a fun time watching were Leonardo (the turtle) and Tetora (the idol). The former was just a really cool dude while the latter was always having fun, looking to bring a smile to both me and everyone else in the world. Leonardo hardly got any screen time, unfortunately; he was placed in the same spot as Nyanta -- really cool but underutilized. And Tetora couldn't always be around to bring about the laughs.  Log Horizon 2nd Season attempts to continue what its predecessor started. Unfortunately, due to an awkward story, shoddy animation, and boring segments throughout, this tale seems to still be questioning its own sense of belonging.  SUMMARY  Story: Fine, thematically strong but coherently weak  Animation: Bad, low quality art style, good character designs, below average actual animation  Characters: Good, Akatsuki, Isuzu, and the rest find the confidence to fight  Sound: Good, great OP, good ED, good soundtrack, average VA work  Enjoyment: Bad, lame fights, boring arcs, and only a few likable characters  Final Score: 5/10";Mixed Feelings
3;Log Horizon 2nd Season;taeyeonist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/taeyeonist;6;"At the point of reading this review for the second season of Log Horizon, I'm going to go ahead and assume that you've already completed the first season of this anime series. Do note too that this review is written with no knowledge of the Light Novels. Some spoilers may be in the following review. You have been warned.  Log Horizon Season 2, like its predecessor, has a storyline that has been re-used many times over in anime, and the setting of the anime is not a unique one, everyone is stuck in a game world due to several circumstances and are left trying to find a way out. Unlike other similar anime, however, the adventurers in this story are not desperate to find their way out of the game (at least, not all of them are,) and for the most part, are content with remaining the in the game world and managing their time and the situations faced in the game world itself instead. The story touches upon many interesting concepts in a game world; the politics of a fantasy world, and how one man leads his organisation to maintain peace and prosperity in his ""town"", and deals with the various issues facing the world. From mysterious effects coming alive to the dissatisfaction of the NPCs native to the Log Horizon world, there are indeed many issues that the show explored briefly which led me to be interested in continuing to watch the series. However, the major flaw within this series also lies in this area, while the concepts touched on were interesting, they were explored way too briefly.  There was way too much uninteresting dialogues or even monologues among the characters about how they felt and what needs to be done, or how they should work together to become stronger, etc etc and the development was drawn out far too much to keep the viewer hooked to the show. Sure, there were some decent fight scenes throughout, but these were kept to a minimum, and most of the episodes were about discussion of feelings, how they feel absolutely worthless in real life and how being a gamer and never giving up gave their life meaning (seriously?) and so on.  Throughout the plot, there was also various references to the threat of the Minami town (another player-controlled town) and that of another player-guild, Plant Hwyaden that was positioned to becoming the main antangonist of the story. However, much of that was left largely unexplained, and most of the confrontations between the protaganists and this guild was left to the user's imagination (the reasoning behind them, who they were, what they wanted to achieve, etc ). A war was constantly referred to, but there was no real indication that the war was about to begin anytime soon. Strange phenomenon occurred and a war is approaching is pretty much ubiquitous every episode, but fillers continue to drag the plot along mindlessly, with valentine festivals and stupid quests to make a magic bag, which bored me greatly. I ended up skipping through some of the more unbearable parts (will leave u to discover which). Towards the final two episodes, the plot began to pick up the pace, like the first season, but I knew two episodes could not be enough to give a satisfactory ending. Regardless, the interesting concepts explored were enough to make me want to finish the season (i had time), but it would probably be dropped were i any busier. To conclude, you would probably be better off watching an abridged version (or manually skipping fillers to the interesting parts.)  Art: Nothing to mention much here, decent art overall.  Sound: Hated the opening song, but some like it , so meh. Ending is cute though. OSTs were normal, nothing worth mentioning.  Characters: Interesting, but too little was done to develop them. Ironically, the one they focused a lot on, the bard and her musical past, was incredibly boring.  Enjoyment: Given that you can endure the drag of the plot, it is fairly enjoyable.  Overall Score: 6/10";Mixed Feelings
4;Log Horizon 2nd Season;PeterJWei1993;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PeterJWei1993;6;"The second season of Log Horizon brought more enjoyment to me than the last season. Sure, there were episodes that didn't contribute all that much to the storyline, and there is much less character development than I would have liked, but the character struggles are realistic and well placed. Very few times have I seen an anime that is as genuine as this one; most of the characters have something to fight for (which isn't the case for many anime).  The following may contain spoilers!  ""it’s natural to want all of humanity to be happy, but that, in the end, is the beginning of sorrow"". This powerful line illustrates one of the major thoughts brought up throughout the course of the episodes. Unlike the first season, where everybody seems to be content with the new world, season 2 introduces the dissatisfaction from many players about living in the world. The desire to return to the old world is contrasted with the desire to stay with the new friends made in the game world. In terms of new ideas, the second season does a fantastic job of introducing them at well placed intervals. 8/10  The story lags when the low level characters are sent to level up; for whatever reason, there is a focus on them that indicates their importance later on in Log Horizon. However, their importance was not revealed in this season, even with their participation in the final battle. The main story arcs (Akatsuki's teachings, the gold raid, and the radio tower raid) are fun to watch and somewhat advance the plot, but don't give a clear direction for the anime. The final battle leaves much to be desired, as the viewer may be left wondering what the past 25 episodes were even for. Story: 6/10  The art in this season is the same as the art in the first season, and is nothing spectacular (but also not bad). Art: 7/10  The soundtrack to the second season was quite powerful in some parts, and managed to give me chills on some occasions. Better than most anime soundtracks and appropriately timed, sound: 8/10  Character development is lacking. In my opinion, this is the biggest problem with Log Horizon: the character development. Firstly, how can one be attached to the characters if they aren't developed? Secondly, it is hard to see how one can be concerned for the characters when they cannot be killed. The battles are not as intense as say, Sword Art Online simply due to the fact that nobody cares if the characters die. They simply come back as if nothing happened. This is made worse by the fact that the characters are poorly developed, and thus makes the players actually seem like NPCs. Characters: 5/10  I enjoyed the second season of Log Horizon. However, the season is lacking in both story and character, both of which are vital parts of a good anime. My enjoyment peaked when Shiroe acted indecisively during the tower raid and Henriette slapped him; that's exactly what I wanted to do at that point. There was a level of satisfaction that was fulfilled in that moment, and that certainly gave me more reason to give a higher score to this season. Enjoyment: 6/10  Overall, this season is better than the first; however, it still lacks in important areas. If there is a season 3, the story and character development must improve else I may just end up falling asleep in the 10-13 episode range. Glad that Akatsuki did better than the middle school girl with Shiroe. Overall: 6/10";Mixed Feelings
5;Log Horizon 2nd Season;daimonfo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/daimonfo;5;I marathon-ed through Log Horizon Season 1 and 2 in two days. Just saying.  I see that many people share my view on the second season as well. It was a poor representation of what was supposed to be a sequel of a top-notch anime. Instead they delivered too many plot holes, endless filler episodes that had little or nothing to do with the main storyline and deprecated the value of the shining star that was season 1.  Don't get me wrong - season 2 had amazing episodes as well. But a few great episodes doesn't come as awesome as the first season. The atrocious thing about season 2 is that I had hoped that many of the questions I had from season 1 would be answered to some degree. It appears that I was wrong, and not only I didn't get an answer but it left me with more cliff-hangers and did an open ending. And now I have to wonder if there is season 3 coming. Why should I wonder? From the 50 episodes they made, I feel half are wasted on pointless filler and annoying plot twists.  If this is the end to the anime and season 3 isn't coming, then I have to say that they pissed on the anime and left it to rot in the sun.;Mixed Feelings
6;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Eagleshadow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eagleshadow;5;I take back anything I ever said about this writer actually being any good at writing. He just had a lucky strike with the first season, and even that has shitty writing on micro level, which amazing direction covered for perfectly. Reading those LNs enlightened me about that.  Second season should have been where the shit finally hits the fan, and where we learn and explore all about what's REALLY going on, quicken up the pacing, resolve character relationships, and then go a bit beyond and have an epic thematic wrap up. Instead we get what's essentially a bunch of fillers because author is too big of a sissy to let go of his new cash cow. Where we should have at least gotten cool fights we got epic studio Deen budget of $10 per episode. Which also meant instead of cute characters we know and love, we got some deformed monsters take their place. Alright not quite THAT bad, but at places it felt like it. Not all of second season was horrible, but too much of it was for me, and the worst part is that it just kept spiraling downwards just further betraying my hopeful expectations. First season introduces best OTP Crusty and Lenessia, and then second season just entirely sidelines them. Oh, and why not return to the most unlikable character no one cares about, Demikas, and dedicate third of the season to his character development for no damn reason whatsoever.  So it might sound like a 1/10 raging review, somewhat in contrast with the grade I picked. This is mostly due to this still being Log Horizon world and cast from a loved show. There were some interesting developments like all the moon stuff, even though I would have preferred it see explored deeper and faster. Some of the raiding and action was fun as well, despite actual mechanics of the fights not even being near what first season offered in terms of clear stakes and well explained mechanics. Environments were their usual post apocalyptic overgrown prettiness I love so much. Also Tetra. At least until she devolved to a broken record of single joke character like so many others (I'm looking at you Naotsugu!)  #TeamMinorin!;Mixed Feelings
7;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Aldones;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aldones;5;"Food-centered.  About 50% of the show time can be described as: ""and they decided to have a meal..."". Should one pay enough attention to the content, it will become clear that this can't be a mere coincidence. Maniacs kept the studio staff in a cellar with no food so they couldn't think of nothing else? Doubtful. More likely that, though unofficially, this was funded by people with not the least influence in japan food industry.  You like watching ads? Cooked with a pathetic pretense of a ""plot""? Spiced with unsoundly repetitive and totally unoriginal ""humor""? Served to a hub-controlled zombie ""characters""? Then this one awaits you! :)  There are still a few good episodes though, or moments in between, mostly in second part. Arguably worth the trouble.";Mixed Feelings
8;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Tsugan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsugan;6;"Log Horizon is an anime that has been completely overshadowed by the massive popularity of Sword Art Online. The first season was an admirable attempt at creating something worthwhile, but the second season fails to impress.  Story: Log Horizon Season 1 was an intriguing geo-political chess match inside the framework of a cliche ""trapped in the game"" story. Log Horizon Season 2 abandons that premise in favor of more action and side character development, which undermines what the series had going for it. Particularly grating are the horrendously long and redundant external monologues where characters spout off meaningless exposition about ""friendship"" and ""struggle,"" as though these things weren't evident from what's happening. One instance of this takes up nearly an entire episode! Log Horizon has lost whatever magic it had.  Art: Solid animations, character design, and background.  Sound: Serviceable (with the ridiculous intro song from the first season).  Character: The core of Shiroe, Akatsuki, and Noatsugu is entertaining, while the majority of the side characters are obnoxious. The ""young group"" of characters: Minori, Touya, Serara, Isuzu, and Rudy, are a significant reason why season two falls below the first. They get roughly half of the 25 episodes dedicated to them, and their arcs were a slog to get through. The reason for this comes down to the sense that anything they do will ultimately prove to be pointless. Their romantic interests with people decades older than them will obviously amount to nothing, and their ""achievements"" include not dying or getting in the way. They were not nearly this bad in the first season - likely because they stuck close to the main cast (in fact, I remember enjoying them far more than Akatsuki).  Enjoyment: My goodwill from the first season gave out around episode 18, and from then onward I forced myself to finish the rest of it. Something about season 2 was so draining, even while binge watching. I cannot imagine watching it week-by-week, that must have been torture. The ""payoff"" at the end of the season isn't much without a third season, which, even in late 2017, seems far away (or not happening at all). Part of me wishes I had continued to put off watching this, if only to preserve the satisfaction of the first season.";Mixed Feelings
9;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Wicked_Turtle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wicked_Turtle;6;My score for sound is for the music, and the sound FX. The voice acting was B... almost C class for most of the characters, even if they were important. (Like big sis, amazing character, but she had probably the worst voice actor in the entire anime).  This anime has one of THE BEST plots to exist for being in another world. But it is almost completely ruined with the massive side story of the kids. I don't mind the kids, never have until now. But they focus FAR too much on them in this season while giving us the tip of whats going on in the main overall story. Not to mention, they're heinously one dimensional, and come to revelations of THE most simple things in existance like the importance of music. There is no reason for them to focus THAT much effort into such a miniscule thing. And the singer had the worst singing voice ive ever heard in anime. (Isuzu).  Isuzu and Rudy honestly had one of the best side stories until then. The owner and dog relationship development they had was impossibly adorable and great. But once they focused like HALF OF SEASON 2 on her music? Jesus christ did it just kill the vibe of the anime. I'm reawatching it because I can't remember finishing this season at all, and I'm beginning to realize why that may be true. Not to mention why there is no season 3. I have been hoping and waiting for a season 3 for years, and I now know why that is.  The story is develoiping at an astonishingly slow rate, there are WAY too many side stories that absolutely no one will ever care about, and then when Toya was arguing with the knight who wanted to go home. The knight actually made WAY more sense than him. Yes, it's crazy that they're killing themselves over and over. (which by the way completely negates them making death and losing memories such a big deal). But Toya's argument after saying it was crazy was completely selfish and absolutely incorrect for that conversation. The knight made perfect sense (besides the fact he kept killing himself). He wanted to get home to his fiance who at this point he didn't even know whether or not she was still there waiting for him. He had a life before all of this that he wanted to get back to, people he cared about, people who loved him and were probably worried sick or thought he was dead. While Toya is feeling sorry for himself because he finally has legs again, he's standing up for his own selfish wants in this world. He wasn't standing up for anything else. And the fact they wrote in for his friend characters to support his argument was also... so... stupid.  I have read that the kid characters had more actual development than the anime in the light novels, but that makes me not want to ever read the light novels because I truly do not care about the kids at all beyond being shown here and there. Not given the largest chunk of a 25 episode season. The world is on the verge of breaking out into a war, there are other characters traveling from the other servers, there are issues with the people of the land, and so much more, but they focus SO MUCH of the anime on the kids coming to simple and small realizations.  The raids, the MAIN CAST, the MAIN PLOT, the music, and etc, are amazng. But the heinous amount of side story and side character development is hideous.  Also, the problems with the opinion of the adventurers by the people of the land is so forced. It's literally like they wanted to insert racism of some kind into the anime without actually fleshing it out organically.  The adventurers are immortals who save their lives over and over and over, while providing other services that the people can't deal with themselves either.... and they still look down on the adventurers? These characters are LITERAL GODS to the people of the land, but they scoff at them at every turn? That makes zero sense.  If our own world was suddenly filled with god like people who couldn't die and could complete tasks for us as trade for land and such? We'd think very highly of them. We could even find a way together to semi-surpass our own mortality in various ways. I know IRL we have racial problems left and right, but I know for a fact we'd NEVER have issues with a race of literal gods that helped us all the time. I know im rambling, but it just sucks to see the anime try to force conflict where it just shouldn't exist instead of focusing on whats important.  By the way. I actually love the heck out of this anime. It's amazing... they just waste soooooooooooooo much time with things that no one cares about outside of a very small few.;Mixed Feelings
10;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Sanjayan-Ravi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sanjayan-Ravi;5;Disappointing not as good as first season.its as if the writers had no idea how to take the story further and they were trying to drag the story to 25 episodes.  The story as so many sub plots which actually makes no sense what so ever or any connection between them. it felt more like waste of time. the first season was really good and interesting but second was boring from very beginning.  The second season had its best moments but not as good as the first one. I've watched the entirety of both seasons of Log Horizon and found the first season very enjoyable.;Mixed Feelings
11;Log Horizon 2nd Season;ZanZus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZanZus;5;Medicare at best with slow progressing story. This can't even be compare to Season1 at all since it had a huge impact and filled with a lot of events. Season2 just try to showcase friendship and BS that is obviously there to fill the time and try to produce a 25eps when I really think this can be cut to 18 maybe less. There are literately eps where you need to watch 2~4mins and that is what meaningful to the story. They made a calculating/ thoughtful story and fights into Friendship feast and unrealistic events in game world.  Spoiler  Lets talk about the finale raid and how stupid it was. I just want to know how does a low level players can do damage to 90lvl monsters? Why would you put low level characters in that raid? I remember them showing that in Season1 when they met the Chif Cat and the little girl when she tried to heal and her healing was little to none. So now with a lvl 58~59, they can heal lvl90 people and what is worse in a Raid where they stated before that normal monsters deal more damage than before? That and TON of other chat events in this season Took my immersion away. Eps turn into girls chatting and nothing happening at all. A full eps is for the girl to practice and then do Shonen crap on us in the Akihabara fight. A full eps was done just to show the Elf Guild Master encourage and REPEAT himself over and over. JUST cut it, I rather watch a 12 meaningful eps than an extended version of girls talk/encouragement talk/TALK TALK TALK/Valentine filler eps..for double the content. Quantity doesnt mean Quality and this season/anime proved that point.  It was painful to finish, and I honesty didn't want to say so. Focusing on stupid love fight between a middle school and a grown girl with middle school body is so annoying. Talking about friendship that can be done at least once and be done with, getting a lot of eps to show that is annoying. Making little girl skill in organising a Raid group of lvl90 when her experience doesnt pass lvl58 is annoying. This season was annoying to watch and takes you out of the immersion when the story breaks rules(game's rules) when they sit them before in previous season is annoying.  All in all, this season made the story boring and the game setting even more boring than ever. Keep that up if there is a season3 because this is worth 5 At best when Season1 worth 8~9 with their game rules/story.;Mixed Feelings
12;Log Horizon 2nd Season;holmeskudo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/holmeskudo;6;The first half of the season was really really slow and it seemed filled with fillers and boring stuff. The second half was completely packed in and seemed t be extremely rushed. I almost felt like dropping the series midway through.  This season did not have it's ups and down, but was rather filled with explanations and was pretty much boring. They have kept the opportunity for a third season open, but I feel it would be dragging things out too much.  As for characters, not mentioning names(to avoid spoilers), some of them change personalities that is their basic nature with(Like, are you kidding me!). And then there are concepts which have been explained but in a very rough and unsystematic manner.  Though everything, it wasn't much and was filled with positivity and somehow lost it's focus and importance on what the series was really about.;Mixed Feelings
13;Log Horizon 2nd Season;SansCesse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SansCesse;6;"I mostly enjoyed watching it, but it was such a disappointment compared to season 1. I don't know anything about what actually happened in production, but it feels like all of the writers quit before season 2 and were never properly replaced. There are a handful of particularly interesting and thought-provoking events and themes, but for the most part the plot is all over the place, often feeling contrived and nonsensical. Moreover, I was constantly feeling that plot events were undermining important overall themes set up in season 1.  It seems like they were just constantly running out of ideas, so they had to constantly change the rules and throw crazy events at the characters. I very much wish that they had focused more on politics, interpersonal relationships, character growth, and realistic sorts of conflict rather than insane and unpredictable outside forces. A number of super interesting potential problems/conflicts were actually explicitly mentioned briefly, but then not properly explored. The biggest strength of season 1 in my opinion was how it set up a very interesting scenario and then let things play out in a fairly realistic/believable manner, without subjecting the viewer to too many deus ex machina surprises. In many episodes of season 1, I had fun imagining what I would do in the situation, thinking about all of the various factors involved. In season 2, it felt more like uncontrollable events kept being thrown at largely unchanging characters, which isn't nearly as fun.  I loved the characters from season 1, and while I don't particularly dislike how a lot of time was spent on certain characters in season 2, I feel that a lot of time was wasted on unimportant and uninteresting things when we could've instead been exploring more of the characters, many of whom ended up largely forgotten. The characters at the end of season 1 remained largely unchanged by the end of season 2 -- there wasn't much character growth.  I do think that from a narrower perspective, execution was OK. When characters did appear, season 2 remained pretty faithful to them; I didn't often feel that characters were being twisted. The settings and dialogue were usually OK. Individual episodes were usually interesting enough to keep my attention.  Overall, I have to say that I think it was decent. It's probably comparable in quality to popular shounen anime. I'm mainly just struck by massive disappointment compared to season 1, which was monumentally better. I really wish that some new continuation could be made from season 1, but that's probably not going to happen.";Mixed Feelings
14;Log Horizon 2nd Season;ToonShiba;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ToonShiba;6;First season was better.  The story isn't as good as season one. I've never seen a flashforward that worked well, and this one killed any tension in the first half of the show. Additionally, a significant portion of the show is dedicated to worrying about love interests that is rarely reciprocated. Developing relationships is fine. If there isn't a confession/rejection, then it is wasted time. Time that could be spent doing more with the story. Season one accomplished a lot while world building and introducing characters. This season coasted off of the earlier hard work. Lastly, there was a little dissonance between the source material and the anime. It comes off as a little jumpy or awkward conversation between characters near the end.  Art is about the same. Studio Deen took over for Satelight and I see no discernible change.  Sound was incredibly lazy. The opening was reused from season one. Also the bard Isuzu, sang the ending from season one as her performance plug in music. That's not ok. I need to see some originality from a aspiring musician. For all the talk about creating new music for the world of Elder Tale, it's awfully hypocritical to reuse songs. Side note: Do you know who's famous for playing music while watching a city burn? Emperor Nero. That's not someone I would want to be associated with, Isuzu.  Character's don't really change or grow from season one. Akatsuki has the biggest change, but that's basically her becoming less of a loner. Several characters experienced moments of doubt and renewed resolve but this effectively changed nothing. As backstories are concerned, we learned part of Tohya's. It's not lengthy, but it explains some aspects of his character. Oh. We get to see a little bit of Kanami. That's a plus i guess.  My enjoyment fell off a bit. The first half felt slow and Shiroe and the gang didn't accomplish near as much as they did in season one. The half hearted romances also brought it down. Sadly, I thought the last episode was really good. It felt more exciting than the rest of the show did. And then there were credits. Bummer.  Hopefully, it'll get a third season and find it's former glory. Maybe some new music too.;Mixed Feelings
15;Log Horizon 2nd Season;MirrorBlanc;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MirrorBlanc;6;"In my opinion this second season did not improve in any areas compared to season one, but instead it either remained the same or even got worse. I will give my thoughts on each component of the show as well as my rating for it. If I have any spoilers, I will write them between *'s.  First of all, the story. The story in this season is worse than season one. Yeah its moving forward and its exploring the world, but its done in a way that feels more like cramming in information than exploring and discovering their new world. The theme of this season according to what I saw is ""adaptability and creativity during the unexpected"", as we *see that when silver sword adapts to the new dungeon, the kids party adapts to the world while traveling alone, as well as shiroe coming to terms with their situation and coming up with creative solutions several times throughout the show*. It is a very generic theme imo, and even so it is one that the story does not execute well. Things keep happening just for the sake of keeping the story going, and that becomes more and more apparent as you go on with the show. The story gives a really basic theme and lesson, and on top of that there are no real satisfying fights or events or problems that would keep my interest engaged. I came out of this season looking to take a break of this series instead of wanting to watch season 3, and on top of that I know that if I take a break I will probably completely lose interest in the series. Mind you, the story is not bad by any means, its just really generic and plain, and thus fails to keep my interest. Overall, the story is 5/10.  For the art, I will keep it short. The art is at the same level as it was during season 1. It did not get any better or worse. The art itself is good and easy to watch. I was hoping to see some improvements from season one, but its not that necessary. Overall, 7/10 for the art.  The soundtrack/ost, I will keep short too. The soundtracks in this show are generally fine. It is not bad by any means, and sometimes helps set the scene, but at times it also disrupts the scene. I occasionally noticed the soundtrack being too intense/loud during a scene. For example when there is a dramatic scene, the music in the background would sometimes be extra dramatic which kinda took me out of the scene. Overall, 6/10 for the sound.  Finally, the characters. The characters are as mediocre as the story. I was hoping to see more character growth from season one, and I got that, just in a really bad way. *We see characters like William Massachusetts, the kids part, and Demikas grow, but at no point is that growth really relevant to either the story or the main characters*. On top of that, not only are the main characters pretty invisible throughout the show, but they show no growth whatsoever. You see these main characters, the members of log horizon, pretty often, but they never really do anything meaningful. They are just there. Honestly, the only characters that showed growth that was somehow nice to see is the kids party. If not for them, the characters would be horrible in this season. Overall, 4/10 for the characters.  Overall, the show is not too bad, but if you are expecting some engaging story or deep characters, that is nowhere near this season. This season is just for people to turn of their brain, not think, and just pass time. In that sense, it is not bad. That is what I will rate it for, and so overall it is a 6/10 for me. However, if you are looking for an engaging story or deep characters, this would be more like a 2 or 3.";Mixed Feelings

It got really annoying and very boring in my opinion. It felt like shiroe wasn't even the main character anymore, in fact throughout the whole series it just felt like they're trying to fade him out.

Is it that hard to think of anything else I'm really tired of it. We saw things about the universe that we absolutely don't give a f. We didn't see any good politics as we did in season 1. NPC-human interaction was the only thing ok in the whole season actually. There are bad guys without clear motivation. It was such a disappointment. 5/10.;Mixed Feelings

19;Log Horizon 2nd Season;SeekingWaylander;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SeekingWaylander;5;2nd season of the anime drops its art animation quality. This says alot.  Focuses more and more on the younger characters in the show, making the main character starting to look more and more like a stage prop. The plot devices moves on to introducing new characters while developing an interesting conflict that is going to be seen probably in the next season, or maybe never.  What I disliked was that the main characters of the 1st season received visible downgrades on all aspects besides of their art - they become dumber, more bad at things, more lines where they most of the time don't know what are they talking about - aka the story itself was rushed.  One big problem is that the main story is dragged and has lots of fillers this season, more than probably the last season and you won't be able to stand to watch them all.  They really tried to expand the story, but they overdid the fillers, while the main story's great points where most of the time neglected.  The fanservice this season was really bad. The romance was better in the secondary plots than in the main plot. The character developing plots where rushed, artificial, overall bad and bait as it were plot devices for fillers which had nothing to do with the main story.  They had lots of concepts they tried to touch, but because of many problems they didn't quite succeeded, but they managed to pull through some of the main story well.;Mixed Feelings
0;Log Horizon 2nd Season;dertswa687o;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dertswa687o;2;"Story:  Is Log Horizon 2 filler? Now, let's stop right there. The very fact that I even considered leading off a review with this question doesn't bode well. But, to answer that question: No, Log Horizon 2 is not filler, but it feels like filler. Everything in the show is canon, covering 4 light novels and even going into some material that hasn't been officially released yet. Season 1 adapted 5 LNs, so we're already looking at slightly less source material. Within these 4 LNs + extras of material, Log Horizon 2 decides to adapt 1 of them to only 1 episode, so we're left with 3 LNs + extras for 24 episodes.  So it should come to no surprise that the first point of contention is the dreadful pacing of the show. The plot moves extremely slow; there were multiple times that I got bored because I wanted the show to move a bit faster and get to the point. Log Horizon was never a fast paced show to begin with, but there were several episodes (especially in the 3rd arc) where it felt like virtually nothing happened. In fact, I might go so far as to say the first 21.5 episodes of Log Horizon 2 were a waste of time. We get 3 entire arcs during those episodes but we never actually see the results of those arcs. The plot feels contrived to the point of searching for something for the characters to do rather than them actually moving toward an obtainable goal. The last couple episodes sort of introduce an interesting goal, but by then it's too late. However, these episodes are actually good. Had we gotten a whole season of this it would have been much better.  But why don't we get any results? Because those arcs existed for the sake of character development. Log Horizon 2 develops Shiroe, Akatsuki, and the kids a little bit, but it takes way too long to do so. Log Horizon's strong suit was never its characters; it was the world and its MMO aspects that made the show interesting. So the fact that we spend so much time on one of the less interesting parts of Log Horizon hurts the show immensely.  While it spends so much time developing the cast, it also introduces a bunch of interesting ideas to the world. But Log Horizon 2 never goes anywhere with these cool ideas. They're shrugged off in favor of character development. Any expansion of these ideas would have been great.  Now I want to talk about the 3rd arc in particular. We follow the Log Horizon kids (colloquially called the Noob Squad) as they go on a quest. It's so boring and unrelatable that I wanted to drop the show, and I almost never drop shows. The Noob Squad is far and away the worst characters in the cast, and getting a second arc (they had a short one in S1) devoted to them is just too much. The slice of life ""comedy"" parts of this arc in particular are more cringe worthy than anything else.  Characters:  Again, Log Horizon 2 tries its best to develop its characters. We learn about them a little more and maybe change a little bit, but it doesn't really add anything to the show. Again, Log Horizon's strength was never its characters. Perhaps the biggest fault in terms of the cast is its sheer size. With 41 characters listed on MAL, it's unsurprising that the viewer might forget about some of the minor ones, especially when it comes to stuff like guild affiliation. Now, a large cast is not necessarily a bad thing. Legend of the Galactic Heroes doesn't get bashed for its huge cast. But Log Horizon doesn't always know what to do with all its characters, so many of them fall by the wayside.  Shiroe is still the best character in the show, but his screen time is limited compared to the first season. It's really disappointing because Shiroe was the one who most drove the plot forward in the first season. Plus we only get a fraction of the glasses pushes.  Oh, remember Nyanta? Everyone's favorite cat swashbuckler chef shows up for an episode or two just to remind us he exists. Instead we get Tetra, who serves almost no purpose besides comic relief.  Sound:  Log Horizon 2's OST uses many of the same tracks from the first season, and there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that. The songs are good; they usually fit the mood fine and there's nothing really to complain about there. Log Horizon's OP, Database, also returns for another go. Database is a good song, but I don't think we needed 50 episodes of it. Log Horizon 2's OP also shamelessly spoils some stuff from the series again. The ED isn't bad, but the transition into the ED is awful. There are a few episodes that end on a somber or intense note, and then the super happy ED pops in just before the episode actually ends and destroys the mood. The voice acting is fine. The kids' voices can get annoying though.  Art/Animation:  Log Horizon switches animation studios for its second season, going to the infamous Studio Deen. The first thing you'll notice is that characters look slightly different. It's most noticeable on characters with long hair such as Marielle. The designs are more faithful to the original source material, but I personally found the slight redesigns in the first season to be aesthetically pleasing.  The animation itself is bad to the point of distraction. Characters' faces never quite look right. Tons of shortcuts were taken and it's completely noticeable and frustrating.  Enjoyment:  Now, I could throw all this aside if the show manages to be fun to watch. For me, it wasn't. When my first thought week by week is ""Let's get this over with"" then that's a terrible sign. The show has a bunch of slice of life moments that are supposed to be funny or heartwarming or something, but they're tiresome and cringe worthy. The action scenes are all right, but they're few and far between and also take a few animation shortcuts that don't make them as fun as they could be. The plot isn't particularly engaging until the very end, but those last few episodes aren't enough to redeem the boredom that's before it. There are a few moments I genuinely enjoyed, but by and large it felt like a drag.  2/10  Yes, this is a harsh score. But if I can't take much of any enjoyment from the show and it doesn't really succeed in any area, it's tough to give it points at all.";Not Recommended
1;Log Horizon 2nd Season;LAZYBEEE;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LAZYBEEE;1;I am not biased or anything. I loved log horizon first season. It had decent premise, good character development and everything else was plain awesome. But how can such an anime stoop to such a low level in second season. I mean in second season they spoiled almost everything that the first season upholded. Second season was so focused on shiroe that nothing else mattered. All the girls were swooning over him. The swooning was there also in the first season, but was limited and had so many other elements that made the anime stand out. I mean other characters played a significant role in the first season, Whereas in the second season all the other characters were sidelined and Shiroe was a major part of the series.  This anime is a treat for five year old shiroe fan girl, For every one else its plain dreadful. It messed up so bad, I am considering SAO 1st season better than this.;Not Recommended
2;Log Horizon 2nd Season;Magister_Jakene;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Magister_Jakene;4;"I binge watched the first season of Log Horizon (now to be called LH because the full name is a chore to type) over the summer, and I found it quite enjoyable. The action kept me on the edge of my seat, and the MMORPG elements of the show encapsulated me into the world. Every episode felt like another new adventure, another breath of fresh air. The second season, however, did a complete 180 for me. This review is based off of what I saw in the show, because as I explain in the next paragraph, I skipped a couple of episodes.  Story (2): When the season first began, it was pretty interesting. It started becoming boring about... the third episode. The raid Shiroe went on came to a standstill, so the story took a break from him and focused on minor issues in the Adventurer City. This wouldn't be a problem if Shiroe was revisited the next episode, and it was shown he figured out how to beat the raid, but unfortunately, this is not the case. The director seems to forget about him, and instead feeds us some incessant nonsense for a couple of episodes that NO ONE asked for. Some characters go through an existential crisis for like, 3 episodes. Seriously, the problems the characters go through are very simple, yet they last for many episodes. The Player Killer problem lasted about... give or take 5 episodes. The story became so boring and predictable, I found it a chore to watch LH2, so I took a break from it for a couple of months. I came back as confused as ever, so I read some MAL reviews on the story, found that many agreed it was insignificant and a dissapointment, so I skipped a... few episodes. By few, I mean I skipped to the last 2 episodes of the SEASON. To my chagrin, other than a couple of characters introduced, I missed out on absolutely NOTHING. If I had watched those 14 episodes I skipped, it would be nothing more than a waste of time, and time is one of the most valuable things a human has. I am greatly offended the director tried to waste mine.  Art (6): Nothing innovative, nothing amazing. Some character designs look very similar, but other than that, there is a nice variety in the adventurer races and such. The action scenes look average, but the way the HUD is shown when transitioning locations or viewing someone's stats brings a charming feel to the show.  Sound (7): I judge sound by enjoyment of the opening and ending themes. DATABASE by Man on a Mission, the same guys who did the Seven Deadly Sins' first opening, is an amazing song. I was, however, disappointed that they just recycled it from season one. To be fair, this is probably because the director thought, ""It worked so well, why change it?"" The ending, however, I find very boring. It's one of those types where once you hear it about to play in the last couple seconds of the last scene of the episode, you just immediately go to the next episode.  Character (8): Honestly can't judge this because I didn't watch enough of the show, but from what I did see, as much as I hated the tangents the characters went on and the filler episodes the director gave us, there was pretty nice character development going on. Not all of it is good though, like as I stated before, many characters battle with themselves internally for many episodes when their problems aren't that big of a deal.  Enjoyment (2): From what I saw, LH2 does not have much fighting in it. Most of it is politics and characters going on rants about some problem. When Shiroe goes on a rant, it is enjoyable because of his superhuman intellect. When other characters do it, they make it so boring to listen to. No one on the show acts nearly as smart as Shiroe, and he usually solves all their problems anyway. When he's not there, it's like giving a wrench to a four year old and saying, ""Fix this car"". Like, they just don't. They can't without Shiroe. When the director took Shiroe away from the Adventurer City, this is EXACTLY what happens. They can't deal with a problem by themselves without spending 3 episodes trying to figure out how to even start finding a solution. As for the politics side, the politics are very meh. Shiroe carries the City and the Roundtable Alliance by making all the big decisions, which I don't mind, since it advances the story, but the other characters are subsequently useless.  Overall score (4): If ya boy knew LH2 would be this bad, I would have never watched it, which is why I skipped most of it once I realized (and had been warned) how bad it was. At this rate, I won't even touch the third season, which was recently announced, to my chagrin. Unless some big directing changes happen to the show and it becomes as captivating as the first season, I will unfortunately not make the mistake of wasting time watching it. We shall see, though. Oh, and one last thing. Please, for the love of God, DO NOT MAKE DATABASE THE OPENING AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 24 EPISODES.";Not Recommended
3;Log Horizon 2nd Season;_I3lank;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_I3lank;3;"After hearing the announcement of the 3rd season I decided to check out the anime. I know the anime is old but with the upcoming season there may be new fans that might want to check out the show.  In this season they tried to do way to much for a 25 episode anime, with the pacing being off. We got so much useless info dumps which I felt didn't really matter because they would just add another rule which would make the other obsolete. New threats were being introduced left and right with none of them being solved. The princess adventurer they introduced in the first season left us at a cliff hanger, and you would expect them to follow up on that. Instead of her planning an attack or strategizing they showed her moping around and grieving.  The shows pacing and threat dumps could have been solved easily if they didn't focus on side characters too much. This shows biggest issue is showing us useless character development. Side characters like: Minori, Touya, Isuzu, Roundelhouse, get way too much screen time than they deserve. In both seasons of the anime specially in this season the took up 80% of screen time. While we got to see the MC's party in bits and pieces most of the anime focus on those 4. They get so much screen time but in an actual raid with the MC we only see Minori fight and frankly that goes for only 2-3 seconds of Shiro saying something to her. I would have loved to see more of what Kazuna was up to in other servers or what Plant Hwyaden was up to. Instead of getting that we get an episode of valentines day about cooking sweets. Isuzu and Roundelhouse have a strange relationship, her treating him like a dog is very disturbing. This anime should be called ""Side characters and maybe the MC"". I will keep the review short so, if you like a story that doesn't involve the MC then this anime is for you. I just can't see myself passing this.";Not Recommended
0;Log Horizon;yahzee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yahzee;9;"What started off as what seemed to be a bland-version of Sword Art Online turned out to be one of the hidden gems of anime shows. Log Horizon starts off slow with the usual setup of a ""no-faults"" main character, but with a slight difference. That difference is how the main character, Shiroe, strategically approaches each situation that makes Log Horizon an exciting show to watch. Shiroe isn’t the typical shounen main character that powers up throughout the story and then overpowers his enemies. Rather, he’s the guy in the background, the “villain in glasses” who controls the flow and direction of battle. Overall, Log Horizon is a genuinely fun show without all the pitfalls that we've come to expect from a shounen-type series.  The story begins by introducing a set of typical MMORPG rules/restrictions that many viewers are familiar with. But what's not so familiar are the way these rules are manipulated, opening paths to feats that were previously impossible. When one thinks of rules and boundaries, one would assume that it would limit whatever it governs. Ironically, these strict rules expand Log Horizon's story from a generic show to a well thought-out strategic adventure. It's an extremely appealing story given the relatability to many of its viewers. Having played games like World of Warcraft, I and many other viewers understand how the core mechanics of questing, leveling, raiding and more work. That’s why when other possibilities that greatly affect these game mechanics are discovered, Log Horizon truly becomes special. It also feels completely plausible. It is NOT a “power of friendship defeating the boss that was previously kicking your ass.” It’s fundamentally sound and really becomes an intriguing show.  Although some may disagree, I really thought that one of the show’s biggest strength is how the characters all have defined, unique roles. Where Shiroe is the leader in the shadows, Crusty is the leader in the spotlight. Where Akatsuki is loyal, quiet and small, Naotsugu is the loud, pervy and funny big guy. And you also have... Rundelhaus, who's in a category of his own when it comes to goofiness. These kinds of distinctions allow Log Horizon to have all kinds of interactions between characters and the possibilities become endless. To me, the characters are one of the biggest strengths of the show.  The story is what makes Log Horizon quite different from a typical shounen show. It has heavy political/economical themes that tie well into one of the show’s biggest points: building a world. In fact, there are a few episodes where the dialogue gets quite heavy and may not be everyone’s cup of tea. With that being said, I genuinely enjoyed the dialogue and found the story to be engaging. Log Horizon also executes its' story quite well. I found the pacing and structure of the arcs to be satisfactory and enjoyable.  Art is decent, it's not UFOtable amazing, but not terrible either. It's consistently pretty decent and not ""inconsistent"" like some other shows. Nothing else to be said here.  Sound is decent as well, the opening and ending songs are quite good but take time to get used to. The background music, while not bad, is overused. You'll know what I mean when you get halfway through the season.  With all that being said, Log Horizon is not a perfect show. For example, why does no one care about what's happening to their bodies in the real world? You'll find yourself asking this question as you watch the show. It's almost as if the topic of what's going on in the real world is completely forgotten. Also, some people may find that the interactions between the characters become quite repetitive, especially with Henrietta, who has a loli fetish for Akatsuki. Her interactions with Akatsuki are always of the same manner and it gets boring very quickly. It seems that Akatsuki's character is reduced to mere loli humor later in the show.  On a side note, I really feel that it's important to point out that Log Horizon is not a combat-heavy show. That in itself already distinguishes itself from other shounen shows. But what's really important is how the show focuses on actual strategy and manipulating the rules within the game world that the characters live in. If Log Horizon's story didn't have these elements, I really believe that Log Horizon would not be an exciting show to watch, it would just be another okay show.  Log Horizon is not your typical show. It has firm grounded roots of realism in a world of fantasy that is genuinely exciting to watch. From diverse characters, to bending the rules in a world most of us are accustomed to, Log Horizon is a good show and is worth your time. With that being said, it is by no means a perfect show. It's a rather simple show in terms of concepts, as well as having plot holes in the overall story. But Log Horizon more than makes up for it in terms of its pure enjoyability (isn't that why we watch anime in the first place?) and execution of its story.";Recommended
1;Log Horizon;Deiger;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deiger;9;"Log Horizon. The basic premise, as is evident in the synopsis, centres around a group of players who by some - as of yet - unexplained phenomenon, got stuck in an online massive multi player role playing game.  I can imagine anyone familiar with Sword Art Online doing a double take at this point, obviously comparing the two anime, itching to see how one holds up against the other. SAO lovers and haters alike will travel down this line of thought. To be honest, I was and is one of the latter. Infact, I went into the series hoping to find all I missed in SAO after reading some assuring extracts that put this above Sword Art Online. And it did deliver.  I should mention, however, that this anime is not everyone's cup of tea. If you're not the type to sit down and enjoy a dialogue heavy show such as this, the anime will most certainly come off as dry and boring. To be fair, if you're on the extreme end of dialogue-heavy fanaticism, the end-result won't vary. Log Horizon is the kind of anime that sits on the neutral ground - its dialogue heavy, but the concepts are not overly complex, thought provoking or riddled with worldly wise philosophies.  That is not to say the show is not intelligent, but nonetheless, if you take the word of Log Horizon fans(a.k.a SAO haters) that judge the show as the intellectual's SAO, then you'll end up sorely let down. Because, at the end of the day, Log Horizon is still a kids show that shows no shame in shying away from the more ugly facets of the scenario, and the devious schemes that characters keep praising as something phenomenal are rather elementary.  Not that its a bad thing, the anime itself doesn't go out of its way to show its characters as human super computers or anything. We just get a normal gamer guy with above average intelligence, and one who actually does his homework to get things done. Seeing he's surrounded by other normal people and AI, it might even be a good thing. The situations themselves doesn't call for anything more than some rudimentary marketing and administrative tactics and strategies.  The story is in any case, fairly well executed and implemented; you won't find the characters doing utterly pointless actions or going on completely fruitless endeavours. Although, like they say, don't judge a book by its cover, because first arc of Log Horizon can mislead you on the show's main focus. Without spoiling too much, they first go on a rescue mission and the short arc serves as an exposition of sorts to give us a gist of the combat and gameplay mechanics, which while not a central theme, does get some focus later on in the series. Even so, combat is not heavy in Log Horizon. When there is action, it mostly relies on tactics and strategy. There is no one-man show where the mc's love overrides the game mechanics or anything. But, if you forget the two arcs where action is important - Log Horizon is about economics and politics at its core.  One significant factor that differentiates Log Horizon from its thematic predecessors like SAO and .hack series is that death in the game does not equate to death in real life. That is, the players can respawn infinitely. It is not without consequence though, as there is something even more terrible than death that await the players who carelessly let their HP bars easily chip away to zero. Oops, I said too much. Maybe you should go watch the anime, because I won't be dropping any more spoilers.  Now, onto the sound. The OST at first didn't at all sit well with me. It was sharply contrasting to the shows feel and theme. However, slowly but surely, I ended up loving it and started humming along. I can't honestly speak in-depth about the back-ground score...But they were certainly mood building, though I have my doubts about whether they went overboard with it. Some of the mood-building has gone to water and left me with a facepalm because the epic moments were made epic only because of the soundtracks. Without those, I wouldn't have batted an eye at the game winning strategies the characters employed and would have wrote them off as common sense. Meanwhile, the ending has already found a place in my favorites. Never skipped it, infact, I'm listening to it as I'm typing.  The art was quite mediocre. Nothing to speak of. Its not too bad and its not too good. I felt that it didn't quite feel like a game for most part. But you really can't complain, for all we know, they may not even be stuck in a game per se. The character designs were pretty generic and all of anime's usual motifs are used. I particularly liked the mc's design.  Characters of Log Horizon are not unique or spectacular in any sense. But they get their job done, and the mc is a wits above fists guy for once, and he's good at it. There is also the charismatic guy who gets all the praise, but luckily, we see him as a side character for the better part of the show. Not really surprising given Log Horizon takes a radically different route than most mainstream shounen shows by focusing on the action behind the scenes far more than the frontline adventures.  I have noticed the characters getting blamed for reacting too calmly towards their predicament and this is one of those criticisms I don't understand. If you came across such a criticism, take my word - that is baseless. Completely baseless.  One character I was thoroughly disappointed with was the loli assassin, Akatsuki. I actually had high hopes for her. But much to my dismay, her potential as a character was left untapped in terms of both execution and elucidation. I certainly won't condemn her character for development as she seemed to be wallowing in sadness because of her inability to be of sufficient use, and even more her because of her being unable to empathize with the mc towards the end. She still has a lot of potential for development, especially in the light of next season coming shortly. No, my problem is with her lack of chemistry with the mc. The same slap-stick jokes with the show's resident pervert can get old really easily, and the whole cosplay facade she uses to interact with Shiroe doesn't help either. Heck, Shiroe himself thinks her antics are nothing more than cosplaying when her personal monologues shows that she is invested in Shiroe on a more than superficial level. If there was some backstory for such an introverted personality, then I could have let it slip. But sadly, nothing of that sort came up. I'm hoping that the next season will take some time to flesh out her character, seeing she's the main female lead.  Rest of the characters were great for the duration of the show and we can hope that they will play more important roles in the upcoming sequel. Some of the secondary cast got a lot more development than the main cast, both a positive and negative point in my books.  Another weakness in its character department comes from overuse of certain gags. Shiroe adjusting his glasses when thinking making everyone go 'Ooohh the villain in glasses', Henrietta's obsession with dressing up lolis, Naotsugu's openly showing perverted tendencies only to get interrupted halfway by wrathful Akatsuki etc being only some of the examples. While this is not uncommon or ineffective, too much of these can be frustrating.  As I mentioned at the beginning, this anime is not for everyone. For those who like dialogue heavy anime that is not dark or depressing, with some light slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure - this is exactly what you're looking for.  As a last note, I must warn anyone who has been pushed onto taking up this anime by SAO haters - Granted, its different from SAO and does decidedly better than SAO on the story department, particularly the pacing. But its not the masterpiece that many of them paint it to be. Log Horizon is a little above the average shounen, however, its still an anime with flaws that cannot be overlooked. My own overall score is a result of the kind of entertainment I derived and not at all reflecting of the show's quality from an objective standpoint.";Recommended
2;Log Horizon;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"There are certain degrees to which MMROPG series are adapted these days. While not an original concept, Log Horizon has been unanimously compared to another popular series known as Sword Art Online. It’s almost unavoidable considering both series are based off a light novel and relates to character in an MMORPG setting – an open world based off a video game. But really, that’s all there is to it and the similarities ends there. Log Horizon isn’t a rip off of SAO, .//hack franchise, or anything else relating to the MMOROPG theme. It’s a show that shines in its own way that makes its point in the horizons.  Log Horizon is an anime adapted series based off the light novel of the same name written by Mamare Touno. The setting takes place in a virtual world known as ‘Elder Tale’. Log Horizon follows the story of a young man known as Shiroe who has earned a reputation in the community. His nickname “Shiroe the Strategist” fits his title exactly as such because of his analytical skills and abilities of intellect. Together with his companions, they take on this world that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.  As a MMORPG series, Log Horizon adapts many of its concepts relating to the fantasy realm. Nothing in Elder Tale is real but they have their own mechanics. These include but is not limited to various classes players can adapt their roles in, monster categories, economic/politic aesthetics, and world concepts. In fact, the world that Log Horizon is based on is colored with all sorts of fantasy attributes; goblins, murlocs, gryphons to just name a few. More importantly is the fact that the world itself also has its own rules such as penalties, death/respawns, pking, etc. On many chances, Log Horizon follows a suit of narrative through which mechanics are explained thoroughly to give viewers insights. These narratives often goes over background information and how exactly certain notions function. Log Horizon presents this flawlessly because it both tell and shows its mechanics firsthand. It brings out its best when the show follows the concepts of actual MMORPG mechanics. As a former MMORPG player, I am pleased to see this such concepts being explored. More so, Log Horizon also focuses on world building with its construction of its fictional universe. It aims to inform, presents it, and delivers.  Series based off of MMORPG often incorporates a large cast of characters. Log Horizon is no stranger to a large cast. Most prominently however are our main protagonists of the guild – Log Horizon. Shiroe, Naotsugu, Akatsuki, Nyanta, Minori, Tohya, and Isuzu makes up this group of players and together stands as a unity to face their world. Even from the first episode, there’s a sudden degree of chemistry between each member that can attract viewers to see how it develops. On a technical level, each character has their own personalities and more importantly, a class and level. This is important as each class has a skill of its own as well as a sub-class that is imperative for a guild to survive. For example, Akatsuki’s class is ‘assassin’ with a sub-class of ‘tracker’. Both of these functions well in stealth missions where infiltration and gathering information is significant to ensure a guild’s success. Log Horizon demonstrates this well on various degrees by testing the limits of these classes for both its advantages and flaws.  The series functions well in terms of storytelling on most parts. Every episode offers something new to the audience with its game mechanics whether it’s combat, politics, or even culinary. While the series does have its concept of survival, it doesn’t just focus on that exclusively. Rather, its formula consists of various degrees of concepts that connects the story as a whole. It focuses on an internal level of struggle and warfare that sets Log Horizon as a unique series. Furthermore, it also engineers the overall theme of the plot and doesn’t go overboard with its comedy, drama, or even romance. Of course, there is also action offered which brings the show to life with its sequences. What makes it more entertaining and attractive is the way characters engage in combat with their skills based off their classes. Even players in a party such as healers play prominent roles and no one is left in the dust. There is also no player that plays the role of an overpowered protagonist or break through impossible circumstances through deus ex machina. The concepts and mechanics are explained beforehand and applies when the time calls for it.  Even though Log Horizon is the main guild that is explored throughout the series, it doesn’t just focus on them. Supporting characters also get their spotlights with their own classes, levels, and secrets. There’s a degree of connection that the audience can relate to. There’s no random fan service or the typical cliche of the accidental bath walk-ins that sets no relations. As a fan of MMORPG games, I appreciate its presentation that focuses supporting characters and not just its core players. Even NPCs (non-playable player) gets its exploration that is intuitive. And as a MMORPG based off setting world, it doesn’t forget to add the idea of PKers – player killers. It’s a common sight to see and offers a threat for players to face beyond just the world and its creatures.  As fantastic as it sounds, Log Horizon is by no means a perfect series. Fantasy wise, the world of Elder Tale adapts itself well but hard to take it at heart. It quirks into silliness with its high dosage of comedy that makes it hard to take the show seriously on occasions. Demonstrated by its cartoonish designs, most of the characters lacks any features of impressive design. Akatsuki is also advertised as a young girl with a cute face but dangerous nature which is ironic since her age contrasts greatly with her appearance. Her devotion to Shiroe, or rather in her words “protecting her lord” can get repetitive and lacks substance. Essentially, Akatsuki suffers from developments and characterization. And from some flashbacks are shown, most of the main characters’ backgrounds are only briefly touched and vaguely touched upon. It leaves viewers in the dark as to how our characters became the players are they are in Log Horizon. Finally, the connection between the players in the game and their real life counterparts is completely omitted leaving viewers in the dark on their origins.  Despite some of these drawbacks, Log Horizon still offers impressive features to take notice of. From minute one, the show focuses on its theme and doesn’t venture far off of it. The world of Elder Tale also presents location that is credible such as the natural mountains, the ruined cities (that resembles past civilization), fresh breathing beaches, and dampening caverns. There’s a sense of reality that the audience might relate to if they have played MMORPG games in the past. It adapts itself based on these themes where Log Horizon and should be endeared.  The artwork of Log Horizon strikes as a make or break situation. By credibility, it works out very well with adapting its fantasy style of Elder Tale. Satelite studios previously were involved with other fantasy series such as Guin Saga, Arata Kangatari, and Fairy Tail. Here, they make the show believable with its artwork designs at the surface level. On other hand, character designs sometimes becomes distracting and hard to take seriously with their designs. Akatsuki is perhaps the character that stands out the most with her appearance as an assassin but nothing else strikes more than her as that. This same applies to Shiroe with his geeky like appearance that acts as the brainiac of the group. They just seems to be there with its blend background. However, Nyanta is one character to take notice of because of its feline features that really defines the fantasy atmosphere to what Log Horizon is.  Soundtrack wise, Log Horizon strikes as an outstanding feature. Beginning with the OP song, the show defines itself with the theme of “Database” that blurs between lines of fiction and reality. Most characters’ voices fits their roles well with some that defines their characters more than others such as Nyanta. The OST also performs at a level that matches scenes whether it strikes as important, emotional, cinematic, or comical. The ED song also reflects a more innocent theme with Akatsuki as its main mascot.  As a former MMORPG player, I appreciate the way Log Horizon presented itself. Rather than just going with a concept of the typical virtual war trope or saving the world, Log Horizon sets its basis on a foundation of mechanics that is presented in an exquisite way. Not only is it accurate to the basis of an MMORPG setting but the characters themselves drives the story with their adequate roles. Log Horizon also likes to focus on various degrees of politics and economics to explore its insight on a more intellectual level. It also adapts world building concepts that becomes a focus to drive the story forward. It explores territory an MMORPG exactly as it should be and doesn’t lose track. On some technical note, it can take some time to get used to the artwork. Comedy can also strike as a hit or miss depending on your preferences. Still, the end game is that Log Horizon is an unique series. It’s not a clone of Sword Art Online or does it leave audience confused. In fact, you’ll likely be forming your own theories as each episode progresses relating to its world and characters. It’s appreciable that Log Horizon can adapts so many concepts into the show as an industrial revolution of success.";Recommended
3;Log Horizon;karamatsuuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/karamatsuuu;10;This is not Sword Art Online period.  I've decided to write a review because I severely misjudged this anime by assuming it was a cheaply made SAO knock off.  Although it has the same premise of players being stuck in a virtual world, Log Horizon approaches the theme in a different direction by mainly focusing on the impact and development the players have on the virtual world of Elder Tale. The author's approach on the subject of assimilation, which I personally felt SAO lacked, left me thoroughly satisfied with political and historical based struggles of settlement, such as laws, and cultural integration between Adventurers (Players) and People of the Land (NPC's).  Being a fan and enjoying both series, I will confidently state that I honestly enjoyed Log Horizon more than Sword Art Online as a more unique and thoroughly written and well developed storyline.;Recommended
4;Log Horizon;densilex;https://myanimelist.net/profile/densilex;8;"A review for Log Horizon, a show that for a long time has been my favourites, and is currently the only show I've ever fully rewatched. The 2nd season is a different story for me, but this is the first one, and this is the Log Horizon I love. This review includes spoilers from only the early episodes, so I can freely explain the plot of the story.  Story: Plot 4/5, Development 5/5, Total 9/10  In the first episode Shiroe, a gamer that has been playing Elder Tale for soon 8 years finds out he is locked inside his game world. He goes on to find his friend Naotsugu and meets up with an assassin called Akatsuki. In hope of finding out more about this world he now lives in, he goes north on a quest to find Serara, a girl from his friend's Marielle's guild.  The great thing about the plot is that it is unique, and also not that straight-forward compared to Sword Art Online. What I mean is that you can't see the end of the series in the first episode, and I think that is a great aspect in series. I find motivation to watch the series when I don't know what'll happen and thats why I think the plot of this series is great.  Now on to the development - the story goes all different ways. On Shiroe's journey(and in the arcs that don't include Shiroe) you will see all aspects of the Elder Tale community and how it's changed. Shiroe is a man of action, and though there aren't fights all the time Shiroe is always fighting. Some might consider the end of the season weak, but I think it's a great introduction to the second season.  Art: Animation 2/5, Design 4/5, Total 6/10  The art of Log Horizon is cheap, and the battle scenes are weak(That's probably why we don't see a lot of them). How ever, some fights are still in battle and though the fights dont bring out a lot of visuals they add to the enjoyment in many different ways. The design is very nice and the Elder Tale world is bright and pretty. Later in the show the art suffers, maybe something like a degradation in production work(maybe because of a small budget?) and the things we liked dissapear.  Sound: Voices 3/4, OP/ED 0/2, OST 4/4, Total 7/10  The voices in the show are mostly on-point, though there were some misfits and I notice the voices are sometimes over-done and sound a bit stupid, though were few of these flaws.  The opening for this series is a good song, though it's a minus that I can't say ""The Openings"" since there only is one, and you only like it for a while, since in the beginning you think it's too repetetive and in the end of the show you get tired of it. I dislike Loli(a lot) and though I like some J-pop songs this one didn't cut it for me.  For the OST, this is the best part. It's the main OST, the one where you know Shiroe, our MC is going to f*** s*** up, a happy one, and a couple of neutral ones. Some are done by orchestra's and your ears recieve a great massage in every episode. I absolutely loved the OST for this show.  Character: 4/5 Design, 5/5 Development, Total 9/10  Some of the characters in Log Horizon might seem like clichè anime characters to some, but they all have their play in the anime and they all add greatly to a nice community of Log Horizon where all the small chit chats add to the enjoyment. Now for the main characters; Shiroe - Our main protagonist, a university student in his middle twenties, also the strategist of the Legendary ""Debauchery Tea Party"". He is friendly but people call him ""The Villain in Glasses"" because of his drastic choices and amazing plans. Akatsuki - A loli ninja that includes roleplay in Elder Tale even after the day they all moved into Log Horizon, making Shiroe her master. Naotsugu - A pervert Guardian that used to be a part of Shiroe's party, being on all the big raids. He also knows Shiroe in real life. Nyanta - Also a roleplayer after the Apocalypse, the half-cat man is referred to as ""Chief"" by Shiroe, Naotsugu and others that used to be a part of the Debauchery Tea Party. Little of his backstory is revealed, though something hints to that he teached Shiroe the game when he was starting out.  Now onto the development of the characters, where Log Horizon really outdoes itself. We have development arc's that greatly tell us about the supporting characters and the main characters, we are introduced to traits that we didn't know the characters had and you won't say ""That character is normal, just like me"" just like you would compare yourself to Kirito of SAO, who only does what is ethically correct. The characters develop and move further as they find out more about this world of Elder Tale, especially Shiroe, as a lot of the story is based on his choices.  Enjoyment: 10/10  Though the production is not of the highest quality, I loved this show and I had to rewatch it, since there was so much fuel driving me. All the lovely characters, the story engaging you to go further, episode by episode and the amazing OST of course.  Overall: 8/10  I'm putting an 8/10 here since I feel this show deserves it, but I have a 9/10 on my list because Log Horizon really has a soft spot for me. Sorry if the review was a bit one-sided.  I'd like to put some recommendations at the bottom; If you've only watched shounen and want to try something new, try ""Haikyuu!"", a sports anime about volleyball. If you want to watch another great shounen anime, I'd gladly recommend ""Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakaritsu"", you can read up on the story on another review because it's a bit hard for me to explain.  Hope you liked the review!";Recommended
5;Log Horizon;Calitz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Calitz;9;Hello buddies, why don’t we have a little chit chat over Log Horizon.  Log Horizon is an adaptation of a manga written by the fabulous Touno Mamare. Maybe you already knew him as the creator of Maoyuu Mao Yuusha, which by the way really is something. The anime adaptation is directed by Ishihira Shinji who works on Fairy Tail’s adaptation, and some Full Metal ’O’ God Alchemist (Brotherhood version of course).  Now that the bases are set, let’s start the review.  Story: 9  The main lines are pretty simple. Due to the arrival of a new expansion pack, a bunch of players are transported into a game named “Elder Tale”. In this mess, we are following the daily life of Shiroe and his friends through various situations and challenges.  Actually these lines could remind you of SAO (Sword Art Online). Buuuut (you should have expected it :D), the story is way more developed. In fact, where SAO was just barely trying to add some depth to the story, Log Horizon is perfectly managing to create plots in plots through other plots. Each episode of Log Horizon adds to the plot, which is mainly about the players adjusting to their new world.  There is something you may keep in mind, this anime is made by Touno Mamare and this is what is really making the difference. If you’ve seen “Maoyuu Mao Yuusha” it’s really really similar. We don’t have pretty much action but it’s still intense. This is also reminding me of “Spice & Wolf” (Ookami to Koushinryou) in many ways because it’s not based on pure action but it’s still considered.   Art/Sound: 8  The work made on the anime is pretty incredible. Let’s start with the music here. Opening and ending are both quite good, and the background music is a bit repetitive in the second part of the anime. The animations are fluid, but nothing transcendental. In a general manner Art is pretty good but could have it improved a bit. They could have made it more like MMY but whatever. The thing that made my marked it 8 is the work made on the UI they used in the game. When I’m thinking about augmented reality games I imagine it like that and I don’t feel like they are making fun of my gamer side :)  Character: 10  The character building is pretty impressive too. All the character have a real personality, even if we found the stereotype of all anime (loli, tsundere,..) each character of this anime is important. Even secondary and supporting characters are important. Each of them gives a little plus to the anime. Moreover Shiroe (the main character) got a really interesting chara design, his personality and action are evolving in an interesting manner.   Enjoyment: 10 I feel like I could watch it again and again and I’m eager for the second season which is pretty rare for me. Some moments are really delightful, other tears you in half. I really love anime that make me laugh or make me shed tears. And Log Horizon is one of them. I discovered it by serendipity and after watching I feel like watching “Spice & Wolf” which is one of my favorite anime.    Overall: 9,25  I don’t feel like marking it 9 because I really enjoyed watching Log Horizon and I’m really eager for the 2nd season. You should watch it if: -You’ve enjoyed watching SAO -You’ve enjoyed Spice & Wolf and Maoyou Mao Yuusha -You want a SAO like with a real half season :DDD  You shouldn’t watch if: -You want only action and to put your brain away -You can’t stand waiting for a 2nd season to come out -You are an alien  Thanks for reading my 1st review and have a good time watching anime :);Recommended
6;Log Horizon;Aizen-Dono;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aizen-Dono;7;"Let's speak about Log Horizon: an anime that tells about, for the most part, the adventures of the characters trapped in a virtual world; definitely very pleasant for those who appreciate the genre, but with some underlying defects that can not be ignored ... But let's start, analyzing, specifically, every aspect.  STORY 5/10: Unfortunately the story is not the strong point of this anime. In fact, in my opinion, it is a bit abstract and lacking in depth, because this does not seem to have a definite starting point and evolves with a certain repetitiveness and carelessness. It's, essentially, a story based on how the characters manage to build a society, to deal with the uncomfortable situation of being trapped in the game; but, indeed, it doesn't give space to something fundamental, or rather to some normal questions that any sane person, in that situation, would pose: '' How can we get back to the real world? Is there a way to do so or not? ''. Perhaps because, knowing that they probably will not be able to get back to normalcy, they make their best efforts, almost exclusively to make their lives in the virtual word work; But this thing is not specified in the anime and it may just be a mere reflection of mine, and therefore can not be attributed as a strong point of the story.  ART 8/10: As for the drawings in general, they are very well made and cared for. The environments are very colorful and bright, almost enticing the viewer to dive in; the graphics of the characters are really well done and linear, and even the animations are well cured and sliding.  SOUND 7/10: Very interesting regarding the sound level: the openings and endings are beautiful; pleasant are also the various OSTs present in the anime, and finally they also made a not bad dubbing.  CHARACTERS: 7/10: In this anime there is a wide range of characters who are more or less useful, but with the almost total lacking of villains, that kind of annoyed me. Let's start from the main protagonist Shiroe, also known by several nicknames because of his personality, he is definitely the cornerstone of the anime, in fact, thanks to his skills as careful strategist, he will manage to put aside the rivalry between the various guilds and create a good basic society. To help him in this endeavor there will be Akatsuki, a ninja that will strongly bind to him, and Naotsugu, his longtime friend. Then there will also be many other secondary characters, such as Nyanta, a catman who will have some merits in the culinary field, Marielle, head of one of the guilds, Henrietta, her second (my favorite), and many others that will contribute to make the watching of the anime sliding and enjoyable.  ENJOYMENT 7/10: I didn't mind this anime, because there have been many moments of hilarity and madness, which made me laugh a lot; for example the way how Shiroe used to get annoyed because of his nicknames, or when Akatsuki was teased by Henrietta etc etc ...  In conclusion, in my opinion, it is a partially successful anime, apart for the story which is vacuous and baseless. I strongly hope that these flaws will be resolved in the second season, because I think that this anime has a lot of potential and it would be a shame to make it vain because of a dull story. If I were to recommend someone to see whether or not this anime, I would say so, because it is very fun and enjoyable, and it is perhaps this what makes me close one eye on the defect of the story.";Recommended
7;Log Horizon;Blazestar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Blazestar;8;"**The character development part of the review is not good.**  Yet another MMORPG anime.  People always compare LH with Sword Art Online. For me, I cannot find even the slightest similarity between them. They are two completely different show with distinct objectives and focus. I have not started season two as for the time this review was written thus tis purely based on my impression on the first season. All constructive criticisms are welcomed via PM or comment. They will be greatly appreciated.    STORY (Concept 3.5/5, Development 4/5) Rounded down  The series starts off with a terribly explained situation: random players get trapped in a fantasy universe. great. massive cliche. In the world of Elder tale, they have absolutely no objective whatsoever and finding a reason to live is extremely challenging. The protagonists along with his companion begin their journey to, uh, no where.  Instead of trying their butt off to get back to the reality, they seem to be okay with their dire situation. This lead to a problem since we tend to forget it is a ""game"", rather than a normal fantasy universe. Yes, things such as game mechanics and the ""death's penalty"" introduced later in the series do remind us of what is going on, but on a grand scheme of things, it becomes rather confusing and pointless.  Rather than action-packed fights and emotional rollercoaster, LH decides to take a intellectual route. The establishment of government and the negotiations with other factions are some interesting plot lines that involves multiple characters and they give people reasons to continue watching this show. Although some of the lines are kind of bad paced (princess arc) and misleading (round table), the curiosity (if you have any) will probably make you wonder what will happen to these characters. Some of the stories are somewhat smart, but none of them really clearly communicate the moral message to the audience which makes the entire series feels like a popcorn show.  At the end of the show... it feels like a harem anime but I guess I'll let it slide since the majority of the story is considerable interesting.    CHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 4/5)  Log Horizon does not really follow the general formula of adventure-type stories. The typical Adventure consists of a idiotic protagonist and bunch of followers to help him out. In LH however, the characters play their unique role without a sense of ""everybody helps one dude"" feeling. The character designs not complete copycat, but they look pretty familiar.  Notable Characters include Shiroe the mastermind, Akatsuki the bodyguard/lover, Naotsugu the tank and Nyanta is awesome cat.  As a fan of Lelouch and Light Yagami, I can see the shadows of his predecessors in Shiroe's personality. He is clever, but not to the point where the world trembles beneath him. There isn't really too much of development as I can recall (there is, but they are definitely not notable enough to be noticed or cared), but throughout the series we learn about him gradually. I feel like his mind isn't all that clear in the beginning and at the end I do learn more about him as a complete person. Perhaps that counts as development?  Ironic enough I don't feel like any other ""main characters"" have developed at all. Akatsuki changed her opinion toward Shiroe slightly, Naotsugu stays as an dumb tank and Nyanta keeps his image as the big daddy despite how awesome a daddy he is.  The three little kids have their cliche development and that's pretty much it. reminds me of third Hokage's son's team in Naruto. The romance between the princess and Krusty was a very interesting touch. I almost felt like he is the hidden protagonist of the show.  All in all, the design is quite unique and interesting and the development are scattered all over the place. I personally like that. All of the characters get a little bit of love.    GRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 2.5/5) Rounded up  The art in the show is considerably unique. Not all characters have the same face (shout out to SAO) and they are quite comfortable to look at. The armors and clothes have different designs on different persons, each guild has its signature color and style. The background is very beautiful. The art focuses on landscape and the 16th century architecture. Each city has its unique building style and the background. You may not like it, but the effort is there for sure.  The fan service in the show is very minimal. (Hurray!)  Ah... The animation. The animation is shit. It is just so bad. It was made in 2013, and there shouldn't be any excuse to use simple flashy light to represent most if not all super abilities. The skill control menu panels are quite cool but when you compare them with SAO's... uh... not the most exciting animation and action.    SOUND (OP/ED 1.5/3, OST 3/3, Voice 2/4) Rounded down  DATABASE DATABASE DATABASE. This is one of the openings that I will absolutely skip no matter what happens. I wouldn't even consider listening to it just for the sake of appreciation. No, the opening is a very poorly written song that has no connection to the theme of the anime. I can only think of a person who loves repetitive noise booster who would enjoy the song. The ending is very cute. And that's pretty much it.  The OST however is top tier. The majority of the songs are made of various instruments you can find in a traditional orchestra blended with some electronic addons. The heavy metal feelings and the occasional vocals makes great combo. They give a nice sense of glory. I would say the OST is what carries this production without letting it completely overshadowed on the back of SAO. (Yes, the LH OST is better than SAO's in MY opinion. it is just more engaging and stylish.)  The dub is plainly average. Every character sound too unemotional and the lack of personal identification fails to give the show a fair atmosphere. That said they are not hard to listen to, it's just not good enough. The Japanese original is actually much better. I personally would recommend sub over dub, but if you hate reading, the dub won't do too much harm on your overall experience.    ENJOYMENT (9/10)  Despite the problems I pointed out previously, I find some of the elements especially enjoyable. The big cast of character and the unique way of narrative (we don't know what people are actually thinking) along with the glorious OST is beyond my expectation. The story isn't that good, but it is still considered semi-intellectual which I enjoy, very.    OVERALL (7.5/10) Rounded up  Animation aside, Log Horizon is a very well made SHOUNEN anime. Tho not brilliant in any particular aspect, the plot is very intriguing. Instead of randomly coming up with ideas one after another, the story built upon each other. With that in mind, I kindly overrate this a little bit since I believe it simply isn't fair for the creators since too many shounen shows are full of fillers and misleading plot/characters. This is definitely one of the shows that is worth checking out and I would say it deserves much more attention/credit than what it is got.  If you don't find this review helpful, please give me some feed back so I can improve my content and give higher quality contribution to the community, thank you! :D  Peace.";Recommended
8;Log Horizon;AnimeElitist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeElitist;8;"At the peak of my disgust of all of RPG Anime things, here comes the Log horizon. Unfortunately not saving the day just making it a bit better but that suffices for now. Let me clear up some things first before I will get to the review itself.  Usually RPG Anime genre which is at some point certainly very tempting but nonetheless vastly empty, except the fact that the story is happening in virtual environment nothing new nor awesome is going on by all means. Not mentioning all of the wasting of potential for fun-service which is understandable for the simple reason that most of Anime consumers are MOE zombies and primal reason of existence of companies is revenue. At the end of the day we don't very often get a quality product.  When I started watching LH I almost quit, guess why? I had enough of ""This is not SAO"" shows. A week later when I cooled down a bit I gave it a second chance. Now I am really happy that I did so.  I really wanted to evade comparison between SAO and LH. Actually I do not understand why everyone feels the need to compare these two Animes. The only common element here is that real people get stuck in an MMORPG, the result is different. Unfortunately two of them have been confronted so often, that I don't have a choice.  The show started quite slowly with what seemed like typical, hackneyed plot. But later things start to snowball. Problems are getting more serious and world begins to take on dimensions, both growing at a steady pace. The animation is very pleasing for the eye and the music aspect also has a lot of nice ""straight out of game"" like soundtracks. Action scenes seem to be rather lacking in this kind of genre however the in-show implemented game mechanics explanation is acting like compensation. The imbalance between dialogues {not as important ones} and the action is a con. LH is unfortunately Shounen so we can't evade Cliché and fun service. Constant rubbing of glasses by our smart-ass heroes was pissing me off. The main character, Shiroe, plays both the protagonist and antagonist role. He is behind everything, playing the game, always having some card in his sleeve {NGNL similarity}. Akatsuki aka. Lolininja is a wasted potential. Then we got a pervy guy Naotsugu and antipole gentleman catman Nyanta {WTF}. Even though this Anime certainly has some problems like slow acceleration from the start and cheesy humor the plot is really good and most importantly the RPG element is very well executed.  The authors of this elaborate work we're aware of the potential and did not make the same mistake as the SAO, which was mostly about {weakly executed} romance and nothing else. LH truly focuses on the breathing online world where the players are imprisoned, the impact of their actions and choices on the world, communication with the NPC, skills and abilities, magic system, events etc. Unlike in SAO. There is no sense of imminent threat. So whatever is happening its still just a game {little memory loss is nothing compared to death imo}  I recommend this show for all the SAO haters out there. Anyway, I am looking forward to the second series.";Recommended
9;Log Horizon;arrazolavguille;https://myanimelist.net/profile/arrazolavguille;10;"People trapped in a MMORPG sounds like something we've seen at times especially recently, we have one of the animes that more polarized as the community:Sword Art Online  SAO is a similar premise, but still quite different in their implementation and development and it is not fair to compare one nor to the other.  What makes it different, Log Horizon show some implication from the first chapter, which will be the tonic that makes the whole anime, and its they're stuck in the game, what they gonna do now?  That's what makes it different, the lack of an objective/specific goal that leads them to be more outstanding fight to survive, from this point that the narrative focuses on present problems of a society, such as abuse of power, disregard, power forces, commerce, social classes and even in some part the migration.  Log Horizon complex issues is a pretty nice way, and that is the true subject of the picture, not a villain at first glance, human relations become a sort of villain with which our protagonists struggle, plus some moments that are involved in battles that represent fairly realistic as are the MMORPG  The characters are well-drawn, all very good complete its mission within the anime including the one that most stands out is Shiroe strategist, which is one of the best protagonist in a while, in the course of the anime have seen a progress in the character to first costs interact with others to take the risk of being the head of a movement, he understands he has to put aside the passivity, and if you want to improve you have to take initiative, his nickname ""the villain with glasses"" is that as a strategist knows that there are sometimes you have to push a little more rules on the strings to achieve its mission, which goes beyond normal prototype of the perfect protagonists, which works and gives a perfect theme for anime touch.  The art is pretty well done and consistent, good fluidity and the few fight scenes are technically very good, the character design is pretty good too, in part sound also very acceptable nothing extraordinary but pairs well running scenes, what would be the opening database remarkable feat. Takuma ( 10 Feet ) executed by Man With a Mission.  Log Horizon is a highly recommended for those who enjoy complex topics anime, the anime has a few action scenes or fights, contains elements of comedy that much lighten the atmosphere , in many chapters the protagonists are caught up in conversations so if 're not the type to enjoy that nearly 80 % of the chapter no action is not an anime for you, but you invite him to give it a try , it's really a good option to see and in October it has been revealed will have a second season.";Recommended
10;Log Horizon;MAND4;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MAND4;8;"While Log Horizon may not end up being in the list of favorite shows all too many times, and while majority of its characters won't have a long-lasting impact on the audience, it still manages to be a fun ride with occasional fantastic moments as well as some downfalls which all eventually balance themselves out.  When I first found out about the show, I, as many probably have, instantly thought ""Oh look, carbon copy of SAO. *sigh*"". Still, as I scrolled through some opinions, a lot of people have said that Log Horizon plays out as SAO should have. I'll leave that to your own decisions and instead will focus on Log Horizon as an separate entity in the anime world.  LH follows Shioru, our main protagonist who suddenly finds himself locked in a world of ""Elder Tale"", massively popular MMORPG with over twenty million people worldwide. He soon forms a party of three, with Akatskui, honorable shinobi who shall always follow her lord and knee the pervert, Naotsugu. Fortunately, that is not where the cast ends and we are soon introduced to heavy array of characters, ranging from veterans to beginners, each given enough time so we can learn something about them. Unfortunately, not all of them are that interesting.  The story of LH works as a cohesive unit, but what really struck me was the world building. It really did feel as if the author invested a lot of time into making a specific world which does resemble that of MMORPGs - oftentimes, before the OP, we're given some information about the world and its rules which serves its purpose of introducing us, or rather helping us dig further in as to what kind of a world Elder Tale forms. Without spoiling too much, the story of LH is somewhat divided into short arcs, each one way or the other connected to the overall plot which comes into focus later on. Each separate entity is enough fun for itself and the mysteries introduced, especially the characters, are enough to keep your attention on. Overall, story was well above decent, albeit nothing too masterful. It did its job and it did it well.  When it comes to production department, I'd call it the weakest part of the anime. Visuals are often stiff, animation often lacks impact and even battles, albeit exciting, aren't as good as in other similar shows. Even though character designs vary, it does feel as if too many characters are similar and/or act in similar fashion which is oftentimes just a sore. Another gripe I have with the show is the sound and all its merits. Some VA did a fine job representing their characters while I wouldn't be so certain when it comes to rest. There are, sometimes, weird pauses during their speeches which don't fit their character. The soundtrack itself was sorely lacking though; there is maybe 1 or 2 memorable themes while others are barely noticeable at best. I do feel that the soundtrack and the sound overall could have been given more time, especially because of the settings. Some spells, for instance, Astral Howl, do have that visual and sound impact while others ... well, don't. They're too generic.  The characters of LH are ... well, some are decent, some are rather good and some are just plain unnecessary. Shirou, our main character, is a good spin on the ""all powerful MC"". Although anime, or rather characters within anime world, try to sell him as this almighty entity, we soon realize that he's just an above-average intelligent student with enough capacity to work with the information he gets. It's a nice spin and I did like his character overall. The other duo, faithful shinobi and open pervert did their job as a good support and humorous pair. Sometimes they'll get at your nerves, but more so than not they're quite likable. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I'll be honest: it's not that great. Especially the children, or the beginners as they call them. They're oftentimes annoying and given too much space and time which they simply seem to misuse to irritate the viewer even more. While there are some interesting characters, you'll simply feel as if the anime would have been better either without them or with them having less screen time. Other characters do have somewhat defined personalities, and are sometimes joy to watch (Crusty and princess come to mind), but even then they don't feel developed enough. Overall, though, given the number of characters with names, faces and personalities, I think they did a fine job representing them.  I would lie if I said I didn't enjoy Log Horizon. Was it mind-blowing? No, not really. Was it this epic adventure you'll remember forever? Erm ... no. But it was a fun ride that lasted 25 episodes and I am looking forward to the sequel (mostly because I'm interested about one girl from Shirou's flashbacks. She seems fun). Battles were smart and weren't ""oh, I'm this massive dude and my powaaah is bigger than yours"" but instead they focused on teamwork of parties, which I found quite intriguing. The touch on politics and economics might put some viewers off but I personally enjoyed them and saw them as another layer of depth to an already established world. So yeah. Me like me some LH. (sorry Star Wars fans :()  If you do feel like SAO was lacking something or if you're simply looking for a decent anime, you can't go awry with Log Horizon. It isn't epic, it isn't mind blowing, it won't send you to places that will make you think about your life, but it will provide temporary enjoyment and it won't bore you to death.  TL;DR: recommended.";Recommended
11;Log Horizon;Edward_Low;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Edward_Low;9;Log Horizon has really impressed me. It is a solid 9/10 and possesses a quiet intelligence and maturity that rivals other flashier shows.  Any anime about being stuck in a computer game is inevitably compared to Sword Art Online. When Log Horizon made its début on the scene, the most common compliment was that it was ‘more realistic’ than SAO. This didn’t strike me as necessarily a good thing. I don’t want to watch a show just to get lectured on proper MMORPG mechanics. As it turned out, Log Horizon does get the mechanics of MMORPGs right, but what makes it truly great is so much more.  The problem with SAO was that it was blatant wish-fulfilment. The main protagonist Kirito is a Gary Stu whose only flaw is being so damn good at the game that everyone else is envious of him. Along the way he acquires the trophy wife Asuna (just because a girl can use a sword and is given the label of ‘strong’ does not automatically make her more than a cardboard character) and other female members of his harem. By sheer deus ex machina he is carried along by the plot and saves the day. What makes it worse is that the series never really looks at characters beyond the individual that is Kirito. SAO is less about Sword Art Online, the game that they’re stuck in, and more about Jesus Kirito.  In Log Horizon's later episodes, it is highly unlikely that even a third of the frames in the episode contain Shiroe, the main protagonist. Shiroe himself is no self-absorbed prick with delusions about the extent of his powers. Next to Kirito, Shiroe is like an adult, which only makes sense because Shiroe is also a graduate engineering student. Log Horizon is about the trapped gaming community and the political ability of an individual to influence the direction society takes. Shiroe’s only goal, outlined simply, was to ‘improve the mood’ of Akihabara, and he did so by kickstarting the gaming economy through the creation of goods in demand. His meticulous plan to bring the other dominant powers to cooperate with him is not something that can be compared to some flashy sword swings on the part of Kirito. Next to Log Horizon, SAO is purely solipsistic.  Log Horizon's cast is diverse, and one character in particular deserves mention. Minori is a young girl also trapped in the game, and spends most of the initial episodes basically performing child labour under the auspices of an exploitative guild. After being liberated by Shiroe, the story focuses on her growth as she eventually assumes roles of greater responsibility while facing ethical decisions. In this case, Shiroe ends up playing the role of a mentor and role-model, and it's fascinating to watch Minori through mimicking him, understand his motivations behind his actions. Of note is also Princess Lenessia, a self-described 'lazy and unmotivated' girl who ends up changing the fate of her country, and playing a key role in a powerful political alliance. It's generally hard to manage a cast of nearly twenty consistently appearing characters, but Log Horizon manages to make them absolutely endearing and sympathetic. More than anything, Log Horizon paints an optimistic and comedic picture of human cooperation while skilfully portraying an intriguing world with shadowy politicking in the backdrop.  The one flaw that Log Horizon has is its art and animation. The character designs and backdrops are a bit bland (though charming) at times. Especially because Log Horizon's focus was never on battles - battles being hardly conducive for creating anything constructive - it really isn't that bad not having top notch art. Season two will be airing this fall, and I'm definitely watching.;Recommended
12;Log Horizon;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;7;Log Horizon follows in the same path as Sword Art Online in being focused on a popular MMORPG game where thousands of its players find themselves incapable of logging off the game under mysterious circumstances. Unlike SAO though, Log Horizon is a bit more light-hearted in its focus on how players handle their rather unique situation and the serious moments are not as heavy-handed, the latter being the major reason why I never got drawn into Sword Art Online. Mainly focused on enchanter Shiroe and the members of his party, our leads strive to restore stability and order to the game as many players are abuse their unique predicament for personal gain to enforce their will on weaker players, steal items and player-killing.  The series does a rather great job tackling the normal behavior of players participating in an MMORPG with novices, veterans and rule-breakers. This can involve anything from helping novice players, making friends, actively participating in game activity or actively abusing the unique circumstances of the game. Regular MMORPG activity such as special events, forming guilds, gaining game experience and getting rare items is seen and part of regular social activity within the series. Those that form parties even strategize to develop strategies to fend off enemy threats as they either compete against rogue parties or fend against enemy monsters. In addition, logging out of the game isn't the only bizarre thing affecting players and the gaming environment as other bizarre things pop up that get explored which affect how players deal with their present situation.  Gaming isn't the only element addressed within the series either as a good chunk of the anime's plot revolves around Shiroe and his comrades trying to make sense of their current situation in the game and restore order to it. The task isn't an easy one as players are wary of the current gaming environment thanks to guilds and parties reigning control over parts of the game and intimidating other players into joining their ranks or not to put up any resistance. Through extensive knowledge of the game and social interactions between others, Shiroe develops a number of plans throughout the series to deal with rogue guilds, rescuing novice players, dealing with hostilities and bringing some semblance of rules for players to follow that involve some bits of ruthlessness as he exploits unique abilities and game resources to drive off the corrupt elements affecting players within the game.  Beyond Shiroe, we do get introduced to a number of other characters who have their personalities and mentalities explored as to why they participate in the game. While a number of them milk character types typical of MMORPG and rom-com titles, they are still a likeable bunch and the majority of characters get enough fleshing out where you can connect with them as they adjust to events that take place throughout the series. Only issues that come up with the series for me are hit-and-miss attempts at comedy coming from typical anime tropes mostly coming from Akatsuki's character in some form, a few rather shallow characters and the series still ongoing into its second season as the mystery surrounding the changes to the game still left unresolved.  Still, Log Horizon was an engaging series for the most part as it struck a nice balance between typical MMORPG activity and its plot exploration with Shiroe trying to deal with their unique situation taking place in the gaming world and restoring order to it when chaos breaks out. Fans of MMORPG-based anime titles should give the series a look.;Recommended
13;Log Horizon;Tsugan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsugan;8;"This anime is playing second fiddle to SAO in regards to viewership; but can hold its own through thought-out dialogue and a political intrigue filled plot line.  Story & Character: The story is carried through several strong characters; and a few side characters that over-shadow some of the leads. I especially did not enjoy Akatsuki the assassin-girl. It seems like she could have had a whole lot more depth to her but they didn't add it in. Shiroe is definitely one of the best male protagonists I've recently seen (much more interesting than Kazuto from SAO), and by the end Minori seems to almost take over the female lead role from Akatsuki.  Art & Sound: Living in the Database, Database, whoa-o. That intro song is hilarious.  Enjoyment: Overall, I think that I will definitely be watching the 2nd season once it's completed. Is it ""better"" than SAO? I think it does a better job of fleshing out the game world they are stuck in than SAO, but does a poor job of explaining the real world situation outside the game, which is where SAO excels. I see no reason for someone not to watch both SAO and this to see which one they prefer, as they both have something to offer.";Recommended
14;Log Horizon;Lord_Odous;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lord_Odous;8;“Hard to believe it all started with a hamburger that has some flavour.”  Log Horizon is a surprise package, it began airing not long after the immensely popular Sword Art Online ended, and shares the same concept: players are trapped in a MMORPG and unable to get out, also its animation isn’t as flashy as SAO, causing some may cast their doubts onto Log Horizon, I was one of those viewers.  However, things actually turned out rather well here.  STORY: 8/10 The story of Log Horizon can be summarized by 3 words: simple, straightforward, sweet. Its plot follows a very clear path and it is not difficult to understand what they are trying to convey, and the dialogue is sufficiently added to provide enough explanation for the viewers. I like how Log Horizon gives us a decent insight on how does the MMORPG “Elder Tale” works, from the job system, currency, guild system and many more, so at least you are familiar with the setting and then it will be easier to understand the motive of the characters’ actions.  The story of Log Horizon progresses through different arcs, which sort of come off as the different stages of new challenges our protagonists have to go through, although timeskips still occur here, it is merely a tool used to tell a story lasting throughout several years.  Politics are actually an important plot point here, so as you can see things can go really far from here.  It may be argued that most of the trapped players seen in the anime don’t seem to be so urgently wanting home, but it may be explained as simply they do not know the way, and had grown accustomed to the new world they had no choice but to adapt and inhabit.  ART: 7/10 The animation of Log Horizon is one that doesn’t stand out and impress you, causing you to run and catch your dropped jaw rolling all over the floor. However, it is decent enough to be pleasant to the eyes, and the battles showcased are decent. Each character is distinctive from each other, and changes their attire (equipment) to suit their needs.  SOUND: 6/10 Nothing too impressive as well in this department, you have background music which always accompany the scenes, but they are hardly memorable. You will hear the same battle track several times as you progress through this anime. The characters voices aren’t that superb either. I actually liked the catchy OP, Database~ Database~  CHARACTERS: 7/10 Log Horizon generally splits their protagonists to 2 groups, Shiroe and the Tea Party gang forms some of the highest level and the strongest members of the show, they are the ones to solve the mysteries of this entrapment and to further explore the world. Minori and her party of lower level characters form the “newbie” characters, who are still learning the basics of the game and showed us more about getting stronger in this world.  My biggest gripe with Log Horizon is that we are not given much background regarding our main characters, they are strong just because they are the veterans in the game. We do not know why Akatsuki is so attached to Shiroe, other than he gave her an appearance-changing potion at the start of the series, so sometimes you just have to accept that the characters are what they are shown to you and nothing more.  However, all is not unwell here as despite the large cast of characters, each of them are still explored sufficiently, each of them have important roles they have to fulfill, and by the end of the day you will know and remember all or most of them, which is a fine job done by the developers.  ENJOYMENT: 8/10 Log Horizon isn’t an anime that will make you utterly depressed and devastated, or will confuse you with its huge collection of jargon words, instead it is a simple and straightforward anime which one can have fun easily. Dialogue may be abundant sometimes but the pacing is fast enough to ensure you won’t get bored too much. If you like gaming, this is definitely a decent anime for you.;Recommended
15;Log Horizon;TKkissyou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TKkissyou;7;ok, first order of business: do NOT watch the dub because it makes Nyanta (cat man) sound like even more of a seductive pedophile.  ok, fine I'll be honest i was kinda into it too.  I'm going to start with the bad. What killed this anime for me was the FILLER EPISODES (trust me, so far the second season is three times as bad). The main plot was REALLY engaging, but in many cases, it barely moved. There was tons of distracting and petty shit that got in the way. FOR EXAMPLE: romantic development was annoying and disappointing. also, the whole food thing. WHY? also, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF LOG HORIZON. at all. idk there were multiple episodes where there was no pressing matter or nothing was really at stake.  But really, the only reason LH let me down so much, is because it got my expectations way up. For good reasons too.  While LH is often not as visually enticing as other anime in the video game genre, it instead focuses on developing the society and world. LH is an anime of opposing factions, politics, power struggles, and social ethics. Almost all of the plot is derived from how the game world is changing since it became reality. As a result, the character development is rather good, while still maintaining at least an illusion of subtlety.  Because of this focus, LH takes a step back from action. However, part of me (the gamer part) would have liked to see them actually go out and explore the new DLC and get more powerful. While character development is important, the whole point of the setting being in a video game is so the characters can develop as players. I would have liked to see them gain new items or more abilities or progress their builds in some way. But that's just me. I WANT MORE MONSTERS AND I WANT MORE SHINY SWORDS.  One of the things LH did right was the main character: Shiroe. He is not the bland, all-powerful, game breaker such as Kirito from SAO. But he is also not the sniveling, pathetic, unwatchable Haru of Accel World. He plays as a supportive battle strategist who has a place in the world like anyone else. It is his own intuition and discoveries that make him special. This allows the anime to revolve around cunning and plot. As a result, the power struggles can be on a larger, more sophisticated scale.  I'd say it was a fun watch. Yes, disappointing in some ways, but refreshing in others.;Recommended
16;Log Horizon;TheGadaffiDuck;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheGadaffiDuck;10;"I myself am an Anime Fan and Video Gamer, and I find it really astonishing that Anime is being created in the video game setting, most popular of which being MMOs. Some are good, some are bad, some are really ugly. But one thing that completely stands out in all of them, is that the Video Game aspect is often distracted or dragged out of sight by.... plots (or at least trying to have one) and failing to completely immersing the viewer into the video game aspect as a good video game, like The Elder Scrolls, or the original Bioshock would otherwise excel in. Enter Log Horizon! A show that completely immerses you into the video game while telling a good story, with a wide cast of amazing characters to boot! This show is in fact so brilliant that it has invented it's own genre called ""Not Fucking Sword Art Online"" (seriously stop comparing this to Sword Art Online.)  Story 9/10 Log Horizon is straight to the point, unlike SAO. The characters, along with countless other players in Log Horizon, are right off the bat mysteriously transported into the video game, Elder's Tale, as part of the new expansion for the game, with no way out in sight. Rather than being such in a virtual reality, the video game and reality have become synonymous. The players of Elder's Tale quite literally become their avatars, and anything that they can do in real life, they can do in the video game, and vise/versa. Any skills that the in game avatars developed in Elder's Tale, the characters could now do it naturally as if they've done it their entire lives. If their in game avatars could play the guitar, they could! If their characters could walk on water, they could! If their in game character could shoot a laser beam from their face, they could. As time passes in the world of Elder's Tale, the players are stuck with nothing to do, as traversing through the vast landscape that is a 1/4 scale (i might be wrong on this one) of the entire world is damn near impossible, living day to day life costs as much as killing three goblins, the sentiment of PEOPLE DIE IF THEY ARE KILLED is completely absent, and players have pretty much done everything that there was to do in Elder's Tale. Without spoiling way too much, after the first 4 or 5 episode arc, much of the season is spent creating a civilized way of life, maintaining order, and creating a sense of purpose in the MMO. Rather than finding a way out (which no sane video gamer would want to do) the main characters try to make the most of the time they have in the MMO world. I would describe the format of Log Horizon to be much like a Shonnen anime, with multiple arcs that tie with the bigger of the show as a whole. My hope is that because it is a Shonnen anime, i hope that it ends before the show destroys itself over the massive weight of it's already established potential. S1 already done, and S2's nearly over and no real end for Log Horizon is in site.  Characters 10/10  Undoubtedly the best aspect of Log Horizon are it's massive cast of characters. Many shows have a huge cast of characters, but what Log Horizon get's right is giving each of the characters enough screen time to not only feel relevant, but also have importance. The show does a good job of getting into the characters personalities and personal struggles, and follows how they adapt into the new world that they are living in. Specifically the most important character of the bunch is Shiroe. In any other anime, he would solve his problems by completely owning everybody with super duper Deus Machina Spells and blasting everyone into oblivion. In Log Horizon, much of the problem solving is through plotting, scheming, and strategising. Learning the opponents every move, reading his thoughts, and predicting the next attack, consistantly thinking ten seconds ahead of his opponents whether it be in the battlefield, or in political crusades. He works to build harmony between the Adventurers and the NPC characters, but by doing so in the shadows he get's the title of Villian In Glasses. He has many anti-heroic characteristics, but doing so gives him strong presence in the show's despite not having strong on-screen presence most of the time. While he is seemingly not involved through most of the show, he stays consistent throughout and helps develop the rest of the show's cast.  The Melancholy Of Watching Anime. Everything Wrong With..... Log Horizon  As much as i absolutely love this show and have been gushing over it since i started watching it, the problem is that it is not for everybody. Much like Ghost In The Shell, by needing an understanding of Science, Philosiphy, Politics, and the intelligence greater than that of a chipmunk, this show requires some of that and an acute understanding of Video Games and Video Game Mechanics, predominately MMORPGs. This is also a very much a talk/speech type anime like death note, and most of the run time is spent following people sitting in a circle, plotting and scheming. I can't help thinking that jaded anime fans would get incredibly bored of this type of plot progression and drop it very quickly. Speaking of Plot Progression.... Every single episode of Log Horizon is incredibly dense, and spends equal amounts of it's time in the aspect of developing characters, the world of elder's tale, strategising, and moving the plot forward. Because Log Horizon is focusing on so many things at once, Plot Progression does suffer, with four episodes of Log Horizon amounting to one of other anime as far as plot progression goes. This anime also has a humor element but that is a problem in itself. So much time is spent writing everything else, not much of it was spent writing the a variety of jokes for it. I do find myself laughing every single time to these (because I'm a child) but every single ounce of humor in this show involves Hennrietta playing dress-up with Akatsuki, and Naotsugu getting his ass kicked by Akatsuki before he says something totally perverted.... and not much else. Some people might now find a problem with any of these, which i for one don't, but they are worth mentioning. What it really boils down to is personal preference.  With any good show, i always suggest to anyone to go into a tv show as blind as possible, and with a set ground rule of expectations from said show, and watch a few episodes before deciding to spend more time with the one life you have on this earth on the show. I suggest you do the same with Log Horizon.... Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and my eyes see Log Horizon as bloody brilliant!  TENOUTATEN";Recommended
17;Log Horizon;Mochipan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mochipan;9;Having just watched half of SAO s1 and thrown it down in raging disgust, I came across Log Horizon and ignored it at first due to its extremely similar synopsis. I finally came back and watched it after seeing some decent reviews. Now that I've seen it, I would like to proclaim Log Horizon to be the salvation of the gaming anime genre!  Art and sound are decent and consistent but the characters and setting of Log Horizon are what makes this series truly amazing.  This series has a diverse cast of utterly lovable characters. Even the supporting characters or the mains who occasionally get sidelined are still fun to watch due to their interactions with each other. The huge cast should be no surprise as this is a Massive Multiplayer Online game. Unlike SAO, LH fleshes out many of its characters, bringing them to life and shows the community among the players within the game world. This is how a fun MMO should be, and LH portrays it perfectly.  The setting is also rather intriguing. Rather than just being a prison that players have to escape from, the game world becomes their reality according to the MC, Shiroe. The game is a living breathing world that can be shaped by whatever actions the players take, and a lot of the story develops as a result of the players discovering new possibilities and events that happen over the course of the series. Due to its heavy emphasis on world building with economies and governments being established within the game world, this series tends to be dialog heavy and may not be a favorite among action fans. The action is certainly there but not in nearly every episode.  One gripe I had with the series was how no one seemed to care about being stuck in the game. Maybe literally everyone in LH are gaming nerds with no friends irl and are perfectly fine being stuck in a game with their online friends, but I doubt it. There is also no explanation as to how everyone became trapped. Some kind of unexplainable spontaneous magical anomaly? Oh well, not going to debate anime logic.  Despite its lack of explanations, LH's well-paced story and immersive world makes it a must watch. Watch now and see the truth, thy heathens !;Recommended
18;Log Horizon;teruu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/teruu;9;"The anime bases on three principle characters, Shiroe, Naotsugu, and Akatsuki, who are among in the ballpark of 30,000 players in Japan – and a few hundred thousand around the world – caught in the realm of 'Elder Tale', a long-running MMORPG that, for some unexplained reason, has caught everybody inside it. Right now, I must say that I love the setting for this arrangement. The move all makes put on the genuine islands of Japan and in genuine spots like Akihabara and Susukino, yet in ""Elder Tale,"" they are situated in a sort of post-whole-world destroying, sword-and-divination environment.  The arrangement opens with our principle hero, Shiroe. A level-90 conjurer and a somewhat of a maverick, Shiroe stirs midst the diversion world, and after figuring out where he is, starts searching for his companions to see what happened. In brisk request, he discovers his companion, Naotsugu, a patrol who he's quested with some time recently, and Akatsuki, a professional killer/ninja who he's likewise gotten to know. Together, they start to discover some way or another around in this abnormal new reality, arranging with organizations, battling beasts, safeguarding different players, rebuffing miscreants, and attempting to make sense of what they're caught doing here in any case.  There's a positive vein of outdated courageous dream that goes through Log Horizon. It may turn off viewers more acclimated to seeing the imperfect screw-ups that populate a number of today's stories, however I happen to think its reviving. These heroes are exceedingly experienced players who comprehend what they're doing and you see it in every scene. Shiroe's information of the diversion alone is exhaustive. Anyhow don't believe that these characters are level cardboard cut outs, either. Shiroe is torn between his common propensity to bashfulness and his stature as a legend and pioneer in the ""Senior Tale"" world; Naotsugu, who goes around gloating transparently about being a deviant – and getting beat on by Akatsuki when he drives her insane – is by and by honorable, steadfast and kind-hearted, and committed to his companions. Akatsuki, who fights with her own particular questions about meeting expectations in a gathering, is additionally captivated of Shiroe, despite the fact that she would like to reveal to it excessively.  Log Horizon is one of those anime to you will either love or contempt at the outset. I happen to be in the previous party. One of the parts of this demonstrate that I love is the way that the arrangement staff offset key insights about how the universe of 'Elder Tale' functions while not diminishing either the activity or the story line. That is an intense ability to ace in any order, and essayist Syouji Masuda and executive Shinji Ishihara make an incredible showing with it.  It may not be to everybody's taste, particularly the individuals who are searching for components like the wonderful mournfulness that reverberates from an arrangement like Sword Art Online, however Log Horizon is justified regardless of an attempt, particularly in the event that you like a dated sword and magic story where the great gentlemen dependably win. In this way, here's to the great  Art : 7/10 The art is a medium kind of thing for me considering most anime have the same likeness so I figure that'd be a 7/10 for most, including this. I don't take much respect to this subject either, hm eh.  Sound: 7/10  Sound, I'd say...it has those exceedingly pitched Japanese shouts but in the event that that doesn't generally mend you off then you ought to be fine with it.  Overall: 8/10 I've depicted the characters and the plot..and on the off chance that you feel this is the kind of anime you'd like to watch, then proceed to watch it. I am certain you'll enjoy it as much as I did! :D";Recommended
19;Log Horizon;Deoran_Old_Acc;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deoran_Old_Acc;9;"Log Horizon is finally finished, and I like like many people can't wait for the second season to air. It was possible the most enjoyably show this season, but it isn't everyone ""cup of tea"". Unfortunately, the way it sets it sets up is open to much discussion. The thing is , you cannot compare this to SAO or Accel World in terms of action, as it is not a main key element. What you can compare is the way it is executed and the way it represents people being trapped in an MMO. For example, SAO was not a bad show. It had a great premise, wonderful music, beautiful art, but really lacked in it's execution. It started of as a bomb shell, but ended on a rather mediocre ending.  SAO was more focused on action and romance, being it's main genre's (Action and Romance), and was not afraid to break the reality barrier quite a few times. This lead to hordes of people praising or criticizing it, with several people left in-between, in a limbo of sorts. Log Horizon on the other hand, takes an opposite route. Yes there is action, but it focuses a lot more on character interactions, social aspects and political themes, building a society. This may at certain cases, lead several episodes to seem slow, but that's all part of the series, and in my opinion, pacing was done really well.  This unfortunately leads to people either liking it for it's new take on MMO (a much better one in my opinion) or disliking it due to lack of action, and for some people who view it as a very slow placed show. But his is about why I enjoyed it, not what others think.  Story - 8  The story for Log Horizon starts off slow, and for several episodes it may be hard to discern what exactly the plot is. The thing is, it's varied. It's not all ""hack and slash"". It is a well thought out plot and focuses on the aspects of society. Here is where it really shines. It follows logic. If you are trapped in an MMO, panic would ensure. How do you stop that panic? How do you keep the people sane, how do prevent chaos.  This ultimately lead sit to cause the viewer to focus more on the events happening. It makes you think: ""What really would happened if such an event took place?"". It causing you to think, and actually imagine yourself in such a situation. If your in it for a ""slash-a-thon"", you'll be disappointed. Their is action from time to time to keep you interested, but it is ultimately not it's focus.  On other thing I must praise the story for is it's ending. It doesn't leave you on a cliff-hanger. Yes, it dose keep you yearning for the second season to start soon, but it dose not end in a climatic situation, say in the middle of a fight.  Art and Sound - (8, 8)  The soundtracks were pretty decent, nothing amazing though. As for the art, it isn't spectacular, but it isn't lackluster either. One thing I like though is that more or less, it kept the same level of detail and fluid animation throughout the entire series. Although it is an NHK show, and from what I understand, they usually don't have too much of a large budget.  Characters - (10)  Here is where it shines the most. The wide variety of charterer is not only diverse, but highly likable. Shiroe, the main protagonist, isn't some OP kid, he is a strategist, and prefers to take the back seat, and command from the shadows. He's even nickname the ""Villain in the Glasses"". If you wanted a picturesque version of a person following the ""the results justify the means"", the Shiroe is a perfect example.  One thing I must praise the character design for is how they actually look like they are in an MMO. The are not ""photogenic teenagers"" running rampart in a virtual world. They are level-headed, and actually think things though. There no power of friendship, no mysterious power suddenly gained, no OP skill revealed. Every action the characters take to solve problems is logical. It makes sense, it has a basis. It isn't coming out of no-where. They show's directors don't pull rabbits out of hat"". It's not a ""in your face"" kind of life. It all makes sense, something SAO kind of failed at. The creation of a new skill for example, while seeming world changing, if you actually look at the way it works, it makes sense. Manipulation of the world to your advantage has a basis, it makes sense. That is one of the best things about Log Horizon.  Conclusion:  I loved this show. It was an awesome watch, and I would gladly jump through time so I can start watching the second season. I would advise anyone to watch this show. It a great watch, and It'll keep you entertained. Though if your looking for a mostly action based anime, you may or may not like it. None the less, give it a go, and you might just be surprised.";Recommended
0;Log Horizon;GonzoLewd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GonzoLewd;6;A demographic of people love to dabble in the virtual world of Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMO) to achieve escapism from stress and other struggles that plague their nature. Recently, there has been somewhat of a resurgence of interest for anime fans to watch shows that detail the life of gamers who play these sorts of games, with Sword Art Online being at the forefront of it. These shows detail whether the virtual world could become more real to us than what we initially thought of as real from when we were born should be the central theme for these shows to explore and bring a fresh new take on it. It’s just too bad that none of these shows in question ever bothered to in the first place and become generic as a result.  A year later, we have Log Horizon, an MMO-inspired anime with the same scenario as Sword Art Online above, with only a few minor iterations here and there. Before I begin, this won’t be a piece where I start to compare or contrast Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, as many people, unfortunately, seem to be inclined to do so. Whether I think Sword Art Online was good or bad should not be a factor in how I feel about Log Horizon. Judging a show by its own merits without any outside influence of another show should be the number one key in critiquing any work. With that said, does Log Horizon hold out on its own?  One thing to realize about the plot is the tone of the setting and how it feels very lighthearted despite the dire situation that all of the characters are in. As far as the characters know, they have no way of getting out of the game. Many have criticized this aspect as being somewhat unrealistic in how real people would react to something of this magnitude. It might be an understandable critique to offer at first. However, as the show goes on, it feels fitting based on how the characters think about how they live and survive in the virtual environment. For however long they’ve been trapped in the game for years, at least based on their confusing logic, that virtual world becomes their world, and they get used to it by then. It also helps the show’s credit that they don’t ever show us the real world at all and keep it a mystery as to how things will make the situation from the characters’ perspective feel more apparent to the audience.  While this might be one of the more significant points of the show, the story itself, in how it is paced and told, isn’t nail-bitingly intuitive or well thought out. The premise isn’t that complicated, to begin with, as we’ve been shown before, but Log Horizon seems to think that if they throw in multiple subplots into the mix to make it sound complex, it’ll succeed. Unfortunately, those sub-plots I’d mentioned don’t amount to anything special in the long run and aren’t even that memorable because of it. Not only that, but that lack of memorability stems from the fact that all of these political and social constructs that Log Horizon’s world possesses aren’t written clear enough, other than the fact that they’re there to establish some basis for our protagonists to go somewhere. These aspects come into perspective with how many characters there are to follow in Log Horizon, but I’ll get to that later. The problems with world-building might be more apparent after knowing that the original creator, Mamare Touno, was responsible for creating Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, which also had the same problems in its adaptation. These sorts of issues are prevalent in adaptations on this type of scale, but that can’t be an excuse.  Though the massive cast of characters might seem like a huge negative, the way I put it, that shouldn’t mean that all of them are mediocre. The main cast of prominent characters throughout the show is exceptionally likable and hilarious to watch due to their numerous escapades with each other. It helps tremendously how they all have unique characteristics that improve the nature of every one of them, rather than making them all generic and uninteresting. The same thing can’t be said for the side characters. With our main cast being Shiroe, Nyanta-nyan, Akatsuki, and Naotsugu, there’s this decent sense of chemistry between these four characters that are ultimately lacking for our side/supporting cast. Their archetypes mainly consist of a trait that tries to make them distinct, such as Henrietta having an obsession with cute things like Akatsuki, and Serara, who has a habit of wanting to clean things to calm down. At first, it’s humorous, but after a while, it becomes redundant, and it doesn’t make them any more meaningful.  In an action anime centered around the MMO systems, it would make sense to make the anime feel like you’re really in an MMO game from the gritty details of cool-downs, being a tank, healing your party members equally, and conjuring status effects at the right time. I, myself, am one of these people who enjoy these types of games, and, to me, Log Horizon is probably the only one that gets it right. Usually, something like this would steer off into brainless shounen show cliches, and there are a few here and there. Amazingly, Log Horizon gets the idea of taking its time for the characters to strategize their movements and actions rather than just blindly fighting off monsters without any thought in the world. That might make it seem too slow or methodical to enjoy watching, but in reality, they do an excellent job of pacing these fight scenes and keeping the action flowing seamlessly to give us a clear picture of what’s going on.  The art style can be construed as good, just not excellent in quality. The character designs themselves are plain and ordinary enough for me to consider them a triumphant success in artistic merit. Still, we expect that, and for what it’s worth, it handles it decently to where they don’t seem to cut any visible corners in the later episodes. As I’ve mentioned about the action being fast and flawlessly executed, the animation is a big part of why those are the case. The fluid character movements feel nice and kinetic to the cast spells and look pretty good as a result.  Voice talents range from relatively unknown voice actors to the familiar ones we’ve grown fans of, giving their artistic liberties to full effect with Log Horizon. Emiri Kato as Akatsuki is devilishly cute, and her being a fellow MMO fan sort of gives her performance an exciting spin. Even though Henrietta wasn’t that special as a character, Ayahi Takabaki manages to pull off the mature woman voice well and gives her voice some new territory for her to explore for her vocal talents rather than a more boyish female character. Takuma Terashima proves himself worthy of being the main protagonist of a show, and I hope to see him do more shortly. Not to mention, I could listen to Jouji Nakata say anything with the word “nyaa” at the end of his sentences and never get tired of it.  For some of us fans of the MMO genre, Log Horizon should be the one show to be doing it right, and while it handles the actual MMO aspects brilliantly, the real narrative and storytelling sets itself down from being great. I appreciate the amount of depth it tries to convey that wants us to feel attached to the world, yet I can’t help but wonder if that could’ve been done to better effect had it made the narrative more tightly constructive and less cluttered. The saying, “Too many cooks spoil the broth,” sums up Log Horizon perfectly. Only when the eventual sequel comes out will we know if the journey will be worthwhile enough to experience its next climax.  Grade: B-;Mixed Feelings
1;Log Horizon;Asfaria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asfaria;5;"Log Horizon is the newest ""stuck in a video game world"" anime. Many people claimed before it began that it would be just like the extremely popular and hyped up ""Sword Art Online."" However, the first episode is enough to dispel any kind of belief that these two shows have anything in common. Take away the video-game-style fantasy setting, and comparing these two shows is like comparing an action/romance anime to a slice of life anime.  Log Horizon follows more of the slice of life route taking a laid-back and slower pace than many other fantasy anime where people are fighting for survival. In the beginning, the players of a video game called ""Elder Tale"" are transported into the game world when a new expansion is released. While surprised and worried at first, they cope with this major problem and decide to adjust to their world rather than try to find the exit immediately. Since people do not actually die when they are killed, there's really not much to worry about. The only main problem is that food and water have no taste, that fighting in the actual world is vastly different from fighting from behind a computer screen, and that some guilds are now taking advantage of new players caught up in the confusion.  Our main protagonist, Shiroe, is a genius strategist and is at the highest possible level in Elder Tale (as are many elite players). Along with the perverted tank (a person in an RPG who takes hits and protects his allies) Naotsugu and the female assassin Akatsuki, they begin to unravel the mysteries of this world and discover what has changed now in Elder Tale. From saving friends to making hamburgers to protecting entire villages from being pillaged, they are experiencing a whole new world than the one they became so accustomed to playing.  But, in my opinion, it's just kind of boring. The story's slow pacing drags on parts I wish had not lasted so long, the characters hardly develop at all aside from a group of novice players, and the show ends announcing a season 2 after an anticlimactic finale.  Before I say any more negatives, I should highlight on one aspect this show does well: the NPCs (non-playable characters). This refers to the people known as ""People of the Land"" in the Elder Tales game. The anime does an excellent job of showing the differences between the ""adventurers"" (people transported into the game world) and the NPCs and how the NPCs are really an entirely different species than the adventurers. This becomes a major plot point in the second half of the series, which was very nice even though that part did drag a little. It's just something I've never seen done before, nor have I ever really considered before (aside from wondering why people in Pokemon and other games never do anything but say one line and stand still their entire lives occasionally giving you random stuff).  The character cast is very large, but hardly anyone gets much screen time. Shiroe is about the only character you can expect to see in even two-thirds of the total episodes doing anything remotely important to the plot. Naotsugu is just kind of there doing nothing, Akatsuki occasionally has some cute moments and does a little spying, and Nyanta's just that guy who ends every sentence the same annoying way. I actually found myself enjoying watching the group of novice players learning to fight together better than I enjoyed watching the main characters and other experienced supporting characters. Aside from Shiroe's planning, the main cast offers hardly anything of interest.  The animation is noticeably cheap. Some scenes look great while others are just a mess. The character designs are especially poorly animated most of the time as the animators seemed to prefer to save their budget for the scenes that emphasize the beauty of the fantasy game world instead. Even without the poor animation, I did not care much for the character designs. The facial designs were too sharp with shadows sharply defining the boundaries between different parts of the face. Some of the outfits were interesting, like Akatsuki's and Shiroe's, but most seemed very boring considering the wide variety that should be offered in an MMORPG.  The sound is one of the better aspects of the show. It may not be done by Yuki Kajiura like in SAO, but it still fits the fantasy world very well and especially fits the moments when Shiroe is scheming. It mostly consists of different string instruments and a few rock tracks during the action scenes (though there's not too many of those).  I did not enjoy Log Horizon as much as I was expecting. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I still stand by it. It's just an average show in almost every way (except the way it portrays NPCs) and is fairly forgettable. Not as much happens over the course of 25 episodes as you might think would happen and the characters really needed some better development (and no, forcing a small amount of romance with 3 episodes to go is not development).";Mixed Feelings
2;Log Horizon;WildNeptune;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WildNeptune;6;Log Horizon is an adventure anime where our cast is among the people who have been trapped in an online game representation of Japan.  The story is somewhat multi-faceted. It starts with the characters simply trying to figure out the working of their new world into trying to manage it. There are other small arcs that interconnect these things together. At the start of the anime I was very impressed with how it really seemed like they were in a fully functional MMO with rules and teamwork. Almost everything in the anime somehow focuses on different aspects of what you would know from an MMO and have interesting takes on how the changes would affect them.  I was also impressed with how well they built the world. It has all the elements of an MMO and yet they don't neglect the fact that changes are being made within the world and take into account how these changes might affect the rules and characters within the game.  The cast is reasonably large but it's really only fair to focus on a few characters, the main Shiro, is a decent male lead who essentially is the gateway for things to happen in the anime. While a lot of the cast is likeable an issue is that a lot of the main characters get almost no development, and this includes Shiro.  This is not to say there is no character developmet, it's there... but the side characters get it. Now, again, just about all of their growth is facilitated by Shiro, but I do find it odd that the main cast simply follows their archetype like Shiro is devious and Akatsuki is one of those shy type girls fully devoted to Shiro. While the side characters start to change their stripes and question more than their situation, they question themselves and their character.  There is a problem with Log Horizon beyond the weird development imbalance. Honestly, that's not even a huge issue. It's that it seems to dress up what should be a trivial problems and make them much larger than they actually are. The pacing of the show is also somewhat odd since they will often place little fun episodes in for no reason at all, not even fan-service, it's like they are just there. It's not even a filler episode since a lot of them somehow link to the next one, it just has a very different tone.  Another problem is that there is a very distinct lack of action as the show begins to take the turn more into the affects of the change in the world versus the world being an MMO itself. Because of this there is a lot of dialogue without much payoff for conversations since everything is building to something else, and a lot of these are not yet realized.  The animation is somewhat middling. Not bad mind you, but just not impressive. The OP is great and while the music does take some time to have its full affect in the show, it steps things up along the way. The sound in the anime is impressive.  Log Horizon has some amazing world building and an enjoyable cast of characters but fails to capitalize on them beyond a surface level.;Mixed Feelings
3;Log Horizon;32k;https://myanimelist.net/profile/32k;5;"Log Horizon suffers from the problem of being mediocre because of poor writing. Poor for a number of reasons: 1.) It has so many possible elements to explore but capitalizes on none of them because it started off so poorly. 2.) Its lazy in that it leaves the reader to assume much while it explains little. Most other issue I have with it fall under these two reasons.   The show is set in the virtual game world of Elder Tale where our cast is trapped in with no known way of escape. And it’s not just them apparently; there are many people from the real world who are all trapped in this game for an unknown reason (they are referred to throughout the series as “The Adventurers” in contrast to the NPC’s who are referred to as “The People of the Land”). You’d think that that would be explored more in the series, guess again. Rather than showing even the slightest care as to how or why they are trapped inside virtual reality, they start wandering around getting more involved in the surroundings and politics of the virtual community more than anything else. This brings me to ask, “Why even bother using the whole ‘trapped in a virtual reality’ setting if you aren’t even going to explore the reasons behind why you’re trapped?” Needless to say, this is a big slap in the face as the show continues ignoring that issue even to the end of the season. At best it comes off as, “Oh, that’s being handled off-screen, don’t worry.” That annoys me because I wonder if it’s just being used as bait to keep people who care about plot on board. I think under a different setting the show would’ve had a better chance at success. Rather than a being trapped in a virtual setting I think it would’ve worked better as a real fantasy setting.  So yeah, the whole ignoring a big problem like that from the get-go really lost points in my book.  Alright, so apart from ignoring an apparent problem without any justification as to why, what else makes this show mediocre? Well, the characters. Because none of the characters throughout the show give a damn about being trapped in a game, it’s hard to take any of them seriously. It makes them shallow and gives little room for uniqueness among them since they all seem to share this common lack of interest in escaping virtual reality, or why they’re even there in the first place. Because they’re shallow, a lot of their interactions between them feel empty and meaningless, nothing more than a convenience to drive (or force) the plot forward. But wait! The plot isn’t being driven forward! Instead the focus is more on dealing with episodic content and small-arcs involving The Adventurer’s relations with the People of the Land and themselves. Which raises another question in the viewer’s mind: “Why care about the NPC’s?” This same question is asked of the MC by a mysterious character that appears at the end of the season. No response is given to it, instead it’s ignored and we’re left with a cliff-hanger episode that raises more questions than answers to bait us in for a second season (as if we needed any more bait considering you haven’t made any significant advancement toward the plot).  Ok, on to the characters. There is no real character development throughout the series, everyone is just put into character molds without any justification as to why they are the way they are, and you just have to accept it. You are given very brief explanations about each character (mostly to do with their status in the virtual world and a little about their real selves) and that is all, sometimes you don’t even get that. Also, their development throughout the show is little to nothing.  Let’s start with the MC; Shiroe. He is referred to in-series as the “villain in glasses”. He is not exactly evil; his peers just don’t know how to categorize his methods. A lot of his actions come off as inconsiderate or rude in the eyes of those that don’t know him well, and they are to a degree, but we’re supposed to be aware that he does these things to protect people he cares for. This point is not actually made clear until near the end of the season where Minori (a young girl whom Shiroe took under his wing to train in the art of strategy) has a chat with Shiroe about why he does certain things the way he does. I’d compare his character to Hikigaya Hachiman, from Oregairu, but lacking the elaborate character-building of Oregairu. He’s meant to play the cast’s logically brilliant asocial introvert and yet he doesn’t seem to care about the fact that he and many other people are trapped in a virtual world. He seems more focused on solving immediate problems like food, government and societal issues which are all game-related and have little consequence. Forget that you actually exist outside this game and that your body could potentially be starving from a lack of nutrients, forget all of that and just focus on game-related stuff that pales in comparison to actual life itself. This just doesn't fit with the characterization he’s meant to portray. At least give me a reason as to why you don’t care so much about your actual self which is outside of this virtual reality!  Akatsuki is pretty much the loyal, unquestioning sidekick to Shiroe. She carries out his orders and is protective of him all because he gave her some potion in the beginning of the show that allowed her to play a character that matched her real-life appearance (since she originally played a male character). There seems to be some chemistry between them but because of the shallowness of the characters it comes off as meaningless. It isn’t until near the end of the season that Akatsuki’s feelings for Shiroe become clearer, however they’re never really addressed by him and we have no insight as to why.  Naotsugu is one of Shiroe’s friends from the real world. He’s more of a comic relief character with his openness about being a pervert, which leads to some comical moments between him and Akatsuki. There seems to be some chemistry going on with him and another side character, but again, it’s all very superficial.  Nyanta is pretty much the gentle badass of the show. Gentle in that he’s a gentleman and badass in that he dispatches his foes with relative grace and ease. We know even less about him than we do about the others in the main cast.  There is plenty more cast to go on about but a lot of them are pretty much filler with even less (or shallower) characterization than the main cast.   In summation, the ideas that Log Horizon explored were great ideas but they were severely overshadowed by a major plot hole that also serves as the story’s starting point. This show could’ve worked as episodic content with light plot under a different setting. It seems the writer cares little about world-building and character-building, and cares more about appearing serious by dealing with little dilemmas that arise throughout the series. The ending of the first season pretty much left off where it started from with intrigue about escaping Elder Tales. However, it seemed more focused on a vague new problem that arises within the virtual world. I can only hope that the second season makes an effort at development instead of continuing episodic suspension of disbelief, although i've heard the 2nd season is no better in this department than the first.  If you’re ok with watching a show that wants to be serious but totally ignores serious questions along the way, then you may be able to stomach this anime.  Regardless, I wouldn’t recommend it.";Mixed Feelings
4;Log Horizon;phsleague;https://myanimelist.net/profile/phsleague;6;Alright, a lot of you compare this anime to Sword Art Online (SAO), which was an A+ anime. The only similarity between SAO and Log Horizon is that they have a similar story which is people in the real world end up in the video game world of RPG. That's it!  This anime lacks everything that made SAO amazing, which was the drama, fighting, and great story.  What this anime does have is a lot of talking. I mean so much talking. I think the anime should be called Log Horizon the Social Network. Yes, you heard it. There's many of you here that rated this anime a 9, and I know and you know for yourself that this anime has more socializing than fighting or anything really.  So why did I continue to watch this anime? Well, because every episode of talking, I told myself maybe the next episode will be better, and you will continually do this.  Bottom line, this anime isn't bad or great, it is just ok. The last episode showed a preview of what's to come, so maybe season 2 will be the anime that we were all waiting for.  Don't believe the 9 ratings or 8 or 7, this anime is a perfect 6, trust me. I'm the truth, I tell you with an honest non bias opinion.  Should you watch this anime? Well yeah you should if you have nothing else to watch. If season 2 does get better then I definitely recommend watching this season so at least you know the whole story.  Log Horizon the Social Network gets a pefect 6!  Peace, and send me a like! (the like part is what I hear all these online people say all the time, so I figured I'd say that for fun!);Mixed Feelings
5;Log Horizon;Saumon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saumon;6;This is the most mindlessly hyped anime since, ironically, SAO.  I base my overall score mostly on enjoyment, I don't add/remove points for the quality of the work itself unless it's exceptional in a good or bad way.  I won't do an in depth analysis of the anime, I'll just say how I felt about it, and why it didn't work for me.  I felt like I was watching some very basic slice of life anime in a rarely seen setting in this genre, I don't have anything against slice of life if it's well done, but LH is a total mess, tried too hard in so many aspects and ended up not being good at anything.  The characters are so basic, I had to go double check if I wasn't watching a early 2000' show.  The comedy is mediocre, only lame moeblob related and overused jokes.  The story is midly interesting, enough to keep you watching, but nothing new.  The best thing about this anime was the ending song, and I'm not sure if it's because the song is good or because I couldn't wait for it to end...;Mixed Feelings
6;Log Horizon;wasif_khan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/wasif_khan;6;The story is ok but there is a problem in plot. I did not sense anything on which plot is built. You know what am I trying to say. [spoiler] I think the plot must be built on how they ended up in virtual reality game and what are they trying to do. [/spoiler] It would be better if they had a great plot. Setting for plot is ok but there is plot missing there. Art is as good as any other game genre anime can have. Character development is pretty decent.  In the end I really did get disappointed by watching it. It is just so so game genre anime. I thought it would be more good.;Mixed Feelings
7;Log Horizon;lolistar92;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lolistar92;5;I'm actually kinda surprised at how high this show has been rated. But to be fair, everyone has their own taste in anime.  This was not mine. I was actually pretty hyped up to watch it after reading the reviews. But I'm looking back and wondering how I finished these 25 episodes.  My biggest issue with this anime was it has this 'spark' that promised to bloom into something more. But until the end I was waiting and waiting for it to go off.  Characters:  Shiroe is the loner genius that relearns the bonds of friendship. He is not a fighter but a strategist. Thing is I really didn't see Shiroe as any kind of genius but rather a good politician and businessman. It is more of a 'oh he thought of it first' kinda of genuis. That or when he does solve the problem, it is with such vague logic you wonder how it even came through. When you take that out of the equation all Shiroe really has as an advantage is that he is a senior player and has the items and experience necessary to navigate through certain situations. That said, he isn't a bad main character because I like how he isn't the hero filled with purpose and drive but more of a character that rides his own flow and intersects with the main river to keep it from dying out. It made it interesting to see how he would deal with every situation.  Romance/Female Characters   The romance irritated me to no end. The main love interests look like 12 year old girls. One actually is a 12 year old girl. The rest were represented by huge breasts and outlandish personalities that removed them from the possibility of being love interest. They were hilarious and endearing in their own way but they were more for comedic effect than anything.  I really really really liked Akatsuki and wouldn't even mind her love for Shiroe if it didn't completely limit her. We see her fight once or twice in the first 5 episodes and despite being one of the strongest characters she is not seen fighting again. Ever.  Action/Fighting:  The fighting was non-existent, funnily enough for a video game. The issue is that every 4 or 5 episodes there would be a situation where a fight is happening but the fight itself was just lackluster.  It started off good - the first 10 episodes were at least decent. But slowly it just stopped. They scene barely last 5 mins, the same spells are used, and in the case of the 'major event' later on we don't even actually see combat despite the situation. We get a full frontal shot of the character getting ready but no actually movement. Only colorful lights being thrown everywhere. It was disappointing to watch because the animation was there and the potential to have at least one good battle is part of the fact I kept watching. Sadly, that never happened.  So what's left? :  Majority of the story is set in world building - politics, government, security, and public calm. We see small things like teaching, festivals, fast food and other nuances of our world being put back into the video world. The more they try to do that, the less of the 'video game' feeling we are left with towards the end of the season. The last 'battle' perfectly exemplifies this.  The comedy is the only thing I would give this show a 8/9 for. It's what kept me going.  Personally, I am not going to watch season 2. Would I recommend this anime, not really. However, if you know what you like, maybe you might find something to connect you to Log Horizon. I couldn't find much.;Mixed Feelings
8;Log Horizon;Flexicute;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Flexicute;6;Log Horizon falls behind its peers when it comes to consistent action and flair. That aside, the series is a triumphant example of how to create a fully realized MMO setting.  Character development is unquestioningly the strongest aspect of the show. You'll see not just the main character, but all the secondary and even tertiary characters being fully fleshed out. Every character is unique and memorable, and they all feel like they have an impact in the world, instead of just being fluff for the story.  The story of being stuck in a virtual world and trying to get out is obviously not new, but Log Horizon's approach to this genre is a big breath of fresh air. Without saying too much, death in this game isn't permanent, but it's not without its consequences. The economic and social aspects of MMO, including its NPCs, also have some much needed light shed on them as they play a very big role in the show's plot. Many of these situations revolve around Shiroe,with his cunning diplomacy being the most surprisingly thrilling moments in the Log Horizon.  The pacing is a bit slow at first, and there's some humor that seems a little forced (ie Akatsuki's abuse of Naotsugu), but once it picks up speed, Log Horizon really displays its MMO gaming roots. Seeing Shiroe staying a step ahead and pulling aces out of his sleeve is far more fun than seeing an overpowered shonen pulling deus ex machina moments to get out of a situation (you know who I'm talking about).  This is a pretty easy win for anime fans that are also big into MMORPGs. For everyone else, Log Horizon may be too slow and have too much exposition to be invested in. It's personally an 8 out of 10 for me, but I'd be cautious and recommend it as a 5 to 6 out of 10 to everyone else.;Mixed Feelings
9;Log Horizon;thesuperneet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thesuperneet;6;"Log Horizon was many things. It took a premise, previously used horribly, and made it slightly better. Only slightly though. This show could've really made it less boring.  Story 6: It felt like they were trying to teach me how to play an MMORPG and I really don't care about every detail of skills and classes and what not. I mean I would've been fine with a little bit of an explanation, but hey lets spend half an episode expaining this thing in explicate detail because why the hell not? It's like finishing the tutorial of a game and then they're like ""haha jk here's the rest of the tutorial bitch"".  Art 5: The art at least fit in with the show. Actually it got kinda lazy at some moments, but not too noticable. It was okay, but nothing too special.  Sound 7: The music was very... mediocre. In fact the only reason it's a 7 is because of how ridiculous the opening was. They could of at least changed the opening and ending after the halfway mark. Or at least the ending cuz, if I heard ""zutto"" one more time. I was gonna commit mass murder I'd be called the Zutto murderer. Because that was the last thing you will hear ever hear before your life ends in a horrific and inhuman way, while your only functioning body part, your ears, will hear ""zuu-ooooootoooooo"".  Character 7: Most of the characters were pretty annoying. The princess, whose name I won't bother spelling, was the only character I kinda liked. Other than that though no one else. The romance between the characters was not over played or, it just wasn't that annoying.  Enjoyment 5: Like I said earlier, just boring. I'm actually pretty fond of boring things so I think it wasn't boring, just uninteresting.  Overall it's a 6 ,cuz it just wasn't my cup of tea. Although if you like bitter and kinda stupid tea then this show is for you. It did have some good points like how it ended. Writing this review actually made me hate the show more. I don't think I'll be watching season 2, unless I feel like dying then I'll proceed to it.";Mixed Feelings
10;Log Horizon;Fragglepuss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fragglepuss;6;WARNING, MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS!  Log Horizon  Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans  Be warned, Log Horizon is not Sword Art Online. If you go into this anime expecting it to be the same as SAO, you will most likely be disappointed. If you start watching Log Horizon with an open mind and an open heart, you will have a much better chance at enjoying it. Also, there is subtle humor throughout Log Horizon, which is well-placed.  You might enjoy this if: You are on the prowl for a lot of strategic, political action. Also, if you are looking for a gentleman cat-person, you found your anime!  You might not like it if: You are on the hunt for the battle-scene action.  Note to the Viewer: This is not Sword Art Online.  EXPANDED REVIEW:  Our anime group, Salt Lake City (SLC) Anime, reviewed Log Horizon this month and here is what the group thought:  There were several Pros and Cons about Log Horizon, and these all differed depending on the person. Log Horizon is not like Sword Art Online, in that there is not a lot of action. There is a lot of strategic, political planning. This is not bad at first, but carried on through the whole series. I mean, it’s an MMORPG, there should be battles at some point.  There is a lot of interaction with NPCs, or People of the Land as they are referred to. This also means that there is more of a political system in the world.  Besides the first episode, there is hardly a mention of leaving the virtual world until the last episode. It makes it seem as if nobody cares that they are stuck in a video game. It is a 25 episode season, and you never see what their life is outside the virtual world, and it hardly even gets mentioned that this is not their real life.  There are a lot of characters with a lot of stories, and many of the character’s stories get left in the dust because there is too much going in. This ties into the romantic interests of the characters. While there is not a lot of romance in the anime, what little love interest exists is inconsistent throughout the season.  Log Horizon does a great job at explaining basic MMORPG terminology and blending that into episodes. People not familiar with the MMORPG world will be able to understand the virtual world well.  It takes a while for many of the characters to grow on you. A lot of them have a stereotypical introduction, but then develop as the season progresses. Others seem to get ignored, and you only see them every couple episodes even though they were a prominent character at the beginning of the season.  Overall, SLC Anime enjoyed Log Horizon, giving it a favorable review. Just remember, once again, not to compare it to Sword Art Online.;Mixed Feelings
11;Log Horizon;That_JuanKaiser;https://myanimelist.net/profile/That_JuanKaiser;6;What this series brings to the table is a look into the lives of individuals who are trapped in a video game, more specifically an MMO rpg. This is actually nothing new in the realm of anime, but that matters not so as long as its execution is well done. Unfortunately this is were it falls short, since it's entire set up lends itself to underwhelming drama, being that characters don't die when they are killed. (yes that was intentional) With this revelation, much of what was a stake feels lost, although they could have gone in a direction that expands upon other consequences of existing in this world being that it is not the one they once knew, which they do address to some extent, but they are all underplayed to the point where it seems they don't even really pose a great treat or concern beyond moving the plot forward.  Speaking of the plot, The everyday life of people in a video game is what the series should be called, since not much exploration into the nature of being an alternate persona (Which .hack//sign addresses), political intrigue or the relationship between the supposed people of the land and the adventures is really present beyond the superficial and in some ways childish. Everything lends itself to be treated like another quest to go out and complete, which ironically works against the show in trying to build a coherent narrative.  The show also tries to act smart many times almost as if it's trying to prove that it's not a typical shounen, however everything is explained exactly when it happens for the first time in the series, which means the classic case of someone standing still and explaining what he just did in the middle of a heated battle.  What this show I do admit does well is the atmosphere and feeling of being in an MMO rpg, which despite never really having played one that in depth, they definitely did their homework. (unlike Sword Art Online) Though the more I watch of the show the more it felt like a gimmick rather than something the show was using to create an engaging narrative, with characters being quite one note due to a lack of potential within the story for any catharsis. The characters are fun enough for the style this show goes for, but are not deep or complicating in any way. They are easily defined by a few quirks and simple mentalities, which is usually there just for the sake of laughs as the anime is very easy going.  Overall, I'd say the anime does try do be more than your typical anime, but it holds itself back with what could have been done with its set up and fails to fully deliver, as it takes itself way to easy being only enjoyable for those who want there anime about MMOs to make sense, which at the very least, it achieves that.;Mixed Feelings
12;Log Horizon;DarkSoul218;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DarkSoul218;5;Everything you've ever dreamed of in a show about being trapped inside an MMO terminates into a despondent conflagration upon devolving into a loli infested harem. An interesting premise with clear world mechanics, descriptive setting, character diversity, societal analysis, governing strategy and politics, classic shonen action, and decent comedy. All to be engulfed in the flame of insatiable love interest. This author blew the doors off of what was thought to be a dead genre, only then to crush our spirits by later revealing it was a Trojan horse filled with flat chested preteens and busty maidens whose sole reason for existence is to seduce and obsess over an unbeknownst protagonist. This act of despicable horror has been one of the biggest let downs in recent anime history, and the author should be ashamed that they lacked the endurance to continue with a legitimate story.  Art is standard. Sound is standard. Enjoyable up until the harem.;Mixed Feelings
13;Log Horizon;Chris_Concept;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chris_Concept;6;Log Horizon  CAN THESE GUYS JUST FIX THEIR GLASSES ALL READY!!!  Story 7: so.. this anime basically people that played a game and got stuck in it.. One day they after the game's latest update, you were unable to log off. They all learn new skills and a new way of living in that game.  Art 6: Nothing really exciting here, there were a couple of fights that had good animation, but other than that it was very basic. Very weak art during the fights, thought it would be better.  Sound 6: Intro is a good song, but throughout the anime there wasn't a track that got my attention and it the battle sounds were weak. Voice were good, I think they were all well placed.  Characters 7: They were pretty good, very funny moments in the anime. Development was on point, since they all had to learn and adjust. Design was well made too, their design on the characters were great.  Enjoyment 7: Wasn't my favorite tbh, there were a couple of episodes that really got my attention, but there were alot of funny moments which imo kept the anime alive.  Overall 6.6: I honestly thought this anime was going to be great, but I guess it was all the side stories that I didn't like, the ending fight was really good.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BSW-O0bhnGT/?taken-by=geek.workshop  Thanks for reading :);Mixed Feelings
14;Log Horizon;Yakkululz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yakkululz;5;"Log horizon happens in a mmorpg-based world where people are trapped and have to live in, and where the mmorpg-concept is brought forward through mechanics, social interactions, and world design. The story focuses on the hero, shiroe, his interaction with the player-controlled city of Akihabara, the impact on the world around it, and on the emotions felt by people around him. It is done in a way that hasn’t been done elsewhere, but is it capable of binding together all its element in an well-paced story? It certainly has a lot of time to do it, with 2 times 25 episodes, and a universe choice complex enough to fill hundreds. In short, welcome to an attempt to have a global view of log horizon.  After an update of a world played mmorpg, many players worldwide have been trapped in the game, and have to learn to survive in this environment that will be their new home. The back bone of the world is a post-apocalyptic earth where nature would invade abandoned cities, combined with a medieval-fantasy world, and the attention is directed solely on japan, with a focus on the city of akihabara (Tokyo). As it is a rpg world, it is of course monsters and PNJ. And since the world is sometimes working as a game, and sometimes working as a real world, strange things happen with them. But while it's interesting to discover, I often had the feeling of being cheated by how things works. It's used more by convenience to make a background and plot twists, rather than following a real logic. It burns the eyes and the ears sometimes.  A big part of the story involves how the mechanics of the world works, how they changed from before, and how they are changed. ""Will they respawn if they die?"" will be one of first question brought forward of course, but many others will follow. Sadly, it will open more questions that aren't, or can't be, answered. Only a faint light will be brought on how the world works, narrowing the sight of the viewer only on the chosen focus. And this kills the immersion. You simply can't dive into the world with the few explanations given to you, and how blurry they are. It would take many books to explore the possibilities their world open, yet they only give you a glance at it, and force you to eat the things they come up with. It is not done well, and the story suffers significantly from it. In a world where your limitation isn't what the game allows you to do, but the laws of physics and magic, you open yourself to limitless possibilities, and can't just limit it to what is convenient to you, especially it's given such importance.  The story, as said before, is centered on 3 aspects: the discovery of the world and its laws, the mmo side of completing and building things, and the emotions of the characters involved and their personal development. This said, all the story is built around the emotions and the people, while the rest is used to bring those moments, in a very pronounced way. While feelings give an interesting dimension to the anime, they are most of the time poorly exploited. In an attempt to make the viewer laugh, you will be fed with uninteresting unraveled love stories. In addition, to give a dramatic side, a huge part of the show will focus on the distress of characters you won't care about, or care enough. There isn't a single interesting character with a (realistic) personality. When you story is emotion driven, it just kills it. At some point, I choose to skip parts that were too annoying. When skip a 5 minutes part of a 20 minutes episode, I believe you can say it is pretty tasteless filling. The dialogues are also pretty bad, being often cheesy and way too long. Globally, this makes for a very slow story, with not much happening.  Social interaction as you might have guessed is big part of log horizon, since it's a mmorpg. Again, a lot of potential brought up here, as you have people with very different social status and background that meet, plus the interaction with a medievalesque culture. So much potential, yet such an appealing result. The anime makes a really good job at bringing those ideas forward, but always use them so poorly. It is quiet sad. Even the men-women relations are shortened to some kind broken love stories and harem bullshit, to the point where I started to call it harem horizon. But wait, there is more, as every story needs it baddies, that are bad because reasons. Every mmo has its PK, who kills because they want to, but can suddenly become good people because they are not needed as bad people anymore. The magic of imaginary personalities who have no depth.  To summarize, I must say log horizon is doing an amazing job at bringing you an interesting world, with interesting concepts, but fails miserably at using them, and that’s pretty sad. All it does is shoving you with some bullshit feelings you don't care. No cookies for you, harem horizon.";Mixed Feelings
15;Log Horizon;NixDominus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NixDominus;5;"i had great expectations for thisa nime after i heard people compare this to code geass, no game no life, death note and the like, but as you can see from the loks of my review, i wasulitmately disappointed. also do note this review is for this season only, i havent watcehd the second season so i have no clue if it gets better.  so lets start off shall we.  Eveyrthing i heard about this anime had to do with it not being the usual battle shounen, and being more of a psychological mind game thriller kinda deal. and i pity everyone who thinks that, becasue you havent seena nythingif you think this holds a candle to code geass or no game no life.  and ive got to say, every aspect of this anime is contrived, except maybe the characters, because they are just plain lame.  PLOT: 6/10  the whole premise of the show is so contrived and unnatural. so these shut in gamers get transported into the game that they used to play, called ""eldertale"", and obviiously all the main characters except our ""spectator character that is meant to react to the main characetrs feats and show us what we're supposed to feel"" , are seasoned veterans who were the best players in the entire game. and the character that is supposed to represent us, as the spectator and one who draws out the hype from the op main characters, is akatsuki. akin to lucy from fairy tail, stephanie from ngnl, and the like.  now, the anime begins with all the players in the game eing tranferred into the game itdxelf. and from the beginning itself, the direction of the story seems very unnatural, and forced. as soon as the players are sent into the game, te first thought they have is not ""how do we get out of here?"" but its ""lets take a look around! wanna try sushi?"" now this shows how much the writer wants to distance the stroy from the real world.  and although it seems pretty deliberate, the world building inside f the game is undeniably exciting. the whole thing about the creation of the game (world) [forst miracle]  and the event of the arrival of the first adventurers (players) into the game, overlapping with the release of the beta version of the game.[second miracle]  and the players getting stuck in the game being the [third miracle]  but almost all of this is squished into literaly TWO EPISODES. if these explanations were spread out a bit, then the lore would definitely strengthen.  i dont know if this is a bad thing, but everything in the game world, is later explained aplainly as ""magic"" not kidding, all the game mechanics, and politics, races, geography, everything is just covered up by saying ""its magic"". classic, its nothing bad, but i feel there was potential to do something more with that then just pass off everything as ""magic"". although it sorta binds the world together, and reduces the gap between npcs and adventurers.  also, theres minor plot holes, and plot convenience history/flashbacks. which sorta undermines the power of the npcs.  also the scenes arent built up or exected properly, so almost nothing has any impact on the viewer. so many moments could have been absolutely amazing. this is the type of anime that must focus on the moments frist, then the themes and overall passive storyteling second. the buildup and climax scenes are badly executed.  the battle mechanics are also badly written, os the fights are utter trash, but the shining points of this anime, is the brain-games, and the political-debate based strategizing.  CHARACTERS: 3/10  man, this is the real problem of this anime, the characters are incredibly lacklustre. none of the characters have any spontaneous interactions, every relation, interactions, conversation seems forced and contrived. no charectr has a personality that stands out, veryone is literally the same. the main cast:  AKATSUKI: little loli girl who is there literally only there for the moe and the reason i stated above in the 'plot' section.  NAOTSUGU: this guy is also a minimum requirement character for any shounen, the pervert. but man, thats all there is to his character, that the only thing we see about his charaecter. the whole comedy is based on him making blatant sexual suggestions, and akatsuki kicking him, then asking for shiroes permission to hit him.' there that is the only gag that hapens in the entirety of the anime, and its overused as hell.  SHIROE: now its time for our beloved main character. man this guy is bland. his whole charcetr is lame, bland, and half-assed. were told that this guy appears as a villain, becase of his incredible strategies and splendid plans. but its also showed that he is actually the opposite, very kind hearted guy and stuff, but when he starts strategizing, it becomes obvious why hes called a villain.' but seriously, he never appears villainous or anything ever, like, if youre gonna give him the classic ""coin-personality"", with his two ""flip-sides"", then better go all the way and make him seem incredibly villainous at some points, and incredibly kind at some point. these are all just suggestions to make his charaectr seem more impactful. his charecter is never solidly established, his character is jsut a vague mush of half-assed emotions, and he has no striking personallity feature, hes just boring. almost all the time, he shows no emotions, or at the very most, his emotional state is jsut a bland mush of half-assed emotions.  I could also telk about the other characters, but i think ive proved my point about the bland and uninteresting characters  also, none of the characters get any sort of character development, except the band of kids that shiroe taught. shroe never faces any mental challenges, or any moral conflict, so he doesnt get any development. same with all of the other characters, again, except the little kids group. we see glimpses of their pasts, so you can say theres more ti them.  but the characters were mostly garbage.  ART & SOUND: 1/10 AGAIN I HATE THE ART, because the art is another reason why all the characters lack impact, the emotions are barely shown on their faces, so they just come off al bland. the colour palette is the definition of bland. excpet for a few artistically well done shots, the majority of the art is trash.  and the VAs, dont even get me started, the voices suck. they lack impact, evrything sounds like some community wellfare debate held by 90 year olds.   OVERALL: 5/10   end note: be sure to check it out, it does have some shining points, so you might enjoy it if youre into the fantasy setiing psychological anime. but beware, if youve watched death note, no game no life, or code geass before this, you will be appalled.";Mixed Feelings
16;Log Horizon;GrayRealm;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GrayRealm;5;"This anime is starts as one of the worst attempts at pandering to mmo crowd I've ever seen, but slowly manages to pull itself together and provide something somewhat original and interesting in the end. In the end it is a mix of good and bad. At the ""bad"" side there are numerous cringe-worthy poorly moments where the game tried to throw MMO slang around or (even worse) explain it. At the ""good"" side... we have numerous story moments where the anime drops obsession with MMO thing, and starts focusing on the story and characters. In the end both sides sorta cancel each other out, and result is somewhere in the middle. I would say it is slightly better than first season of Overlord, all things considered.  Detailed breakdown below:  Story: 5/10: First episodes are horrible. First means somewhere between 4 and 8 of the first episodes. The anime makes a point of throwing around terminology related to online games and at the same time it wastes many many many scenes explaining MMO mechanics. It is cringeworthy and silly. The only reason why I pulled through those beginning episodes is one of the likeable secondary characters, which made the whole thing interesting. However, past certain point it stops trying to explain everything, and tunes down the number of MMO slang thrown around, and concentrates on unique aspects of the world ... it becomes much more interesting. At the same time the anime introduces a very likeable and very well done secondary character that saves the day. That helps as well.  Expect ton of MMO reference and slang fan-service from the story.  Art: 5/10: Honestly, nothing to write home about. The anime uses plenty of adult-proportioned characters, which is good, but it uses that style where linework is often abbreviated, and level of details is somewhat low, which is a bit disappointing. Backgrounds are well done, but I wish characters had more details. Still, there are a lot of large scenes with a lot of people, prerhaps that was the reason for slightly simpler art style. Either way, the visuals didn't make me go wow.  Sound: 5/10: The music its job, pretty much, and there's little to tell about it. Most of the voice actors are okay, however, sider heroines I mentioned stood out as being more convincing.  Character: 6/10: Now, here we have a split and mix of good and bad. Majority of characters in the anime are quite bland. They're either ""carton cutouts"", or highly stereotypical. Which is not a good thing. For example, after completing the season I have very little to say about protagonist's character.  However, there are two side characters that are of significantly higher quality, compared to everybody else. The first one is Akatsuki, and the second one is certain Princess. The princess is absolutely adorable to watch, and pretty much saves the day, in terms of quality. Her performance outshines most of the other characters, and she is both more believable and more interesting.  Enjoyment: 5/10: It was mostly okay. I could barely tolerate first episodes, but later found some fun watching scenes related to akatsuki and the princess. Those redeemed this anime for me.  Bottom Line: 5/10: It is a mix of good and bad. The anime wastes too much time trying to appeal to MMO crowd, and for someone who isn't into the genre this can be annoying. Same applies to situations where MMO mechanics are being explained.  However. in the middle of the season there are more interesting developments in the world, and there are two very well done characters which pretty much save the show in the end.  So.... my advice is: it may be worth checking out, but non-MMO people can find pandering to MMO players in the first episodes to eb both annoying and distracting. The show gets much better in the middle, and have two very amusing/amazing characters, which are pretty much the primary reason for watching it till the end.  So, it is worth checking out - mostly because of those two well done characters I mentioned, and because of unique setting explanation.... - but I wouldn't call it a ""must have"" kind of anime.";Mixed Feelings
17;Log Horizon;TK8878;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TK8878;6;"Review in brief: Season 1 of Log Horizon presents a truly faithful rendition of the ""trapped in an MMO"" setting and provides an interesting story to go with it but suffers from slow progression and predictability. Your enjoyment will hinge on how well you stay immersed in the world of Elder Tale and while this anime does a good job of getting you to enter there's no guarantee that it will hold you in.  Review in full: When it comes to engagement, Log Horizon places heavy focus on just one aspect: immersion. It wants you to enter its world, explore both its realms and game-like mechanics, experience the cultures of the pre-existing NPCs and the newly trapped gamers, and ultimately feel like you're on an adventure in the world of Elder Tale yourself. This is accomplished quite well. Right from the get-go the characters realize that they must use the mechanics of the game (including classes, cool-down abilities, and now-telepathic voice chat) to thrive, but they are all still gamers at heart and also start developing new strategies to handle everything from cooking to spell-casting.  While this is going on there are bigger implications that are explored in a game world made real. What happens when NPCs are no longer just walking dialogue boxes but living, breathing beings? Or when magic is no longer just game code and becomes a real form of energy? Even politics and the economy become major issues as time goes on. Being trapped in a video game isn't just a gimmick or plot device in Log Horizon, it's the very essence of everything it is and does. Together with the well-established setting (which is continuously being fleshed out) it creates the captivating sense that the story is much bigger than just what we see the characters going though. Even when Log Horizon wasn’t enjoyable for me, this sense gave me reason to believe that something more was just an episode away.  As far as production values go, the animation does a great job of displaying both the world and the video game elements without either looking out of place. This is including the CG, as even though it stands out compared to the animation at times it still feels like it belongs in the context of how it’s being used. The familiar yet fantastical designs of the environments and the characters also do a remarkable job of making it all feel like its own world as well as its own game, cultivating strong visual immersion to complement its narrative immersion. Meanwhile the music, sound effects, and voice-work (I watched in Japanese) is good (but not great) all around. It does its job and there isn't anything to complain about but not much of it is memorable either (aside from the oddly catchy OP).  Sadly, beyond that Log Horizon's presentation transforms the story from an intricate exercise in how a world can be built from the mechanics that drive it into a lazy shounen adventure adaptation where the premise is only used as a hook to get you to watch the next episode each week. It's as though the story is being held hostage by the producers, demanding that you watch more than what's necessary to continue. This is largely due to the show’s slow progression. It's not much of an issue early on since there's initially quite a bit that the anime has to and does explain, but after the first third of the season it finds itself with too little to explain to justify the pace and starts spacing itself out instead.  After the world is established each subsequent arc features a barrage of recaps, which not only include the typical beginning-of-the-episode refreshers but also many mid-episode reminders, cues, and hints; so many in fact that by the time each arc comes to a head so many hints have been dropped that you know how the arc ends before it even reaches a climax, destroying the dramatic build-up of tension the intricate story naturally contains. It's like reading a good book next to an acquaintance who is constantly asking if you've reached the next big spoilery event, with no attempt to mask the spoiler itself. These are then interlaced with so much shallow comedy (especially with the pervert jokes and ship-teases that you'd have to be blind to not see coming) and boring filler (such as pointless side plots and clearly one-sided battles) that it all takes up more time than the serious moments that progress the plot. Everything that actually matters could have been covered in 13 episodes with room to spare, but Log Horizon doesn't trust its viewers to understand or remember anything that takes more than two sentences to explain.  In addition, while Log Horizon's characters are utilized well by the story, the characters themselves are mostly nothing special. The majority of them fill a role, perform that role, and nothing more, while most of the rest don’t even manage that. Development and backstories beyond a few bullet-points (predictable clichés included) are for but a select few characters. You'll likely find two or three of them to be particularly interesting, but many of them are easily forgettable. There is even a plot development tied to the game's XP system that offers a great opportunity to take a closer look at the characters in that moment before things change for them, but nothing substantial was done with it and it passed with just a brief mention. It also doesn't help that there's very little that is able to challenge them. The fact that the trapped gamers are overpowered even becomes a plot point, though again it’s merely stated rather than addressed. Regardless it doesn’t help that few characters have any real reason to develop when all they have to do is listen to Shiroe for everything to turn out okay (or if they’re one of the handful of cookie-cutter villains, wait for Shiroe to defeat them because they had no chance to win in the first place).  Verdict: Log Horizon’s first season could have easily been great, in fact it definitely was for the first third, but its faults severely damage the majority of the show. Even then I could almost still say it’s good because underneath all of the mindless filler & overused tropes lies an interesting concept, quality production values, and the beginnings of an amazing plot. Unfortunately, the product as a whole just isn’t entertaining or intricate enough to cope with its faults. I can’t recommend Log Horizon to a general audience, though if you’re a big fan of isekai or anime about video games you may find enough to enjoy here to make it all worthwhile.";Mixed Feelings
18;Log Horizon;Horatio_Svetlana;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Horatio_Svetlana;5;Log Horizon is an extremely well written science fiction story, with terrible directing and borderline annoying comedy relief. The concepts and execution of those concepts are very well fleshed out and intelligent. It's not just a competent story, it's a great story. The directing is flat and boring, with only the most engaging moments in the story actually effective in their presentation. The comedy, with very few exceptions, is one joke assigned to a character that makes you smile slightly the first time it happens, and then this joke repeated with no variation over and over.  I can off handedly remember about 15 moments in the entire season that were actually effectively directed in a way that I'd enjoy watching again, and one really great scene that was very well directed and enjoyable to watch. Every time I try to think about an episode that I've already watched, I remember how dull the execution is and don't feel like rewatching it. The story is great, but since I already know how it plays out, actually watching the show again does not entice me at all.;Mixed Feelings
19;Log Horizon;Aoi_no_sora;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aoi_no_sora;6;"Since all the reviews came for real fan lovers of the series, I guess I decided to leave a more neutral/objective one, I did enjoy the series but it’s what I called “when you don´t have anything else to watch” , so pretty much is an average anime. This review is for Season one and season 2, since season one didn’t give a correct end, and obviously continues in season 2.  Log horizon was recommended to me as a Real good anime based on a MMORPGs experienced, I was told “is good not like SAO”, since I really hate SAO, I thought wow I finally found a good MMORPGs inspired anime, I was wrong. Now, Log horizon is definitively better than SAO, but any anime is better than sao LOL … let me elaborate  Story (5/10) At the begging looks so promising but the pacing was so slow and became something else so fast. Watching the anime you´ll realized of the huge amount of plot holes it has, there is no purpose, there is no reason, there is no bad guy whatsoever; you´ll see a bunch of people that are trapped in this game, that´s all. They are in a game platform but they decided to make a city, instead of exploring. The only realistic reaction was that gamers became a bit cruel and created a bit of chaos, but that was only in the begging, later on they were so happy and forgot everything and decided to go to all “matsuris” they made in their new city/home. I mean there is nothing bad in that but I didn´t see anyone complaining or being desperate trying to go home, they were just okay with the idea of being trapped, I’m a gamer so I guess I will like it, but eventually I will be at least I BIT worried. No one decides to explore for real just a guild leader (Legolas guy was the only one with a real good reaction when they made the round table). In other word I felt that most of the decisions or reactions, or just simple the Behavior was a bit unrealistic.  I like that they explain the mechanics of the fights, the powers, the level, the types of characters , not like SAO (which I hate since kirito was the only one all-powerful gamer, I mean is a MMO game, the idea is team play, actually you can’t defeat bosses by yourself) the Team play was so cool, you have the healers, and the armor type, and the supports; it was really good, that will be awesome if it wasn´t that fights appears every 15 slice of life episodes, yeah ! For me this was a slice of life anime. Also a cooking anime ._. They decide to make an entire episode of how to cook, and there is a bunch of episode of the girls making deserts and a cat making food.  People tend to blame you that you didn´t understand the plot when you get bored and want to skip tedious talking, I actually saw the whole thing without skipping anything, some conversation were political and interesting and some other were no sense, that all, with this anime some episodes were cool and other ones were completed unrelated and boring. For some reason I feel like the anime slowly became a loli harem slice of life cooking show.  Characters (4/10) I hate the fact that a cool really independent ninja girl became a helpless in love cliché girl, she did also behave like a teen, when they clearly told that she was an adult like shiroe. She was even jealous of a little girl that for some reason supposed to be a teen, it doesn’t matter both look like kids, apparently that is moe, I can´t stand lolis, they are so plain and boring MC , anywho at the begging character seem so unique but I was wrong . there is no character development in here, no unique or strong characters, is more like stereotypical ones , the bunch of lolis, some huge breast girls, I cat that can cook and some guy which I couldn’t understand, was he funny ? Was he just relaxed? Or he was just there to make Shirore look better? Shiroe was the only character that was interesting, cuz you know, he was the strategist. There was also another Megane guy but he didn´t appear that much and in the second season he literally was missed the whole thing until the end (why ? he was cool)  Anyhow empathy is missing and there is no real connection with the characters, most likely you will forget them.  Art/Sound /enjoyment /overall (6/10) The animation is good, sound is good as well really like the OP and the second Ed. Enjoyment was good, the anime is not completely bad, sometimes is boring some other was cool(good fight/ elaborate plan team scenes). Overall is an average anime, its okey when you don’t have anything else to watch, most of episodes are fillers with no connection with the plot but are quite cute and I did like most of them.";Mixed Feelings
0;Log Horizon;sours;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sours;3;"Where do I even start with this anime... First of all i am not the most well versed in anime but i do have a long history of playing MMORPG games like the game ""Elder Tale"" depicted in this anime and most of my issues with this are directed at the game deign because the anime is really just bland and not very good.  THE UI: Imagine somebody watched a futureistic movie or something of the sort where holographic menus pop up that you control with your fingers. Now imagine one where everything is the same bland green color and pops up randomly and moves all over the screen like mad. Honestly an eyesore almost everytime it is animated and rather saddened me as a viewer.  THE CLASS/SKILL SYSTEM: In the show very few classes are shown to the viewer and even though most of the characters for each class are shown at the Max in game level (90) only like 2 or 3 skills are used by any of them at any given point. However at one point there is another painful to look at menu for some body they are fighting skills and he has many more and refuses to do anything with them instead he just uses the same 3 cool downs. Our MC has a CC spell that does 5x1k damage and binds a target and the main tank for him only has 13k hp meaning there is absolutely no balance in this game and all skills just should be ignored for the most part.  THE GUILD/FACTION/PVP: What are the factions in this game you might be wondering? FFA always 24/7 even in towns even on your own party members. None of it makes any sense and should honestly just be ignored because it will hurt you too much as anybody who has played any MMORPG or like game before. Not to mention that healers can heal people while they are dueling and all duels are literally to the death.  THE PARTYS: I really don't even want to talk about the party system in the show/LN/game because it makes me so mad. A party in an actual MMORPG style game has these components TANK | DEEPS (x2/x3) | HEALZ This game has OPERATOR | FIELD MONITOR | PATROL FILE I honestly cant even begin to start to describe my frustration watching the party play in this game/show whatever you want to call it. If any single person in this show was in a party of mine in any game instant kick, instant guild removal, muted, banned from vent. Honestly this is really more like LARP the show then a depiction of what an actual game is like and that made me feel physically ill.  THE STORY: sucks, read more about what other people had to say I really did not care for it and at no point did it surprise me or have me empathizing with any of the characters.  MY CONCLUSION: If you have ever played a MMORPG do not watch this show you will hate yourself for it. If you have ever LARP'd watch this show you will love it. Approach with caution. Do not expect intelligence.";Not Recommended
1;Log Horizon;Social_Elitist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Social_Elitist;4;LOG HORIZON REVIEW:  MINDSET: *LITERALLY ABSOLUTLY NOTHING*  SYNOPSIS: Some game called Elder Tale created a near-apocalyptic event which in that day, the players that have logged in and were sucked into the games world. The protagonist Shiro and he's friends work together as helping freelancers to all sorts of random stuff, like killing a monk, helping a loli etc. It usually centrers around Shiro, as he soon decides to replicate real-life society with Elder Tale, as everything has become corrupt. It is up to he's new guild “Log Horizon” to create a new and working society that benefits everyone.  REVIEW: Lets start out with the good stuff. Even us more professional critics agree, that Log Horizons biggest strength is “World Building” You truly get a grasp of this world, how it works and how it has develop. To be honest, its quite fun for me look back on what I learnt at certain episodes, to revise thorough certain pieces of knowledge. This truly puts in favour of its pacing, like Shinsekai Yori, the pacing of the show gradually shows You an ever more and expanding world. (for the most part) the reactions and development on our barren wasteland, to a fully working society is a really fascinating look.  You see major discoveries, like how if You cooked Your self instead of using the command panel, will add actual flavour onto the food, instead of it tasting like plain Yoghurt. Or how wealthy guilds invest money to research technology, by using the knowledge they used to have the world develops quickly. You see laws being added, wars breaking lose, inventions of items that cannot be made in real-life can all add up to a very immersible fantasy realm.  Consequently, there are moments with flawed writing. My case and point? Some of the world building can be quite unrealistic and some plot pints feel forced and rather out of place, like how the origin of Elder Tale was before the age of Adam & Eve, it was the Elves who came before the humans as this super advance race. There are moments like these which subconsciously makes me face palm to how dum the writing can be in certain moments, and yes without spoiling it, the Lore of the original Elder Tale was down side for me...  Considering the fact that the show centrers around world building, it has no grey morality which gives out a few minuses since You can obviously tell who is the villain. And also, the villains are totally one dimensional turds of writing.  Another issue to stress out, (technically I can call that a flaw) is the fact that You still get the same feel and aura of the shows world building. (I know it could be hard to explain but please grasp on my explanation) You only get fascinated by the shows “World Building” this means that You do not truly feel emotion, or tension when reality hits hard, because of the charcters... Yep, I'm addressing this issue again...  We have overall great world building, so what about a cast to back it up? With a cast that can be completely summarised with one word or a one liner, this makes them feel like the same overused cookie cutter flat and uncomplex archetypes all over again. At the end of the series, they do not develop. Sure there were a very small handful that had legit development, but overall, it doesn’t reward any more redeeming factors on the entire cast. The only character that kind of shines above the rest would be Shiro, he's a very logical thinker, the most OP tactician in the series, but personality wise, he still reminiscent of the same generic protagonist vibe that I see with far too many modern Anime these days. Roriconfan describes characters like these, as Vanilla, a character who seems to have a lesser persona, and just reacts at everything.... He gets barely any development even though he gets the most screen time.  There are a few pretty above average characters, but the ratio is like 3/100 of other characters that I've already forgotten there names, but again, there really nothing special.  The only special mention of the OST, would be the OP, its great, sure it doesn’t fit the whole theme of a fantasy series but its just a piece of some really cool J-Pop with really cool beats! The ED is so average that it kind of sucks, so just skip it. (there is nothing special about it) For the rest of the OST, its Your completely generic fantasy OST with your violins, trumpets, etc. With only one memorable song. It is sufficient on its job, and fits the mood nicely. But I'm no musician, so I can't critique it in a very in-depth and critical manner!  This goes the same for the Animation, again, nothing special. It is again, sufficient on its job and doesn’t have anything note worthy. However, I really like it because it remains very consistent, threes not one moment when it felt like downgrading, or upgrading and the action scenes look pretty cool and fluid. Its overall very consistent and nice! Sure the use of colours is rather minimalistic, and character designs are fairly above average for the most part with nicely distinguishing features in each design but its good.  LEGACY: After so many years passing, this show is going to be decently well remembered for its great (though flawed) world building, it has a few decent characters and an awesome OP to be remembered, its truest legacy would feel like a very fun and animated, quirky geography lesson that is 24 volumes long, with a bit history in the mix made in Japan!  SCORES: 4.5/10 For a nothing special plot, with very above average world building. 3.5/10 With a forgettable and large cast that were not very well directed. 6/10 As its sufficient Animation only redeeming factor is the very consistent budget. And good designs. 6.5/10 For a good OST, and bonus points for a great OP 6.5/10 As an enjoyable Geography lesson (nothing else)  FINALE: 4/10 Only for the cool geography lessons will it not suck.;Not Recommended
2;Log Horizon;WhatYouWanted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhatYouWanted;3;"When Log Horizon wasn't getting on my nerves it was putting me to sleep, it was sold to me as a fantasy world anime done right, with excellent world building, and a vast cast of interesting and likeable characters. Sadly I found this couldn't be further from the truth.  The first issue is that Log Horizon makes up its rules not on what logically makes sense, but what's convenient for its narrative. First of, in this fantasy world you can make food from a drop down menu or buy some made from an NPC, however these foods have no taste, now raw ingredients have taste, and so do meals made in the same way you would do so in the real world, though you need the chef subclass to do so. The reason why this is the case is never explained and is merely a contrivance to set up a major sub-plot early into the show. If the logic is that the menu made food doesn't have any taste because it goes through an ""unnatural"" creation process, why is NPC made food also effected by this. If you need the chef subclass to make food with flavor, why does everyone have the power to make food via a menu, also on that note why there is a chef class is never explained either and have a maid subclass come up later makes even less sense.  Early on we find out that all the characters take on the appearance of their in game avatars, Log Horizon really wanted to have it's cake and eat it too in this instance. All the low level players happen to be children, who all coincidentally made child avatars, which look similar to their real life selves, and everyone elses appearance match both their personality, and gender. Knowing this it would make a whole lot more sense if you simply took on your real life appearance, however then the show wouldn't have an excuse to have some players be cat people, who all coincidentally are fine with no longer being human and even love to role play twenty four seven. One could argue for suspension of disbelief here I agree, though it didn't need to be written in such a way. It could be that you take on your real life appearance, with the exception of specific non-human traits and it would of worked just fine. Even so these other races and traits never really add anything to the show and are never really explored, so I have to wonder what the point was.  Log Horizon isn't even consistent with its rules, it's established that if you attempt to fight inside a city, incredibly powerful guardians will spawn until you cease fighting, outside of cities you can kill other players however, they will merely infinitely re-spawn back in the city. It's also established that a guild exists that forces inexperienced players (who all happen to be children for some reason) to give their experience potions that they receive daily, to the high level players within said guild, of course this brings up just how exactly they could force them to do anything, considering they could just leave to the areas were the guardians spawn. The show attempts to explain this away by saying the guild members could simply kill them when they leave the city, though this implies they have enough people to keep the entire area covered for every time one of the children tries to leave, who are also totally okay with child abuse. At one point on of these guild members physically restrains one of the children, however the guardians don't spawn because it isn't technically 'combat', but this seems to imply that you could physically unarm someone and drag them out of the city, but not have the guardians spawn on you because you have technically started combat. This as well as the food having no taste and the physical appearance of the characters, are just three of the many issues I had with Log Horizons world building, as it feels as if the rules are made up merely as it goes along.  Annoyingly, Log Horizon doesn't even feel as if it accurately portrays MMO's how ether, in most of the battles only one or two ability is used per character, and apparently there's no default attack for most of the classes.I cannot comprehend who would want to play an MMO in which you can only make one action every five teen or so seconds, it also doesn't help that we never learn the variety of class options or if there exists a form of meta game present before the game is made real.  Moving on, the characters are a horrible detriment to the show, which all feel one note and completely uninteresting. We have our main character Shiroe, who doesn't really have much of a personality other than being somewhat reserved. The show wants us to believe he is a master strategist, apparently not by actually showing him do anything impressive but by having the characters constantly riding his dick about how great a strategist he is, remember don't show, tell tell and tell some more. Speaking of riding Shrioe's dick, what better way to describe Akatsuki, a 20 year old women with the appearance of a twelve year old (which is based off her actual appearance mind you) for some reason, not that it matters because she acts like a child, loving to constantly role play as her class, and refer to Shrio as her lord, it is unbearable as it sounds. She isn't the worst however as after her you have Naotsugu, his entire character is basically that he's a pervert, he exemplifies the worst of Log Horizon's attempt at humor, it wasn't funny when Akatsuki hit him the first time for being a pervert nor the other twenty times after that. Aside from that you have a group of annoying children who take several days to grasp the basic concepts of an MMO, some people who take things far too seriously, and a princess that everyone seems to love for no real reason.  The aesthetic of Log Horizon also feels uninspired, you'd think there would be some disquisition between high level and low level characters, considering that higher level players would have stronger equipment, but apparently not, you would also think people would look rather unique considering how much time people put into character customization but this isn't the case either. It makes it hard to wonder why people would play an MMO that looks so generic, and just because a narrative is based on an MMO it doesn't mean it has to conform to such a generic looking standard.  I'll end on a positive note by saying the sound track for this show is decent, and also feels as if it would be in place inside of a video game, whilst also fitting the scene in general. The intro theme is also pretty good, aside from being a tad cringey with lines such as ""We've got the antidote for the jammed and hypnotized."" Unfortunately this isn't enough to salvage Log Horizon, and I certainly wont be continuing on to season two.";Not Recommended
3;Log Horizon;siphus007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/siphus007;4;Log Horizon lacks stakes, has childish humor, minimal action or character-building, and only has 1 compelling arc that doesn't seem to denote that this should be a renowned isekai.  Story & Writing: 3/10 Characters: 4/10 Art: 2.5/5 Sound: 2.5/5  Avg: 4/10  I haven't written one of these in a while, but without spoilers I feel the need to unfortunately dump on a fairly beloved isekai. Let me start by saying that this is sometimes a very smart show. For anyone who has ever played an MMORPG, it is a very legitimate and affectionate take on the genre. They introduce several mechanics such as classes, subclasses, quests, grinding, balancing a party, etc.  It also has 1 arc that was really great. I won't go into it but it's around episode 9-12 or so, and involves a lot of clever politicking and is very well-written. Beyond the aforementioned moments, it feels worthless to me.  The story is almost nonexistent. There is an event that happens that is never explained, and none of the characters seem overly concerned that this is a monumental life-changing experience with no sign of changing. There is also no goal, journey, or point to the season. They essentially meander and try to take over until some kind of conflict arises. That said, the final arc is mostly slice of life and has little suspense or interest. I had to multitask to even finish it. The writing is smart at times, but the humor is very poor. Maybe children could find the slapstick funny, but it's mostly cringy.  The characters can be good sometimes. The main character is one of the better ones, in that he's an otaku but his skills come in handy in this game world. He's never a pure good guy but easily someone you can root for. As for everyone else, you have the perverted friend, the sagelike perfect friend, the adoring sidekick, generic tough guys, a guy who can somehow always read the mind of a princess, a bubbly woman who fawns over another girl, etc. They reuse the same jokes and character interactions over and over again, and nobody grows or learns in the story.  The art and sound are both fine. I skip both the OP and ED althought the ED isn't bad. Nothing special or terrible in either of these regards.  If you are a very patient MMORPG fanatic, this might be for you actually. I'm not dumping on it to be cruel but to provide a perspective for potential viewers. I definitely hope to see some newer isekai that change my mind about this genre at some point in the near future.;Not Recommended
4;Log Horizon;brettkigawa101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brettkigawa101;4;Honestly I dont know how this anime got above a 6. It may have been one of my least favorite isekai genre of animes. The fighting scenes and animations were sub par, the sound effects were not satisfying, the characters were kind of boring, the voices of most characters were annoying, the anime kept using cliche anime scenes like pushing up glasses with a glare and sound effect, there was nothing special about the animation, in fact I thought the animation was a little worse than other animes, and the ideology behind the character motives and thinking are childish. I feel like this anime is a vastly inferior SAO. This also applies to the second season.;Not Recommended
5;Log Horizon;0MAN0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/0MAN0;4;In a world of shitty isekai's, there's gotta be one that's actually good, right? Log Horizon is... not quite that.  Log Horizon is a series that, while not that good, does have a few things going for it. Notably, the strength of the narrative and its use of MMORPG mechanics as plot devices. However, these advantages are smeared by a mess of poor presentation and stiff characters. I can see why somebody could be captivated by a show like this, but so many elements hold it back from being anything beyond but just-another-isekai.    [Rating] Story: 8 Art: 3 Sound: 4 Character: 3 Enjoyment: 5 Overall: 4   [Story: 8] The story is, without a doubt, really well constructed. That is, until the final arc. But let's list what is great about the story at the start!  - Shifts in the plot don't feel random due to proper foreshadowing. - Offers perspective on both high-level and low-level players - Uses MMORPG elements properly as plot devices. - Keeps audience informed about the rules of the world. - Great understanding of political and economic response to social change. - Has a pretty good sense of agency and pace. - Gives opportunity for growth to many characters in a way that feels natural (though the characters are too weak to support it)  ... and more. I would nearly give the plot a 10... before we get to the last chunk of episodes. Coming in, we finish a nice battle arc but don't really settle the 'final boss', which the audience definitely expects. Instead, we go into this strange romance arc which is incredibly boring because THE COUPLES SUCK and also this strange scheme-discovery arc which is also weird because all it really does is set up the next season. This really makes the last 7 or so episodes lack any real sort of interest when it makes the most sense to just finish off the action and set up these events better.    [Art: 3] The art is not good. Generally, things look alright, but the line art and character portraits are really iffy most of the time. Character design ranges from average to poor, the only good one appears in the last episode. It also feels like the characters simply lack proper shading. Art of the various monsters is awful. Really lacking in the action department.  I'm taking a full point off for the egregious use of the glasses-adjust visual device. Happens so often. It is beyond stupid. Whoever thought this was a good idea should never be allowed to work in the industry again. Seriously, what are you doing?    [Sound: 4] Voice acting is pretty stiff. Individual tracks and simple and do the job, but definitely repetitive. Otherwise, the sound design is fine.    [Character: 3] Yeah I mean, these characters really don't have much going on. Shiroe and Minori have some moments going for them, but beyond that, the rest are just throwaways.  The series is particularly maligned by its inability to properly construct a romance, which it tries to do. Get Akatsuki out of the show. She literally did nothing after episode 5 in this series. She has no romance potential at all. What are you doing?    [Enjoyment: 5] I finished it! The story keeps you engaged without the continuous use of cliffhangers, which is a testament to the strength of the narrative with all the other problems that exist in the series.    [Overall: 4] Nothing left to say. Despite the strength of the narrative, I consider this to be a close-to-average show. That being said, those interesting in storytelling can learn a great deal from this series. But there is too much holding it back from being actually good.;Not Recommended
6;Log Horizon;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;4;"PROPER MINDSET Many say that a show should be judged based only on its own merits and not how it compares with others of its kind. Nothing can be more far away from this concept that Log Horizon, which will forever be compared to Sword Art Online.  SCRIPT So yeah, here we are again with a premise where people are trapped in a videogame. Only this time, death is not permanent, since you will just respawn in the nearest temple. You know right away it is not a grave issue, like SAO pretended it was before throwing in tentacle fan service. It is light conflict where the trapped players just try to get along, many of which don’t do that and just loot and pseudo-kill others for fun. Here is where our main heroes come in to save the day because… erm, because they are good people. Yeah, that is the whole conflict, some guys who are bored and do nasty thingies with no real repercussions, and some other guys who try to stop them because they have nothing better to do. That’s all there is to it, really. They try to make it seem more intriguing at points by mentioning how you lose some of your memories every time you resurrect, or how the NPCs actually have personality and are not drones. Despite those attempts, it still remains a comical and light fantasy adventure all the way.  The story is based on light novels by Touno Mamare, the guy who also wrote Maoyuu Maou Yuusa. He never tries to create a serious story, and loves to make parodies out of stereotypes. Despite the light approach, he still manages to have better characterization and immersion than SAO, since over there it was just some generic super perfect dude doing everything, while being surrounded by people who can’t do anything without his divine presence. Over here, you get teams of players, each one having a certain role in battles. Nobody can solo armies and big bosses like that asshole Kirito could; over here you need teamwork and coordination to win. Thus it offers a much better feeling of what MMO battles really are like.  Of course lots of things are still quite off in terms of realism. Many of the players don’t seem to know very fundamental powers even if they are at maximum level. Yes, you heard right, the main players are at max level since episode 1 and just raise their secondary classes, which have no real impact in their happy-go-lucky adventures. Thus nobody can be stronger than them in terms of statistics and it all boils down to strategies and teamwork. And since the heroes happen to excel in those elements, they are basically flawless and you are just watching them casually showing of their mental superiority as they overcome with ease all challenges. So all the fancy terminology they use during action scenes is just there to confirm their status as the picture perfect super team. Again, not exciting, but at least it is about brains over brawns. And they sure don’t try to make it seem like equipment or items play any role, since nobody seems to wear something that gives him extra durability, or does spells that the others even heard of.  Exposition is by far the weakest aspect of an already weak story, since everything is explained exactly when it happens, a thing which makes it sloppy. For example, they explain the game terminology in the middle of the battle, as if there is no other way to let the audience understand without rubbing it to their faces. Opponents and on-lookers will be stand still while the heroes are infodumping the hell out of everything, even for things everybody should have known in-series. It looks ridiculous when you see how all the strategies they use in battles are based on skills and spells the audience never heard of up until that moment. It does make sense after they explain it to you but it is by no stretch of the word smart; it feels like the author is just making them up as he goes along based on what the plot demands.  CAST The characters are just ok for the type of style this show goes for, but are not deep or complicating in any way. They are easily defined by a few quirks and a simple mentality, which is usually there just for laughs. Thus we have the assassin chick acting like a slave to a bookworm mage, who is friends with a pervert paladin (talk about acting out-of-character). Any attempts the setting does in order to present a world where anarchy rules and people do stuff out of boredom is rendered useless when you see how nobody seems to care much about whatever happens. They act scared when someone is looting or killing them but that means absolutely nothing if you can’t really die or you just lose a few trinkets. They are all still defined by very well-established archetypes and fetishes, so you never feel like they are real people. They are fairly cartoony and goofy, lack backdrop stories or long term objectives to offer some openings for character development, and take it too easy considering their situation. So they might seem cool and funny at first, but down to it are very shallow and easily forgettable.  PRODUCTION VALUES The one aspect SAO beats it at, but then again if you are watching a show just for the visuals and music, you really don’t care about what the show is all about. Not that they are bad; they are just ok, nothing fancy, better than most of whatever a small studio like Satelight can offer. It’s enough to get a good feel of a virtual fantasy setting but you are never going to be mesmerized.  LEGACY It will never have the sales or popularity of SAO, just because it is easy going and without awesome production values. It will still be remembered as a better version of SAO, since it did a far better job at showing how online communities work, and how social skills and strategies are more important than grinding monsters out of screen, and then having time skips every 20 minutes just for the heck of it. I can even say how we were all expecting it to be a SAO clone instead of being hyped to the moon, and thus when we go to see something better fleshed out with less expectations, it ended up being an overall better experience. Log Horizon does not betray you, since it remains the same as what it shows you in the first episode. It doesn’t promise you to be a scary action survival before soon turning to a harem with tentacles, rape, and incest like SAO did. That is something quite respectable. Although it still isn’t exciting, so unless you are in for the comedy and the gaming terminology you will get bored of it very soon. I still consider the best of “trapped in a videogame” anime to be Hack//sign for down to it NOT being about videogames but rather about isolation and a critique on escapism through a fake persona. It might not have been funny or exciting, but it was serious and moody throughout its run.";Not Recommended
7;Log Horizon;PotmArrows;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PotmArrows;1;"I went into this anime with high hopes and expectations after all the hype given to it by its fans and the friends who were interested in watching the new season with me. I binged first and second season across a few days and my god. This is probably one of the worst animes of all time, and by far one of the worst pieces of story telling across all mediums of media.  First, the characters. Shrioe is a boring plank with no personality and weak motivations. The rest of his ""character"" is projected onto him by those around him constantly worshiping him and his supposed galaxy sized brain. But Shiroe himself with one or two exceptions, has no proven superior intellect but rather a base level of common sense especially with regards to any ""strategy"" in games. His big moment in early episodes he ""waited until the cc spell was almost expired to cast it again for chain cc and burst"" which is arguably the most common sense utilization of said spell possible if the cooldown is that low. Won't even talk about how this spell being used in this way should technically break the game in any kind of fight where there is only one target. Most of his solutions are silly and smell of a ""smart character"" being written by a very dumb person. He makes the game server pay for all his buildings upkeep, rigs a vote by just invited an entire other city to come vote, he brings someone back to life by making them sign a document to become an adventurer. Its just weird all too convenient solutions that don't sell the audience on him actually being intelligent.  But rest assured, the rest of the cast will convince you he is actually super smart by constantly reminding you of it. Other characters are even more poorly written than Shiroe. Shrioe has two close friends, one of whom's only character quality is talking about panties and holding a shield. The other's qualities are kicking the guy for talking about panties, **** worshiping Shiroe in a RP-style kind of way(calls him lord etc and is clearly infatuated with him), and she gets almost no development whatsoever in Season 1 despite being the clear love interest with our protagonist. The list goes on but every character is essentially *insert anime quirk/meme here and have them spam it* and that is all there is to them at all. The only character who actually seems to have real passion or motivation is the muscle man Shiroe beats in PVP in episode 3(?) who goes on to really hate Shiroe for beating him in a fight and just wants to beat the crap out of him. Everyone else pretty much operates with no goal or purpose with maybe exceptions given to the numerous women who want Shiroe's big brain PP for no discernible reason given he is a blank slate *insert yourself here* protagonist for young escapist men with poor social skills who also have power fantasies/short man syndrome.  Speaking of characters, what about villains/antagonists? Well disappointingly enough, there seems to be no apparent villain in Log Horizon. I have heard arguments about the world itself being the antagonist but the memory loss seems almost irrelevant after 2 and a half seasons, the weapons/flavortext being important or dangerous was immediately fixed, goblin invasion was boring and pointless, no one seems to care about actually leaving the game world. There is no actual threat present that isn't solved within a few episodes or just forgotten about(and thereby being unqualified to be of importance/seriousness). Seems like any characters being presented as antagonists are outplayed instantly or in the case of two certain female characters, seem to be thinking more about Shiroe and less about actually completing their own goals. And to be an antagonist, your goals must be either in the way of the protagonist, or the protagonist's goals must be in the way of yours. For an anime with as much exposition and weakly attempted world building as this on(during which it always takes a very serious tone) you'd expect there to be a clear antagonistic force or character by the time Season 3 comes around. I'll save you the disappointment and let you know there isn't one.  World building. The world is cool but the author does very little with it and refuses to explore interesting ideas he puts forward, likely because they are beyond the scope of his own abilities to explore. Which is fine, but there is a lot of truth to writing what you know, and I am not sure the author knows how to write a smart character, or actual layered intrigue. So the world falls flat because we see so little of it and so little of it seems to actually matter anyways. This is a slice of life style anime with exposition and dramatic dialogue layered throughout it and a constant suggestion of impending problems that never actually come out to shake the world up.  The story is directionless, as is the world building and the anime suffers heavily for this. It tries to be a quirky slice of life but then why have all the exposition/world building/attempts at intrigue etc? So much time is wasted on, for lack of better terminology, anime memes. These are spammed relentlessly at the viewer in the most repetitive sense possible and none of them at that funny to begin with, and those that were get old very fast.  Log Horizon is an impressive feat in that it somehow convinced a generation that grew up with the likes of Game of Thrones(the first few seasons specifically) that it is a ""smart"" anime with lots of depth and good characters/world building. In truth it has none of that and is an attempted smart anime written by a presumably dumb person for even dumber people. It fails in every technical aspect of good writing but tries too hard to actually be good so it doesn't even cross the threshold of ""being so bad that its good"" which I would welcome at this point from this 60 episode slog of a series where almost nothing ever happens and when it does it literally does not matter.  To end with an especially egregious example of the story telling at work here:  A character gets SUCKED INTO A WEAPON in such a way another character loses her forearm trying to help him, and then NO ONE talks about him for THREE MONTHS in the anime's timeline, which was many MANY episodes for the viewers. And that is the ONLY time he is brought up again until the end of the season after which it is relayed to the main cast that he is A-Ok which I guess they must have already known beforehand because no one seemed to care or get worried about what happened despite him being one of the main GMs for running their player city/their war general. They just shrug it off until the audience is told he is fine.  No one cares, so why should we?  And that's basically all there is to the show. Don't waste your time on it. People who enjoy this anime likely have nostalgia glasses on and watched it before they had a palette developed for what makes a show/story good. And if they watched it recently and unironically think the story/characters/world are well written, then I would filter out future anime suggestions from that person. It is a miserable slog not worth of anyone's time and by and far the WORST anime, or any piece of media in general, that I have ever had the displeasure of consuming.";Not Recommended
8;Log Horizon;Define-Reality;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Define-Reality;4;"It's a slow, soulless MMORPG guide disguised as an anime. The characters aren't terrible, they're just stale and incredibly uninteresting. The story doesn't actually exist. The writing quality is variable, with some parts actually being key to the workings of the (rather complex) world, and others being absolutely mind-numbing rambles about literally nothing of signifigance (i.e. s1e2 when Shiroe was trying to gauge the ""coolness level"" of something and then wondered whether there even is a ""coolness level"". It's just not believable that a person in Shiroe's position would even have those thoughts.) The art and animation are both good, and the sound quality and execution is very good, all of the sounds fit well for every scenario.  Pros: -Characters aren't unaware of obvious facts in regards to the situations they're in (*cough* Guilty Crown *endcough*). -The mechanical aspects are strongest of any Isekai. -The art, animation and SFX/music are all good. Cons: -Characters are painfully limited in their individual personalities. -Some characters don't even express any grievance with being forced into this false world without any escape (bye bye behavioral authenticity). -The pacing is so slow that you could leave to use the restroom and return with a high probability of not missing anything essential to the ""story"" or characters, which brings me to my next con. -The story doesn't exist. In a small, vague way, it does exist. But there really is no primary direction or conflict. It's more like watching a bizarre social experiment in the style of anime than an actual normal anime. -You can tell that the combat in this show wasn't meant to be exciting, but rather, to make as many possible parallels to real MMO games via familiar terminologies and visuals. Recognizing those familiar elements in this anime is cool at first, but unless you're an MMO addict that is also halfway through MMO withdrawal, that angle quickly wears out. -The moments of awe in this anime exist solely for the characters, not the viewers. Again, things like combat are devoid of excitement for the viewer. -After a while you begin to realize that you may as well just be playing an MMO yourself since you're essentially watching a group do just that almost to a T. -The leader is a support class who somehow enjoys the support role (which is a knock at believability). -The above con is satirical. I enjoy the support role in many types of games.";Not Recommended
9;Log Horizon;rotokun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rotokun;4;"The only good part of this show is the that the NPCs are basically real people and have meaningful strife with the real players. Unfortunately, that's only about 30% of the story, and far less of the overall screen time.  The characters are somewhat enjoyable, though none are particularly strange enough to claim any significant feelings from a viewer over any set of characters from any other show.  The real issue is how much of this scenario is supposed to be an MMO and how absolutely fucking terribly the show portrays it. They literally live in an MMO, which has supposedly been around for 20 years(though is still the most poorly made game to ever exist), yet less than 1% of players have hit max level, and nobody in the entire game, including the veterans, acts like they've ever played anything. Every single character has severe brain damage, nobody ever uses more than 2 abilities in their repertoire of 10 minimum, and several times, abilities that previously were shown to do something, now do something else.  I feel I need to give some examples, so that anybody who has a shred of common sense or cares at all about video games will steer clear of this show. In an early episode, the main character uses an ability that does 1k true damage per ally hit, 5 times(max level character of the tankiest class has only 14k hp max), and then after that deals 50% of the opponents max hp. Clearly this has to be the most overpowered ability ever created, and maybe the author realized this too, because next episode the 50% hp shred was straight up removed. Did i mention that the main character only has buffing abilities, has only played solo, and was one of the first people to hit max level?  In that same scene, a low level healer needlessly puts out healing of about 5hp/sec, which the main character for some reason has her ""hold until the right moment."" Then she levels up a few times, from about 19 to 24, and suddenly in a later battle she randomly puts out healing of over 1k/sec, which hilariously outheals any form of damage the entire gangrape on enemies had been doing.  Tanking things in this game works on a damage based aggro scale, so high dps people or tanks with ""fake high damage"" abilities tank enemies. Later on in a dangerous battle, the bard, who has been shown to have 0 damaging abilities, is in a 1v2 against the same enemies as the tank right next to her is 1v1ing. This takes place after a heartwarming several episodes where their troop learns common sense, and clearly proved that they at the very least knew how tanking works. This leads to a rough battle, where the ""smartest strategist"" in their group realizes their tank is about to die, here's how that scene plays out.  ""I need to use [shield ability] on [tank] or he'll die, but its on a 10 second cooldown still!"" It then shows her HUD, where we can see that ALL of her other abilities are up, several of which we have seen be fairly useful. ""But wait, that [shield ability] doesn't even work against these enemies!"" Why in the world was she using it then, nevertheless ONLY using it.  Also this tragedy of a battle starts with all the max levels characters sitting it out, because they have to ""regen their mana"", even though we've seen that mana fully regens in 1 hour, they haven't done anything involving mana in at least a day, and they have a plethora of mana potions.  The relative OK-ness of this show's characters and story barely make an attempt to outweigh the pain that is the scenario.";Not Recommended
0;Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den;JTurner;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JTurner;7;"No, it's not a sequel, but rather a retelling of the events that follow episode eight of the original OVA. Actually, the Lodoss OVA are a somewhat streamlined telling of the novels they were based on. This longer, more drawn-out 27-episode television series hews closer to its source material, but in doing so causes for inconsistencies between the two programs. This has caused a lot of confusion for many viewers, although the booklet contained with the series (and the DVD-ROM bonus extras) do help to explain them. There have been a lot of mixed reactions to Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, with many who dismissed it as a cheap, inferior spin-off of the (arguably superior) OVA. Once you get accustomed to its oddities, however, this series isn't as inferior as it has been made out to be. In fact, it can be best appreciated as an interesting, if more sluggishly paced, &quot;alternate route&quot; for the final five episodes.  That said, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight starts out less than promisingly. The first eight episodes (the weakest of the show) concentrate on the struggle with the ruthless (and yet strangely not so evil) Black Knight Ashram for the Scepter of Domination which initially comprised episodes 9-10 of the OVA. While it's nice to see Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, and King Kashue again, their roles are actually less significant this time around. The only characters to receive any development are two supporting characters from the original, the headstrong mercenary Shiris and her quietly reserved (but easily enraged) Berserker partner, Orson. (In what may be an example of one of the many inconsistencies in the show, both characters are reintroduced to Parn and company as if they never crossed paths in episode 8 of the OVA.) There are several new characters, too, including a prissy mage apprentice, an easily deceived priest, a mischevious elfish grass-runner sprite named Maar, but all three are hardly memorable. The slow pace of the episodes are what really work against them, however; there's less action and more talky moments; even the climactic showdown at Fire Dragon Mountain between Ashram and the vicious red dragon Shooting Star is longer and more drawn out than one might expect. There is a surprisingly heartfelt sacrifice in episode 7, but the overall arc doesn't have the same energy or roller-coaster action of its predecessor.  It is only at episode 9 and onward that Chronicles finally comes to life. The story jumps ten years after the Fire Dragon Mountain events, where the focus shifts to the evil wizard Wagnard's desire to awaken the Goddess of Destruction, Kardis. Again, Parn and company's roles are reduced to supporting ones, and consequently, come across as the least interesting in the show. The hero here is Spark, a blue-haired knight wanna-be who, at the surface, comes initially across as a more pale incarnation of Parn, but his troop of companions do provide the kind of banter and chemistry one would expect for any fantasy adventure. The smart-aleck mercenary Garrack is a well-realized character, as is his sassy half-elf partner, Leaf, who steals every scene she's in with glee. Just as interesting are the loyal thief Ryna and the dwarfish priest Greevus. This ragtag team of misfits are joined by a mysterious girl named Little Neese (daughter of Slayn and Leylia), who turns out to be one of the key ingredients Wagnard needs to revive Kardis. During all this, Ashram returns in a last attempt to unite Lodoss (to fulfill his late master, Emperor Beld's dream) while the shifty Grey Witch, Karla, also lurks in the shadows. It is the chemistry between Spark's comrades and the more lively pace that really bring much needed energy to this major story, which, many would argue, is just a recycling of the last story thread from the OVA, but this telling is more complex, introducing some twists that are alternatingly surprising and insightful. And even though the grand finale is less exciting than the OVA, it still wraps up the show on a pleasing note. (Although Wagnard's drawn-out rituals and Little Neese's continuous screams of pain get tiresome after a while.)  Probably the only jarring thing about Chronicles of the Heroic Knight are the short three-minute Welcome to Lodoss Island segments at the end of each episode. These are super-deformed versions of the characters in goofy, cartoonish sequences, each of which clock in at around 2-3 minutes each. These wildly bizarre skits (which parody the world of Lodoss) will either amuse or drive you batty; I personally choose to give them a pass because they just don't click with me, but chances are your mileage may vary. (Interestingly, it's worth checking out these interludes with the English version to see how the Japanese puns--which make up a majority of the dialogue in these skits--are adapted into English, namely &quot;I'm King Kashue, and this is my CASHEW! I'm really quite a nut!&quot; as opposed to the more literal &quot;I'm King Kashue, isn't my KATCHU (armor) nice)?&quot;  The character development and overall entertainment value of Chronicles provides for a pleasant enough way to pass the time for fantasy fans, which isn't to say that it is the most aesthetically or aurally pleasing show to watch. On the contrary. The Lodoss OVAs had some beautifully detailed, if sometimes limited, animation, but Chronicles' production values are another matter. Aside from a breathtaking opening sequence (underscored by a beautiful theme song composed by Yoko Kanno), the animation fluctuates throughout the series, with some episodes looking downright painful on the eyes. There are several episodes which do get a boost in overall quality, artwork wise, particularly the last ones, but all in all, the artistry is not one of Chronicles' strongest points.  The audio portions fare signifigantly better, thanks in large part to the epic musical score contributed by Kaoru Wada. Fully orchestrated, with soaring, epic marches one moment and pounding, percussive action cues the next, this soundtrack arguably carries the whole show from start to finish. As mentioned, the opening theme is remarkable and impeccably delivered by Ma-aya Sakamoto, although the ending theme is a bit on the kitschy side. The sound effects are also very good.  As far as the voice acting goes, the dub of Lodoss has received a mixture of praise and disgust from many fans, but I happen to be one of its biggest fans. The Chronicles dub, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. It does have its assets: Crispin Freeman does a surprisingly fantastic job as Spark (making this potentially monodimensional character more interesting than he is) and Angora Deb is similarly good as Leaf. (I might argue that both make this dub worth watching.) It also reprises much of the cast from the OVA dub; even though their acting standards are lower than that of the OVA (Parn's more mature-sounding voice in particular takes several episodes to find his stride), it's still nice to have continuity. Working against them, however, are the uneven performances by the lesser supporting characters -- several of which border into intolerable territory (Ashram's minions, Governor Rabido, and Prince Reona, in particular, are dreadful), and vocal inconsistencies (some characters receive new voice actors either temporarily -- Lisa Ortiz's Deedlit is annoyingly replaced for at least two episodes by a far duller A.J. Parks -- or permanently -- Garrack's Michael Gerard drops out after five episodes, Crispin Freeman plays him for the remainder of the show). That, in addition to the sometimes awkward-sounding dialogue and hit-and-miss synchronization, rank the overall dub a notch below its superior predecessor. It's by no means the worst around, however, and patient dub fans may find it to have some merit.  In all fairness, the Japanese voice acting isn't all that stellar either. The entire Japanese voice cast from the OVA are replaced; while some voices are less grating than their English equivalents, others are actually sub-par in comparison to some of the better voices on the dub, particularly the seiyuu playing Deedlit, who is nowhere nearly as good as Yumi Tohma or Lisa Ortiz. There are also some parts of the Japanese language track which come across as cheesy, particularly the scenes involving the talking dragons (these scenes come across as very laughable in the English version, and the Japanese track sounds every bit as fake in this part). The common attitude I hear from dub detractors is that the Japanese language track is preferable, regardless of whether it has any weaknesses of its own, but in the case of Chronicles, I have to say that both audio tracks tie in quality. They have their strong points and are, at best, tolerable, but not particularly flawless.  All in all, Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight isn't without its drawbacks and doesn't always live up to its predecessor, but it's still a fine series that holds its own ground decently. For every weak point, there is always an asset to counter it, making this one moderately enjoyable fantasy Anime series.";Recommended
1;Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den;L-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/L-sama;8;"Having watched the original Record of Lodoss War, I went into this title with a little bit of apprehension. Sequels have a notorious reputation for being sub par in comparison to their predecessors. Luckily, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight breaks that stereotype in a fairly big and entertaining way.  For some reason, I could not get into the original Lodoss, try as I may. However, Chronicles had me hooked from episode one, despite the fact that the first batch of episodes are basically a rehashed version of the OVA storyline. Fair warning though; don&rsquo;t get used to seeing Parn and Deedlit in every episode. After the introduction, it&rsquo;s as if the original Lodoss story never happened. A new cast, and a large one at that, is introduced with new enemies and new motives. While it was great to see that the producers took the time to make sure that no one was just another nameless warrior, keeping track of a cast this size proved to be a daunting task. The story to go along with this new group was equally complex, but very intriguing and captivating. That is, until the end of the episode, when super-deformed versions of the characters make a parody of the story just displayed. It was funny at first, but then became just plain annoying and took away from the real storyline.  Probably the brightest star of this series is, arguably, the music. Yoko Kanno, already famous for her work in such titles as Ghost in the Shell: Stand alone Complex and Vision of Escaflowne, whips up a fantastic orchestral score to fit every scene on the screen, making this series pleasing on the ears. The opening and ending themes, Kiseki no Umi and Hikari no Suashi, are a joy to listen to every time they play and are definitely two of my favorite anime themes. The animation sequences to go along with them were stunning. It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame that the series couldn&rsquo;t have the same luster in its animation. By no means am I saying that the animation is bad. I was just a little disappointed at the dip from the opening and ending sequences to the series.  If you liked the original Lodoss, then by all mean, pick up Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. It&rsquo;s just about everything that the OVA was and better. Just skip the last three minutes of each episode and enjoy the ending theme instead.";Recommended
2;Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;7;"Kind of like this one better over the Lodoss War OVA series, biggest reason being the greater amount of character depth and development. The OVA series just breezed by with its plot developments, leaving little time to develop its characters. Here though, many of the characters get fleshing out over their motives and some even grow over the course of the series. Even baddie Ashram gets focus to show that he has honorable reasons for fighting alongside the enemy faction. There are still some characters that were underdeveloped, such as Parn and Deedlit. But the character depth here is of great improvement from the OVA series.  As for the show's plot, it is your standard fantasy adventure series with the first eight episodes having a different take to the Scepter of Domination storyline from the OVAs and having another adventure years later with the knight Spark. I hear this TV anime is supposed to be a more faithful adaptation of its fantasy novel source material, but I don't know enough about the novels to know of how faithful it is. Regardless, the anime goes through the motions of having the audience know of its world, the gods worshiped and the creatures that inhabit it. To a great extent, the series follows the standard plot setups of a fantasy RPG game with our male hero of a knight (Parn for first eight episodes, Spark for rest of series) having a party of differing classes (mage, dwarf, mercenary, thief, etc...) accompany him in a journey to combat the plot of an evil baddie (Wagnard). The greater character depth here gives many of the characters more dimension than what their ""class"" archetype would give, though the fantasy setup occasionally milks cliches in its plot developments that cause the series to drag at points or suffer in quality. This is especially noticeable in the final several episodes of the series that milk enough cliches that you could find used in the final level of an RPG game's storyline. In addition, the series also comes with an SD omake mini-episode at the end of each episode to the show which is quite silly in tone compared to the main series and your mileage will vary on how well you enjoy them (winded up skipping them after a few episodes).  Visually, Lodoss War TV appears to use a more traditional character design style here compared to the OVAs, meaning most characters in the show have the ""big eyed"" and attractive look you can find used in many popular anime titles. The designs are nicely drawn and have a good amount of visual detail to them. Same treatment is given to scenery which have a diverse number of environments drawn thanks to the different locales that the parties of warriors travel through and fight in. The animation for the TV anime isn't much different from the OVA, meaning you can expect frequent use of still shots, speed stripes and other animation shortcuts during heated battle scenes.  The music to the series is perhaps the high point of Lodoss War TV for me. Insert music mostly consisted of orchestral music pieces that give the series an epic feel and Yoko Kanno's composition of the title's opener song, ""Kiseki no Umi"" sung by Maaya Sakamoto, make it among one of the better openers I've listened to from an anime.  Overall while still having its issues from its typical fantasy-adventure mold, Lodoss War TV is still an improvement from the OVA series thanks to its greater character depth and focus on exploring the world of Lodoss. If you have interest in medieval/ fantasy-style adventure titles, this is a decent series worth having a look at.";Recommended

In my own head, I think of it as a sequel.  This anime is a more ""anime"" anime. The characters are more colorful (visually), and although it is good, I don't like the animation quite as much as I did the animation from the OAV.

0;Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den;xcomprr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xcomprr;6;"You could say this TV series ""Chronicles of the Heroic Knight"" picks up after the OVA which rolls back and roughly covers the second half of Ryo Mizuno's light novels. It takes place about after episode 7 of the OVA and follows the party members as they grow up, facing new enemies that threaten Lodoss as well as the aspiring new hero, Spark hence the title. Art's not quite as detailed which is usually the case for longer running TV series but character designs more or less look similar to the OVA. Some of the voices don't sound as well matched.  The show's kind of aimed at a younger audience with its ""Welcome to Lodoss Island"" (horrible) mini shorts which is probably why there's no blood in it and more joking around. I actually found it a sleeper most of the time because it doesn't have the same build-up towards each event like the OVA did and the threats just don't have much impact. Not to mention the silly shorts just ruins the mood afterwards although the show does have an epic ending if you get that far. The only other highlight would probably be the OP ""Kiseki no Umi"" sung by Maaya Sakamoto (Mari from the Evangelion Rebuild movies). It's even better once you've journeyed through the show.  I think overall the character development is lacking. The trials that Spark face don't really have much impact and feel dragged out. It's kind of like once an event's over, that's it for the characters. Then it's a time skip and onto the next event but that's fine I guess considering the story is based on Dungeon & Dragon game sessions.  Personally, I'd go watch the OVA and forget about this series or just enjoy the OP.";Mixed Feelings

0;Lodoss-tou Senki: Eiyuu Kishi Den;AnimeRevelation;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeRevelation;3;When translating something from the written medium to film or animation there can be certain aspects of the story that may be lost in translation. However it is sometimes wise to sacrifice certain things, and to that I will explain further, but first, normally I do not write a review to the series I have watched unless what I watched was so bad that it was worthy of a cautionary summation to future viewers. Now mind you I did not find anything that bad or appalling in this series, but I felt that the viewer ratings didn't reflect the true quality of the series.  So I will begin this by saying that the author wrote this story well out of their normal comfort zone. It is hard to take and tell a tale that is not in relation to your heritage, for instance it is hard for a storyteller who lives in the West, to write a story about things that relate solely to the East, and visa verse. This author however did a very splendid job in doing just that.  But, the story itself is very linear and predicable. Now while this can be a good thing in this case it is not. Since the story itself is so visible it cannot and will not be able to draw the viewer into the storyline. To complicate matters even more, the unnecessary amount of characters actually bogs the storyline down further.  Characters were so numerous that any depth that could have been given wasn't due to the amount of them. The screenwriter chose to add characters in that really were not needed other than to provide a plot vehicle or romantic interest. Less is more, and in that allows for better character development and a chance for the viewer to connect with the characters. Unfortunately this story did not allow for that, and should have sacrificed some characters. For future screenplay writers, not all stories need romance, nor do they need characters who's sole responsibility is to help provide plot line.  Production values were better for this series than the first. The characters were diverse in features to allow a pleasant indulgence in them. For the most part the clothing designs were true to a European style fairy tale, but there were a few Asian influences in them as well. I'm sure that however was the artists trademark and quite acceptable even nice to see.  One of the problems however in production values were the action, or fight scenes. These were very far and few between with most of them being nothing more than SFX and quick color flashes and stills. I would venture to guess that the budget was shoestring and some sacrifices had to be made, I personally just wish they would have made them in the character department and not the action department.  So overall with a huge cast of characters, poor production values in animation, this series has, in my opinion, a higher rating that it deserves. Storyline was weak, art values were high along with sound and styling, this series should actually rate closer to 6.5 than the 7.6 it currently holds. Which again is what triggered this review.  This series would be good for a viewer who is wanting a simple plot and storyline with good art but poor production values.;Not Recommended

It might also not be fair to compare it with the shows that exist today, but I'll do it anyway.  The STORYLINE is good... but it's implementation is concise and lacks details. Watching it felt like 27 episodes weren't really enough to briefly describe the events, character development, which are the MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES with this show.  The CHARACTERS were really immature (especially SPARK), although the quotes they said from time to time were really motivating. The first 8 episodes has PARN as its main character, but after that the mc role is taken by SPARK. I would be fine with any protagonist, but the immature personality of SPARK stopped me from liking him as a character. SPARK didn't develop as a character till the last episode, although we saw many other characters who praised him for things he barely did, sudden romantic development, his desperate decisions...  ASHRAM and PARN matured a lot after episode 8, and they were my favorite characters in this show. DEEDLIT is also adorable when she tries to get attention of PARN. But their screen time just becomes less and less with the consecutive episodes, that it isn't enough to counter the dislike towards SPARK.  The background MUSIC has classic RPG theme, and it's really compatible with the desperate development of the story events. The Op & Ed songs are perhaps the best aspect of this show imo.   OVERALL : The show could have done better if not for its FAST PACING of the events which ruined the show significantly (from a perspective of someone who's watched this two decades later).  As a note, I am thankful for the fact that many 'fantasy' based shows that exists today are refined from this show ; In this sense, Lodoss-tou Senki can be considered as the predecessor of many fantasy shows. BUT as someone watching this two decades later, one may feel this show is far from even the decent ones that exist today. For that very reason, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone.

0;Lodoss-tou Senki;JTurner;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JTurner;10;"Of all the Anime series that I have viewed, Record of Lodoss War holds a special place in my heart. If you happen to be fond of fantasy adventure videogames as I am (or great literature such as J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings), then this 13-episode video series is a very clever hybrid of these two great works of art. It's got everything fans could ask for--dragons, elves, dark gods, unlikely yet compelling heroes, villains you'll either hate (or love, depending on who you side with), action, suspense, romance, a small dose of humor, and an engaging feel to keep on watching by the time each episode ends.  This is a direct-to-video animation series produced back in 1990, which unfolds over thirteen half-hour episodes. Adapted from the fantasy novels of the same name by Japanese author Ryo Mizuno, Lodoss is a classic good-vs-evil story, exploring the chronicles of six adventurers: these include Parn, a young, inexperienced warrior eager to (literally) jump at any chance to clear his father's tarnished name; Deedlit, a spunky, mystical high elf who tries (with varying degrees of success) to prove her love to Parn; Etoh, a loyal, good-natured cleric; Slayn, a gentle wise mage; Ghim, a gruff and tough dwarf; and Woodchuck, a wanted criminal who nonetheless provides loyalty (and occasional chagrin) to his pals.  The story is hardly original, and the plot tends to &quot;jumps around&quot; from one event to the next (for instance, the first episode starts off in the &quot;middle&quot; of the heroes' quest; chronologically, it'd be best to see eps 2-5, 1, and then 6-13)--yet the overall show is so engrossing that this fault (in addition to a few others I'll come to in a moment) becomes irrelevant.  It's the characters which make Record Of Lodoss War so much fun, and much of the best scenes belong to Parn and Deedlit; especially in a royal banquet episode where she forces Parn to dance with her (one of my favorite sequences from the show). As is typical of a elf-dwarf rivalry, Ghim and Deed bicker about each other's differences yet maintain a somewhat begrudging level of self-respect. It's Parn, however, whose plight stays with you long after the show approaches its climax. Eager to discover whether his father died in disgrace or not, he finds a father figure in Kashue. (This gets on Deedlit's nerves; she continually competes with the king for Parn's attention--a running gag that plays out unfortunately for only a couple of episodes.) In the latter episodes, we meet two new characters who don't get much screen time but are no less fully realized. Shiris, the hotheaded young mercenary who vies with Deedlit for Parn's affections is strongly depicted, as is her partner (and secret love), Orson, the moody Berserker, who becomes an angry, uncontrollable monster at the sight of Shiris in trouble.  Even the bad guys are richly developed. Ashram, as mentioned, isn't driven so much by malice as he is by what he believes is right; in fact, he becomes the most three-dimensional of the villains for that reason alone. For support, he has a Dark Elf accomplice named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who'll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself. Karla, incidentally, is no ordinary villainess. Her primary goal is to bring to Lodoss the balance she feels has been so greatly disturbed... yet her psychologically unbalanced persona leads her to cause far worse chaos with deadly consequences. She is shifty, cunning, manipulative -- an almost deadly combination. Wagnard, on the other hand, is just plain evil -- every bit the equivalent of Kefka from Final Fantasy III who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action. When we first meet him, he appears to be a nondescript character, but when he becomes possessed by Kardis, he becomes frighteningly villainous. (Every scene he's in sends shivers down my spines.)  Its the strength of the characters and their chemistry as well as the compelling (if jumpy) plot that make Lodoss as a whole that one can overlook its occasional shortcomings, notably the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count resulting with some stiff movements. Taking into account that this is an older show, however, this doesn't really detract all that much (although there are some later episodes where some of the same footage is reused, for cost cutting purposes).  No fantasy adventure would be complete without a stirring soundtrack, and Record of Lodoss War delivers this in style. The musical score by Mitsuo Hagita is mostly symphonic, although it is (obviously) generated by electronics. Yet the compositions were so rich and lovely that they eventually grew on me over the course of the show. Equally lovely are the opening and ending theme songs, &quot;Adesso e Fortuna -Now &amp; Fortune-&quot; and &quot;Fantasia of the Wind&quot;, both of which are excellently sung in Japanese by Sherry. As a nice bonus, these songs were even translated for the English version; the woman who sings the dubbed songs, Lisa DeSimone, sings with an equally splendid voice.  One aspect of Lodoss often criticized is the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media in 1996, a time when most dubs had a low reputation. I've read all kinds of mixed opinions about this English track; some say its fake and/or mediocre while other claims its unbearable, but here's a better review from one of its several (albeit outspoken on the net at least) enthusiastic fans (that's me). No, it's not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voice-overs are really good. In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla &amp; Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites. Plus, the dialog is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: &quot;Quick, Deed, what's this dragon's weak spot?&quot; Deedlit: &quot;I'm not a dragon expert! How should I know?!&quot;) and great chemistry between the actors. I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things. Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this &quot;inferior&quot; to the Japanese language track. I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently. Of course, it may be in danger of being overshadowed by some of the better dub productions of today, but for a dub made in 1996, its a rather decent, if unspectacular listen. I'm still fond of it, as a matter of fact, even after hearing some better ones.  Record of Lodoss War has received its share of detractors over recent years, probably due to its cheap production values and/or inconsistent plotting. However, it is important to remember that these &quot;shortcomings&quot; is mainly because it's an older Anime series. While Lodoss may show its age in places, its infectious appeal and complexity rings true even after other shows of its ilk, and like most classics, it can stand against the test of time.";Recommended
1;Lodoss-tou Senki;WiikendWarrior84;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WiikendWarrior84;7;Story:  Overall though this was a good OVA. However, the Story is very scattered and doesn't have proper closure. The completest in me tells me I have to at least see the TV series that follows. I haven't had any luck finding it, however. This anime has a special place in my heart due to the nostalgia factor. I only hope that the TV series that follows this up somehow gives better closure. And one minor gripe, I think all of us understood the backstory of Lodoss by the 3rd episode so it really wasn't nessesary to retell it prior to every episode.  Art: It's very good looking for an older piece, however it's not so old as to forgive some of the shortcuts and mistakes that are noticable.  Sound: I love good sound. This doesn't really diliver however. IMHO there's no excuse for 2.0 now that dvd has been on the market so long. other wise it's got repetative music that you'll never forget. But that doens't make it good. Sigh...  Character: All of the characters have some sort of charisma to them. Parn and Deedlit are still one of the most recognized anime couples of all time. I just wish there was more down to earth characters like Woodchuck.  Enjoyment:  I really do like this anime alot. It's more nostalgia than anything but I do like it. I recommend this Anime to fans of Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons or other swords and sorcery stories.  Overall:  Fanboy opinions and nostalgia aside you should...  Borrow it!

3;Lodoss-tou Senki;Shura-shurato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shura-shurato;9;First of all, i can slap myself for not watching or seeing it as an kid, though i noticed it decades ago the collection in the VHS store´s, but i had no idea about it until recently and its MAGICAL. This ova serie´s that i think a side or continuation of the t.v serie´s ( 1990) that was a cornerstone for fantasy anime till this day with exception of Y´S ( 1989). But there is a catch if u watch it for the 1st time ever, and its that u have to watch the epidose´s in the right order, start with episode 2,3,4,5 after that watch the 1st episode , than # 6 till 13 in order wich i never was able to solve why they did it. Storywise it was definetly a epic fantasy , dark and well put together with the whole package, dragons, Knights, spells, ancient kingdoms, sort of a ´fellowship´, princesses, trolls, treasures ect. ect. and ofc could be very violent at parts. As for the animation , in my eyes it was almost flawless for its time, very low background animation fails, charachters and villians design was quite well done and had the right outfits, but what i love the most are the DRAGONS!!!!!!! for 1990 it looked tight and well animated , fluend movements and drawn to look terrifying, we don´t see it like that anymore , sad. FANTASY OPERA as i call this,and i not mean only the intro but througout the ova serie´s has numerous moments with opera music blended in nicely, to me the intro alone i played it repeatedly in my head, rememberable. Most of the charachters had a good relationship , likable and not the sort to be forgotten easely, especially if u are an anime fantasy fan, only the main protagonist has still some of that oldskool hotheaded type like that rushed in fights without thinking , those kind of chara popped out everywhere in the late 80´s and 90´s, a bit tasteless, but does have a good turnaround later on. Elves are some of the main basis as charachters and storywise, if ur talk about fantasy ofc, and they have a great role in lodoss.It was more than entertaining, it was a very colorful and memorable experience to me that finally i watched lodoss war, till i gonna get the full t.v serie´s, too bad i never saw it aired because it somethinf like Record of lodoss war could fill up lots of today´s fantasy anime that has rushed or weak substance!;Recommended
4;Lodoss-tou Senki;Iron_Leopard;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Iron_Leopard;8;I'll go ahead and get the inevitable comparison out of the way. Record of Lodoss War is The Lord of the Rings of anime. Maybe not as highly regarded as Tolkiens fantasy trilogy but still a spectacular addition to the genre.  One of the very first OVAs I was introduced to back in the late 90s ROLW was everything I'd ever wanted out of american animation but never recieved. A dark and serious fantasy adventure that touched on all the familar qualites that the genre is known for. Knights, Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, Wizards, and epic bloody battles. This was a show strictly made for Fantasy fans.  The story is pretty straight forward with a few twists and surprises here and there but it's mostly the world is in peril from a great evil and our band of heroes must set out to defeat this evil and save the peoples of Lodoss. It's simple but satisfying. Theres great characters throughout the entire series and just when you think theres no one else to introduce we get treated to probably my two favorite characters Shiris and Orson. A couple of bandits that join up with our heroes around the midway point that gives the show a breath of fresh air after the few dark eps leading up to their introduction.  Last thing I want to touch on is the animation. Now remember this is 1990. So its not going to be nearly as pretty as what your use to watching these days. But theres a certain charm to its dark and dirty old school style approach that makes me apprechiate it even more today then I did back then. It's a great product of an art style long gone.  Record of Lodoss War. Fantasy fans shoud love it. Casuals should apprechiate it. Whichever catergory you fall under one things for sure. You should respect it.;Recommended

6;Lodoss-tou Senki;TevishSzat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TevishSzat;7;"Once, a young man toured the empty, echoing halls of an ancient dungeon, a place abandoned by time and now slowly, painfully grinding towards a final collapse named ""Blockbuster Video"". A few petty coins were left behind for his prize, a priceless treasure known as ""Record of Lodoss War""...  OK, enough of that, you want to see a review of the 13-episode OVA series Record of Lodoss War. So, right off the bat, here's my objective opinion: This is a flawed, often deeply-flawed series, but one that has a lot of high points to go along with its flaws. Personal opinion, though? I love this series. I love this series because its creators clearly loved it, and that shows.  So let's talk about those flaws. The story is strong, but the pace of the story is fairly uneven, taking its sweet time here and there while rushing (or even skipping) ahead at other parts. In fact, 'uneven' could probably be the big criticism of Record of Lodoss War as a whole, since it can, thanks in part to those pacing issues, be applied to the problems with the characters as well, since we're missing or at least have poorly emphasized elements of their development and arc.  The animation is another thing, and part of where I'd like to point out being able to see a creator's love for something: The images are all gorgeous. Look at just about any still from the show and chances are you'll be able to like what you see. Now, I don't actually know the production history of Record of Lodoss War, but later on, when you just know the budget was running dry and corners had to be cut they just use... less of it, relying on slow pans over their scenes and very limited movement. It never looks worse, just less animated. The ""Budget is out, have to cut corners"" ending situation is hardly unique to Lodoss, but unlike other examples the creators of Record of Lodoss War knew where they could cut those corners and where they absolutely could not cut them in order to still tell the story they wanted to tell and transport the viewer to this fantastical world. Again, trying to think of it objectively I have to mark the show down for what it did there, but I think they found the best solution they could to their problem that it seems clear from the final product that they faced.  For all its problems, Record of Lodoss War has a very timeless quality to it, a trait it tends to share with the best of the best in fantasy if not in media in general. It's very earnest. It feels natural. It feels, I dare say, real. Or perhaps more than real it feels like an actual legend. In this day and age when so many works pillage their predecessors all the way back to the myths and legends of the world and end up feeling hollow or artificial it's somewhat astounding to see something, much less something with the fairly shallow roots of Record of Lodoss War (which clearly owes much to the 1974 genre-shaper Dungeons & Dragons) that feels like it could stand up alongside them.  Part of that is because, I personally feel, that the people involved clearly wanted to tell this story and tell it well. Another part I realize now might actually be the very flaws of the piece helping to propel it forward. Few indeed are the myths and legends that are complete and self contained, so when Record of Lodoss War frays at the edges but manages to do so in a graceful manner it ends up invoking not dissatisfaction with what was missing, skipped, accelerated through, or seemingly riddled with plot holes or continuity errors, but rather it evokes the sense of those old tales that are generally told and retold through many sources, leaving them misty-edged glimpses of a tapestry that can never be beheld in a full and finished state. Whether by design or by accident, it seems possible to me that the elements that make Record of Lodoss War technically weaker may be, in some ways, actually enhancing the emotional experience.  And in the end, that's what Lodoss best delivers: an experience. If you're going to come in to this like a health inspector setting foot in the kitchen of some old, beloved diner you're going to find problems here and there and you certainly won't enjoy yourself as would the patron soaking in the warm hues of the yellowed wallpaper and rich bread-and-grease aroma of the patty melt brunch on its way to them. To an extent, that's true of any work of media. Someone watching something as a critic can't be forced to get invested if they're too busy thinking and analyzing to feel. But it's especially true for works like Record of Lodoss War that play more strongly to the viewer's emotions, rather than a mystery or think-piece that goes primarily for the intellect.";Recommended
7;Lodoss-tou Senki;MKSTEEL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MKSTEEL;10;A fantastic piece of fantasy anime that feels like it brings alive the lore of Dungeons & Dragons in the medium of Japanese Animation. I really liked the heroes who were all well-drawn personalities despite their fantasy archetypes and the villains were well imagined as well with several morally 'grey' entities inhabiting the moral ground between the armies of Darkness and Light struggling for Lodoss such as the Grey Witch Karla and wildcard Dragons. With even secondary characters like the Good King Fahn and the Dark Emperor Beld receiving some impressive development the series has a sense of history and worldbuilding that helps create an impressive series, despite some of the limited animation that plagues some of the larger set-piece moments in the OVA series.;Recommended
8;Lodoss-tou Senki;earl_of_sandvich;https://myanimelist.net/profile/earl_of_sandvich;10;"Record of Lodoss War was recommended by a classmate back in university, during a time when VHS was still a thing. Anime releases in North America back then were generally abysmal, favoring titillating shows or big productions over diamonds in the rough, and you usually were stuck with shows with low-budget dubbing, replacing passable or overacted Japanese acting with terrible acting by unknown actors or extras furiously trying to stay in sync with the animation.  When I watched this in the university dorm (complete with so-so fan subtitles), I couldn't wait for the next episode. And the next. Great shows always leave you wanting more (terrible shows leave you demanding a refund), and Lodoss War is probably the anime that, to me, sets the bar for quality.  So, yes, the animation is dated. Well, think about the computers that were available in 1988-89. Apple IIs, greyscale Macs, an Amiga if you cared about graphic quality. None of these were used in the animation business at the time (that I know of, anyway-- graphical processing power just wasn't up to snuff). Anime was hand-drawn on cels, every single frame, 24 frames per second. Sometimes they will loop an animation and zoom out the camera to save a few yen, but that kind of shortcut breaks the illusion easily and was used sparingly. If the director or anyone in charge of production calls for a retake of a scene, it had to be redrawn, completely. If the colors were off, you didn't have color correction, you had to redraw it. Don't believe me? Watch Shirobako. They're not kidding when they say animation was extremely hard work in these days. Just as Steamboat Willie was state-of-the-art in its day, so was the animation in Lodoss War, and doubly so because OVAs allow a good production staff to take its time to make sure everything was right, unlike the mad dash of a weekly television series. Sure, showing the glint of the blade tip rather than the full animated swing is a shortcut, but it is undeniably effective (and no anime since has used this nearly as effectively). The animation staff knew exactly how to employ the imagination of the audience and draw them in. I'm sorry to say, this is a lost art today largely because animators now have the tools to show us all the gory details, overload our senses, and leave plot and characterization in the dust.  The soundtrack. Oh, yes, the soundtrack. The score's soaring battle themes evoke Carl Orff's Carmina Burana (which is fitting, because that was the soundtrack of the film Excalibur). The composer, while he's no Yoko Kanno (let alone Howard Shore, James Horner, or John Williams), nevertheless demonstrates his mastery of every section of the orchestra, from tracks that would probably evoke zombie apocalypses, to tracks that Vivaldi could've written for a royal court, to tracks that could be the backdrop of Eomer's counterattack in The Two Towers. I usually don't remember anime soundtracks because they're totally unimpressive (or I remember them because they're terrible)-- I cannot say that about the soundtrack to Lodoss War.  Adesso e Fortuna is the only anime song with a tango beat that I can remember (it's a slow tango-- listen to the bass line and the harp), and while romance isn't a particularly important part of the show until the final 3 episodes or so, it turns out to be a great match. The ending theme is good as well, but I never really got into it nearly as much.  The voice acting is very well cast, written, directed, and performed. How do I know this? As another reviewer mentioned, there is chemistry. In the behind-the-scenes to Star Wars, we see that one reason why George Lucas cast (a very young and terrified) Carrie Fisher wasn't because of her Hollywood star parents, but because of her chemistry with Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. If you want to see why casting matters, look at early deleted scenes of Star Trek: Voyager with a very different Captain Janeway. Poor casting (especially political casting) is never a benefit to a production, and thankfully here all the voices fit like gloves.  Now, sure, it seems like an anime cliche-- fantasy theme, RPG party of a fighter, a mage, a healer, a dwarf, a thief, and an elf, now go and fight {dragon|evil warlord|wizard}. But you need to understand that you are watching the series that in my opinion set the standard for this genre. In fact, it probably did its job too well-- nearly every fantasy anime I've seen since was either a cliched copy of this party, or a parody (intentional, in the case of Slayers, or otherwise, in the case of follow-up productions). Without a good script, the characters can't grow. Without good direction, the audience won't care about the characters. Here, the characters have depth, they don't remain who they are in the beginning, and they all have journeys, for good or ill. Good casting, great script, good direction.  Part of me wishes that there are more episodes, and part of me dreads what happens when there isn't enough plot to go around. The pace is just right to me, and other than an introductory episode, there isn't much of ""jumping around"" to my recollection (which means I should rewatch the DVD). The story does meander a bit, and despite all the stuff happening, the show never loses its focus on the main cast. For all the liberties taken with the original RPG/novels, this is the best adaptation to animation, hands down.  Am I biased in thinking this is the bar for all fantasy anime? Damn straight I am, and proud of it too.";Recommended
9;Lodoss-tou Senki;GreenEmu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GreenEmu;9;"The age of this series shows, but the OVAs still hold up today as a classic high fantasy anime. The story itself isn't anything special and plays out like a D&D campaign, and the characters are pretty much ripped out of a D&D session as well. But that's the charm of it, It's just a straightforward high fantasy story. I'll also admit the influx of the ""Isekai"" genre has influenced my review as the most generic fantasy plots are masterpieces compared to that garbage.  Animation and sound wise it still holds up fairly well for something it's age, and the first episode in particular had animation that puts some series today to shame in comparison. Story wise as I said before, it's pretty much a D&D campaign in animated format. Your enjoyment of it hinges on whether you like those kinds of plots, I did so I liked it. The characters are all pretty generic, but that's what makes them endearing. They aren't some ridiculous over the top anime trope like a lot of ""fantasy"" anime does these days. Parn the main character isn't a Japanese teenager who got killed by a truck and sent to this fantasy world where he's given a ridiculous OP power that's considered weak. He's just the son of a knight who starts off as a complete greenhorn, and by the end you see his progression both in his combat skills and his personality.  All in all, it's a classic series that I'd recommend anybody who loves Fantasy or those who are tired of the bland self insert Isekai genre to check out.";Recommended

I like the theme of light/dark and balance. The characters are interesting, though not very complex. The art is really good. It has more detail than a lot of anime. And the music is really beautiful as well. I really wish there were more anime like this one out there, because in my opinion, it truly is a masterpiece.  If you have the choice, watch it subtitled. The dubbed version is pretty bad. I don't notice it much due to nostalgia, but when I pay attention to it, the dubbed version is noticeably bad in comparison.

11;Lodoss-tou Senki;Recynon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Recynon;7;"Record of Lodoss War is a basic high fantasy story that is carried by its gorgeous art, outstanding designs, and wonderful music.  There's not much to say about the stories, characters, and themes. Your average RPG starter character Parn gets together with a group of RPG archetypes to go on a quest to stop a war orchestrated by some dark deity. The characters in the group are fine; they're not given much exploration, development, or backstory but they're each competent at what they do and their dialogue and interactions are fine. Deedlit falls into that category as well--- despite having an awesome character design that suggests she would play a bigger role, she's just there to be the chick to Parn.  The story opts to focus on fledgling hero Parn, who of course talks a lot about saving people and rushes into battle but doesn't have any of the fighting skill to back it up. He's pretty much a noob who tries to be a hero up until the very last episodes and it gets tiresome to watch him get bailed out by the other, much more competent characters in the group. The emphasis on Parn over the more capable and potentially more interesting members of the group severely hurts the story.  Speaking of the story, the group also just doesn't do much in general; for the first 8 episodes or so they simply travel from place to place. There's nothing egregious about the plot (except for one thing), but it would have had some life if the battles that they fought were actually well animated. I understand it was 1990 and their budget was limited, but still the slowness and reliance on still frames for the action sequences limits their entertainment value. That's not to say the art is bad, though. The backgrounds and characters are beautifully drawn and really convey that classic fantasy setting.  I was OK with the plot until they damseled Deedlit so that Parn could finally man up and save her. Not only did they damsel her, they also seemed to use this as an opportunity to sexualize her. This is a cardinal sin in my book- they took a character with a strong design and objectified her. When Parn saves her, they act like he's a big hero who's gone through a lot of development, but in reality he didn't learn much and his sword skills made an inexplicable jump from noob to master.  Anyway, enough about the plot and characters. Let's talk about the art and design. Like I said, the art is gorgeous. The designs are some of the best I've seen in anime and in fantasy in general. Parn's suit is a great knight design and Deedlit's outfit, with its broad shoulder pads, is powerful and elegant. The face designs are among my favorite in anime. Each character's face is unique and handsomely constructed, achieving a perfect blend of anime beauty and realism. The male faces are actually handsome and not pretty in the feminine way that anime designs usually do it. Parn's eyes, in particular, do a lot to soften my dislike of him. The second series blindly discarded these face designs in favor of more generic ones.  The music has an otherworldly beauty that capture the finest feelings of the fantasy genre, doing the job that the story and characters couldn't. The opening and ending songs feel like they embody the quintessential fantasy adventure aesthetic.  The design and music alone make the series worth checking out, but don't expect too much from the actual story.";Recommended

I just loved how it was basically an RPG come to life, tell me an epic story any day of the week!!! From start to finish character development/progression is prevalent in ALL characters, not just the main. even the villains have motivations for their actions. I honestly wish it was longer but even for 13 episodes it felt like an 'epic' tale without sacrificing the pacing at all.  Depending on the time frame you pick this up, you may be off-put by the art style but for the early '90s this was gold, pure animated goodness!!! though its been a while between this review and my actual watching of the show i can't recall the musical score being anything but appropriate. bass drops occurred in time with the action beats, not a whole lot of 'BIG EXPLOSION' moments but the fight choreography was impressive and well thought out between knights crossing swords with wizards chanting spells from the rear to assist everyone was in place where you would expect them to be and if they weren't... then things most likely didn't go well for the side that slipped up.

Now the forces of darkness brews once again as the dark ruthless armies of Marmo begins to invade and threaten the inhabitants of the island. After his village is attacked by a a horde of strangely behaving goblins, the badly untrained and rash Parn is sent out to investigate the source of the darkness. Joining him is an unruly party of six each journeying for their own reasons - his priest-in-training and friend Etoh who chose to accompany him, Ghim the dwarf in search of his daughter, Slayn the self-taught mage who sees potential in Parn, Deedlit the curious High Elf and Woodchuck a thief they rescued during a raid. Soon they discover there are much greater forces at play.  This show is based on Ryo Mizuno's 7 volume novel series which are actually a novelisation of recorded Dungeon & Dragon gameplay sessions. Think RPGs with pen and paper without any electronics, just dices to determine what happens. As such, the setup is very RPG-like with your party member of humans, elves in their familar classes such as mage, warrior etc. It's very much your classic Western fantasy world setting filled with legends and the simple plot of a party setting out to adventure to vanquish the evil that leaves a trail of ruin wherever it goes. Complete with the evil laughs too.  Art is good and suits its fantasy setting. I think the character designs are beautifully done and aren't done as fan service heavy like most shows these days. You do notice the repeated animations used during battles and how short duel scenes are but, with the amount of work involved in doing cel animation you'd probably give them some slack for it. You can also see the lack of animation sometimes such as when a troupe of knights are moving like a cardboard stand. The emotional ""twinkly eye"" animations feel overdone and overly used and, there's a bit too much flashing of scenes sometimes. There's lots of blood but little gore.  You could say the 13 episode OVA is roughly based on the first half of the novels but has its original ending as the novels were still ongoing at the time.

15;Lodoss-tou Senki;Pink_Noodle_Hair;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pink_Noodle_Hair;7;"Story - The main story itself is not half bad for a fantasy themed anime. Some things are a bit unclear that I don't think I missed yet go unexplained. The whole thing feels like a small part of a the novels it was adapted from. That said, you can follow along with what's happening for the most part so it could be worse. It's no Lord of the Rings but the story was absolutely fine for it's genre.  Art - The art for me is really great, I'm a sucker for the genre and this classic style. However, Deedlit and Pirotess' ears really shot out a bit too far. I guess they really wanted you to know they were elves. Just a small quirk of what otherwise is a pretty beautiful style, but may come off as ""boringly realistic"" to people who don't like that stuff. I however, loved it.  Sound - So this is a real mixed bag. The quality ranges from poor to good. The sound effects are mostly actually quite good and never feel too stock. The music is also extremely hit or miss, and it's less about the writing of the music and more about the quality and whatever weird synth they used to make said music that sounds extremely fake for what's supposed to be a beautiful orchestral score. I think if it had a bigger budget this could have been ironed out. As it stands it's only ever distractedly bad a couple times and I'll forgive it.  Character - I wish characters got fleshed out more, but the couple that did were pretty good. Parn is a decent MC if not a bit plain. Ashram was really cool as well as King Kashue. I wish they had more time to expand on the campaign characters as they feel largely glossed over and probably the anime was made for people who already knew the characters from the novel series. It doesn't make the story hard to follow but it just leaves me wanting in the character development department.  Enjoyment - I actually quite liked this a lot. Some episodes are far better than others, sometimes the animation and budget really plummets and it gets unevenly cheap looking. However, I could see myself watching it again in the future. Easily one of the better series I've seen lately. It left me a bit frustrated that it didn't have more episodes to expand on things or a bigger budget to really make the good ideas look better in execution. They did well with what they had I think.  Overall - If you like that type of old school Swords and Sorcery through the lens of Japanese people you can hardly do better than Record of Lodoss War. It fulfills it's niche and if you don't fall into this western fantasy sort of fandom you may find it to be a dull or average watch.";Recommended

17;Lodoss-tou Senki;barsoapguy219;https://myanimelist.net/profile/barsoapguy219;8;Simple. Straightforward. Quality. For what it was and when it was, it knocked it out of the park. Put on your nostalgia goggles for this one, folks.  Story Dungeons and Dragons as an anime. All the classic stuff. Fighter, elf, dwarf, mage, cleric. They level up and fight stuff. Good vs. evil. There is a mirror evil team too.  I believe that the story was a transcription of a D&D campaign so all the standard plot events were here. Gobins attacked our fighter's home village. He started adventuring, met allies, ran into enemies, and inserted himself in the middle of war between good and evil.  Nothing is new about this now. But I imagine it was groundbreaking material back then. It was for me when I first saw it.  The real story took place in the first 7 or 8 episodes. The stuff that happened after seemed like an after thought. It was stakes and the conflict was resolved halfway through the season. Apparently, it was because the producers were adapting books couldn't find a good way to spread out the story over 13 episodes.  In any case, the story is average at this point but really good in 1990 or if it is your first foray into the D&D world.  Characters The characters were straightforward. Lodoss was actually my first dive into D&D. I liked fantasy things before then but never got the real D&D experience. As tropey as they were, they were new and fresh to me.  Parn was our guy. He started as a low-level warrior and took his lumps as he leveled up. He made up for his lack of skill with his conviction to duty and honor. I found it refreshing that he got his ass kicked by just about everyone. He was a budding swordm and had to earn every inch of ground he got. In the first few episodes, he could barely hold his own against basic goblins and guards. He was the shonen protag.  Deedlit is our gal. Waifu S-tier for sure. She just kind of showed up and fell in love with our guy. It was shallow, but how else were the producers going to maximize her screentime? I like that she acted like an elf. In the prologue, she haughty and a little childish, was at odds with the dwarf, and got distracted by random bling. She was madly in love with Parn for some reason. It seemed random, but I rolled with it just because it made for a good story. She was our original anime elf girl.  The other members of the crew are basic but solid. My only gripe was that Etoh, the cleric, didn't really get to do anything cool until the last or second to last episode. And I thought he was a girl for most of the show.  There was a mirror evil team too. Pretty cool group.  Art The art was pretty good for the most part. The character designs were solid. The action was not good.  The art seemed to focus on the faces. It's been a while since I watched it, but I remember the director zooming in on faces for dramatic reactions. The magic was cool. But the fighting was not well animated. The fighting used a lot of streaks of color and reused footage instead of showing the characters in motion. I remember hearing that it could have been a measure to conserve the budget. Who knows.  The character designs were cool. I remember giant shoulder pads. Maybe this is where Warcraft got its inspiration.  Deedlit is the character you're going to remember.  Sound The voice acting was good. Everybody sounded like they should. I wasn't sure if Etoh was a guy or a girl for most of it.  The sound effects were okay. Nothing great but it was a professional production.  I love the opening theme and visuals. It captured the epic fantasy romance feel perfectly. The OP is one of the best parts of the show.  The ending theme was decent. Surprisingly, it was more upbeat than the OP. It was not as epic, sweet, or catchy as the OP but still got the fantasy vibe right. Decent song.  Enjoyment Lodoss was one of the first animes I saw. It was my introduction into the D&D world and high fantasy in general. I had a great time with it.  That said, there were shortcomings. The first episode is the best one out of the lot.  The prologue is awesome. I love creation myths and we are given one that was animated as paintings on a ruined dome. Badass. This is where most of the animation budget probably went.  We're thrown into the middle of the story. Our adventurers are going through a dwarven tunnel to consult the great sage. The sage and a witch decide to toy with our heroes and throw some challenges their way. Our guys show off their character attributes it's cool.  The episode ends with a confrontation with a minor dragon. Our characters do their character stuff complete with tension between the elf and the dwarf. It's cool as hell.  But then after the first episode, things never get quite as good. The action isn't as good, the spells don't hit as hard, and the characters don't have their stereotypical moments. I mean, the rest of the show is still decent, but not as awesome as it could have been. They started on a high note but weren't able to keep it up with the art, action, or storytelling.  Another thing is that the MC is underpowered for most of the show. It's a stark contrast to the OP MCs of modern isekais. I haven't seen too many isekais, but I'll say that being OP takes the piss right out of the story. If our guy is effortless, then what's it really all about? There's no tension. We are confident in our guy prevailing so I don't worry. I don't get invested. I like underpowered MCs because it makes the W feel earned.  Parn got his ass kicked so much through the story. Toward the end, when he was finally making his way through the final castle, he was taking down normal baddies left and right and it felt good. This was ROTJ Luke Skywalker handling shit. He was always headstrong but now he had the skills to back it up. He wasn't the same little boy no more. I loved the growth.  Overall It shows its age now, but Lodoss was awesome when I saw it.  I loved the underpowered MC who grew up, the OP, and that Deedlit is bae.;Recommended
18;Lodoss-tou Senki;jsc315;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jsc315;9;When I first watched this series back in 2005 I never cared to much for it. It was enjoyable but never really could get into it. Now in 2021 having this on Blu-ray being able to see there stunning art as it was meant to be helped a lot.  This time around I was far more invested in the story even though it kind of falls flat at the end and feels a bit rushed. The characters are really what sell this show. The first few episodes are a bit slow and honestly felt like just another fantasy story, but those episodes really help with the character development and get you invested in them, because by the end of this OVA at least there are things that happen that really make you appreciate those earlier episodes.  Overall I had an absolute blast with this series. It's far from perfect, but for what it is trying to do it's a lot of fun in you are into D&D type fantasy. The animation is stunning and has a rather unique look to it.;Recommended
0;Lodoss-tou Senki;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;5;"Overview:  Record of the Lodoss War was a HUGE hit when it came out in 1990 Japan. It also gained strong popularity among the tiny US anime fandom of the early 90s. Unfortunately, this anime has not aged gracefully. Normally I hate using the phrase ""aged poorly"". It's something that young punks use too often to just shit on anything over 10 years old. In this one instance though, I'm afraid it's kind of unavoidable.  Background:  Record of the Lodoss War was a 1990 OVA based on a Japanese short novel... based an a Japanese tabletop RPG...which was a ripoff of Dungeons and Dragons. Take the most cliche Western high fantasy tropes and they are ALL here in Lodoss War, distilled down to their most basic. The characters go well beyond archetypes and into the realm of laughably generic. The plot was already just a standard D&D campaign in the novel, but the 10 episode OVA had to cut out a LOT of the novel. If Wheel of Time is like bare bones high fantasy, this OVA is like sucking the marrow from those bones.  Popularity:  As I mentioned previously, this OVA was a smash hit and spawned a ton of video games, radio dramas, manga, and a 27 episode sequel! So HOW did it get so popular?! To understand this, we have to go back to the year 1990 and look at it from that perspective. Ring the bell sucka! School's in session!  Just as it used to take a few years for a Japanese fad to spread to America, it took a little bit for American trends to spread to Japan. In the early 90s, Japan was heavily influenced by American culture of the 1980s. High fantasy was HUGE in the 1980s. The utterly mediocre Wheel of Time books were dominating the best seller lists in America. WOT gained such popularity in the Southern US that Atlanta created Dragon Con as a WOT convention. To this day it is the largest geek convention in the Southeast US! Dungeons and Dragons was an absolute cultural phenomenon. He-Man was the most popular toy in the US. You couldn't go anywhere without running into Tolkien inspired high fantasy with elves, dwarves, orcs, and all the rest. There were plenty of high fantasy based video games in Japan by 1990, but not really any high fantasy anime or manga at the time to meet this demand. Record of the Lodoss War was created to fill a hole that NEEDED filling back in that time. Today, there really isn't the same thirst for Tolkien style high fantasy and there are already 100 fantasy anime better than Lodoss War. Keep in mind that Japanese gamers LOVED Hydlide when it hit home PCs back in 1984. Today...there isn't much of a Hydlide fandom. Lodoss isn't THAT bad, but at times it feels close.  There is one other reason that Lodoss sold like hotcakes back in its day. Deedlit the Elf chick and her sex appeal. Deedlit was in many ways the first true ""waifu"" in anime. Before this you really didn't see lonely virgins collecting TONS of figurines and body pillows of their favorite anime girls. You've probably heard lots of people online waxing nostalgic for the anime heroes of the 80s. They all had chiseled muscles, hard jaws, broad shoulders, and looked MANLY! When have you heard people talk about how they want female designs from 80s anime back? That's right. You haven't. Look at the top 300 waifus on MAL. You'll see Yoko Littner, Senjougahara, Rei and Asuka, Lucy Heartfilia, Nami, Erza, Hinata, etc. NONE of these were around in 1990. Even Android 18 and Major Kusanagi weren't around yet. The only rivals Deedlit had were Lunch from Dragonball and Cutie Honey from the 1970s!  Story:  A young swordsman with no parents must team up with an elvish archer, an axe wielding dwarf named Gim, a Wizard, and a thief to go on a long journey and thwart an evil God. Did I mention this series has little imagination of its own? The only creative thing to come out of this series was an evil sword called ""Soul Crusher"" that took possession of its owner and had a giant eye in hilt. The game Soul Calibur BLATANTLY stole this from Lodoss War. I mentioned this before, but the novel had to be very abridged. In one episode, our heroes decide they need to go meet an old wizard and learn the weakness of an evil sorceress named Karla the Grey. In the next episode, it just announces that they have returned from seeing the wizard and learned all about her. Lodoss has a firm policy of ""Tell, don't show.""  Characters:  The characters once again are SO generic that I can't really say much about them. Instead I'll focus on Deedlit, who is the only character ANYONE remembers from this series. She was drawn with long blonde hair, massive bouncy breasts, and very soft facial features. Deedlit was being drawn by a young Satoshi Urushihara, the KING of breasts! That's all I need to say. She IMMEDIATELY falls in love with the young swordsman right after meeting him and plays his sexy sidekick. She doesn't really have any chemistry with our leading hero Parn, but her looks still win her ""best girl of 1990"". Fuck Bulma! She was still being a total bitch on Namek at this point.  Art:  The art by Studio Madhouse is decent for the most part, but this wasn't Madhouse's top performance here. In the 80s and early 90s, Madhouse was at its best with feature films like Wicked City or Ninja Scroll. It could also do 3 episode OVAs like Cyber City ""God Damn Vampire"" Oedo, which looks WAY better than Lodoss. With a 10 episode OVA, the budget got so strained that we end up with a still image of a dragon getting dragged across the screen in a moment of unintentional hilarity.  Music:  The soundtrack is pretty damn limited and plays the same tracks over and over. The closing theme is awesome though and contains the line ""please fall asleep on my breasts.""  Overall:  Lodoss is not an anime that's going to knock the socks off new anime viewers in 2018. Still, if you are interested in anime history and want to see a neat time capsule of the year 1990, it is worth checking out. Just go into it knowing what to expect and put on your archaeologist hat.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lodoss-tou Senki;themegamancave;https://myanimelist.net/profile/themegamancave;5;Knights, clerics, elves, dwarves and dragons occupy some of our biggest inner-nerd imaginations. Some of my fondest memories were playing old school dungeon-crawler video games on the PC, and interacting with this type of fantasy lore. Lord of the Rings, Willow and the Chronicles of Narnia all come to mind when reminiscing of some of my favorite fictional fantasies, and there’s plenty of anime out there that scratch the itch. Legendary anime studio Madhouse attempted to tackle Record of Lodoss War in the early 90’s, a time when fantasy novels and movies were undoubtedly on the rise. It has a palpable Dungeons and Dragons feel, and is nostalgic of those all-nighters with friends, chugging our Mountain Dews and munching on Doritos while rolling the 20-sided die one more time. Unfortunately Lodoss is plagued with a sense of “generic” that’ll have you thirsting for more depth… which’ll sadly never come. Coupled with some of the most inconsistent English voice acting I’ve ever heard, it’ll be an anime you’ll probably forget soon after watching it.  My biggest complaint about Lodoss is that it wasn’t given the proper amount of episodes to expand its story properly. It has such an engrossing atmosphere and massive worldbuilding potential that is squandered terribly due to a lack of time investment. What we’re left with is a marginalized “good vs. evil” approach, thinning the cast of characters to generic protagonists and antagonists. A series with this much imagination needs the proper nurturing to ensure success, and 26 episodes would’ve given it more of a fighting chance. On top of that, they decided to drop the viewers into the middle of what is chronologically after the 5th episode… only leading to the confusion. I don’t know if different mediums of media were trying this reverse storytelling at the time, but it was entirely unnecessary and only confused the hell out of me, and I’m assuming a lot of other people.  You follow Parn (yep, sounds like porn) and his stereotypical group of fellow travelers (a cleric, wizard, elf, dwarf and thief) as they seek to prevent the destruction of the planet by baddies that want to control the universe. Sound intriguing? Well, I can assure you that this is the Dynasty Warriors button masher of plots. Considering the source material is actually written to emulate a D&D experience, the dungeon master must’ve been rather disappointing. The main character transforms from useless fodder to going toe for toe with the most powerful foe on Lodoss (which has definitely never happened in an anime before), all in the course of like 5 episodes. There's a loose backstory referencing his father and restoring his family’s honor, but it’s unconvincing at best. Generic quotes like “I'll get you!” and “you're no match for me!” resonate from his vocabulary on occasion, and you sense there isn't much there are on his intellectual level. Parn’s childhood friend Etoh, the with perhaps the worst English voice actor of all time, accompanies him as a sworn companion.  Deedlit, a high elf and Parn’s hinted love interest, is a princess that randomly decides to join the adventure. Given the fact that she’s actually of royalty, she naturally drops everything to answer the underlying question of what is happening to her people. And honestly, the rest of the main pack is irrelevant. A gaggle of genericized fantasy tropes, which doesn’t create the best selling point. The most interesting character in the entire series is Ashram, a knight who seeks the highest power, but has some serious self-identification and reflecting to do in the process. He’s initially perceived as a villain, but can actually draw some empathy and understanding as the series elapses.  In addition to being a relatively generic series, Lodoss is littered with bits of randomness along the way. Although the “potential” romantic relationship between Parn and Deedlit never actually develops, there are plenty of awkward exchanges or long stares that force the viewer into thinking there’s something there. I’m just not buying it, there’s almost no chemistry between the two. Not to mention the interest fellow traveler Shiris (the girl with the berserker friend) has in Parn…. something that's awkwardly left by the wayside. There's also the evil witch Carla, with perhaps the most unassuming name in anime villainy existence, and another dark elf that sporadically falls for Ashram along the way. The more I get frustrated with the lack of finesse in writing, the more I realize what the anime was modeled after: a D&D quest. Speaking from experience, the element of randomness doesn’t even scratch the surface of the ridiculous stuff me and my friends used to come up with when we played. So…. I guess there’s that.  Sometimes I don’t consider it fair to criticize animation from the 90’s or earlier, because it’s merely a sign of the times. In Lodoss’ case, the art style isn’t necessarily my cup of tea but it’s consistent with the art out at the time in terms of quality. From what I remember reading, the studio actually utilized a sizable budget in order to get exactly what they were looking for in terms of emulating various fantasy elements and characters. Some of the fight scenes are actually quite fluid as well, something that earlier anime had issues with. No choppiness or quality drop during the heavier action sequences, something I can really appreciate. Especially when you consider the issues modern day anime have with frame drops and inconsistent animation, likely without any legitimate excuse.  Did I mention how bad the voice acting is? Central Park Media, a NYC based company took the reigns dubbing Lodoss. It was clear they had no idea what they were doing. Some acting is decent, but others are absolutely atrocious. It’s almost as though when the producers signed off on it they were doing more of a “screw it”, knowing they’d be out of a job anyway. If you’re a fan of dubs due to convenience, I strongly suggest you watch the Japanese version or avoid it altogether. It’s THAT bad. Performances like this employs hopefulness for my future seiyuu career… I digress.  The rest of the music is slightly unfitting, but about what I expect from an early 90’s series. Anime was largely in a learning period, starkly evident by the slow female ballads present in their OPs. For a show so focused on action and fantasy elements, the OP just...doesn’t work. As a standalone track it’s quite present, reminiscent of “Fly Me to the Moon” from NGE, but not an anime fit. The background tracks depict the genre much better. They’re full of orchestral life, and build crescendos left and right.  As much as I disliked certain aspects of Lodoss, I enjoyed it overall. However, one must understand that most of my enjoyment comes from a mix of nostalgia and relatability. I was a HUGE nerd in my high school days, so Lodoss speaks to me in some ways other anime cannot. On the other hand, it’s leaps and bounds from being “good” by any normal definition. Perhaps I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had watched the Japanese dub vice the English, but a generic plot, short run time and forced romance all work to cripple Lodoss, dooming it from the start. I would recommend this series to fans of other fantasy anime or earlier shows, or those just looking for something different. As always, thanks for reading!;Mixed Feelings
2;Lodoss-tou Senki;Dwarfking45;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dwarfking45;6;Going into this anime, I didn't have very high expectations, but it was part of one of my favorite genres. Also, this is one of the anime where I had some of the hardest time actually deciding on how to rate it. Then, I realized that it is probably going to be just above average. And it did just that.  Story:  It revolves around the wannabe swordsman named Parn and his fellow adventurers who are trying to avert further warfare and save Lodoss from the oncoming evil. This is a setup for a good anime, and I liked it. However, there were many plotholes that could be dug into this anime, and for good reasons, and not necessarily bad ones. This story was meant to be more of a story about a hero who triumphed against all odds, and trust me, the odds were stacking against him WAY more than I anticipated, but he prevailed in the end, and got the girl. Also, it felt like it was VERY rushed too, so there is that. So basically, it wasn't horrible, but it definitely was what I expected, and did have some twists and turns I did not expect, but overall, it did its job. (5/10)  Art:  Oh, I dreaded actually getting to this part, because it is a 90's anime, and I know I shouldn't bash a 90's anime for not looking very good, but sadly, the animation was bad, and that is even when you consider the times it was in. There was a whole lot of reused shots and reused still images. Also, some of the flames didn't look like flames, some of the blood didn't look like blood, and even some of the lip movements didn't even happen when a character was speaking, despite them not being too far away. It just looked like a big mess. Sure, I did enjoy seeing how some of the characters looked and how they moved, but oh my word, I sometimes had to pause the anime, when a particularly badly animated scene or movement occurred. (3/10)  Sound:  Now, the anime surprised me a little by adding in music that wasn't exactly fitting the tone all the time, nor was it varied, but it was consistent and knew what it was trying to say, even if it didn't always say it. It had a couple of REALLY good songs, or selections of songs, and some of the sound effects weren't that bad either. However, there were a couple songs that were mediocre at best. The voice acting was pretty good, but it just wasn't as great as it could have been, both dubbed and subbed included. It was just above average, but it didn't pull through all the time. (6/10)  Characters:  Well, what can I say, there were some I really liked and some I really disliked. Parn, for example, has some of the best luck I have seen of a fantasy anime protagonist, like seriously. He didn't even know how to fight with a sword until almost halfway through the third episode, and by the time the anime ended, he apparently was good enough to handle one of the main villains, who could easily kill him in the first few episodes. and even though this is the character section, another problem I had was the lack of time notifications about whats going on. I really didn't like that part, especially when it came to the development of characters. Also, the love story between Deedlit and Parn felt SO forced that I could become one of the most confused people on the planet after seeing it, and yet it was still so interesting, because you know it is part of the story. Also, everyone else just felt more like someone who was just there to fulfill a necessary spot, of both the different classes and races like humans, elves and dwarves. I don't know. They were all very likeable, but at the same time, there was not much time to explore into many of their stories. (5/10)  Enjoyment:  However, this was the highest rated part of the series, and it is the shortest. I REALLY enjoyed watching this anime, despite all of these mediocre findings of mine. What can I say? I love fantasy, and this anime fulfills the role nicely, even though it has a lot of flaws in it. To me, its like seeing Lord of the Rings. Sure, there are a number of plotholes in it that I can think off the top of my head, but it definitely was very enjoyable to watch, and after watching this anime, I want to explore more of the lore in this universe, because it is so fascinating, and yet there was so little that was put forth out there.  Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, despite its flaws. It may need a lot of work in different areas, but I do recommend you watch it, even if it might not be that great.  Overall: 6/10.;Mixed Feelings
3;Lodoss-tou Senki;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;6;This is one of anime's most beloved titles, even though I never learned about it until this year on TVTropes. Plus I felt bored of watching nothing but Pokemon and Sword Art Online all throughout the semester, so I figured I might as well try something I've never seen before. This has gotten a lot of praise from fans, and I thought I'd like it. To an extent, I did, but...honestly, I can't really see why people like this. Now don't get me wrong, it's not a BAD anime. Heck, I'd watch this over every ecchi anime in the world! However, there's just too much wrong with it to really be conceived as anything other than decent. But the show's main problem is that it's just way too short and way too convoluted for its own good. By convoluted I mean like Digimon Adventure 02 convoluted. What do I mean? Let's explain, shall we? (Note: this review is only about the OVA, not the TV series. I haven't seen the latter, and don't know if I'm going to or not)  There's definitely a story to this anime. But the problem is, I can barely comprehend it, as there's just WAAAY too much being shoved down my throat. All I managed to comprehend was that a group of people meet and join forces, an evil empire called Marmo is trying to take control of Lodoss, there's some evil spirit trying to manipulate everything, and at the end, some wizard tries to resurrect one of the goddesses that split Lodoss. That's about it, really. Remember when I said Escaflowne isn't giving people time to absorb its story? Well, I take it back. Lodoss does it too, but far worse. There's so much going on within that timespan that it tries to bite off more than it can chew. It doesn't help that everything jumps around like a kangaroo high on sugar, so you can barely tell exactly what the heck is going on! Part of it could be the fact that its thirteen episodes long, and had it been extended to 26 or even 52 episodes, the story would be more comprehensible, and everything would feel more connected and flow better. If you want to tell a good story, don't just throw in a bunch of events and shove them down our throats without giving us time to chew it! Popolocrois had 25 episodes, yet it had a perfect balance between the story and the characters, the episodes felt more connected, and they kept a consistent yet restrained output. It gave time to develop its story and explain what was going on, and it didn't need to rely on adding in as much stuff as possible. It knew how much it could chew at a time and managed to come out fine in the end. Lodoss really needs to work on that.  The animation...I'll be honest here, it really hasn't aged well, and there's lots of errors. Heck, one part of the opening sequence looks like two of the characters were cut from paper and pasted on a background! There's too many still frames, and I think the animators wasted too much budget on making everybody's costumes as elaborate and fantasy-like as possible. But I do like the character designs, though! Plus nobody looks the same. In a time where modern anime characters look too much the same except with different eye and hair colors and different hair lengths, the character designs in this are very refreshing. I'll at least give the show credit for that. The music...while the opening and ending are nice, they're still a little bit generic, and the background music isn't really all that memorable. Some pieces sound like they came from popular video games, like Zelda or Final Fantasy.  The characters...eh. They're all kinda bland to me. Nobody was even remotely interesting to me. We have the hero, the chick, the mage, the skeevy guy, the evil villains, etc. Because the story is so freakishly convoluted to the point of looking like an overflowing trash bag, it really suffered in characterization. They could have made these characters into real characters, but here they're just a bunch of bland archetypes. The only characters I thought were even remotely interesting were Orson and Shiris, and they don't appear until episode eight! I really want to like these characters, but even after 13 whole episodes, I still feel like I've only JUST started getting to know them. They could have been more fleshed out, which is a shame. Had the creators gotten more episodes and didn't try so hard, they could have been able to do great things with them.  There's a difference between balancing things out and biting off more than you can chew, and unfortunately, Lodoss is the latter. While I appreciate its efforts, it was just trying too hard, and because it tried too hard, it suffered greatly as a result. Escaflowne had somewhat the same problem, but it had 26 episodes (it was going to be longer but their budget was cut so they had to make do with 26), and it at least tried everything it could to get its story out, and it wasn't freakishly convoluted either. It also did its best to fit in a lot of character progression, even though it was also extremely focused on its story. Plus, their characters were more interesting! Escaflowne, while it didn't entirely succeed in its effort, at least tried to balance out its story and characters, and for what its worth, it did a good job. Popolocrois has 25 episodes, yet it knew what its story wanted to be, didn't try to go for anything big, and balanced out its story and characters in whatever time it had, and it really worked in its favor. Lodoss...it just wound up biting off way more than it could chew, and wound up suffocating in the process. All it really needed was more episodes and more time to flesh out both its story and characters so we'd be able to comprehend everything better. Maybe they had budget issues and couldn't do it? Were they not able to get it to air on TV? I dunno. Also, we also get reminded that there was a great war resulting in the creation of Lodoss. It'd be one thing if this was said once, but he explains it in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!! We freaking get it! The story's hard enough to comprehend as it is! That pointless opening scene was really not necessary, and Lodoss has suffered enough as it is.  All in all, Lodoss isn't a bad anime. It was just too short and took on more than it could handle. All it really needed was more episodes and a lot of polishing. But I can at least appreciate its good points, and if you're looking for an escapist fantasy anime, check it out.;Mixed Feelings
4;Lodoss-tou Senki;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;6;This one is a little bit serious. If you want to talk about this in DnD perspective, these are the guys that take everything serious and say that you can’t talk out of character and all that. Sure there is a little comedy but it is pretty much ether nurd-ifide or magically complicated. Maybe this is why I don’t really get along with the serious people… because I didn’t much care for it. Now this doesn’t mean that it is bad, oh no. It’s far from bad even to today’s standards. It just takes a lot of talking and standing around before anything really significant gets done.  The characters are alright though I have to wonder about the names and character designs. Ghim, the dwarf, reminds me a lot of Ghimbli from Lord of the Rings, and I’m not sure but depending on when Rune Soldier was made, Deedlit looks a lot like Crysta, the elf girl they meet. No matter how you try to sugar coat it, Parn is pretty much a weakling trying to fit into his father’s armor, though that’s mostly what he looks like. He does have a brave heart though, which I have to sit down and roll my eyes at since it’s pretty much generic. The whole thing is freaken generic and rather boring to me most of the time.  The animation, though beautiful, felt more like still shots with lips flapping because The fight scenes aren’t well done in today’s standard. They might have been fine back then but I come from a generation where we like our active fight scenes and not this ‘clash swords and talk’ thing most of the characters do.  The voices, mostly actually miss in the English version and since I couldn’t find the Japanese, I couldn’t see weather it was the same there too. This is just one that I really wish had some more comedy to keep me interested. The narrator got on my nerves a hell of a lot more then the others though. It seemed ever part that could have been better without any sound was voiced over to talk about what was right in front of us!;Mixed Feelings
5;Lodoss-tou Senki;Hanakotaba;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hanakotaba;5;"A classic by definition is used to describe a certain piece of media that had stand in a test of time for its insurmountable quality. Record of the Lodoss War, for its time in the 90s, had a cult following with the high fantasy genre booming in the West and Japan taking heavy influences of these genres such as space operas and of course, high fantasy. Record of Lodoss War's blatant influences can be stemmed from the 1974's tabletop RPG, Dungeons and Dragons and certain elements from the publication of J. R. R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings are implemented into the 1990 OVA series. The original novelization of Record of Lodoss War was penned by Ryo Mizuno, who must've adored Dungeons and Dragons and decided to write a series as an inspiration. Then, later adapted into a 13-episode OVA or Original Video Animation produced by Studio Madhouse (Yes the same Madhouse that did One Punch Man, Overlord, Monster, etc.) They have been around for the longest time in the industry. For those who don't know, OVAs are straight to video that were commonly known for its minimal production value. The 90s were the times OVAs was constantly littered into VHS, DVDs, and other physical copies that nowadays, are rare.  So, how does Record of Lodoss War holds up in modern day standards? Honestly, no except visually. The story, characters, setting, aesthetics; everything is a love letter to the high fantasy genre and considering how much an inspiration the series has taken from, Record of Lodoss War is none other than a shallow recreation of the beloved tabletop RPG or other fantasy series. You have knights, elves, dwarfs, sorcerers, clerics, thieves, and many other standard tropes of high fantasy imaginable. It is Western-styled based high fantasy except it's the Japanese version of it. For its time, it is understandable how it can appeal such an audience (nerds/geeks) in the 90s. However, despite the beloved series, it is nothing more than nostalgia fest.  Record of Lodoss War's presentation is as basic as any setup for a high fantasy; wars, dragons, quests, conquests, kingdoms, you name it. Each episode starts off with a narration foretelling the events that most likely happen to the world of Lodoss. The rest of the series follows a really by-the-books adventure with our central protagonist, Parn and his group of generic template RPG class group members: Etoh, a bowl cut cleric, a long-bearded axe-wielding, Ghim, a wise mage, Slayn and the most popular character everyone remembers; Deedlit, a high elf who is beautiful and courageous. How they met was merely out of circumstances that forced the group to be together to further the plot. There's also the forces of good versus evil the characters brought themselves into and this is where the majority of the plot revolves around. There's no excitement throughout and if you an avid watcher of anime, the predictability can be apparent. The lore itself is also half-baked and usually when its mentioned, used as a exposition device to pan the runtime.  Of course, the story won't be interesting without the characters, right? Well, the investment towards the main cast aren't well developed enough. We never know most of the main group's motivations except Parn's curiosity of his late father. Deedlit, the most beloved waifu, has no depth either. Deedlit's main role is to act flirty around Parn for some forced and flat romance or to act spunky. The rest of the characters are similar of having no depth. Therefore, the connection is skewed and left with no care to what happen to them. Even the side characters aren't interesting in the slightest. Karen for example, without spoiling, served a role to give the characters a sense of danger and threat that supposed to make Karen as intimidating as possible. The so called villains aren't nuanced in particular shape or form; they are the most mustache twirling villains template, its laughably generic. As if, everyone are bound to be plot devices.  It may looked like I am bashing on Lodoss but not entirely. Lodoss has some really good aspects aside from the lack of characterization and story. As previously mentioned, Mizuno wrote Lodoss as an inspiration and Madhouse achieved that vision in the visual department. The artwork is mesmerizing, the attention to detail in the costume design, monsters/goblins/dragons, weapon sets that look amazing, environment that stayed true to its fantasy counterparts like castles and its interiors, and character designs that look ethereal. Specifically, the female characters. The artist, Satoshi Urushihara, was known for his exquisite female characters with very voluptuous ""body shapes"". Yes, he was most known for his hentai works apparently. Other than that, we have the soundtrack. Composed by Mitsuo Hagita, mostly deal with symphonic sounds to capture the feeling of majestic in a fantasy setting. The opening theme song (recently becoming one of my favorites), Adesso e Fortuna, encapsulates that high fantasy vibe in a romantic way. These aspects I praised for capturing the aesthetics of high fantasy Lodoss was known for.  Should Record of Lodoss War be considered a classic? Well, in a sense, yes it is. If speaking on the perspective of the majority in the West who have grown with the OVA series, there is a certain magic that resonated with them because it was a time period the genre of high fantasy was booming. Of course, the ""similarities"" to the tabletop RPG and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings are present with Lodoss, as a love letter to Western high fantasy. The comparison to Lodoss to D&D is unavoidable. Despite these massive flaws, the fans of the series adore Lodoss and there is an enjoyment factor when watching Lodoss. I liked the detail in the art (the dragons are drawn superbly) and the soundtrack. Although, I find it to be a chore to sit through from its lack of depth and originality. Not that it is god awful, I wish I could find the charm of the series but I just couldn't. The mediocrity stuck with me start to finish.  If you think you can get into this series, there are other series like Lodoss such as Grancrest Senki, who was penned by the same author. There's the supposed sequel, Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, which is supposed to be the alternative version of the 8th episode of the OVA, just extended. Lastly, there's Legend of Crystania, a spinoff. I can certainly recommend Record of Lodoss War for diehard fantasy fans if you don't mind the tropes and simply experience it, you will have a great time. Overall, a hugely flawed love letter to Western high fantasy.";Mixed Feelings
6;Lodoss-tou Senki;BurningCarnation;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BurningCarnation;5;This show is based on the first novel of THE classic Japanese high fantasy series. If you were born in the '60s or '70s (if you were Japanese) or '90s (if you were anywhere else) you must have heard of Lodoss at least once. The novel series was based on an actual TRPG playthrough of the series' writer Mizuno Ryou and his friends: the story involved was modified after the playthrough was done.  This show cut down on almost every sidequest/filler within the novels, and some more: hence the story is abrupt, confusing, and not very well developed throughout the whole running time. The story has a tendency to either jump between certain points in time, or not explain what happened between events. Notably, the transition from episode 5 to 6 was quite confusing, so much that I thought I'd turned on the wrong episode by accident. Also, no one gets any character development time, not even Parn, and if our protagonist is susceptible to this then no one is exempted. Deedlit is in love with Parn out of the blue because reasons, and everyone else are likewise cookie-cutter characters, such as the supportive wizard, the gruff dwarf fighter, the morally gray rogue, the mentor/father figure and king, the scheming advisor, etc. Expecting a well-woven, fantastic and complex story of a grand scale in a meager 13 episodes is the fastest way to disappoint yourself: Treat this show as an appendix to the novels, as a teaser video series of what a properly visualized Lodoss could have been, because the visuals, while a bit static (or borderline ridiculous) in a few key action scenes, are for the most part absolutely gorgeous and emblematic of the late 80's ~ early '90s aesthetics, with animators that worked on/would go on to animate incredible visuals from various works like Galaxy Express 999, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, RahXephon, Cowboy Bebop, and many more.  This OVA series' greatest contribution to the otaku subculture is how they managed to perfectly animate Deedlit, arguably the most influential elf character in ALL of Japan--at least, in terms of character designs. Blonde, long and pointy ears, well-endowed with a slender frame, green clothing, nature something something, with a high chance of being a tsundere? That's from Deedlit. I can immediately think of five elf characters with similar hair and cloth color coding--and most of them originate from NSFW material. To say that Deedlit influenced EVERY female elf character in Japan since her creation might not be an overstatement. It's not just her character design though: Deedlit is probably the best 'character' (if anyone can properly be called so) in Lodoss, simply because she gets so much screentime even when it's not her turn to shine, in addition to having the best voice acting. Deedlit is strong and resourceful without being overpowered (unlike Parn), wise and composed (unlike Parn), haughty but not overbearing, compassionate yet level-headed, possesses unrivaled beauty, and, most importantly, has the power to significantly increase the budget of the sakuga and frames of every scene she's in while Parn stares at her or zones out into the distance. Truly the fantasy girl that every otaku wants.  I talked more about Deedlit than the actual plot. That should tell you what to expect from this show: a visual feast and a narrative famine.;Mixed Feelings
7;Lodoss-tou Senki;TwoSevenTwo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TwoSevenTwo;5;"Lodoss follows in the tradition of D&D rather than literary fantasy, and it suffers from it. It has a nostalgic appeal, but only because back in the 90s, we didn't have many options for medieval fantasy anime, and this scratched that itch. It does have its good moments, but it is otherwise forgettable.  Let's get this out of the way first: ""Record of Lodoss War"" is an adaptation of a D&D campaign run by the author. No attempt is made to hide it. The grand back story and world building by the DM/author are used for flavor and to motivate events, but they otherwise have little connection to the story. The characters are straight out of the early D&D manuals, and obvious choices at that: fighter, elf, dwarf, cleric, magic user, thief. In episode 8, the group must have got their hands on a supplementary D&D manual, so they introduce a berserker. The final battle is at the bottom of a multi-level dungeon, just as you expect. Even villains seem to come straight from the D&D manual—you can pick out the chaotic evil and lawful evil villains the moment they appear on screen.  In the end, what makes up the story? A love story for the hero, training to become a better fighter, and a bit of a tragic love story in the background, all set in front of an eternal battle between light and dark. This comfortable predictability makes it an excellent target for nostalgia. The pacing becomes problematic as the series goes on—more characters, more stories, more viewpoints, and more exposition all slow things down towards the second half. The story then lurches forward to meet an ending that it hasn't quite earned. In the meantime, characters and plot seem to happen independently of each other.  But it's not really that bad. In spite of the cookie-cutter character concepts, the characters themselves are filled out and seem real. We sympathize with heroes and villains alike. The story treats its setting and characters with respect. Finally, he animation and soundtrack are great—at least, much of the time.  So if you can't get enough medieval fantasy, or if you're on a nostalgia kick, Record of Lodoss War is just what you need. However, if you're just curious, don't bother. The 90s has better series to offer.";Mixed Feelings
8;Lodoss-tou Senki;Sobornost;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sobornost;6;"Lodoss-tou Senki (Record of Lodoss War) is a very western-style fantasy story. The protagonist is a village-boy-turned-swordsman, his love interest is an elf, they’re joined by a priest, a wizard, a dwarven warrior, and a thief. They fight against evil wizards, dark elves, orc-like beastmen, and ultimately an evil kingdom, all of which are in service of resurrecting an evil god. They meet various allies throughout the series, including kings, lords, and mercenaries. They explore ruins and travel the land.  If you’re a fan of fantasy novels or video games, all of this probably sounds fairly familiar. I don’t know what Japanese audiences would have thought, but Lodoss is rather cliché. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. Cliché stories can be comforting (eg. in the form of nostalgia) or sources of easy entertainment. And even a bad story (cliché or not) can be saved by having exciting or complex characters. But this is where the first real problem with Lodoss’ writing emerges: the characters aren’t particularly great.  Of maybe half a dozen major characters, only one, the protagonist Parn, sees anything resembling character development. Parn starts out as a reckless teenager who doesn’t know how to use a sword. Over the course of Lodoss, he learns how to use a sword, becomes less reckless, and appears to mature at least a little. However, these changes are rather superficial. Parn is fundamentally the same person at the beginning of the story, in the middle of the story, and at the end of the story. Likewise, Parn never seems conflicted or in doubt about his choices, nor does he ever despair in the face of evil. Parn’s entire personality and character arc could be summarized with one word: protagonist.  The other characters don’t differ, really. They all fit into familiar archetypes, none of them demonstrate any hidden depths or complex motivations, and, unlike Parn, none of them have any kind of character growth. None of this is to say that there aren’t any likeable characters – Ghim, Woodchuck, and Ashram all stood out for me – but for every likeable character, you can probably find at least one or two who feel superfluous. For example, I can vaguely recall both Slayn the wizard and Etoh the priest doing things, but neither really felt integral to the plot, despite being two of Parn’s companions.  A lot of these problems with characterization could be solved if Lodoss was better paced. Lodoss’ pacing is odd. The OVA was adapted from a series of novels; however at the time, only the first three of seven novels had been published, and only three more would be published by the OVA’s conclusion. And whilst those novels were, in turn, adapted from a DnD campaign run by the author and his friends, at best that would have only provided an outline to the production company. Whilst one can’t know for sure, I suspect that this had some impact on the production, pacing, and writing of the episodes.  Lodoss’ first episode is in media res, taking place probably around the same time as episode six. It doesn’t really spare much time in introducing the characters. As a story about six companions adventuring in a dungeon, it’s pretty entertaining, but I admittedly found it hard to follow at times, especially when it cut away from our heroes to focus on conversations being had by various villains and supporting characters. The second episode is the true beginning of the story, and from there the series progresses normally. Lodoss is primarily about a war staged between the evil empire of Marmo and the various other kingdoms of Lodoss, and this war transpires over the course of the series. However, for the first eight episodes, at least some of the narrative focus is on Ghim’s quest to find a young woman, Leylia, who had disappeared some years before. These eight episodes are probably the best part of the series, and if the story told during them had been expanded to the full thirteen episodes, I suspect that many of my complaints regarding characterization would have been moot.  Unfortunately, after episode eight, Lodoss’ story takes a nosedive. The last five episodes concern the bulk of the war against Marmo, and five episodes isn’t enough to tell the story of a war. Often times, I felt as I were missing something – as if, for example, the characters had decided something or come to some realization between episodes. I’ll admit that I had trouble maintaining interest by this point, so I may simply have missed something, but these final episodes definitely felt rushed when compared to the eight that preceeded them.  If there is a bright spot to Lodoss, it is the fantastic art. The characters designs are all richly detailed and are an interesting blend of Eastern and Western art styles. Any one of the characters wouldn’t look out of place in a DnD manual from the eighties. On the other hand, the animation leaves something to be desired. I’m not the greatest judge of these kinds of things, but I suppose one expects a bit more fluidity from an OVA, whereas Lodoss – character designs aside – felt more like a television series in terms of quality. That’s maybe not the best way of putting it, but I’m not an art guy. The color palette is also more muted when compared to other fantasy anime (such as Slayers), though I think that’s fitting given how seriously Lodoss takes itself.  As I mentioned before, I think that Lodoss would have been more enjoyable overall had the story arc of the first eight episodes been extended to all thirteen. However, as it is, I don’t think Lodoss is without it’s appeal. It is a solid, if predictable and cliché fantasy story, and I suspect those with an interest in the fantasy genre will find something to enjoy here, whether it be the nostalgia or the art. Likewise, I don’t know how faithful it is to the novels, but I imagine fans of the novels would appreciate the OVA, as well (and perhaps get a lot more out of it). Then again, fans of the novels might take issue with any deviations the OVA made, and given the OVA was being released before the series was fully published, I can imagine there were a few.  However, you probably already know whether Lodoss is the kind of series that will interest you. It is exactly what it seems to be, for better or worse.";Mixed Feelings
9;Lodoss-tou Senki;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Record of Lodoss War” is a 13-episode OVA series that is part of the mixed media franchise of the same name. “Lodoss” was quite popular when it was released and influenced just about every anime in the fantasy genre that succeeded it; this series’ importance is not to be understated. However, while “Lodoss” has excellent music, nice artwork and character designs, every other aspect of this series, especially plot and character development, leaves a lot to be desired.  The gist of the plot is that a wizard is trying to resurrect an evil goddess to rule and/or destroy the island of Lodoss, and a traditional party led by a hero has to stop him. They are aided by a neighboring kingdom and a couple of rogue characters. On the villain’s side, there is some infighting, as a couple of characters don’t get along with the wizard. There’s also an “observer” whose alliance is left unclear, and seems to switch between the two sides. So, in essence, it’s a traditional good-versus-evil setup, which isn’t a bad thing, but the the narrative gets repetitive. It’s basically: fight the villain because they’re evil. Defeat them. Fight the next villain who is also bad just because. Rinse and repeat until you’re holding a half-naked elf woman in your arms.  The plot sounds simple, but the story jumps around a lot, particularly in the first half of the series, so it can be difficult to follow. For instance, the first episode starts in medias res style, with events that chronologically happen around the middle of the series. Then from episode 2, it jumps back to the beginning, and there are also some flashbacks here and there that aren’t transitioned into well. In addition, the series mentions various kingdoms around the island, and we see characters traveling to and from these kingdoms, but we never get a sense of where these kingdoms are in relation to each other, or the distance between them. It would have been helpful if they had shown a map once in a while.  The story does have a conclusive ending, but many key questions are left unanswered, especially regarding the fates of some of the main characters. One character, in particular, seems to have been forgotten by everyone else. A group of multicolored dragons is featured prominently in the opening sequence, and we start seeing some of them in the latter half of the series. However, one of them simply shows up and strikes a pose in the last episode, and doesn’t do anything after that. The significance of the dragons and their relation with the other inhabitants of the island are not explained well, if at all. We also never really learn much about the other races/species living on the island, or what lies outside of the island.  As “Lodoss” was based off of a series of novels that were in turn based off of “Dungeons and Dragons” roleplaying sessions, the characters are about as archetypal as you can get. They don’t have any personalities beyond stereotypes, and we don’t get too much background information on them. Character motivations, particularly for the villains, are simplistic, contradictory or simply left unclear. There is a hint of development for two of the antagonists, but it’s too little, too late. It’s suggested at the end that the main protagonist has changed somewhat (as stated by the narrator), but we don’t actually see him change.  As for technical aspects of this series, some of the artwork is good, particularly with regard to the character designs for Deedlit and the other female characters. The male characters, on the other hand, look rather plain to me. The backgrounds are also dull. The dragons have interesting designs, but due to the lack of animation, their fights are underwhelming. Regarding the animation, most of the time it’s not that fluid. Action scenes tend to rely on still shots and slideshow-type shots which use minimal animation. Occasionally, the characters appear to be off-model. About the only time the animation is actually good is during closeups of Deedlit’s face.  As mentioned earlier, there is a lot of jumping around the timeline, and the scenes aren’t transitioned into very well, so the direction is not that great. The voice acting is decent, but due to the cliched dialogue, none of the actors really have a chance to shine here.  The best thing about “Lodoss” is the music. I love the airy, ethereal feeling of the opening and ending themes; they really add to the atmosphere of the series. The insert song in the last episode, and all of the instrumental background music, are good as well.  Regarding potentially objectionable content, this series is full of fighting (it’s called “Record of Lodoss *War*,” after all), and a couple of the many scenes in which people get killed or seriously injured are rather grotesque. There’s a slight bit of nudity in the last episode, and some implied nudity in the ending sequence. Also, it should be noted that most episodes of this series, especially around the beginning and end, have frequent flashing light effects, so caution is necessary while viewing this if you’re photosensitive.  Overall, “Record of Lodoss War” is an important show that is watchable, but due to the confusing way the story is set up, as well as the lack of interesting characters, it’s not a particularly satisfying watch. The music and atmosphere of the series is nice, though, so if you don’t mind the lack of character development and having a bevy of key questions left unanswered at the end, you may enjoy watching this.";Mixed Feelings
10;Lodoss-tou Senki;KoopaKlown;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KoopaKlown;7;Record of Lodoss War Review   Record of Lodoss War is one of those oldtaku “classics” that a lot of people have heard of but in my experience you find less and less who have actually seen it, especially with the oldtaku continuing to age out and newer younger generations joining the fandom in much larger numbers. Nowadays it’s kind of most notable for being that thing Lisa Ortiz was in before Slayers, and that series that Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth was based off. I only know two people who have seen Record of Lodoss War other than me, both only saw it once and one saw it over 20 years ago. Where I live, in the US, we have only received a handful of Lodoss properties but in Japan it’s quite a bit bigger with multiple novels and games in addition to the couple anime that were released in the 90s. However the two anime are meant to stand on their own and the OVA series was the first of these two making it the entry point to the series for many people, such as myself. Did it succeed in properly introducing and explaining the world of Lodoss Island to fresh audiences? Kinda.  Lodoss is a by the books fantasy story. What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say “fantasy adventure party”? The mental image you just got there is identical to the composure of the Lodoss group. We get Parn, the warrior, his friend Etoh, the priest, Slayn, the wizard, Ghim, the dwarf, Deedlit, the elf, and Woodchuck, the thief. None of them are really all that notable other than Deedlit, who is strikingly beautiful and has a personality that isn’t as easily summed up as just stating her character class. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Parn, who at times comes off as so empty he feels like an RPG player character still awaiting a player to come in and personalize him. Parn is the main character. The people in charge of the anime though clearly knew who you were gonna watch it for however. Both the opening and ending heavily feature Deed, with the ending cutting all party members who aren't her. Pretty artwork of a pretty elf to keep you going. But other than the party make up what is Lodoss like? Pretty standard.  The basic plot outline of Record of Lodoss War is that the party is on a quest to stop an invasion by the evil emperor of Marmo, Beld, and to take down his powerful ally, the witch Karla. Ghim and Slayn are looking for Leylia the daughter of Ghim’s friend Neese who went missing seven years ago. If you want to know the particulars of why, read the novel. An English copy currently has an asking price of around $70 so hopefully you got one while they were still in print. Salyn and Ghim get roped in with Parn and Etoh after they help them fend off some goblins attacking the town they live in. They meet Deedlit when she shows up to warn them of the attack. Woodchuck they meet in prison when the party is arrested for a miscommunication later in the series. However this is not where Lodoss chooses to start. Instead the first episode is smack in the middle of their adventures when they are already on their way to meet the sage Wort. Unlike some series, Berserk for instance, having the first episode set ahead then flashing back does not help establish a tone or foreshadow anything. Instead it’s more akin to Violence Jack, just having one random episode out of order. It’s odd and confusing because the viewer doesn't know any of these characters yet and they've just been thrown into the middle of the story. In addition Parn’s first two lines are both negging Deedlit which doesn’t help endear him to you. This weird out of order episode left one of my friends so confused it effected his ability to understand the story. He told me “Yeah they were like ‘okay we’re gonna go see the wizard’ then the next episode they’re like ‘okay now that we saw the wizard’ and you never see them go there!” I had to tell him they did, they just did it in the first episode then flashed back for seemingly no reason. However this is not the biggest flaw of Record of Lodoss War. It’s biggest flaw would be its pacing.  The strength of any fantasy rests on the back of its lore. From Lord of the Rings to Game of Thrones all successful fantasy franchises have had deep lore. Record of Lodoss War is no different. It opens every episode with a brief summery of the history of Lodoss’ creation. However there are only 13 half hour episodes of the original OVA franchise, they were never going to be able to pack everything in. This did not stop them from trying. Things move at an absolutely break neck pace in Lodoss War. In those 13 episodes alone there are 4 separate villains. That means there are 4 separate climaxes. You barely have time to rest on the end of one part before the series has moved on to the next. Okay they’re fighting Beld, now they’re fighting Karla, now they’re fighting Ashram, now they’re fighting Wagnard. Those last two take place during the final three episodes leaving them feeling even more rushed and crammed than anything that came before them. Characters can be introduced and then made lifelong friends or bitter enemies in what seems like an instant because the show cannot slow down if it wants to get everything in there at once. I’ve watched it multiple times and I can’t say for sure if Wagnard is possessed by Kardis, the god of destruction, or if he just remembers his evil scheme in the middle of a battle. Personally I don’t think he should have been in the series and that they should have cut both his and Ashram’s battles using those last 3 episodes to slow the series down a bit and ending it with their battle against Karla. She was the villain with the most connection to the main party and the battle against her felt the most climactic out of the 4 villain battles. If, however, you can get past a level of pacing so fast it would pass an F-1 qualifier there are things to enjoy in the series.  Lodoss has some genuinely good fantasy action and designs. The dragons are huge and intimidating. The sorcery, while standard at times, gives you that classic fantasy magic feel. And the larger party means there’s more of an opportunity for individuals to use unique class abilities. Not to mention for those into that sort of thing Deedlit is total eye candy. Her ability to commune with the spirits of nature sets her magic apart from the type used by Slayn so it doesn’t feel like they just did the same character abilities twice. And for those willing to put in the time and attention to detail there’s some pretty interesting lore behind the scenes. Such as how emperor Beld wields the demonic sword of the demon king that he previously felled and that it grants great power but in exchange will corrupt the user. I also think the sword my crave blood and has a mind of its own but it is hard to tell given the speed at which this information is dumped and how easy it all can be to miss. Ghim’s obsession with rescuing Leylia, while lacking in the motivation provided by the novel, ads a more personal component to the group’s questing beyond just “stop evil thing from destroying world”, a personal connection later echoed when Parn has his battle against Wagnard at the end of the series. Karla makes for a fairly interesting antagonist. Unlike many fantasy villains who’s motivation is “I am evil because I am evil” Karla is trying to strike a balance in the world. She believes that the world can be neither fully good nor fully evil and will throw her weight and influence behind whichever side she deems weaker in the sake of maintaining a perfect balance. If you’re willing to look past the under cooked characters and rushed delivery you can appreciate Lodoss on its aesthetics and world then later return and finish cooking the characters yourself with additional research. It’s a very standard fantasy, but that also means it’s not a poor fantasy.  In the end it’s hard for me to recommend Record of Lodoss War, and this is entirely because of its insanely fast pacing. I personally enjoy it, and found that I liked it even more on my second viewing than on my first when I wasn’t all that impressed. The more layers of the Lodoss onion I peel off the more I enjoy it. However taken as a stand alone this OVA series is ridiculously rushed. It bites off far more than it can chew and both story lines and characters suffer because of it. It would easily be a much stronger show if it cut down on a couple of plot threads and gave the others room to breathe. The creators of the show don’t believe in pruning their trees however, and allow every tiny branch to suck away the energy of the whole rather than cut them off to allow the stronger ones to continue to grow and flourish. If you’re the type of person who really loves fantasy stories, or this sort of pacing issue isn't a dealbreaker for you then I would say go ahead and give Lodoss a shot. On the other hand if you're not big on fantasy and really need a strong, slow story to feel a deep connection with the characters then just go ahead and pass on this one, it’s not going to offer much for you. I would say it is the stronger of the two Lodoss anime but that doesn’t mean its fantastic or that it is for everyone. In the end its a heavily flawed work and the enjoyment is going to vary wildly by individual. I like Lodoss, it’s not my favorite, its not going to be topping my chart of all time greatest fantasy stories, but it’s an enjoyable way to fill my time and is a world I can get into. Maybe that will be how you feel, maybe not. But in the end the only way to really know for sure is decide if thats an adventure you want to take.  7/10;Mixed Feelings
0;Lodoss-tou Senki;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;3;"Nostalgia can be such a nice feeling, evoking vivid memories and moods. On the negative side, it can result in a depressive malaise or obsessive longing; more positively, it can lead one to aspire to something new, even greater. In the case of media, though, the rose-tinted image from memory is usually better—especially if it leads back to childhood. That's certainly the case for Record of Lodoss War: it's visually striking enough and well-presented to the point that it can seem a bit grander of a fantasy than it really is, and contrary to the emperor with no clothes parable, RoLW is an emperor peacocking in lavish and ornate robes at the behest of his advisors who hope to distract the populace from realizing their puppet king's drooling idiocy.  As is so common to the fantasy genre, it loses any sense of the fantastical due to the mundanity of its endlessly recycled, cliche roots, and the production values tank so often that the illusion of solidity cannot be maintained. Anime has often been known for its limited animation, usually making up for this with more calculated direction and editing of highly detailed and shaded (ahem, maybe not so much now...) character designs and backdrops—exposition, dialogue, and storytelling are all prioritized a bit more heavily than is the norm for animation as well. Madhouse is a solid studio, but they take the above formula to its extremes here. The character designs, even if some of them are on the generic side, are often rendered with so much detail, you'd be hard-pressed to believe these characters will be animated at all, and the staff often heap loads of stills on us with the bare minimum of movement. The dragons look immense and fearsome next to our puny heroes, but good luck not laughing once you see them tugged across the screen like a kite on a wire that is stiff as a board.  The animation can be striking when they pour in enough time or budget. The opening is lovely, and the first episode is filled with good work as well, especially the scene with the dragon—with Toshiyuki Inoue responsible for most of the choice bits. There is often bursts of stylish limited animation. Of course, they make sure to squeeze the most detailed animation into Deedlit, so they can sell their endocrine disrupting PVC figurines, which you need to make absolutely sure to never touch, should you be brave enough to wander into the dungeon of a weeaboo or otaku, torch in hand. The reasons to abstain are multi-faceted, and I shan't go into them here, but mind your hands!  There is a greater problem at hand than the animation, however. In fact, the series often manages to transcend the sometimes poor animation via solid storyboarding and directorial magic. What cannot be so easily dismissed is that the story, the setting, and almost everything about this anime is impressive, first and foremost, in how it is the most generic of all generic fantasy stories to have ever been generic. It's so generic that I have to use the word a plethora of times to emphasize how generic it is and to make it absolutely clear that I am not exaggerating by calling it generic—not in the slightest. This is the quintessential generic fantasy: a basic elemental magic system, sexy female elves, a short and stout dwarf with a battle axe; mindless hordes of goblins, kobolds, orcs, etc., and a few big dragons along the way; bog-standard D&D-styled classes for all of the characters, such as priest, thief, warrior, etc.  While this is a fairly standard tale of good guy versus bad guy, there are some betrayals and shifting alliances, but most of the ""complexity"" comes from the most tiresome cliche in fantasy, where a god or the heroes have to maintain the world's balance. I'm getting sleepy already. I hate this in fantasy. I mentioned this in my reviews for Ellcia, Final Fantasy... and while I'm not sure if I broached the subject with Mizuno's Crystania, it does apply there as well. I'm sure if you did a large survey of fantasy anime/manga, you'd find a similar pattern (I feel this tends to be less pronounced in isekai, but that is in no way an endorsement of the genre). You'll see this concept often in novels, video games, TV series, movies, and whatever other medium. That's probably part of what led to Made in Abyss being so popular. It has a fantastical, unique world, and the thematics are more personalized and meaningful than ""Okay, gang, we gotta make sure the fire spirits are nice and toasty over here and we water the earth spirits"" or whatever inane variant.  With RoLW, it's a little more realistic, with a powerful witch/warlock entity conspiring to ensure that no great power conquers the continent, playing the different sides against each other and manipulating them directly. It's actually more of a political realist take on the genre than any kind of ecological or spiritual focus that is more common. Yet the presentation of it is diluted into tedium because of the focus on the witch so effortlessly pulling Jenga blocks out of empires, as opposed to a more complex conspiracy that might lend this the depth it sorely needs.  Mizuno, as far as I can tell, is something of a hack fantasy writer. I've only seen his adapted work, so I can't say much about his novels. It probably doesn't help that the novel series this anime was based on was actually a novelization of the transcripts of some kind of D&D game. That's why this series is so generic and cliche, and it feels like the characters were ripped straight out of an RPG—that's because THEY WERE, in the most literal sense possible of an actual BO-drenched dork fest, and when the budget drops and we're panning over slideshows of dragons and knights, I feel like Ken Burns was there that day and made a documentary comprised of paintings documenting the epic and valiant D&D game and charted the perilous journey that inspired the legendary RoLW franchise. If that doesn't send a thrill up your leg than I'm not even sure you have a pulse.  Most of the characters don't have much of a purpose to the story—the whole point of all of these characters is to form a party like in an RPG. Most of them are not useful. Woodchuck hardly ever does anything, and Etoh is pretty much dead weight other than to heal characters after battle. The two mercenaries feel as if they were written in at random (they were) and almost none of the characters have distinct personalities or even motivations to maintain the party or do anything in particular. The dwarf at least had a motivation, separate from the party, but nothing about his story was compelling. Why was Deedlit even there in the first place? Because there was a sexy female elf quota, and those PVC figurines weren't going to be able to sell themselves. Parn is kept as everyman and bland as possible so any schlub can imagine himself wooing Deedlit.  Parn and Deedlit lack any chemistry, but what was especially funny is when he was asking her to stay behind and not enter the war. The intent was to show he cared about her, but he never appeared very interested in her up to that point, and hardly even during or after that point. Honestly, he spent more time casting googly eyes at King Cashew for like an entire episode than anything substantive with Deedlit. The Parn-Cashew tension was so thick I probably would have mistaken this for a yaoi, where the sought after Parn had grown jaded with female company and rejected numerous beautiful female suitors so he could mosey off with his tall and tan dessert man (don't worry, I'm sure there are plenty of fanfics fulfilling this function), and the two of them being swordsmen leads to all kinds of potential jokes that even I am tasteful enough to forego.  With the immense genericness that I've alluded to, it's hard to even recognize whether or not the writing is good, as it's so unbelievably familiar, like you could have written it yourself and then start to wonder if your fanfic was plagiarized. For what it's worth, it doesn't seem too badly scripted—just very unoriginal and predictable to the point of tedium. Half of the time, I didn't pay attention to the story, my eyes glazing over in boredom, yet I never felt like I missed a plot point at all because none of the specifics really matter. Everything they do revolves around acquiring knowledge or an item that will allow them to thwart an antagonist or some such. It could even be said that the world building is horrendous, but it's probably more accurate to state that the world itself is too dull for there to be any world to build upon at all.  The way this story was plotted was a little weird, and I wouldn't say it worked too well. The first episode is the best, and it takes place somewhere in the middle of the plot, then we're back to the beginning with Parn being a wuss, and it remains a long, bloated story that never really goes anywhere. The last few episodes are more viscous than the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, and I thought they would never end. Instead of an open ending, it's really unfinished, and you'll have to watch the lower-budget TV series that remakes most of the OVA and then continues the story. Both are mediocre at best. Immersion into the world is broken either by tedious storytelling or Ken Burns' direction or a subpar bout of storyboarding or bad and reused animation (I swear they even reversed some of the footage's orientation and shifted the colors in an attempt to trick the audience).  What is RoLW? A fantasy, if you can keep it. A fantasy should transport you to another world, but I don't get any sense of that at all. When I'm watching this, I feel like I've been transported to Mizuno's dank basement in the 1980s with a bunch of lard-asses (now I'm spinning fantasy—fat people don't exist in Japan) with cheese poof-fingers huddled around in a circle. It smells like death and the air is thick with sweat. They're pushing around cheap figurines that look just like the heroes in the dreck we know as RoLW. Mizuno is madly recording transcripts and there's the palpable dread of knowing he'll adapt this tripe into a novel that will become a sensation.";Not Recommended

0;Liz to Aoi Tori;manlyflower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/manlyflower;10;"""Liz to Aoi Tori"" is essentially a side story to the ""Hibike Euphonium"" series, and from the very start, it fully embraces that role. Fans of the TV anime will likely find themselves despairing over the limited screen-time of their favorite cast members, inching forward in their seats as Kumiko, Reina, and the rest of the now-second-year ensemble teasingly jump in and out of picture for only moments at a time. This minor frustration will only be temporary, however, as we're forced out of that frame of mind, into the soft, melancholic lens of our focal point in this movie: Mizore. Although this story exists in the same music room we've all come to know, it takes on a different hue. Owing in large part to the incredible soundtrack and fresh character designs and art direction, the tone of the movie shifts entirely, transitioning from an inspirational story of motivation and hard work into a deeply somber and introspective world.  The story itself is very simple, examining the relationship of Nozomi and Mizore in their final year in high school. It openly compares the feelings of the two characters with the piece they play, the namesake of the film, and the folktale it was based on. I was originally concerned that the comparison would end up overplayed and come off as forced, but I left pleasantly surprised. The film acknowledges the simplicity and straight-forwardness of the story, but instead of allowing itself to be confined to that, it achieves a level of technical mastery that managed to blow me away, even though I was already plenty used to the historically superb Kyoto Animation and the other wonderful works by director Naoko Yamada before watching it.  The film succeeds on such a level because it allows itself to be a single vignette in the ""Hibike"" storyline. It's not a story of hard work, a story of competition, or even a story of music. It's a simple story of two characters, and it's precisely because this aspect of it was so intimately understood by the production crew at KyoAni that such a story was allowed to flourish. There is no excess. The film brazenly jumps through time, refusing to linger on anything unnecessary while still allowing the events that clearly happen off-screen to create meaningful depth in the story. We don't focus on what practicing is like. We don't see what the characters do on their weekends. We don't listen to the girls ruminating on their feelings in the comfort of their beds. From the moment we as an audience walk with Mizore onto campus at the beginning to when we exit it at the end, all we see is what's limited to the confines of the school, to the band room and to our two leads, and everything else is left to become a sort of wistful ether that exists on the fringes of our minds. Because what was shown was clearly so carefully chosen, we come to viscerally understand the weight behind every lingering shot. It's an incredibly delicate experience, and one that could've only been realized with production quality of this caliber.  Yamada's quirks as a director have often been the subject of conversation in the anime community, but I believe that this film has been one of the best applications of those idiosyncrasies to date. Her approach to the art of unspoken communication paralleled the film's focus on Mizore, a girl unable to truly express, and at moments even understand, her own feelings. Subtle gestures such as Mizore stroking her hair not only serve to silently convey the cast's thoughts, but end up feeling as if they were sewn into the very plot itself due to how integral of a role they play. The consistent focus on the characters' legs—a mainstay in Yamada's works—mirrors Mizore's own downcast eyes, and the other camera shots always seem to look off to the side, as if shyly avoiding the characters around her. Add to this the introduction of a softer pastel art style, and we see the world brilliantly through the lens of our main characters, creating something amazingly intimate.  The soundtrack and sound direction are, hands down, the shining star of the film. It combines composer Kensuke Ushio's fragmented, minimal approach also found on his work in Yamada's previous film, ""Koe no Katachi,"" with the expertly realized orchestral arrangements that the series is known for. However, gone are the sweeping brass-heavy pieces that complimented Kumiko's role as a main character in the original series. The introduction of the new piece instead turns the focus to the woodwinds. Brass now supports from the background, and the airy voices of woodwind instruments paint the entirety of the film with a wonderful warmth that sets it apart from the main franchise. The parallel stories of Mizore and Nozomi and the girls from the folktale blend masterfully into each other because of this—from the gorgeous bass clarinet adding a sense of comforting security to the cold isolation of a ""Koe no Katachi""-styled piano piece casting an ominous tone over the characters—yet the well-timed use of other instruments such as the bassoon add the perfect amount of levity when necessary (the bassoon in particular being used wonderfully to comedic effect when the bassoonists themselves are relevant to the scene), while still staying in line with the overarching thematic style.  That's why this film works. Every aspect of it is fine-tuned to near-uncanny perfection. The psyches of each character are silently brought to the surface through each deliberate animation choice, from Nozomi's eyes darting around the room to Mizore's subconscious trembling. The soundtrack compliments each and every emotional swell—synchronized musical flourishes match footsteps and impeccably timed silences pull us devastatingly close to the most minute of actions. Each background track cuts to the core, yet never accidentally overpowers the gentle art and soft color scheme. Because of this masterful balance, all of the reactions are almost unnaturally natural, seemingly larger than life because of how lifelike they are. This kind of exaggerated humanity is an achievement only possible through the medium of animation, and even then, I have never seen it done quite like this. Although giving a full score seems like it could be a provocative statement for a film focused simply on the minutia of a measly two characters, if this movie isn't considered among the best for the sheer level of craftsmanship that it exhibits, then I really don't know what other film deserves to be.";Recommended
1;Liz to Aoi Tori;Karhu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Karhu;8;"From the world's most famous female anime director, Yamada Naoko, comes Liz and the Blue Bird. A spinoff movie of Hibike Euphonium, produced under KyoAni.   The movie focuses on two Hibike side characters, Mizore and Nozomi. The story is about their relationship and personal drama, mainly focusing around the ever present music and how it plays a part in their coming-of-age and self-discovery, giving a meaning to their life and the base to their relationship. The movie especially focuses on how hard letting go off something is, and raises the question ""are all good things really bound to end?"" This is presented in 3 different ways. Directly in daily life, inderectly and silently through audiovisual story-telling which is mainly seen via character behavior and expressions, and the third way being the symbolism of Liz/aoi tori.   The music presented is way more impactful -for myself at least- than in the actual Tv series. The art an animation is typical KyoAni for the expectation of the actual monogatari side of the story which is so fluid and gentle it looks almost fragile. Surprisingly beautiful for KyoAni who practically never tries anything new to secure mainstream appeal. Kudos for that.   Basically, this is highly similar to other KyoAni movies. In a way, it's like Tamako Love Story with different approach, but also like Koe no Katachi except this time the other lead characters is not a mary sue. For those who enjoyed these movies for their drama, and found beauty within them, Liz and the Blue Bird is more than recommendable.";Recommended
2;Liz to Aoi Tori;izumif;https://myanimelist.net/profile/izumif;9;"A Genuine Masterpiece of Yuri; Or How Shoujo Become Adult  ----------  After international success of ""Koe no Katachi"" (or, ""A Silent Voice,"") Naoko Yamada has been regarded as one of leading anime directors. In ""Koe no Katachi,"" Yamada tried to adopt the adolescent's sense of guilt as a main subject and depict how the young overcomes their difficult time of teenage, which was highly reputed both by the folk and by the critics.  As the former work shows, Naoko Yamada tends to depict teenagers' mental conflict, sour-sweet love, and attitudes towards coming future, especially girls. This is true also in the latest featured anime, ""Liz to Aoi Tori.""  ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" is a kind of spin-off of Kyoto Animation's ""Hibike! Euphonium"" series. However, though all of characters on the screen are from the TV series, there is no need of watching it before you go to cinemas. Yamada created this movie as a completely independent work.  The protagonist is Mizore, a high-school student and good at playing the oboe. Though she is spending her last year of the school, she have not decided what she will do after graduation. What she always thinks of is Nozomi, her cheerful friend, and, a member of the school band like Mizore is.  For Mizore and Nozomi's final chance of winning the national competition, a coach selects an instrumental composition, 'Liz to Aoi Tori,' which is based on a (fictitious) fairy tale. As the best players of oboe and flute in the club, they starts to practice hard, but it seems that something between them becomes an obstacle to brush up the music, and after realizing that fact the two meet each other in a biology room.  In this work, both Mizore and Nozomi's emotions and standpoints are likened to the characters of the fairy tale, Liz, a lonely girl, and the blue bird, which transforms itself to a girl and starts to live with Liz to heal Liz's sadness. In the end of the tale, the blue bird leaves Liz's house, following Liz's advice. The director, Naoko Yamada, carefully treated this tale and accomplished to make it the framework of the entire anime.  At first, we might consider that Mizore is compared to Liz, for she does not have many friends and tend to bare loneliness. In contrast, Nozomi's gregarious trait easily connects to the cheerful blue bird, which is believed to bring happiness, in our brains.  This assumption leads us to one certain understanding: this movie may be about Yuri or even girls' love between Mizore and Nozomi. True, for Mizore Nozomi is her only friend. Mizore always stands just behind Nozomi and follows her. Such acts reminds us of many Yuri anime/manga.  However, ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" is not merely a Yuri anime; it depicts how shoujo leave their teenage-like traits, as the blue birds leaves the cage. We cannot deny that ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" is a masterpiece of the Yuri culture, but this work goes beyond this reputation.  Throughout the story, Yamada rarely depicts landscapes or incidents outside the school. For teenagers, it is school that isolates them from the society; school is the cage. As long as they remain in school, they can be shoujo and avoid from being adult. However, shoujo cannot be shoujo forever, because of request from the world, and of their growing. Someday shoujo will have to fly from the nest. Yamada has already realized it and includes this school - cage metaphor in ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" to express growing of Mizore and Nozomi after going through their conflicts.  As above, Yamada's ambition easily goes beyond our expectation. What is impressive here is that Kyoto Animation and staffs of ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" met Yamada's, and our anticipation with highly-refined techniques and unusual talents. Animators succeeded to live up to Yamada's fine direction plans, from where eyes focus to tiny actions of Mizore, which reflects transition of her emotions. Drawings of the fairy tale is also worth mentioning; you might feel as if you were reading an animated picture book.  Music and sound effects are memorable, too. Kensuke Ushio, a composer, again made an unique soundtrack mainly based on notes of piano. Like ""Koe no Katachi,"" Yamada and Ushio used classical piano tunes effectively, which tells us the changes of characters' mind, their maturity and immaturity, and their growing. Sound effects helps such direction using music, so I strongly recommend you to see this work in theater.  With these sophisticated elements, Yamada tried to tell us something important. Back to the theme of this work, the director concisely showed how shoujo open a door to the world, that is, how shoujo leave their young days. As is often the case with Yamada's featured anime, words appeared in her movie are keys. At the beginning of the movie, we see an impressive word: 'disjoint.' Then, Yamada gives us another clue at the end of this work; again she indicates the word 'disjoint' and then she erases a prefix 'dis-.' Paradoxically, by disjointing we can joint; or, by jointing we can disjoint. It will not mean that in order to disjoint we have to joint something in advance; it just implies that jointing and disjointing are supporting each other. Shoujo can be mature women by jointing ties to someone and by disjointing it.  After all, Mizore and Nozomi decided to help each other, though a tragedy has set on. It is that way that they will take to grow up, which indicates us what 'joint' and 'disjoint' mean. Both Mizore and Nozomi are Liz, though the two are also the blue bird. Supporting each other, shoujo will fly to another sky. Naoko Yamada achieved to express it finely. Definitely one of the best anime in 2018.";Recommended
3;Liz to Aoi Tori;ImRingo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ImRingo;10;"One week before this film would hit US theaters, I was just learning about it. I saw some artwork from the film and thought, “Huh a music anime film. Oh it is a Hibike side-story. Sounds interesting.” Three days before I’m set to get see the film, videos on YouTube start popping up for the film. One by Lock-kun and the other by Mother’s Basement. Both videos praise the film on all accounts with Lock-kun going as far to say it’s the greatest thing they’ve ever seen. Ok well now the bar is set wayyyyyyyyyyyyy high for this film. I arrive at the theater, sit down, and prepare myself to (hopefully) enjoy one and a half hours of this Hibike side story.  I was going to include this one pre-written section to talk about my feelings about the Hibike TV show. However, it isn't needed because it doesn't matter due to what the film ends up showing. You can go into this film 100% ready without seeing the show. Yes it helps connect some dots but honestly the film does such an amazing job relaying the character troubles and interactions. You just understand each character's standing within the cast.  The film is, quite simply, the best animated drama film I've seen thus far. Going into the film I wanted to find every little issue with it due to the hype that Lock-kun and Mother's Basement started perpetuating leading up to its US release. They were though...completely correct. This film is marvelous.  The music and visuals have to be talked about together because, like with the TV show, they are married together. In the film, every scene is perfectly intertwined with visual and acoustic representation. The music dances with the animation all the way through the film; one does not lead the other. The drama (to be more precise melodrama) works because of this marriage. If one of them were over-the-top, I wouldn't be able to take the film seriously. Luckily the film pulls off this balancing act throughout the entire film.  The film tells a dual but interlinked story; one being a following of two members of the high school's concert band and the other being a glance of a townsperson meeting a new friend. The stuff that revolves around the school looks great. It is staple Hibike detail. The stuff that revolves around this picturebook-like story though is amazing. It almost comes off as a Miyazaki-esque looking film which is a huge compliment. The fact that the studio was able to juggle between these two drastically different art styles within the same film is praise worthy. The music performance scenes are also quite the treat for the eyes. One of the scenes in particular takes over 5 minutes to complete and there are no sort of cuts that force you away from the performance. So you are seeing 5 minutes of straight up musical playing animation. It's amazing, all of it.  The music made me cry alright. I haven't cried in a film since I don't know when. The music, working in tandem with the visuals, will pull on your heart strings if you are invested in the characters. From an atheistic standpoint, I loved the music. It fit the setting of the concert band really well and the music was super pleasing to listen to.  The two main characters in the film worked really well for me. They are great friends but they fundamentally misunderstand each other. The idea of having them work together on a duet solo for a song fits perfectly into their final characterization. I was sort of invested in them in the beginning but by the end I was 100% on-board.  As a side note, I thought I would be disappointed with the main cast of the TV show being sidelined but honestly it was for the best. I applaud the studio for sticking to making this film its own thing rather than fanservice in the other characters. The film also completely skipped a pool event. The film is 100% ready to show you a serious film.  My one gripe with the film is that it made the decision to skip over early characterization of the two main characters. You are dropped into the story pretty much at the tail end of their high school life. Since we don't see their freshmen and other earlier years together, I had issues early on getting invested into the characters. However, this is honestly a pretty small gripe in the grand scheme of things.  I don't know what else to really say about this film. The octopus hair wasn't octopusy enough? I left stunned with how much I enjoyed it and even now writing this review I'm still stunned. I don't know when/if I'll watch it again in my life but I'm glad that I got to see it when I did in the theater. You don't have to have seen the TV show to watch this film so you have no excuse. As soon as it comes out on DVD/BD, you must set aside some time to watch this.  Enjoyment: ∞/10 Overall: 9.5/10  Thanks for reading my review!

4;Liz to Aoi Tori;inisipis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/inisipis;9;"Liz to Aoi Tori,  First off, to those not familiar with the series Hibiki Euphorium, the movie can be viewed standalone without any knowledge of the said series, however, knowing the series and the various character in it brings an extra depth and enjoyment when viewing the movie.  The movie deals with the simple yet close relationship between two side characters in the main series and the storybook tale of the affrementioned title of the movie. Mizore is a quiet and shy character who we see in her seemingly daily routine of quietly coming to school early and wait on it's steps for her only friend Nozomi, a lively and chipper girl. The way they don't need to talk much to acknowlede the other tells us this is their usual way. Mizore plays the oboe, Nozomi plays the flute, both of them plays an important solo on the school's band.  Nozomi brought along a book that interest Mizore. The book is ""Liz and the blue"". As Mizore reads the story, she finds herself symphathizing to the lovely but very lonely Liz in the book, especially when Liz grew fond of a pretty blue that suddenly came by.  The movie's main theme about love and about growing up and about the things one must give up especially to those we truly love rings true on how both Mizore and Nozomi interpret the said fairy tail. Both girls are going into their third year and last year of high-school, they've been together for a long time as seen in the flashbacks. Nozomi is the cheerful and popular one, with lots of friends. Mizore, whose very talented in playing the oboe is rather the introvert, wouldnt even bother to help her junior in the club to play their instrument without much prodding. We get to know more of the two with film's leasurely pace and unusually bright but flat artwork while juxtaposing it to Liz's colorful sorta Ghibli-esque watercolor wash. Both of the girls had their peaceful day on the sun, but sadly everything must come to an end like all good fairytale. A precious time in their life's chapter must come to bittersweet conclusion in order to move on to next chapter in their lives, sadly like the blue bird, each have a different path they must fly too. To have the strenght to let go of the other is probably hardest thing one can do. There lies the drama of Liz and the blue bird.  The film's quite different in look and tone of the main series. I for one like the more angular flat design of the film. It presents the characters in a more direct, less enhanced look. There's still the usual quirks by Kyoani and director Yamada in the film like the constant use of rack-focus on the characters close-up face, the quirky running that the girls do... Though I don't see thue usual cutting the characters mouth kind of framing that they used to do.  The film is quite engaging. Some people might get bored at the film's slow pacing and a rather uneventful drama, but the leasurely pace let me breath in more the films atmosphere and setting, it get's me more to emphathize with the movie's two protagonist, as well as showing the series main charcters in a new light.  Once again this film is one of those you either love it or hate it. The points that one considers weakness in the story or plot are also considered it's strenght to some. It's quite hard to point a finger into it's construction without exposing one's bias to either one.";Recommended
5;Liz to Aoi Tori;SSygrt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SSygrt;10;I'm going to keep this short and simple.  I surprisingly really enjoyed this movie. Yeah I guess you could say its a little bit slow at some parts, but for me that didn't take away from this film. I cant really tell you what exactly I enjoyed about this film, the characters, storyline, the art style, everything just fit in perfectly. It really didn't feel like an hour and 30 minutes, I pretty much flew past this film in no time, and I understood the story. It was just very enjoyable for me to watch and that's why I'm giving it a 10 star rating.;Recommended
6;Liz to Aoi Tori;chumiichan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chumiichan;10;"It has been a while since I was awestruck by a movie, and I'm glad that Liz and the Blue Bird provided me the chance to watch such a beautifully made film.  At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to two people, Midore and Nozomi, who are polar opposites yet quite similar. I was confident that the two of them would portray Liz and the Blue Bird, the musical work for which they are both preparing for a competition. However, the beauty of this film lies in the subtleness that subdues itself into the factors that lead to us realizing that Midore and Nozomi are both Liz and the Blue Bird.Liz, because they are lonely and, in some ways, fearful of being abandoned. And the Blue Bird, because they realize that no matter how painful the thought is of being left behind, what is important is to move forward.  Throughout the film, I was certain with the fact that Midore (Liz) and Nozomi (the Blue Bird) will only ever encapsulate the personality of the characters they 'play' as in the musical piece they will solo for. However, this was only a shallow perspective of it; this whole time, throughout the first half of the movie, they were both Liz. Both of them were afraid of being left behind by one another. And by the end of film, they both morph beautifully into the Blue Bird, having full confidence, and though bittersweet of the thought of 'leaving', is still keen towards moving forward.  The music that was used in the film was notable, although this was a given considering how the series this film is part of is a band that plays classical pieces. And as someone who is a fan of classical music, I was met with the feeling of familiarity; the emotions that surged through me while listening to the painfully beautiful piece that Midore and Nozomi soloed for tugged at my heart strings. Not only did you feel emotion from the dialogue of the film, but also the words that etched itself in the music they have played. Although not much dialogue was shared between them regarding what they felt about and towards each other (at least, not until the end of the film), the viewers were already provided with the opportunity to understand the feelings they were trying to convey for each other and for themselves.  Although the film focuses on the relationship of Midore and Nozomi, I was very happy to see that it didn't entirely focus on that factor; they also focused on their individual growth, perfectly embodying the story of Liz and the Blue Bird.  As always, KyoAni graces us with another masterpiece. The only thing that saddens me about this whole movie would be the fact that we did not witness the competition they will take part in. Nevertheless, Liz and the Blue Bird will leave you with a feeling of contentment and the understanding of the importance of moving forward.";Recommended
7;Liz to Aoi Tori;Wirea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wirea;10;"Naoko Yamada directs a masterpiece in Liz and the Blue Bird, a beautiful story between two close and longtime friends who run into a hurdle in their relationship and as a result are both forced to take a step back and reexamine their feelings toward each other.  To get this out of the way immediately, the events of this movie take place after the events of the last episode of Hibike! Euphonium Season 2.  You can certainly watch this movie without having seen the Hibike! Euphonium TV animation series beforehand, because it was made to be a standalone spinoff to said anime series, but having done so will allow you to quickly get all the things happening in the background so you can focus your attention more on the sad, beautiful, and delicate story this movie has to show.  Now, I'm a huge fan of the Hibike! Euphonium anime series for its inspiring tale of working hard as you reach for your dreams. I particularly liked the club's advisor, Taki-sensei's, blunt and unforgiving attitude towards improvement because honestly, that's the best way to go about in the real world. But I digress. In almost direct contrast to the anime series' focus on music, rehearsals, the ever-present goal of winning that coveted gold at Nationals... this Liz and the Blue Bird spinoff focuses on much more human and close to the heart concepts, such as friendship and learning to see when a relationship is starting to become unhelpful to a person and then taking steps forward to resolve that.  The entirety of the movie's ninety minute runtime leaves little room for any of the familiar scenes in the anime series. Sure, there are a few slice-of-life scenes (an art that KyoAni has perfected) and rehearsals here and there but they definitely take the backseat in this movie. The movie takes place in the same high school and in the same wind ensemble club room that fans of the anime series have grown to be fond of, but the focal point, the viewpoint... the cinematography itself demands that you focus your attention on the two main characters in this movie, Yoroizuka Mizore and Kasaki Nozomi.  Mizore is your quiet and soft-spoken girl who is close friends with Nozomi, your lively and outgoing girl. They are both third-years at high school and members of the wind ensemble club. Both know that this is their last chance to enjoy their youthful and carefree lives before they step out into the unforgiving real world. Luckily, they are both also the aces of the club in their respective instruments so they get a chance to play a critical solo part in the club's upcoming competitions. That's a pretty good way to go out, if I do say so myself. But I feel what I've just said in this paragraph does not do these two's relationship enough justice.  The two of them have been friends since middle school. Nozomi is very introverted Mizore's first friend and definitely holds a special place in her heart. However, this relationship seems hopelessly one-sided as Nozomi, being the outgoing person that she is, views Mizore as simply another friend. Their relationship is made to go a little deeper though when Nozomi invites Mizore to join the wind ensemble club. Eventually, spending time together both in and out of club allows Nozomi to also see that Mizore is a special friend to her. Their relationship then hit a rough spot during their first year in high school but has since been resolved (watch Hibike! Euphonium Season 2 Episodes 1-4 for more details!), but not without leaving behind lasting anxiety and uncertainty in each others' hearts, especially Mizore's. This movie does a stellar job of portraying the two's pure, delicate friendship and how they resolve the aforementioned anxiety and uncertainty by reexamining their relationship.  From the get-go, Liz and the Blue Bird sets very down-to-earth expectations for itself and that never wavers throughout the movie. It doesn't try to be the next big hit in high school romances, or drama, and definitely not in the music genre like its parent story. It is, very roughly summarized, nothing but a story between two close friends who are nearing the end of their high school lives. The movie both begins and ends with a normal, everyday scene of the two of them walking to or from school and engaging in typical youthful conversation, albeit a little less chatty than expected due to the nature of one of them. From an outsider's point of view they would certainly look just like typical best friends in high school..  And this is where this movie's beauty lies hidden. We see as the movie progresses that there is so much more going on between these two seemingly inseparable friends. The movie takes care to use every precious scene with detail and craftsmanship that turns an otherwise stereotypical ""hIgH sChOoL"" anime movie into a true work of art.  Whether it is Mizore's constant uncertain glances at Nozomi, or in general just how much Nozomi's typical friendly acts and words toward her can turn her blushing red in an instant. Whether it is Nozomi's extroverted-ness shining out as she interacts with everyone. Every single emotion that the two characters feel in this movie get animated with clear distinction. You can physically feel Nozomi's surprise when Mizore asks if she can invite someone else. You can physically feel Mizore's hurting when Nozomi deliberately snobs her. I've read in an interview with Naoko Yamada that she took extra care to make sure not to ""disrespect"" the two characters' complex emotions and damn did she accomplish that in this movie! Interestingly and as an aside, Yamada showed increased interest in directing Mizore and Nozomi's story way before production and this goes to show how talented, passionate people who like what they are doing can really create the best works.  Probably my favorite part of this movie is just how entrancing the relationship between Mizore and Nozomi is. On one hand, you know they are close friends and that chances are high they will remain so for the rest of their lives. But Mizore's increasing uncertainty toward Nozomi feels like it put their relationship on knife's edge; a bubble that has grown too big. Another big rife in their friendship could very well put it to a irreversible end, but you can feel that Mizore is taking great pains (at least for someone as introverted as her) to make sure it never comes to that point, ignoring everyone else as she only really has eyes for Nozomi. On the other hand, Nozomi is just being her usual outgoing self, confident that Mizore will always look up to her, but even she comes to a point where she realizes just how vast the difference between the two of them really is and makes up her own resolve toward their friendship. At this point I can only say that my number one ship in anime has safely become MizoreXNozomi (friendship ofc) and I really hope things work out well for the two of them going further.  I've been focusing on the two main characters and their story in this review so far because after all, they are the highlight of this movie and imo, where the nail truly hits the coffin. But that is not to say that the other elements of the movie do not deserve mention. In particular, the accompanying soundtrack was really good and silent tracks were used with care in the movie's more emotional scenes. Mizore's oboe explosion at the climax was a thing of beauty to listen to as well. The different artistic style and redesigned characters really help to make this movie feel parallel to the anime series.  Liz and the Blue Bird is not a grand story, and doesn't try nor have to be. It's not a tale between fated lovers, nor a huge chronicle of working hard towards sweet sweet victory. Hell, it's not even a good drama! This movie cannot be viewed with the typical expectations that its genres seem to imply, because it deliberately exists as an independent plot point in the Hibike! Euphonium universe and therefore cannot be viewed like the anime series. I'm sure this movie's events will only get passing mention in the upcoming Chikai no Finale movie or a Season 3 (fingers crossed), and yet they have stuck with me. It's a combination of the pure and delicate love story between Mizore and Nozomi and how they reexamine and advance their relationship forward and the sheer amount of detail and craftsmanship that went into making sure both their emotions got properly expressed and felt on-screen. The sound (as expected from a music-oriented series) and art-house like visual style were the cherries on top.  Liz and the Blue Bird is a must-watch for anime fans period, but even more so for those looking to take a break from all the serious anime that have come out recently. For those that want a work executed to near perfection with skill and craftsmanship only made possible with a dedicated and talented director who respects their characters' humanity and emotions, this movie is right up your alley. People who don't care much about technical stuff and only want good content will still find Mizore and Nozomi's personal story to be a truly moving one, even if the setting seems a bit too ordinary and grounded. Even then, this movie reaches level of detail and craftsmanship seen in few other anime and that alone is enough to warrant me giving it a perfect score.";Recommended
8;Liz to Aoi Tori;OujoYunie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OujoYunie;10;Overall rating: 10/10  I enjoyed this film more than the entirety of Hibike! Euphonium, and fully recommend to give it a chance.  It is a beautiful and emotional piece of art.  All elements of the film -- the story, art and sound direction come together beautifully like orchestra music. Nothing in the film is executed at random.  Story and characters: 9/10  The story is simple and fully contained in the film, although I'd highly recommend to have watched Hibike! Euphonium before giving this film your attention. It adds much to the backstory of the relationship between the main characters, which is the core of the film.  That said, the film should be viewed differently than the anime series, as the overall tone is different (Hibike! has for the most part a casual, fun feel to it, while Liz and the Blue Bird has a more somber, mature feel).  Art and sound: 10/10  The art direction is similar to the series and beautifully executed. There isn't a single scene wasted. The soundtrack matches the scenes and emotion perfectly.  - - - I highly recommend to give Liz and the Blue Bird a chance if you've already watched Hibike! Euphonium.;Recommended
9;Liz to Aoi Tori;Rakmaninoff;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rakmaninoff;10;I have never cried for as long as i have in a movie ever. Genuinely. There were multiple points in this film where my eyes were stinging after having the tears just set in my eyes for ten minutes as a time. Granted, I was eating a solid burrito with salsa out of my spice tolerance so it seemed logical.  Then I finished eating… I was still crying.  I had intended to watch this film earlier than this, after I had finished the series of Hibike Euphonium. Yet for some reason I put it off. Life seemed busy I suppose. But as my yearning for more Naoko Yamada grew mighty and mightier, I had to check it out. For my love of her visions, and my curiosity of her upcoming projects.  My oh my what I was missing.  The aesthetics of the film already clicked with me upon seeing images of it, prior to full viewing. The character designs have this beautiful long and stretched quality. Everyone looks a lot more humanoid but int he best sort of stylised ways. It gives this instant connection and empathy through how soft & emotional the characters appear. Futoshi Nishiya, the character designer, spreads this quality through his other designs such as in The Shape of Voice. Where that same empathy can be felt. There’s an aspect to these designs where they seem like fantastical beings who are somehow only managing to survive. Which fits well with the struggles in this film. The film presentation is also top notch. Manipulating the frequently beautiful techniques of the digital anime medium that KyoAni have perfected over the past decade. The backgrounds have a dynamic form of realistic, apropos of the very grounded human drama whilst not being visually drab.  With all that has been mentioned, character design, backgrounds, and drama, the film begins with these correlating elements to introduce us to the focus of the film. It is with these attributes that create this chilling and delicate human experience that rooted me into this film head first. This is a film that so gorgeously illustrates the struggles to communicate. The interlocking conflicts that build, stemming from this moment, is a beast understandable to myself and many others. I began to really feel sorry in here as I gazed at Mizore’s, the protagonist’s, attempts to bridge and get close to people. It’s this heartbreaking difficulty that you feel as though you also haven’t built up the strength to manage it. Pushing you to be happy for her to maybe even gain the ability to speak and create an understanding between people. It’s something that tussled with me most in this film. Just watching as some characters can’t get people to understand them really shout in my head “I know”.  It’s not just Mizore that is unable to communicate properly. All of the characters are draped in this cover of unclarity which they are attempting to free themselves from and get to doing what they want. This being best communicated through the superb direction work. Naoko Yamada is known to have an infamous interest in the symbolic meaning of legs. With this film rooting that interest to its very core. The cutaways between legs always having something extra to say about the barriers between each character. Legs will even be explicitly shown changing positions as to correlate with the change in situation or role in the scene. Stand out scenes are in the beginning of the film, where there is a lot of fixed shots on legs that expertly communicate the problems our characters face. The confessions of Noizomi also stand out to me, where they effectively convey the change and reflection her character through her change in position. These details are charming with how they add dressing to the cinematography and give you something else to stare at. But ultimately, you grow to find it a very useful tool to understanding and connecting to the film that they become so important to your viewing. And there’s an appropriate amount of thought put into each scene where you can simply focus on legs as the dramatic visual to inform you on the conflict present. Frankly its hard to recall a particularly powerful moment because the imagery is so consistently embedded. But it’s also my first time viewing this film, and since it was quite an emotionally explosive session it’s fine that I didn’t soak up everything.  But I would be remiss if I just kept ogling at legs this whole time. Not that I always could anyway due to my tear stained eyes. My ears were very active throughout this film. The moments of orchestra in the original series always impressed me with how they were able to channel such emotion. Even to change the emotion with the same piece at a different time in the episode. That sense of emotion is ever present here. Especially with the swathes of silence found scattered throughout, the music delivers in portraying the perspectives and struggles of these characters and it really strikes accord with me. Much like it’s their secondary voice that we can maybe understand better than the words that presently escape them. For me at least, I can hear and feel that voice.  That is what truly devastated me at the climax of the film. All of these things unifying in this brilliant moment that was just so beautiful and powerful. It was something I could just understand so instantly. And it was as though the film proved to me at that moment how great it was. Not to say all was only revealed until that moment. But that, the mountain we climbed lead us to a place that was just what the journey was taking us towards. And that it was so satisfying to witness it, and follow everything as we came back down.  I haven’t mentioned it at all but the concept of the musical piece Liz and The Bluebird is also wonderfully integrated into the story. As are the subsequent scenes that bridge between the film. Really it’s something I don’t want to explore here because it is so beautifully put in the film. That is something which must be experienced on your own.  The one thing that doesn’t seem perfectly set with me is the pacing of this film. While I don’t find it an issue, it does have the sense that this is an extended episode of the TV series. Ultimately, I find that nature to the film charming. And if it is a longer TV episode, it is the best episode there is. This is something I’m keen to explore and feel towards upon rewatching. This uncertainty is why I would say the story as being a 9/10 but the film 10/10 overall. It is the immense lack of distaste or disinterest on first viewing that makes me feel so strongly about this film. In terms of firsthand impressions, this film has successfully captured my love. And I applaud it.  Quick things i loved without saying much: - Reed making is such a cool looking craft and I love how Mizore makes her own. - Band members hanging in musical groups is super cute and I love to see the little communities formed here. - Taki-sensei once again giving inadvertent life advice makes me wonder how aware he is of fundamentally changing the lives of these performers haha.  If I am to mention rankings, I don’t know if I would say this is definitely better than The Shape of Voice. But I’m willing to say they’re both equally fantastic and are wonderful benchmarks of Naoko Yamada’s bright and beautiful future as a director. I certainly hope to see her make as many she feels need. But all the more, it is these relatable and touchingly executed stories that invest me in the media of film. And i am always happy to see more.  Thank you KyoAni, may you heal and grow to be stronger than ever before.;Recommended
10;Liz to Aoi Tori;Prio_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prio_;10;There are movies that you know are great on first viewing.  But then there are movies that hit you so hard that you cannot wait to watch it again.  Liz and the Blue Bird was that movie for me. It only took a single viewing for me to know that this is easily my favorite movie. This movie is so powerful that a single word appearing on the screen at the beginning and end makes me want to bawl my eyes out. The character animation in particular also stands out to me. I've never seen any other piece of animation that handles facial expressions as well as this one.  The score titled Girls, Dance, Staircase is also of note here. It was recorded in the very school that the fictional Kitauji High School is based on, and it really shows. Each footstep taken is planned out as part of the music, almost making it seem like a dance of sorts. This is best exemplified in the 8 minute near-silent intro of the two girls just walking to their classroom.  The pacing is broken up by the fairy tale of Liz and the Blue Bird as Mizore reads the story over the course of the film. These segments are reminiscent of watercolor paintings and it helps to change up the setting every now and then, as the rest of the movie takes place entirely within the high school. The choice to cast the same voice actress as Liz as well as the Blue Bird (in both the sub and the dub) is an interesting one, and I think it helps add to the more whimsical feeling these segments have.  Naoko Yamada has very quickly become my favorite director, but only one of her films is separate from other series. A Silent Voice is the one most people know, but it is actually my least favorite of hers. If you enjoyed that, I implore you to give Liz and the Blue Bird a try. It can be viewed without watching the show it is tied to as the two leads are only side characters in the show.  [lifted from my letterboxd review];Recommended
11;Liz to Aoi Tori;LegendAqua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegendAqua;9;"The complexity of co-dependency and separation through time...  Liz to Aoi Tori being set after Hibike Euphonium's second season, most notably the biggest clue of that being that Yuuko is now president of the club instead of Asuka Tanaka. Anyways Liz to Aoi Tori looks more in depth to the struggling relationship between the silent stoic introvert Mizore Yoroizuka voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki to the talkative genki extroverted Nozomi Kasaki voiced by Nao Touyama.  Liz to Aoi Tori's major focus is on the relationship between the lead oboist Mizroe and the ace flute player Nozomi, however there is a little subplot referencing to the title of the movie itself, ""Liz to Aoi Tori"", told periodically throughout the movie about Liz, a baker and friend to all animals, where she befriends an injured blue bird that can transform into a human and nurses her back to health, but when the time comes for Liz to give up on the blue bird and allow the blue bird to be free, Liz reluctantly has a choice of keeping her caged forever to let her be free. This story told like a children picture book both in it's tone and animation reflect similarly to Mizore and Nozomi's relationship as coincidentally they have a duet together about this story and they struggle to be sync with one another as a result.  Both Nozomi and Mizore being the focus quite obviously gets development together as they're relationship grows more and more distant as they pick their careers and or schools they want to also being VERY similar to a similar incident between them during the second season of Hibike Euphonium with how Nozomi pushes Mizore away with her trying to quit the club, only this time in this movie it's Nozomi's choice of schools. Liz to Aoi Tori takes a rather harsh look at the co-dependency and separation and how it effects a relationship such as this, with two characters with vastly differing personalities and attitudes and how they cope with it, whether be it ignoring it or trying to improve the situation at hand.  So it comes to the point of...who's Liz and who's the blue bird?...  Liz to Aoi Tori's animation done by Kyoto Animation takes a differing approach to it's animation, not like it's anime series, the animation has a much more loose style in comparison to the more bold and detailed animation of the anime series but still as expressive in it's facial features as ever along with the beautiful backgrounds especially with it's pastel picture book like backgrounding to it's story of Liz to Aoi Tori but also it's detailed instruments with their polished look it has, to be expected from Kyoto Animation. Now the change of style is due to Futoshi Nishiya, the character designer for Free!, Hyouka and animation director of K-On! along with Futoshi is Naoko Yamada, the director who also directed in other Kyoto Ani works like K-On! as director and an Episode Director and Series Production Director of Hibike Euphonium, so they know their stuff. Nonetheless be it the animation change or not, the animation looks amazing with the special note once again by the expressive animation it has going for it makes the movie beautiful to watch even if it's a bit loose in it's style.  Voice work, well being a HUGE fan of Nao Touyama, knowing LA, ya...LA easily gives MVP to Nao Touyama for her performance, BUT LA will give major props to Atsumi Tanezaki as Mizore, sure she's voicing a rather silent and non-talkative character but nonetheless, in the little sounds, differing cadence, they make to make Mizore more believable kinda makes up for it, in voicing a character that's trying to open up but struggles to do so. With the returning Hibike Euphonium cast back together (well besides Saori Hayami, Minori Chihara and Minako Kotobuki), the voice cast is nonetheless amazing, with special mention going to Chika Anzai as Reina Kousaka. But not only that Miyu Honda who voiced BOTH Liz and the Blue Bird character, did rather well and considering she was 13 at the time, LA couldn't tell especially with her voicing Liz!.  So with soo much praise LA put on Liz to Aoi Tori, is there any flaws that LA found?, well pacing and how there is ALOT of silent lingering moments within the movie, some might say the pacing is rushed, some might say it's too slow, LA thought it was actually decent in it's pacing, sure it can actually become too slow with the silent lingering moments not helping matters, but LA doesn't see it as rushed either, as Liz to Aoi Tori takes it's time in spreading out both Mizore and Nozomi's plotline as well as Liz to Aoi Tori's plotline sparingly and all under 90 minutes no less. LA thinks it was ""just"" right in it's pacing, maybe the lingering moments were maybe a bit too long at times but nothing to rage about, it's suppose to a calming movie with some dramatic tension. The only other flaw that people might say about Liz to Aoi Tori is our main duo, Mizore and Nozomi themselves being bland....well to that LA might as well say...did you watch the movie?, they develop as characters, they might not talk about it, but the subtle changes in their behavior and their actions do the development as they break out of their archetypal characters which is even further backed up by how the story of Liz to Aoi Tori applies to Mizore and Nozomi near the end of the movie as well. To those people saying that they were bland minor characters given the limelight and they DIDN'T develop throughout this movie, they are kidding themselves.  Why is LA defending Mizore and Nozomi?, well LA was more intrigued by these two characters in the second season of Hibike Euphonium and seeing them have the majority of the focus and development in this movie was something LA wanted to know more about them and LA was more than satisfied by this.  Liz to Aoi Tori is more or less a brilliant addition to the Hibike Euphonium franchise and looking in depth into once minor characters that had some development in it's second season to being the main focus and brilliantly executing it's themes of co-dependency and separation of a relationship and implementing the ""show don't tell"" all at the same time, stylistically expressive animation and an amazing voice cast. Liz to Aoi Tori is an amazing movie to say the least and was wholly satisfied.";Recommended
12;Liz to Aoi Tori;Agent_Redacted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Agent_Redacted;9;"Above all else, no offense but I don't generally like music anime. I think that its exhausting and boring regardless of the amount I attempt to concentrate and watch properly. It's simply not my kind of thing. However, Liz to Aoi Tori became my first music anime that I actually watched until the end without yawning, getting bored or pausing it. Thanks to the fact that it's just a movie, Liz to Aoi Tori is, as I would like to think an incredible anime music movie that indicated how love is like a cage through music.  What I enjoyed the most about this movie is the music. In spite of tuning in to relaxing melodies during night time when I hit the sack. It's nice to hear relaxing songs in a movie once in a while. Sort of reminded me of..Uh..Forgot..Disney films? Yeah..I think so. Well, yeah, I also adored the connection between the two main female characters ( Mizore and Nozomi ). Since I'm a Shoujo ai and Yuri lover, I find the vibe going on between them entertaining to watch ( although I wanted their relationship to be more ""engaging"").  [SPOILER START] What I hate about this movie is the last scene. Seriously. She just turned and then suddenly the credits started rolling. What the profanity. I swear to the gods that they really were going to kiss. C'mon man, at least let me see them kiss and I'd be happy. [SPOILER END]  Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I find it relaxing and entertaining at the same time. Kind of reminded me of the old times when I still play piano. Ah, the nostalgia. Anyways, I recommend this to everyone. Not forcing you to watch it, but you should check it out.";Recommended
13;Liz to Aoi Tori;whalewhale;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whalewhale;9;This movie starts out slow, not unlike most great anime movies, In This Corner of the World, Wolf Children, A Silent Voice. And the movie rewards you for your patience.  The composition of the plot is clever. Little by little, you understand the slow build up in the beginning. It is clear to you why each scene, unimportant to you as you had watched it, was actually crucial in shaping how you viewed each character, and how you view that character now, and why that scene you thought was pointless has made the tension of the plot, the depth of the characters, so visceral to you now.  Of course, not all questions are answered. Maybe some will be unhappy about this, but those people will also have been unhappy about Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, right? At the end of the day, this anime is about human interactions. And this anime has succeeded in portraying what is perhaps one of the most sophisticated relationships, complete with emotion and desires, in anime movie history. And it has succeeded in making the viewer, walking away from that cinema, feel all of those emotions for himself (herself).  To top it off, the music and art are beautiful, especially in a show where music is not just BGM but also an integral element of the plot. You wouldn't expect any less from Kyoto Animation.  Read on for my more thorough critique, but with spoilers.  I thought it was clever. Of course, the movie was very slow to start. And then, I found myself thinking that it was going too fast. All of a sudden, Yoroizuka had become super expressive, which I didn’t expect. When she stepped up to hug Nozomi, I didn’t see that coming, and couldn’t help but think that they were rushing the plot. But in general, the evolution of Yoroizuka, and the whole relationship, was clever. As I said previously, it certainly is the case that some of the unspeakable frustrations that manifested in the earlier scenes proved invaluable in characterizing and evolving the relationship.  I was confused by the birds. At the beginning, I knew that the movie was trying to tell me one was Yoroizuka and one was Nozomi, but I honestly couldn’t figure out which was which. Was Nozomi actually like the blue bird at the start? That was kind of a stretch, and both characters were already far more fleshed out to me than Liz and the bird, so I couldn’t strongly feel that the movie had intended Yoroizuka to seem like Liz at the beginning. Of course, I realized that that was the metaphor some time early enough for me to see that the movie was using this clever twist, but unfortunately it just wasn’t clever enough (or wasn’t executed well enough) to make me fall for it early on. (Not sure if everyone feels this way, but my guess is that most people would be somewhat confused at the beginning.)  Perhaps one more nitpick is that I don’t feel the orchestra motif working very well anymore. Sigh, it’s amazing music, and it is clear, but it is like a little too clear. It’s somewhat annoying when you’re doing so well with these scenes of unspoken tension, interspersed with the awkward cuteness of that girl whose name I don’t think I ever bothered to learn, and then you have this cheap orchestra scene where you need the guest teachers to tell you that your two characters have a problem they need to sort out. And that the precise problem they're facing is strongly characterized in their music.  So I felt these things were weak, but then again, I think I can overlook them because it’s a movie about emotions and relationship, and it doesn’t have to answer all my questions about the technical aspects of the plot. At the end of the day, there are some solid emotions there, oozing out of the screen, even. And a complex, difficult to portray relationship between two girls was fairly successfully portrayed. That’s nice.;Recommended
14;Liz to Aoi Tori;GuanYu_7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GuanYu_7;8;I were not the biggest euphonium fan out there, honestly i watched the series for Kumiko's sake. I enjoyed it (i rate it 7/10) but melodrama isnt my favorite theme and i really couldn't relate to its drama in the point that i find it useless and annoying. But the other things that explored were very interesting and many interactions were beautiful made. The only reason that i finally decide to watch Liz to Aoi Tori was the visuals. Im far from dissapointed to that and from the first momment amazing Kyoani animation draw my attention. I expected that movie's sound design was great but the first time that i hear the sound from their footsteps left me speechless. Great work to the music as well and in every detail like everytime that they touch/fix their intrumentals.  The Liz to Aoi Tori story was by far the most significant and huge theme in the movie, color's palette was outstanding, the scenery has a fresh feeling and in generally that is how a great 2018 anime should be like. Every detail was perfect illustrated, and the animation was at its peak. Μy only objection is that i want to give more screen time in this part. The feeling that those two lovely girls give me is one of the best momment in 2018 so far.  In other hand the main movie's theme which was the story of the 2 main characters were not able to follow the perfect flow of thebook's story. Special techniques have been used in the area of the animation and the result was almost 100% flawless, except that one scene, the most intense scene, where blur annoying me a bit. Like i said melodrama isnt my favorite gerne so i couldnt enjoy the movie the way i want but fortunately the lovely momments and the interaction of the two mc's when they were closer to each other were enough to love the movie.  I hope Kyoto Animation to work in simular stuff indeed, especially in the style like the blue bird's story has and stop the yuri bait, please make it canon :);Recommended
15;Liz to Aoi Tori;288124;https://myanimelist.net/profile/288124;9;"As of writing this, I've rewatched this movie around 5 times. But rewatching anime films is nothing out of the ordinary. Nor is picking up on new details and artistic touches each time; I've spent a similar amount of time picking apart the meaning behind Naoko Yamada's other masterpieces, Koe no Katachi and K-On. Unlike those two, however, Liz and the Blue Bird manages to stay fresh every time.  Firstly, to get this out of the way: Liz is, in my opinion, a functionally standalone film. Some knowledge on how Nozomi and Mizore's conflict played out in Hibike! Euphonium Season 2 may help, but it's not necessary.  Considering the almost laughably minute scope of Liz's plot - one setting, one ephemeral friendship, one tiny time frame - the idea of it being able to produce continuous novelty and excitement seems far-fetched. Liz's workaround, cliched as it may sound, is to dive into the micro, rather than the macro.  Nowhere is this more prominent than in Liz's opening sequence. Koe no Katachi starts with bombastic youthful exuberance, a slideshow of Shoya and his friends living the time of their life backed up by a charming 1960s hit. K-On's movie chooses a similarly intriguing way to begin, subverting our expectations of the band before revealing it all to be part of a prank. But Liz hits a far different chord, with only one short exchange occurring in 6 minutes of otherwise narrative silence, supported by Kensuke Ushio's ""wind,glass,bluebird"". For a movie about music, these wordless 6 minutes were as much an introduction to the main cast as a display of cinematographic and directorial flair. Nozomi drops her indoor shoes carelessly onto the ground, while Mizore elects to softly lay them down. Nozomi spins on the spot before entering the music room, but Mizore stands still, watching her friend walk further and further away into a gradually whitening screen. And that's JUST the first SIX minutes.  At this point, Liz has already shown its hand. There are no major plot twists, no world-shaking drama, no big objective the characters must struggle to, but inevitably achieve. Life is rarely so outspoken and clear-cut, after all.  Rather, Liz stakes its hopes on touching its audience with a humble, realistic depiction of youth. No one has the answers to everything, not unless you're an edgy 14-year old with the ability to hack a VR game from within. No one is ever confined to a stereotype, and no one ever really knows the true consequences of what they are doing. By placing such great emphasis on each action and reaction, we are able to grasp how the actions that one party regards as typical can be perceived by the other as monumental. Characters lie to the camera just as much as they lie to each other, appearing to respond in one way, but showing minute cracks in their facade which point towards another. Truly, nothing can really be condensed down to concepts as simplistic as ""tsundere"", or ""happily ever after"". We must learn to respect the different perspectives and emotions that everyone around us faces, lest we hurt our friends in ways we may not even be aware of.  That attention to detail isn't just limited to our main duo either; Yuuko, Natsuki, and Ririka could've been lazily written solely to advance the plot, but through the difference between their interactions with Nozomi and Mizore, we see how differently the two are perceived by their closest friends, and the delicate ground everyone must tread.  It goes without saying too that Liz would not be nearly as outstanding without its music. The composition of the titular piece, ""Liz and the Blue Bird"", is beautifully sad in its own right, but by scattering snippets of it throughout the film, its emotional payoff is that much more significant. Kensuke Ushio does just as good of a job in Liz as in Koe no Katachi, with individual tracks like ""reflexion,allegretto,you"" heightening the emotions evoked by their accompanying scenes, while changes in musical tone indicate shifts in emotional states and perspectives. For lovers of Liz's parent series, Hibike! Euphonium, this attention to musical detail would come as no surprise.  Liz respects its characters. Liz respects the modest scope it starts with. Liz respects the uncertainty that clouds everyday existence and interaction. It would've been so easy to invoke ""the power of friendship"", creating rifts in Nozomi's and Mizore's relationship while introducing a larger challenge they had to overcome together so they would necessarily advance towards a happy ending. If one looks at the general plot outline of Liz, that may very well be the conclusion drawn. What does a ""happy"" ending mean, though? There's no clear goal achieved at the end of the show. No one's life has been significantly altered, and Nozomi's and Mizore's relationship barely changes from the movie's beginning.  What's been achieved, however, is infinitely more important than some tangible victory. It is mutual understanding and acceptance, and in our day and age, it's something we all need.";Recommended
16;Liz to Aoi Tori;SCLFI;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SCLFI;9;Liz to Aoi Tori’s as good a sequel to Hibike Euphonium as I can hope to expect, and clearly they weren’t slacking off, much like the rest of the series, it’s got a rather simple story, but makes up for it with some outstanding animation, character, and direction, also this time around the main character is Mizore, the oboe player you forgot existed.  I should probably talk about Mizore a bit since she’s the main character now and all, and to describe her briefly, she’s socially retarded – doesn’t talk much, too attached to her one friend, Nozomi, can’t really make decisions, and everyone else thinks this is because she doesn’t like them. Ultimately, she is socially retarded, not for the purpose of comedy or moe (as is the case with Tomoko, Hitori Bocchi, Mikuru, or basically any other anime character), but because it is an integral part of her as a person. It is certainly more believable than the listed examples, and she is a compelling character for this reason, since the story is primarily about having to make a difficult decision, and the manner in which this person who has to decide for herself for once rather than just going with what Nozomi wants since that’s no longer a viable option, maybe I’m biased towards her since she’s almost an exact replica of how I behaved in high school, but biased as my reasoning may be, she is a splendidly written character. Considering that Kumiko does share a fair number of her aforementioned traits, I have to say that Mizore is the one I much preferred, maybe because making a ‘gweh’ every time you’re uncomfortable prevents them from displaying serious emotion from the character in the same way, and perhaps more importantly, proxemics. I’ll try and keep the comparisons to a minimum, but it is certainly something to consider, Reina seems to really enjoy violating Kumiko’s personal space, very much of the time, for very little reason, whereas Mizore is more or less entirely physically distant from everyone else, her and Nozomi are only seen close to each other during intimate moments, which by extension, gives them more weight.  I mentioned direction earlier, which proxemics is a part of, so I should expand on that, the animation’s as good as the standard that Hibike already set, even if a little different, I wouldn’t say it looks any better or worse than the previous titles, nor do I particularly see much of a thematic or symbolic change either, perhaps it was just to make it unique for its own sake, which there’s nothing wrong with, only other thing to add is Reina looks remarkably like Mio Akiyama now, and also there is one scene in which she confronts Mizore, but apologises after going too far, which I considered to be out of character, but maybe that’s the reason why the art’s different, it’s from Mizore’s perspective, sort of like that one scene in Pulp Fiction where when it’s from Jules’ perspective the dialogue’s slightly different. More generally, the usage of visuals and cinematography is top notch, lots of close ups, long takes and POVs which creates a very personal feel, and one thing I really appreciated is how there was still action going on when they decided to show action during the intertitle, minor as it may be, never really liked how most the time they have to stop everything to show you a blank screen for the intertitle, it’s called a movie, I’m here to watch shit moving. Furthermore, the soundtrack was quality as well, in particular, how a lot of the time it wasn’t there, which may seem like a backwards thing to be praising for a series that is about music, but I can appreciate a director who understands that there are some scenes where the addition of music would only harm the overall experience, and given the nature of most of Mizore’s interactions, there are quite a lot of them, that isn’t to say there’s no music at all, they still end up performing, and it’s as good as ever, albeit if your interest is music first, characters second, then you would be better off with another Hibike title.  Ultimately, Liz to Aoi Tori is a refinement of the Hibike formula, it detracts from the musical side of things, replaces its main characters who were already well written and produces even better ones, beyond the fact that I think the story of Liz and the Blue Bird (a fairytale that is a metaphor for the main characters) gets a little more screentime than is really necessary, and there were one or two instances of symbolism that I felt were a bit lacking in depth, apart from that, I don’t think I can really say anything negative about this film, every detail, every facet, every line of dialogue, everything is performed optimally, the artistry that went into the creation of the film is unparalleled.;Recommended
17;Liz to Aoi Tori;nazsa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nazsa;9;"The latest addition of the ""Hibike! Euphonium"" series just came out in Bluray a few days back. It's a movie named ""Liz to Aoi Tori"" or ""Liz and the Blue Bird"". The movie continues from the 2nd season of the anime and focuses on the two 3rd-year students of Kitauji High School, Nozomi Kasaki (plays flute) and Mizore Yoroizuka (plays oboe). The movie mainly focused on the origin and development of their friendship and their individual decisions about their future after graduation. The movie also tells a fantasy story of Liz and a blue bird as an analogy of the friendship between the two girls. The movie is designed in a way that it can also be watched as a standalone, though I won't recommend it. +Plus points+ Story (the strongest feature of the movie) Background art (awesome, as expected from KyoAni) Music (really good and up to the mark) -Minus points- Character design (a little dull, compared to the background artwork) Shoujo Ai vibes (?)  **All in all, I really enjoyed the movie.

18;Liz to Aoi Tori;veemon23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/veemon23;10;"I feel like this movie is kinda of underrated... I would've never watched it myself if I didn't know it was a part of Sound Euphonium. I mean apart from it, it's stand alone as a great movie, but without without the first part, I won't have watched this. Since I'm not a guy who really cares for music in real life and with anime it's still pretty much the same thing. Since most of the time, I care more about the dialogue and the plot and what I'm seeing then what I'm hearing. But the music, not as in background music, but the piece of Liz and The Blue Bird speaks on so many different volume... it is both moving and sad at the same time... it's a beautiful piece of art  The visual is beautiful, it is so unique compared to most other anime and I loved it. It was simple but yet because of it, it convey so much emotion in their characters, the way the eye flickers, to the way the hair moves, or the way they move their legs or body, there is so much unspoken words being spoken through body language. Just from the first early scene how we see the two walking, how they way they move, it speaks to how their characters are. How they handle themselves and their personality, the more outgoing and the more shy quiet girl.  One of my favorite friendship anime, yes you can say this is ""yuri bait"" or this is ""yuri"" but whatever, I'm not here to debate that. Just taking it at face value, this is a beautiful friendship that we see between two girls. To truly love someone, we must learn to let them go, so that they can truly be free and grow.  I can sit here and try to breakdown this whole anime and there's a lot you can say about it, but I'll just say this is a beautiful work of art and one of my favorite movie of all time. The plot is so simple but it's so relatable. I think as you get older, this becomes more relatable, but as someone who's younger, I guess it won't relate to them as well. For me, just thinking about all those friends I love, who I have to part way with, just because we walk different path now doesn't mean we aren't no longer friends or stopped caring for one another. The whole thing is, we're still on the same road, just it's split up now, but we can always trace back and be glad we had a friend who once walked the path with us so we weren't alone. Even if we feel alone now... the only way to truly feel alone is have truly felt loved.  This is a masterpiece, one of the few films I will truly say is 10/10. Even though I would give other things 10/10 but more of my pure enjoyment and my personal bias opinion and not as a critic. But this one as both a fan and critic, I would say deserves to be called that.";Recommended
19;Liz to Aoi Tori;shootin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shootin;9;"When I first heard about Liz and the Blue Bird, I was quite conflicted. Hibike! Euphonium's second season was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever watched because of how much I didn't enjoy Mizore's arc. It got to the point where I dropped the show and never came back to it even after the arc was over. Creating a movie that expanded on something that drew me away from the franchise did not excite me one bit.  I decided to give it a shot anyway, seeing that I can't judge the side story based on the parent story, and boy was I surprised.  I'm not sure what the motivation behind this project was - whether it was envisioned to be a fix to the original Mizore arc or a passion project. I'm not even sure whether or not this is part of the original source material. But I know for sure that Naoko Yamada did a brilliant job taking over this film.  Liz and the Blue Bird was everything that Hibike! Euphonium's second season should've been. Instead of giving us the snoozefest forced drama seen through Kumiko's perspective, we got to see how Mizore and Nozomi's relationship actually worked in THEIR perspective. Can you believe how much could change if you simply changed the main characters themselves and not have it be played out from a third-party perspective just because they're the main character? Yes you can because that actually makes so much more sense.  But don't misunderstand me. Changing the perspective doesn't automatically make the film good. What sold me on the film was how brilliantly it managed to portray their relationship. Very little dialogue was used in the film. What Yamada did, was simply put together a bunch of scenes in Mizore's perspective, and transition those groups of scenes between an animation of the ""Liz and the Blue Bird"" picture book. Simply animating the picture book itself and comparing it with the following scenes was enough for the viewer to make connections between the two. Simply showing a normal interaction between Mizore, Nozomi, and the rest of their classmates was enough for the viewer to understand the relationship between the two. Absolutely no explanation was needed - the viewer just needed to pay attention to what was going on.  I'm not really a fan of shy and quiet characters because it's hard for them to stand out and express themselves. However, Naoko Yamada really has a gift for bringing these types of characters to life. It was easy to emphasize with Mizore's behavior, especially in contrast to extroverted characters around her. She reminded me of Shouko from Koe no Katachi, which Yamada also directed. Shouko had trouble expressing her feelings because she was deaf. Even though she couldn't hear or speak properly, the viewers can still understand how she feels because of how well the scenes portrayed her body language and feelings. The same goes for Mizore. There were so many scenarios in which she wanted to express her feelings but Nozomi was too dense to realize it. We know exactly how she feels based on her actions and how she copes with rejection. Shy and quiet characters are difficult to understand because they don't often use words. But they have the greatest and deepest potential to understand because we focus on everything else they do instead.  I'm glad Hibike! Euphonium still gets a lot of attention from KyoAni because it was a very unique project that they took. Seeing Liz and the Blue Bird made me realize how beautiful you can make films without having to resort to any clickbait or flashy material that many Hollywood and mainstream anime use. It's not the premise that makes it good, but the direction and emotion that the creators put into it. And with that, I'm definitely looking forward to the next Hibike! Euphonium movie that will be released next year.";Recommended
0;Liz to Aoi Tori;llimdaert_hpue;https://myanimelist.net/profile/llimdaert_hpue;5;It's nearly impossible for someone interested in the anime industry not to have heard of Yamada Naoko. Her personality-focused direction on K-On! is arguably what turned it into a hit and raised it above its contemporaries. More recently, she directed Koe no Katachi, a film that seemed to signal a move into a more art-house style with unusual shot compositions, a minimal soundtrack and a meandering pace. While the film had many flaws, its personal message resonated with a lot of people, further shining a light on Yamada's talent. With this in mind, it was clear that Liz to Aoi Tori would be well received, even from the conceptual level - a down-to-earth, character-driven drama tied to an existing franchise, directed by the person who does that best, with a heaping helping of symbolism. However, in my opinion, the final product can be described as nothing other than a waste of talent.  First of all, the visuals. If KyoAni is known for anything, it's their high quality artwork and animation. However, in this case they're oddly mediocre while acting more flashy than ever. Characters have their hair flap around wildly to show off fluid key animation that everyone knew they were capable of anyway and doesn't add anything to the scene other than a distraction, while the background art consists of uncharacteristically low detail surfaces which seem to have been made completely separate from the foreground objects (and not in a superflat way, there was clearly an effort to portray depth within the frame). The transitions don't guide the viewer's eyes so much as throw them all over the screen, and there's a lot of random cutaways to objects lying around the room or to the side of a character's limb without any real purpose or meaning, not to mention it rarely goes more than two cuts without an obnoxious depth-of-field effect that puts winter's Violet Evergarden to shame.  The plot moves at the slowest of paces, and while that isn't a problem in and of itself, it makes the narrative progress (which is almost exclusively located in the last 20-30 minutes) feel jarring and unearned when it comes. There's a heavy focus on a story which our two main characters are obsessed with and constantly relate themselves to, even though thematically it turns out that the story doesn't fit either of their situations very well, making it feel like wasted time which is especially egregious when coupled with the aforementioned pacing.  On the other hand, the sound design is pretty exceptional (it was directed by Youta Tsuruoka and Kensuke Ushio after all), and I have no complaints regarding it. It really helped sell the reaction to Mizore's performance around the climax and the evocative dreamlike melodies may have been what kept me from completely disliking the film.  All in all, I don't regret watching it but I can't see myself rewatching it or recommending it to anyone. 5/10;Mixed Feelings
1;Liz to Aoi Tori;whatsosticky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whatsosticky;5;This is loved to death by so many, yet I found it to be so undyingly slow. It just went on and on and on. Maybe it's because of the expectations I had going in and that was a letdown in the end (well, by half-way through, honestly.) Their relationship is entirely unhealthy for both of them and I know that it isn't a total secret to either one of them, really, especially Mizore when she states that she just can't let the bluebird go away. There is merit to the story, but I don't find it to be all that engaging.  That being said, there is such a lack of anything moving, nothing that provokes emotion, nothing to truly make you feel anything as the story goes by. Everything is just stale. The visuals are undeniably drab and do nothing to initiate any increase or decrease in the story, emphasizing key plot points or changes in the story, good or bad. There was just a constant pale light that cast itself over everyhing, leaving a disappointing water color appearance in every aspect. Trees and flowers are accented when the should be, but they shouldn have had something more besides that. It would have been nice if they had even added some flare to pronounce the groups of instruments when they were together, just to show some sort of passion or desire. Music is meant to make you feel and move and do and just be something special. Find more! The total lack of all of this together made for one very long, 90-minute watch.;Mixed Feelings
2;Liz to Aoi Tori;DiplomaticSonDS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DiplomaticSonDS;5;This was odd for me personally because over the years my opinion on things has changed drastically. And one of those things was anime. I sorta have a lot of explaining to do but really I'm not bothered, so for now i'll just list off my personal thoughts on the film to give an idea of what I mean.  This is my third time seeing this and on each viewing was a totally different experience. First time I was instantly in love with it and giving the soothing melancholic nature to it really connected with me, it was something I hadn't felt before at the time and that kind of blew me away. Second time I didn't get too much out of it but I remember picking up on a few little details I missed and mostly just appreciating the animation/production put into this (take note this was long after first viewing). And finally on third viewing I was... well... as you'd expect probably, left a little disappointed. So, much of my problems sorta come from a stylistic approach the film takes, and I would like to point some of them out at least.  I wasn't very keen on the soundtrack taking up a large chunk of the scenes. I would've preferred more silence or instead having the ost being played in the universe of the film as the scenes were taking place, kinda like the way Michael Haneke (sorry for abstract reference) does it. To me it would have felt not only more appropriate but less jarring too, making the film feel less repetitive than it actually is. I'm also not a fan of the whole fairy tale aspect. Its not a bad idea but I feel like there were better ways of exploring these themes & these messages without that aspect and putting such a huge emphasis on it - that element felt quite on the nose to me.  And sadly I just could not connect with the characters. I'm not so opposed to the idea of a character we know nothing about just as long as there's a purpose or its a decision made in service of the film's purpose. Unfortunately these rules don't make themselves very clear in Liz and the Blue Bird. I didn't really care what was going on between the characters, I didn't care about their relationship. I was mostly just waiting for something integral to happen but for the most part it was just meandering from beginning to end. But whenever there was drama it felt wasted, nothing came from them that felt like it would have any sort of a genuine impact on a story like this. And this is a problem I've had with anime for a while now.  There is definitely a lot to be desired here. I was ultimately dissatisfied with the conclusion of this film but it had me wondering, what could really fix this? There is a masterpiece in here somewhere, perhaps there already is and I'm just not seeing it right. But sadly I must confess. Anime has never really been a genre I connected with deeply, but I for some reason still ended up seeing a large chunk of them, most usually for guilty pleasure purposes. So, I would like to hear other peoples thoughts on this film. Maybe I'm just viewing it with the wrong perspective and if so, give me yours cause I'm interest to see what you got out of it.;Mixed Feelings
3;Liz to Aoi Tori;PeachyKinoko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PeachyKinoko;6;Personally, this movie is a 9/10 for me, but I can see a lot of problems that would make it 1/10 unwatchable for most viewers, so I rate it 6/10 to split the difference.  One big issue is that even though the movie has multiple layers of story, it lacks a literal layer. On the surface, it's just two girls having a rough spot in their friendship and worrying about their career surveys. That's a big deal-breaker for most watchers. Even if the deeper layers of interpretation in the story are expertly crafted, it is extremely difficult to get invested enough to watch that closely if the action of the plot is basically nonexistent. A lot of people will feel biased and say that the lack of plot doesn't matter, or even that it's a good thing because of minimalism or some crap, but let's be real, it's boring as shit if nothing really happens.  Once you actually get invested, the movie is surprisingly emotional. The director did a fantastic job of making these characters feel *real*. There are a lot of subtle nuances that really convincingly tell a story of depression, anxiety, isolation, etc. Basically it hurts . . . in a good way.  The real strength of the film is in the allegorical layer. The director frequently juxtaposes scenes to lead you into a particular line of interpretation only to blow your mind in the last 30 minutes by flipping everything you thought the movie was going to be on its head.  Unfortunately, all of that will just fall flat if you aren't invested in the first place, so if you watch the first half and don't feel anything, even a single iota of pain, then you might want to give up on the movie and try to watch it again later.  Final verdict: Watch it at 2x speed if you can, or else the movie will drag and it's hard to get invested. If you can get emotionally invested, then this is the movie for you.;Mixed Feelings
4;Liz to Aoi Tori;KamiAMG;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KamiAMG;6;the movie is progressing very slowly. i like the way they show the emotions but generally its not a masterpiece. I cant say im not bored while watching and i wont lie that it didnt gets my interest. yes its a good movie but if you watched hibike you can understand what will happen at the end. Art is perfect and we know characters from hibike my general enjoyment is 6 so i decide to rank it 6.  this series gets people's interests because they did the senario like yuri. maybe this anime movie is but its pretty clear that hibike's not.

0;Liz to Aoi Tori;Libido_Kamen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Libido_Kamen;2;Animation-wise and directing, absolutely phenomenal. Unfortunately, the writing was just straight up bad in most aspects. The core romance was really powerful, definitely a good character dynamic there on the compositional level, and some strong emotions are brought out, but the actual characterization, the dialogue, the structure, etc. was just really subpar. The picture book scenes also didn't really do anything worthwhile and could have been abbreviated to dialogueless 20 to 30 second chunks if they really needed to be there. Regardless, it's easy to do this kind of character animation-driven storytelling wrong, especially since it often feels gimmicky, but KyoAni has always done it impeccably;Not Recommended
1;Liz to Aoi Tori;ambien;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ambien;4;"1. The Direction - Naoko Yamada I know you're aping the whole Shinkai thing of randomly zooming into landscapes and utensils to show how RICH and BEAUTIFUL life in the anime world is compared to the bum crapsack that is reality, but can i ask why there were nearly a hundred shots of their legs in this film? This film is a Freudian field day.  2. The Writing - Tatsuya and Yoshida 2.1 Someone tell them that the character development is supposed to go AFTER the climax. And no, vaguely hinting at their personalities by having a dozen scenes of everyone playing patty cake doesn't count as development. 2.2 Every time they used the device of the girls saying something simultaneously to be cutesy a little part of my critical thinking shriveled up and died forever, scattered to the desert winds, presumably.  3. The Editor - Kenge Shigemura There are a lot of people who I could blame for half of this movie being ridiculously overexposed. It often felt like staring into the sun. My retinas threatened to form their own FLQ and detach before they burned out. I will pick on Shigemura because it was presumably his job to look at the film and say ""I need snow blinders to watch this! This is unacceptable!"" before it was released.  CONCLUSION: If you've ever seen a single Makoto Shinkai film you know what to expect. There's a bunch of pretty shots, then two characters who we have no investment in waver and waffle around until they need to melodramatically part forever.  More than anything, I mostly feel bad for the genuinely talented animators and musicians whose efforts have been recruited to make the 9000th forgettable film to be loved only by teenage girls and the musky, fully grown men who are convinced the world must know  ""ANIME IS A REAL ART FORM!

0;Liu Xing Huan Jian;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;2;"Meteor Magic Sword is a wuxia style donghua set in an Ancient Chinese era following Ye Bugui, a cultivator of Sword Spirit Island left to integrate onto the country to wander. He meets up with his female fellow disciple and they go on adventures with other disciples and people they meet along the way. The journey is riddled with conflict as Ye Bugui has a powerful spirit/blood which sends demons and martial cultivators his way. While exploring, Ye Bugui also befriends demons as he hears of their past and backgrounds, some even joining his travelling party.  Story & Character: 2/10 Meteor Magic Sword is a chinese CGI donghua that, from the synposis appears interesting and different from other cultivation wuxia stories. This series tries to implement light hearted comedy, suspenseful emotion-evoking drama, fluid and powerful fighting scenes and a diverse character party all in the span of a 7 hour first season. The show is so hard to follow because the comedy is just Ye Bugui being abused or doing something dumb and hurting himself, the suspense is literally that Ye Bugui's party chases after a mysterious hypnotic witch while also finding themselves in dangerous life or death situations inevitably being saved by plot armor and also running away from enemies that covet Ye Bugui's blood/body for his ancestral powers. All of this is happening while the characters make small talk every 5 seconds to fill the episodes which is just terrible structure for an anime. It doesn't help either that Ye Bugui's personality is the type to think out loud while in the middle of a fight or an important situation - his dialogue drags out any situation he's in making it such a terrible viewing experience.  Art & Sound: 4/10 The series has subpar art and animation to be released in 2021; In almost all episodes involving an inn/foodstall/shop the same exact owner is running it - I understand that this may be part of the novel which I haven't seen or a budget issue but it's just bad asset management.  This series uses some suspenseful rock music as the backing track for fights against demons which is surprising since for the era and theme, you'd usually use some music that suits the time period and trend of music geographically but I guess if the series has terrible story and characters there's no exception to music choice.  Enjoyment & Overall: 1/10 & 2/10 I visited this anime with an open mind but as soon as I noticed the main character being useless and his objective not being clear within the first 2 hours of the show I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this. No progress toward the narrative was made in 60 episodes and it's probably because the studio followed the novel line for line and adapted every single detail into animation. This is a lazy way to adapt as it adds some details that could be removed to save time, plot consistency and budget but I guess it's not valued since it was blatantly copied.";Not Recommended
0;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Link_of_Hyrule;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Link_of_Hyrule;9;"**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**  Like most sequels to beloved classics, expectations were quite high for Little Witch Academia 2. Considering that it was practically funded out-of-pocket by fans of the original short film via Kickstarter, anime fans really had every right to demand their money’s worth on this one. With the quality of the original and the hype that was created thereafter in mind, my inner cynicism led me to believe that LWA 2 was set up for failure. However, much to my delight, it can be said without hesitation that LWA 2 recaptures the magic of its predecessor and yet again contains more energy and charm in its little finger than the entirety of the modern anime comedy genre has in its whole body.  Synopsis: Akko and her friends are tasked with organizing the annual “witch parade” for their town. As you might have guessed, not everything goes according to their plan.  If ever there was a difficult characteristic to describe, it would be “charm”, and yet it is just that which makes LWA 2 such an entertaining and heartwarming film. It captures that innocent, child-like sense of imagination and wonder that never fails to pry your lips upwards into a smile, and does so with the utmost perfection. Despite being an adult male, this movie made me giggle like a little girl from beginning to end. It’s not just heartwarming; it’s hilarious. The comedy is spot on and it hits every note that it needs to hit. Something about this anime brings back that Disney-esque feeling of seeing your wildest dreams brought to life by the power of animation; like seeing Fantasia for the first time. In an industry that many feel lacks the soul that it once had, LWA 2 has soul in spades. It reminded me why I like anime to begin with.  Another masterful aspect of this film was the fact that its pacing was flawless. Every scene has a purpose, not a single one of them drags on for too long, and no scene is a boring one. The fast, energetic pace of LWA carries on into its sequel, and it fits the spirit of the show to a T. Despite being less than an hour long, this movie goes through a full, satisfying story arc, several character dynamics, and effectively expands upon its cast of colorful characters. There’s something beautiful about the simplicity of a well-executed children’s tale; the premise isn’t anything remarkably original, but it doesn’t have to be because the execution is all that matters. The characters don’t have remarkable amounts of depth, but they don’t need to; all that matters is that they have personality, they are entertaining, and they are likable. Disregarding a recap scene or two, which you could potentially argue were unnecessary, I wouldn’t change a thing about the story direction.  One of the most important aspects of an anime in this style is the animation. When you write a quirky, upbeat script, it is absolutely imperative that your animation is equally quirky and upbeat, otherwise the show is doomed to fail. Needless to say, Studio Trigger totally nailed it, just as they did in the original. Comedic timing is something so nuanced that it comes down to fractions of seconds, and while many lighthearted anime (even the good ones) can sometimes find themselves a bit off on their timing or not executing jokes as well as they could have, LWA 2 has no such issue. It is no exaggeration to say this movie makes the most of each and every scene. The visuals are like eye candy, everything is polished and crisp, the character designs continue to be brilliant, and every movement is about as fluent as you’ll ever see. Simply put, it’s animation done right.  To sum it all up, LWA 2 is a brilliantly executed anime movie that appeals to everyone. All ages, all genders, and all cultures won’t be able to resist cracking a smile at a movie that is simply so much fun. It’s a fast-paced, heartwarming adventure that will bring out your inner child, and I highly recommend that everyone take the time to watch it. If you ever need a pick-me-up, I can’t think of another anime that will cheer you up more than this one.";Recommended
1;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;lawlmartz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lawlmartz;9;"""Never, ever underestimate the importance of having fun."" - Randy Pausch  Preface:  Little Witch Academia was a surprise upstart in the Young Animator's Expo in 2012, and along with fellow member Death Billiards, these two productions started making waves. The fan outpouring was great, and demands fell on the then-brand new studio Trigger to make more! A kickstarter was raised, and incredibly, the $150,000 goal was smashed in 30 days with the help of nearly 8000 backers and a grand total of $625,318!! (This is all pre-Kill La Kill, guys and gals.)   Let's get into some other nice numbers- the score on this anime.   Artwork and Animation: 10  The original was entirely hand drawn, and with an enormous budget, it turned out to be a spectacular showing of fluidity and vibrant, flashing magical colors. LWA 2 is no different; it's absolutely stunning to watch flow across the screen. I would go so far as to say that this is on a Disney level of traditional animation both techincally and in fluidity. The magic and characters practically animate themselves right off the screen, crisply, sharply, and beautifully. You Yoshinari doesn't get enough recognition for his work at Trigger in my opinion. As a Key Animator and character designer for FLCL, Gurren Lagann, KLK, Dead Leaves, PSG, and others, this guy has a crazy credit list, and his work is always quality. As the director and creator for Little Witch Academia- his eye for animation really comes to life.   Sound and Voice Acting: 8  Same players, new game. Sounds great, and good performances by the VA.   Characters and Story: 9, 8  After getting in trouble in potions class by Professor Snape, the hyperactive Akko, the narcoleptic Sucy, and the brainy Lotte are forced to plan and create a parade float for the yearly festival in town. Traditionally, the parade is about making fun of witches and reenacting middle ages witch hunts, but in a much less deadly way; but our trio team up to change the public's opinion of witches by making it into a fun and exciting show and showcasing how cool and exciting witches can be!  Along the way, Akko gets cross ways with her friends, and ends up having to work with three new characters, the ""problem children"". This little gang is constituted of Amanda O'Neill, the red headed, hot tempered girl, Constanze Braunschbank Albrechsberger, the silent German robotics engineer, and Jasminka Antonenko- the constantly grazing Russian girl.  The story is paced excellently, with not a magical drop of filler to be found. An hour of screentime practically flew by on a broom, from the opening with a very Harry Potter feel, to the magical dreams-come-true Disney ending. It's a very heartwarming and enchanting watch- honestly, I know I keep repeating myself, but it just feels very Disney.   Enjoyment and Overall: 9  The extra length, the new characters, and the sharp, beautiful animation really sell Little Witch Academia. It's a fun romp through a gorgeous world.  Little Witch Academia 2 didn't have to be astoundingly original and bold to be charming and fun. The humor hits the right marks, the visuals are awesome, and it is simply easy to enjoy. The original was a very cute work that was obviously inspired by children's tales and movies from ages past, and this works well within that framework- another adventure, another day in the life of a little witch.";Recommended
2;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;HaXXspetten;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HaXXspetten;8;The original Little Witch Academia was a highly successful work from the 2013 Young Animator Training Project. It was a film praised for its energetic characters, stellar presentation and for quite simply being an incredibly entertaining movie from start to finish.  Fast forward two years to 2015 and it's finally time to rejoin Akko, Lotte and Suzy in the long-awaited sequel film, titled Mahou Shikake no Parade, or The Enchanted Parade in English. After a consistent spree of misbehavior inside the school, the headmaster gives the trio an assignment to take care of in the upcoming witches' commemoration festival taking place in the local town. In this festival, the villagers throw rotten tomatoes at the witches, half-drown them and perform other cruelties, all under the pretense of reminding themselves of the witch hunts of the Middle Ages and why this tradition must never be implemented again. Akko however thinks this tradition sounds ridiculous and instead decides to put on a fun and lively show she calls the Happy Time Project for the townsfolk in order to make them see how cool and awesome witches are. Of course things never go quite so according to plan as they end up running into all sorts of problems along the way, and they may even have to do their fair share of fighting before everything is said and done…  The main character cast is the same as the first movie, but this time there are also three new witches joining the original trio. There is the resident burglar Amanda O'Neill, the tech addict Constanze Braunschweig Albrechtsberger (say that three times fast) and the habitual food thief Jasmineka Antonenko. All three of them are also tasked with representing the witches in the festival, and thus end up joining hands with Akko and her friends by also participating in her Happy Time Project.  The animation is fast, fluid and lively. It doesn't look spectacularly detailed but it fits the theme of the movie itself like a glove. I especially love when inanimate objects come alive through the usage of magic, then it truly looks like a classical Disney film more than anything else. Actually the entire movie reminds me a bit of Fantasia in that sense. As far as music goes, Little Witch Academia doesn't actually utilize a whole lot of it, but when it actually does use it then it sounds great. The more large-scale scenes and the climax have beautiful orchestral music which highly enriches the overall atmosphere and makes everything feel all the more dramatic.  Despite everything though, as a whole The Enchanted Parade is still a very simplistic creation, but what really makes it shine is quite simply how much fun it is to watch. It makes me feel like a child again, and as a result it manages to consistently make me smile when watching it. Even though it's 53 minutes long, I swear it only feels like half of that. It's just that captivating.  The first Little Witch Academia stands out as one of the most original anime films I have ever seen, and despite its simplicity I have always had a soft spot for it. The Enchanted Parade is no different. For what it's worth, I really cannot recommend it enough. Because every once in a while, you just have to let loose your inner child again.;Recommended
3;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;TheAzureSky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAzureSky;9;This sequel succeeds in every way from the original Little Witch Academia.  ★★★★  I almost want to break my personal rule of never passing out a 10/10 because this was so fantastic. Every minute of it was enjoyable. It’s obvious that the creators took immense care to maximize every second of this episode.  The characters are very expressive. Their designs are attractive. They’re all distinguishable and unique. The animation is fluid and full of energy. The magic is creative and fun to watch. It’s surprisingly funny. The plot and what’s at stake is made clear from the beginning to let you know what the goal is so you can easily root for them. There’s nostalgic scenery which makes you feel like a kid again. Every frame has something interesting to look at.  The Enchanted Parade hits every mark. It's immensely charming and leaves you craving for more. It’ll be a long time before another episode, but I can’t wait.;Recommended
4;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;YizelTro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YizelTro;9;"""Harry Potter"" is the first thing that came up in my mind even tho i've never watched it before. but, with the concept was being a little bit similiar to Harry Potter, the vibe that this show was giving to me was Disney vibe, and i really like it.  The story is simple imo. it was just a story about a girl that want to be a great, gorgeous witch, want to be a witch like Shiny Chariot who she really admired and inspire the girl to became like Shiny Chariot. i think that was simple, but it the way they modify the story was really good imo. they made the story into a story that really enjoyable and fun to watch.  The animation was great as i expected from Trigger, and at the same time it was giving me disney vibe so it was a little bit weird but i love it. Cool and Great animation especially the action ;)  On the other side, the characters were really good imo. in the previous movie they only showed three characters but in this movie, they added 3 more, and i think the characters were funny XD There was some conflict too betwee the glasses girl and the MC but i expected that, because before the conflict occurred the atmosphere was getting hard so i kinda expected that, and again, they executed it really good imo.  Soundtrack, in my opinion, really great. The soundtrack is the reason why i was feeling disney vibe while watching this anime XD  Overall, it was a pretty simple story, yet they executed it really well. fun and enjyoable to watch because of the soundtrack and the animation. Characters were fun to watch too. really enjoyed it so much. wish for another movie :D 9/10";Recommended
5;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Artrill;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Artrill;9;"[9.0/10]  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  Going through the OVAs for Little Witch Academia before I dig into the series is exactly what I needed during a lazy afternoon. Mixing childish Sunday-morning nostalgia and utterly impeccable presentation, LWA's second OVA, The Enchanted Parade, is an utter joy to experience. With explosive character animation, beautiful design, and endlessly love-able characters injected into a Harry Potter-esq modern world breathed new life into me.  We follow Atsuko ""Akko"" Kagari, an adorable optimist that struggles with her witch schoolwork yet, with the support of her two equally cute friends, Sucy and Lotte, ultimately succeeds where it matters most. It's a story that is as old as time, really, the idea of our protagonist being an underdog and forced to work with friends to become better. Yet, when done right, this story is as timeless as it is old. Especially when you get so many unique voices and solid direction into the mix.  That's exactly where LWA succeeds in its narrative based storytelling. What it is sharing with us is somewhat generic and simplistic, but the way it goes about sharing is what stands out. If you aren't as much about aesthetic as I am, then you may disagree with me, but I see not only potential, but realization within the world in front of me. That's more than I can say about the majority of television I watch.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Aesthetic, Narrative, and Character]  I don't usually lump all of these categories together, yet I think they all play off one another. The first OVA from 2013 was enchanting and beautiful, this OVA is on a completely other level, in my opinion. I expected the beautiful people at Trigger to tone down the fidelity of animation with this almost hour-long project, yet they upped the anti. My jaw was agape the majority of my watch, so much so that the ice-cream I was supposed to be eating melted.  This project looks utterly astounding. From the gorgeous key-frames to the energetically pronounced and blurred fill-frames, there doesn't seem to be a single moment where Trigger had to time-save on this project, which makes it infinitely more lively. People seem to not understand just how much impressive aesthetic can actually do for the narrative. I wouldn't be remotely as attached and enamored by these characters if the way they were animated wasn't so lively and notable.  For the same reason I consistently praise Kyoto Animation for their exceptional character animation, I will say that Trigger stepped up their game notoriously for this OVA. If you don't know, character animation is the animation that is relegated to making a character's personality shine through the presentation. As in, giving characters unique animation that expounds or develops their established personality traits.  For example, Akko is an optimistic and lively girl, so her animation reflects that. She's constantly flinging her arms around, doing all kinds of wacky things in the background, even her walk-cycle is different than that of someone like Sucy, who is restrained and quiet. Something as tiny as a walk-cycle or the way she picks an object up makes all the difference. These differences shouldn't go unnoticed because they make or break characters for me. Beyond just the aesthetically incredible character designs which, at this point, is synonymous with Trigger's team, they offer not only a variety of characters, but a variety of captivating personalities through the way these characters are presented. Through their movement you learn about them, and that is so refreshing.  Especially when you realize that a huge amount of anime, especially television anime is very low on character animation. Most characters utilize similar movements and animations because that saves time, effort, and budget, focusing on elements a lot of producers or directors may view as ""more important,"" when in reality, character is the most important and character animation should never be ignored.  Enough about the aesthetic. It's perfect. It is literally perfect. I wouldn't change a single thing about the way The Enchanted Parade looks. From the engaging world of the witch academy to the tiny details that are speckled through each students rooms, from knick-knacks to posters, giving you insight on who they are. The visuals here are beyond what I expect. They are cartoony to an extreme, but that is what makes them all the more unique within the current generation of anime.  When it comes to character, as in, the way characters are written, they are expressive simply due to the aesthetic behind them. Sure these characters aren't explosively three dimensional as people, but the base traits they were given are continuously expanded upon through the presentation and ultimately creates people I am charmed by. You see just how important aesthetic and minutia can be to get you attached to someone? It doesn't have to be intricately written character arcs with complex emotions, it can be something as silly as three base character traits and clear motivations all lined up well under the umbrella of care given by the people animating and writing this project.  The story of the Enchanted Parade follows Akko as she tries to show the cynical, human world just how awesome witches are, especially since the non-magical people aren't too into witches. What makes Akko instantly like-able is the fact that she comes from a non-magical background, making her not only relate to the non-magical humans she's speaking to, but giving her an alien-vibe within the academy she attends. She's the underdog you can't help but root for, and is a solid twist on the ""outcast"" trope.  From this motivation she has a rough go-about proving this. From kids meddling with her plans to having a cliched falling out with her friends, everything is predictable. But in this case the predictability works because these OVAs have done so much to already make me care about these characters. I can't bother being critical of the predictable scenario when I want these characters to succeed nonetheless.  What also resonates with me is this stories focus on friendship. Which always is significantly more interesting than romance. Romance, I feel, lacks nuance when done poorly, to the point where it feels obnoxious to sit through. I can't begin to express how happy I am that this project didn't collapse into marketable romance bait, which it easily could have. Instead it is about friends overcoming something and that just warms my cold, cynical heart.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Sound]  I can't say much about this. The music is really solid and isn't inserted into the oft-groaned at J-pop craze that so much anime forces into their shows. A sweet orchestral backing helps sell scenes well, and thankfully it isn't over-indulged within, making it not overpower other scenes. It's good. What I do want to mention is how superb the sound-design is, though. All these little elements add up.  Every crunch and explosion is cartoony and energetic. It fits the aesthetic but also the charming world that these characters inhabit. I think this is a hard balance to strike, trying to maintain this level of cartoony-ness whilst not becoming a bit too much to handle, which can often result in mismatched comedy and poorly executed punchlines.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Conclusion]  What can I say, I was thoroughly in love with this second OVA. The Enchanted Parade was nearly perfect to me. I think the biggest flaws was the cliched narrative and character beats that felt mandatory to strike, but even they are easy to look past because of how love-able these characters are. Not just from the unique voice acting and the utterly wondrous character design, but also the animation being so unbelievably exceptional. It creates a realistic connection to these characters that so much anime lacks.  These potentially caricature-esq characters get so much well-deserved life breathed into them from this undeniably passionate team of animators that probably slaved away over hundreds of hours of meticulous animation that was required just for some of the unnoticed cuts that seem to slide right past an every-day viewers radar. It not only injects characters with life, but the world as well, making me eager to see what else this series has to offer.  Little Witch Acadamia : The Enchanted Parade is what I want to believe the main series is going to be like. While I'm not expecting this level of unbelievable animation, what I do want is the continued focus on lively character animation and cartoony cuts that make me nostalgic, remembering waking up at seven AM for school, and chomping on cereal as my favorite cartoon plays on the television.";Recommended
6;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;FAKEANIMEGIRL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FAKEANIMEGIRL;8;I was pretty damn happy when I heard Little Witch Academia was getting a sequel. Not only that, but the success of The Enchanted Parade was apparently going to be used to determine the production of an actual TV series. It almost seemed too good to be true, as I loved the first movie but was depressed at the thought there’d never be anything more. But the unlikely happened and not only did we get a Kickstarter sequel, which shows great potential for future ambitious anime projects, but a TV series has now officially been confirmed. I’m just now seeing The Enchanted Parade for the first time, so clearly I’m a bit behind. My hesitation wasn’t entirely coincidental: I had heard many lukewarm to negative opinions about this follow-up. After watching, I feel comfortable in saying that these misgivings seem oddly picky and hyperbolic.  Mainly, everything that made the original movie a stunning success returns. The primary complaint seems to be leveraged at the fact that the original movie didn’t deserve to be anything more than a one-off and its main draw was the storyline. Something I couldn’t disagree with more, as the plot of Little Witch Academia is the most downright ordinary thing about it. The coming of age witch girl story where a down on her luck schoolgirl manages to save the day and assert herself in the end. It’s the classic kids’ movie formula, and it was never the draw. What made a typical story so enrapturing are the usual qualities that do, such as everything that encompasses the framework of the story being told. In Little Witch Academia’s case, it’s story is magnified by many strong attributes. The first is the magical academy setting, which while has been copied many times after the popularity of Harry Potter, has yet to perfectly refine itself. It’s then still a ripe avenue to explore while not completely original, and Little Witch Academia gives us an animated installment that in a rare occasion isn’t about sexualizing girls.  The choice to make it animated is a particularly beneficial one, and the staff at Trigger studios bring a highly stylized and fictional world to life with a skill that transcends any subject matter and makes it worth seeing for the sake of itself. The scene choreography is marvelously dynamic, and the generally wavy shapes of the character designs gel smoothly with the fluid animating. Facial expressions move so quickly I frequently rewind in order to catch them all, because the art style is such a joy to look at. The pastel colors demonstrate a very bright and childlike world without going too far in alienating a general audience were they to go with more juvenile character designs instead. The excessive amount of detail in the painted backgrounds and movements of characters are not only stunning in their own right, but this combination of meticulous focus in drawing and freeform movement are important when it comes to background world building and selling the unique non-human characters and magic that fill up Little Witch Academia. Simply put, as long as Little Witch Academia has these fantastical qualities amplifying its base premise it will always be worth watching – for exactly the same reasons as the first one was. There’s no logical reason to turn on it here. Little Witch Academia has a distinct identity among anime that should be cherished so long as it still has something of it to give.  With the surroundings out of the way, let’s look at the core of Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade. Or rather, its story. Atsuko, Lotte, and Sucy are punished for constantly causing trouble around the academy and are given the responsibility of putting together the upcoming annual parade. Failure means flunking the year, but fortunately they’re not alone. They’re joined by three new troublemakers to help: a deft attempted thief, a mute mechanical wiz-kid, and a chronic junk food eater. These side characters add charm and visual gag diversity to many scenes, but mainly this story focuses on the friendship between the three leads, something which the original didn’t really have time to do. Lotte in particular is given more attention with a bit of background info, but for Sucy we mostly just get more definition on her mischievous personality. A shame, since she’s my favorite character, but now there’s the series coming up.  Anyway, Atsuko wants to show the non-magical denizens a different kind of parade that demonstrates how spectacular magic is, similar to how the performer Shiny Chariot did to her as a child. But despite her successes in the last movie, her immaturity and inexperience strain the relationships between her friends and keep her from her goals. When push comes to shove, Atsuko is forced to attempt her best and grow up a little along the way. It’s the same deal as the first story, admittedly with a little less punch this time around because it’s less distinctly personal than the victory of the first movie, but the little that’s lost emotionally is made up for the increasing attachment to Little Witch Academia’s world and characters.  This time the victory is shared among those other than Atsuko, and the journey there is filled with remarkable visual flash, humor, and fun characters. The folks at Trigger do a great job conveying character personality in exaggerated movements that make this kind of light animation so appealing, and overall another extremely impressive romp to a world that completely deserved being revisited. With the TV series announced I feel both excited and hesitant. I would always love more Little Witch Academia just like how I wanted this sequel, but where The Enchanted Parade did a fine job living up to its predecessor, I wonder if the TV series will be able to do so. Not because of the strength of story, but because of the things far more important to Little Witch Academia. I wonder if the direction and astounding detail and character in the art and animation will be lost with a stricter production schedule and budget plotting. With Trigger at the helm my worries are assuaged, as ultimately it’s the talent behind a series that mainly determines its success and they’ve delivered both in Gainax and on their own. But nonetheless my optimism for more Little Witch Academia is only matched by my realization of how high Trigger has set the bar for themselves and the strength of their magic.;Recommended
7;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;_chitanda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_chitanda;7;"tl;dr: If you watch the TV series, this is probably a waste of time. If you have not, it's a pretty cute short movie to watch and to show the beauty of Little Witch Academia. Going to compare TV series and this.  - Story (6/10) Pretty simple story about a girl (Akko) inspired by a magic show to become a witch. This is basically the same premise as the TV series, and while both series make Akko seem like the worst witch ever, the TV series expands on the reason.  - Art (8/10) I have a bias for TRIGGER, so I love their art style. The animation is similar to the TV series.  - Sound (7/10) There was nothing memorable here.  - Characters (6/10) Because this was a 23 minute OVA, there was not much room for character development. However, you are able to get a sense of each character's personality. In comparison, the TV series was able to expand on each character, being it was 24 times longer.  - Enjoyment (7/10) It was a simple story, just showing the daily lives of what witches do. There was a conflict near the end, which was easily resolved.  - Overall (7/10) Pretty good show to remind me of the beauty of Little Witch Academia; however, I would highly recommend watching the TV show if you have the time.";Recommended
8;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Chrismas95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chrismas95;10;Like the first Little Witch Academia, every minute of The Enchanted Parade is used with intent so it's easily worth watching. The longer run time made me skeptical, but that simply gave TRIGGER the chance to make a grander story without compromising anything to fit it in.  The plot is about how our big dreamer Akko tries to make a grandiose parade completely from the ground up despite everyone—even her team of friends—doubting it. I was hoping the plan would work for the whole thing. There are tensions when the plan starts seeming too ambitious, but the planning process and magic parade are a joyride thanks to the unique characters, stellar animation, and appreciable music/voice acting. I was impressed to no end when TRIGGER stuck with the parade focus, even spinning the climax around the parade instead of abandoning it like I thought they would. I think my only gripe is how one of the main characters is the “fat person whose actions are inseparable from food” trope.  Thanks to it maintaining interest throughout and looking stellar to boot, this movie definitely earns a spot in my favorites.;Recommended
9;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;sop12;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sop12;10;"It's hard to rate anything from Little Witch Academia with less than 10/10, an anime series that I like a lot and that is my favorite and the movies have the same excellent quality.  Synopsis: Akko is a girl who is a big fan of a witch named Chariot and wants to be like her, so she enrolls in the Luna Nova academy, where her childhood idol studied, but Akko and her friends are punished and put to participate in a festival that humiliates witches and they have to fix the situation.  Story: 9/10 As an LWA fan I am totally incapable of saying that the story is bad as it is actually very good! The idea of modern witches is very well built, similarly the design, it's nice to watch too and it has a good plot, although the anime is relatively darker. This movie is reminiscent of the first season of the anime, with a more fun and fanciful vibe, which is awesome.  Characters: 10/10 LWA HAS AMAZING CHARACTERS!!!! In this film, we had a better development of Akko and her friends, the ""antagonist"" Diana and others. The characters are incredibly charismatic and you will probably like most of them and they have a very well defined personality that will be deepened throughout the anime mainly.  Animation and soundtrack: 10/10 Little Witch Academia has wonderful animation, worthy of Trigger studio, the character design is also good and yields several gems for the viewer. The soundtrack is perfect, it matches every scene and moment.  Pleasure: 10/10 This movie amused me a lot, I watched it immediately after seeing the anime 2 years ago, I remember that I was very happy to have movies, because the anime ended up with a taste of ""I want more"", until today I hope for a continuation of sequence.  Overall: 100000/10: LWA is my favorite anime and the movies have exactly the same quality, an anime full of references, light and easy to watch, these are just some of the qualities of this show, I recommend anyone to see Little Witch Academia, and I particularly watched in the anime-film order.  Ps: renew Little Witch Academia please, I've been waiting for a new season or new movies for years, but as the story had an ending, it probably won't :(";Recommended
10;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;ToastMyGhost;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ToastMyGhost;7;"Finally got around to watching this movie!  Just like with the OVA, the animation is top-notch (expected of Studio Trigger), and the voices and sound fit very well. The story is very simple, but it's still very fun. The pacing was a bit strange, in my opinion, as the last act took up almost half the movie, but the bad things were kind of made up for that awesome moment around the 40 minute mark. I got chills.  Now I wish the OVA was this long; it would have given it room to breathe... but that's neither here nor there. Now that I'm done this, it looks like the TV series is next up... hopefully it'll take less time for me to get to it than it took for me to get to this!";Recommended
11;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Tyrannicswine117;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyrannicswine117;8;Warning possible Spoilers  So going from a 30 minute OVA to a 53 minute movie is certainly an upgrade and gives more time for character development too which we nicely see in this.  The story continues with Akko, Sucy and Lotte with they usual antics, but their latest screw up ends up them almost getting expulsion unless they successfully organise the Academy's annual parade so Akko and the others try their best to succeed. So going from a simple dungeon exploring lesson to organising a magic parade was definitely a step up in the story department as we get to see the girls along some new additions tackle a near impossible feat so they don't get expelled, it was fun watching the characters try their best to make a successful parade despite being the worst witches in the academy which made for some ridiculous ideas to be made. It also showed how deep the relationship was between Akko, Sucy and Lotte who all have a dispute at some point in the movie after certain things happened that made them all go their separate ways. There was also scenes that showed how witches are treated in this world despite learning magic would be awesome the majority of people still see it as a nuisance and Akko was determined to show them wrong and by doing so got her and the others in trouble with a gang, it brought about some funny fights though.  The characters were developed a little more in this movie as we got to see more of the relationship between Akko, Sucy and Lotte who despite their differences actually need each other in order to make things successful. There are also some new additions to the crew too and they are Amanda, Albrechtsberger and Jasminka. Each of them fit perfectly into the group since they too also have their quirks that get them into trouble.  The artstyle was done just as well as the first OVA, the parade was actually done very well and the Titan that appeared at the end was also detailed very well, the girls outfits also changed towards the end which made them look like colourful superheros.  The comedy was again really funny especially when the girls got into multiple fights with a gang who would throw tomato's at them, however with the dispute that went on with Akko, Sucy and Lotte it was definitely more serious this time around luckily everything worked out in the end.  Overall this was a nice addition to the LWA series and gives me more hope for the main series that has just finished airing recently.;Recommended
12;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Amysel_JinkusuP;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Amysel_JinkusuP;7;"First movie was very fun and colorful with nice characters and a unique setting.  This movie retains these aspects for the most part, but the first half of the movie is dedicated to really annoying drama that ends up making the main cast very unlikeable compared to their dynamic in the first movie, but thankfully the 2nd half is pure fun with great animation and music.  I also want to comment on the new characters they added to the cast, they didn't have a chance to be developed since they were a supporting role, but I do have some comments about them.  Amanda was pretty cool and had a really sweet dancing sequence. Constanze had some cool gadget, but had no personality. And Jasminka was just ""fat people eating = funny"" which really wasn't funny.  So overall, its fun.  I enjoy.";Recommended
0;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Tozzy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tozzy;6;Trigger has invited us back into the world of Little Witch Academia with a bang in The Enchanted Parade. The second, eagerly-awaited title in the series doubles the screen time and with it brings more action and characters to make its world feel as vibrant as before. Is it as good a film as the first? Maybe not. There’s a certain charm lost that was there the first time around but this is still a loveable, magical tale.  While I was worried in the opening portion of the film that we were substituting too much magic for drama, a satisfying and action-packed conclusion saw the series back at its strongest. There are areas where the original animation excelled better but there’s plenty here that also adds a lot in areas of world building and action. This latest addition to the LWA series remains a family-friendly, energetic experience that’s going to leave you beaming as the credits roll by.  Story  Akko, Sucy and Lotte plus a trio of new characters find themselves thrust into control of the upcoming town festival. While Akko naturally wants to showcase the best of what witches have to offer, her ideas bring with it a few problems and create tension with her fellow students. That’s not all that’s at play, however. Before they know it the group are forced to band together and use everything at their disposal to overcome their biggest hurdle yet.  Having roughly 40 minutes to put together a cohesive, interesting narrative is a big challenge but Trigger managed to overcome this previously in half the time so they’ve had their practice. They also get the bonus this time of being able to cut down on a lot of exposition. They use this time well to expand the scope of the story. Because of that though there’s a little less intensity and magic. It works both ways.  The overall tone of the story is the biggest change up when compared to the previous offering, with a bit of character conflict thrown into the mix this time around. There was a real sense of adventure and exploration in the first film. Watching the characters make their way around the school grounds was exciting, the lessons were amusing and story in general was a lot more fluid. With some extra time up their sleeves Trigger opt to at least give us a lot of new characters and new settings. There’s some small thematic jumps, so it’s great to see the studio didn’t simply opt to do the exact same thing twice. Some elements of the story have certainly been copied over, but an expanded cast and setting help make it feel fresh.  Adding new locations to the world our story takes place in has its ups and downs. I felt that bringing the witches out of their school environment and into town took some of the ‘mystique’ and the ‘magic’ away from them. At the same time it’s nice to see the wider community around them and what the witches place in that universe is. When you look at it, there’s only so much Trigger could do by limiting everything to the school. While it’s wonderful to imagine all of their adventures happening in their own little bubble, it adds a new dynamic between the magical and human societies. Some may like that, others may not.  Some themes have channelled over from the first film, but the biggest change this time is the focus on friendship. In the original show it was more on having confidence in your own ability. This time Akko faces a lot more conflict and troubles with those around her, friends included. People may be a little bit put off by this slightly more serious approach but it thankfully has its purpose. Trigger use their extra minutes to create character complications that stretch over a long run of the film. The strength of friendship is an easy theme to stuff up and instead come across as cheesy. They mostly avoided that here. Everything revolving around this theme is nothing original but that hasn’t stopped it being executed fairly. Characters are shown to have retained important lessons, reflected on what they’ve been through and apply all that knowledge to find a solution – much like the first film. It’s a formula that works, even though it brings nothing new to the table. It’s easy to watch and it manages to be entertaining while doing so.  When the action kicks into another gear as the film nears its conclusion, the ride feels worthwhile. One particular moment is immensely satisfying, and you’ll know it when you see it. It’s a perfect blend of Trigger’s animation capabilities and ability to put on some memorable set pieces.  Characters + Art  Akko returns as our loveable, often inept, lead character. While Akko remains a primary source of comic relief for the show she’s a lot more proactive this time around. It’s refreshing to see that the original LWA tale has had an effect on her in that way. The original series gave her a huge shot of belief in her own capabilities as a witch and now this is a look at how she applies her new knowledge. I think some may be a bit turned off by this new, confident side of her. It’s certainly quite the leap from what we’ve seen previously. Her outgoing personality and habit of acting before thinking gets her into trouble once again. Nothing new changes there at least – and you wouldn’t have it any other way.  Both Sucy and Lotte feel a little underutilised but, honestly, that’s not a big deal. That too serves a purpose of its own. When they are on screen not a second is wasted and their role to play in the story still feels meaningful. It can serve as reminder that even not being around can make the times you are more important. As for our new trio they’re not that memorable, more there just to help drive the story along than contribute anything of value. They get their odd scene of comic relief or chance to show-off but that’s about it. I think it’s also disappointing that Diana, someone who played a big role in the complication of the first film, gets cast to the back this time around. Strange that Trigger didn’t opt to make more use of a character with a more defined personality and presence than almost anyone else in the show. It’s a show that very much rides on one character, Akko, which means a lot of your enjoyment will come out of how much you can take to her character and how’s she’s changed from the first outing.  I’m personally a big fan of Trigger’s character designs. The exaggerated expressions and reactions are always worth a laugh. The studio keep things simple when it comes to effects and shading in the animation, putting most of the work into some nice backgrounds. As always in Trigger’s works there’s the odd lazy bit of animation scattered about. Some background characters look crudely drawn and it’s often very easy to pick out where the costs have been saved. Some frames look very hurriedly put together, but thankfully most pieces of action looks a treat. As a whole, however, the first LWA struck me as more visually impressive.  Summary  Even when given additional time thanks to the efforts of their backers, Trigger was going to find it hard to live up to a wonderful debut in this franchise. But they’ve come close. It’s a show dying for more exploration of its characters and an expansion of its magical elements. I like the friendship building side of things, don’t get me wrong, but there’s that sense of adventure and mystery lacking that was present in the original Little Witch Academia.

1;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;WdaCdaShdaDid;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WdaCdaShdaDid;5;"Remember the mystery of the first film about Shiny Chariot? Yeah, that's not what we're exploring in this film. Instead, let's talk about poorly handled metaphors for religious prejudice.  It's basically the same as the first one, but with perhaps a larger budget and cast. And more guys. Because a film that is about women, women's relationships and fighting the old stereotype of ""evil witch"" of course needs more men - I mean bullies, cowards, thugs and probably corrupt government officials - in it. None of whom actually advance the plot. None of the relationships outside the trio from the previous film are explored in any meaningful way, like between previous film's protagonist and primary antagonist, and most of the characters outside the main trio are background characters. The new female characters serve little purpose and we learn little about them. Two of them have little to no speaking lines.  The main problem I had with this was the bullying storyline. I don't know why this is popping up more and more, but we've seen it before: a group of, typically, male children are messing around and decide to pick on some of the main cast. The main cast typically does not retaliate through fighting, but instead tries to cure cruelty with kindness - a noble endeavor. The bullies seem to start to figure out that their victims are good/interesting. And ultimately the bullies just go back to bullying them in the same way. But now the main cast has accepted it with a smile. For no apparent reason other than the storyline has come to an end. The moral being, I suppose, that bullying is incurable, you should just accept it when people decide for one reason or another to assault you, and boys will be boys. You see this elsewhere in incurable street harassers: after going on some journey with the female cast member, they still catcall or harass her, but in a ""loving"" way, while the female victim chuckles or smiles or shakes her head. Ah, men... I just described ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" and ""The Proposal"".  Even outside of the toxic lessons and trope-forming crap, this serves zero purpose in the storyline. The protagonists don't even attempt to deal with the problem in an intelligent manner. Sure, they eventually sort of show that witches are useful people, but they don't find the parents of the kids to explain ""hey, your children attacked us without provocation for somewhat prejudicial reasons."" They don't go to the authorities or try to see how widespread this prejudice is. They just create a light show and accidentally defeat a giant. And these kids are HORRIBLE. The scene where they steal the thing they steal made me feel SO uncomfortable. Especially because they face NO consequences for it. The ringleader almost gets crushed to death, I guess, but ultimately all they do is the same bullying they did when they were introduced. Which is supposed to be fine, apparently, given that they're primarily at fault for nearly destroying the town and killing countless people???  Not much else to say about it. Akko was terrible. I know at least two people like her and I can't stand them. I was happy that she faced at least some consequences for her actions and did eventually apologize profusely. Although it would have been nice if someone had explained to her JUST WHAT SHE DID WRONG instead of assuming that she would figure it out by using psychic powers? Yes, it's obvious to us as the audience but it doesn't seem like she's aware. At all. As far as we know, she probably thinks she just ripped the equivalent of a piece of notebook paper in half.  There's a TTGL reference because of COURSE Studio Trigger would put in a nonsensical TTGL reference. It really doesn't make any sense. Maybe it'll make sense for the next film or series or whatever if they got into the lore behind the special wand. I doubt it. But maybe.  I wish I could be excited about this storyline that initially seemed focused entirely in a largely non-sexually-objectifying manner on women and women's friendships and magic done by and administrated by women and women's history. But it's just a giant disappointment recycling boring sexist and cliche tropes with some added bad writing.";Mixed Feelings
2;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Winstonite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Winstonite;6;Don't really get why this has such a high score. While the original OVA excels at nearly every aspect, the sequel fails on many front. The main character, Akko, went from adorable genki little girl with big dreams to just plain selfish, disregarding almost every one else and then get mad at them for not wanting in on your shitty little plan. Her friends get more development, which is fine, but the three other addition to the cast has almost nothing going on for them, and never developed, at all, period. They served as nothing more other than plot device to help her build her parade, and never seem to disagreed with anything she said. The show itself is very, very quiet for some reason. Like, there's still the voice acting going on, but music seems to be missing from very key moments, which is wierd since the original LWA has a fantastic soundtrack, and even if they ran out of budget to write new music, they could've probably reused a lot of that. But, instead, we get generic orchestral music sparsely playing in the background. The animation is still there, with the iconic Trigger style of animation with exagerrated expressions and cartoon-like feel. This is where the show excels at the most. Although it still feel like some corners has been cut, especially with the crouds. Overall, even though I really wanted to like this show, considering the original LWA was probably my all time favorite, it fails me. I didn't really enjoy my time with it. Even at the climax, I was still put off by a lot off things. I just hope they can do better with the upcoming TV anime.;Mixed Feelings
3;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Prorogon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prorogon;5;Really disppointed with this movie. I really liked the first Little Witch Academia but so much of the charm was lost in this sequel. The protagonist Acco or whatever her name is gets really annoying really quickly in this movie. A lot of the sick animation sequences from the first one have been substituted for drama here. Whilst it does have an excellent action sequence at the end, by that point I didn't care anymore. The animation and sound is as fantastic as you would expect from Trigger but the characters let those perks down. A lot of side characters got introduced that were granted, funny, quirky and interesting but we don't get to know them nearly well enough to care. I hope the TV series feels more like the original but I'll just have to wait and see.;Mixed Feelings

With proper movie-length, we get more time to introduce the characters, the setting, the plot, and goof around a bit, nice.  It's basically the same as before, with a few new characters, and different antics. There's a little bit of world-building and character development this time around, but nothing outstanding.  I found the main character a bit less likable this time around, but she does get better. Just like before, there's a whole bunch of nonsense that doesn't make a lot of sense, but I suppose it doesn't need to.  I found the quality on animation on this sequel a bit less good than the original, but by no means bad.  It was still a stand-alone, enjoyable lil' witch-watch.;Mixed Feelings
0;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Angry_Anime_Nerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angry_Anime_Nerd;4;I know that this anime came out a year ago, so it may not have had much problems back then but this anime is not going to be remembered for years due to its tiresome cliches, squeaky dub voice acting, and non-fluid art.  I did not expect this to be so poorly animated and filled with unlikeable and generic characters.  Sound:  Let's just talk about the dub. I don't know if I should blame the director or the voice actors but there is nothing great about the voice acting. The characters sounded like annoying and weak characters. Well, I guess that they tried but they still didn't do a good job. They were like amatuerish professionals doing a role that just wasn't perfect for them.  I know that Rica Mendez tried hard on voicing Akko but she still sounded a little too high-pitched and it just didn't fit the character. But it's hard to nail a child character considering that she was way older than Akko. Sucy's voice actor was scratchy. The voice actor put little effort to make me care for the character. She can do better than that.  With that wrapped, the dub is pretty sub-par and I recommend to watch this anime subbed. You are not really missing out on anything if you watch it. It's cuter and more believable.  Another thing childish about this is the big stomping noises the characters do when they stomp their foot.  I do not recall seeing the dub for the predecessor so I don't know if anything is different or whatnot.  Sub: 6/10 Dub: 4/10  Animation:  The animation is not fluid. In fact, its childish absurdities is like they were focusing on trying to keep younger audiences entertained, not older audiences. Teenagers are not looking for something silly and panderous. The way Akko's eyes are colored are a bit too big.  Though, the rest of the character designs are pretty. I liked Akko's little braid, it resembled the little girl she is.  Characters:  At this point, I think that Akko has gotten even more childish. Her mischief and hyperactivity does not fit the girl that I remember from the first film. I know that she is just a young girl and kids can get overjoyed but that wasn't the girl that she was particularly supposed to be. I remember a calmer girl than that.  After mildly enjoying the first one, I was hoping that this one would at least be a bit better because due to the predecessor's flaws, I could not rate that one higher than a 6.7.  Due to its rushed story and weak characters, Little Witch Academia is a mediocre experience.;Not Recommended
1;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Flawfinder;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Flawfinder;3;Back when I was the type of fanboy who blindly bought into new things like a homeless man who found a book on Mormonism in the trash, I contributed to quite a few Kickstarter projects upon its discovery, waited months/years to receive my prize whilst feeling good about myself that I was supporting a dying industry, reaped the rewards, and said happy expression quickly turned to sullen joylessness when I realized that the final product - with no exception - wasn’t very good. In fact, they were worse than not good. They were utter shit that I could have watched for free anyways, so I might as well have spent the money on a video game that everyone knows is shit but I wouldn’t personally know for sure until I played it myself. Like say, Ride to Hell: Retribution.  It just goes to show: try before you buy. Now to be fair, I did try the first Little Witch Academia back when people could actually say the word “Studio Trigger” without a mild snarl in their voice. I remember liking it at the time, but I honestly can’t remember why. In fact, I can’t remember anything about the first Little Witch Academia at all aside from the characters’ designs, the animation being nice, and this one cartoonish expression a dragon had right before he spontaneously combusted. What I did remember was that the cast consisted solely of little girls, so I went into the sequel with a bit of fear whilst reminding myself that Euphonium’s cast was mostly girls and it was...well I didn’t love the show or anything, but it was tolerable. Certainly a better well-animated cute girl thing than this banal pile of horseshit. Sixty bucks well-spent, huh?  The story of this sequel brings back the girls from the first installment, whose names I’m not going to even bother remembering because they have zero personality and thus I have zero interest in treating them as people. After pissing off their potions master and getting ten points taken from Gryffindor, they are forced to prepare for a local parade and learn about the nature of hard work and how goofing off tends to lead to trouble during important events. Oh wait, that would be the plot of a half-way decent kids’ show (unless you’re Gravity Falls, in which case it would be an awesome plot in an awesome kids’ show). The OVA is actually about the girls wasting time with lots of talking and ideas for the parade that never goes anywhere, and then when some kids show up all mopey, they cheer ‘em with magic and defeating another monster in a rehash of the dragon climax from the first installment, and then deliver a final lesson scraped off of a Disney Channel checklist that was thrown into the janitor’s office. As far as plots go, it’s right up there with that one episode of Da Capo SS when Aisha tries to teach little kids how magic can solve anything by having Junichi’s harem dress in mahou shoujo outfits that look like they belong in a strip club.  Yes, I’m sorry to say that Little Witch Academia 2 is the shit kind of sequel. Most anime sequels never do as well as the first to begin with, but this is the kind that’s basically the same as the original except with twice the length and twenty times the bullshit. There’s very little added to the formula and the stuff that is added is just used to pad out the runtime rather than contribute in any major way. Also, I’m not quite sure, but I think the girls act more spazzy than before. It’s not as bad as Durarara’s gimmicky additions, but at least Durarara waited an entire cour before giving up on itself and going “fuck it. Let’s do the same thing Nintendo does with its franchises”.  The animation is still of good quality, so at least the visual-loving fans have something to slobber over after having eye surgery to repair the damage caused by Santa Company. And if you, like me, are tired of seeing Trigger turning into Shaft with their cheap animation-saving tricks whilst someone makes bad catchphrases in the recording room and repeating their stories with more self-referentiality than Platinum Games, you’ll be pleased to know that at least they kept at least one of their usual annoying quirks out of the thing. Now if only they’d fix the other fifty, maybe they’d actually produce some good stuff. But we live in a world where everything that can go wrong will go wrong, so I wouldn’t hold out hope for that unless it turns out that they’re making a remake to Thundercats or something.  So is there anything new in this thing? Um, there’s a parade? People like parades, right? Unless they have singing dinosaurs voiced by John Goodman, I mean. There’s...um...see, this is the reason why I don’t like reviewing, let alone watching cute girl stuff. They lack substance, they’re not funny, and they’re so bloody hard to write about. At least when something ends up as a trainwreck, I can work with that. And speaking of cute girl stuff, hell will freeze over before I watch any more Girls Und Panzer or that movie about the three goddesses that A-1 Pictures is releasing. Hell will have Satan turned into a pussy bitch when A-1 releases something good.  See? Now I’m insulting studios who have nothing to do with the anime I’m talking about just to lengthen this review out the same way Little Witch Academia 2 has the girls chat about the practicalities of magic like I give a fucking damn just to fill up an hour worth of screen time. Well you’re not pulling me into your evil any further.  The story is ripped out of every kids’ book cliche ever whilst borrowing too heavily from the first. The characters are either completely unrelatable or act like bad parodies of characters from much better kid shows. And the humor sucks balls, realized it didn’t like the taste, and vomited for three minutes when it decided to show up, because there were large sections of the anime that felt like I was watching the pointless filler from A Troll in Central Park again. It’s a poor product from a disappointing studio created through terrible means that wasn’t at all worth the wait, and I’m happy to just forget it existed and continue refreshing my western cartoon feed waiting for a new episode of Gravity Falls to finally get released.;Not Recommended
2;Little Witch Academia: Mahoujikake no Parade;Ciaran_Zagami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ciaran_Zagami;4;"Good visuals, nice music and overall an improvement on the previous OVA.  But the story is derivative and predictable. I had to stop and start watching watching cause I'd seen it all before so many times and I just didn't have the stamina to get through it all in one go.  I think most of my problems trace back to Akko. She's annoying, an id fueled creature who runs on pure impulse. With no forethought for her actions, constantly causing problems, outright blind to her friends desires. Yet she constantly tries to guilt and manipulate them with the guile and charisma of a toddler on a sugar rush.  Her only redeeming quality is that she's so stupid you can solve the (admittedly minor) plotholes with something like: ""She's too stupid to do/know that""  The other characters don't fair much better, they get much less screen time then Akko and basically all boil down to a single personality trait. Tomboy, Gadgets, Food, Evil etc etc etc.  The visuals are nice though, very fluid and lively. If your an animation fan you might get something out of watching the cool dance sequence and explosive visuals. But digital animation tends to fail when it comes distant objects and every crowd is full of clones.  Honestly I can see why this is popular, its cliche and easily digestible.";Not Recommended
0;Little Witch Academia (TV);TakaCode;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TakaCode;9;"""Just you watch! I'm gonna become an amazing witch one day and make the whole world gasp in surprise!""  Akko Kagari Little Witch Academia (TV) 2017 (Episode 5)  Out of all anime that came out in winter 2017, Little Witch Academia (TV) caught my interest and it's the only show from that season that had to potential to great not counting squeals. I have previously seen the short movies for Little Witch Academia and I really liked a lot. However, I won't be mentioning or comparing the TVs with the short movies because I want to review the TV series by its own identity. Now after all that is show worth watching or it's just an another lame seasonal anime. Hellow everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and I will be reviewing Little Witch Academia (TV) and with that out the way let's begin.   Story. The story of Little Witch Academia follows Akko Kagari who aspires to be a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot even tough she has no witch blood in her. Akko sets off to go to Luna Nova Magical Academia where she can to achieve her dream. Along the way her during to Luna Nova Magical Academy she befriends two other witches Sucy and Lotte. Now they magical adventures in Luna Nova Magical Academy begins as Akko tries to achieve her dream by being a witch like Shiny Chariot.  I found the story of Little Witch Academia to be pretty great. It's very similar to Harry Potter in terms of concept and setting but unlike Harry Potter where it centers around Harry growth as so one day, Harry can defeat his antagonist. Little Witch Academia is mostly episodic as most episodes are very different from one another. If you're looking for a magical academy drama like Harry Potter then you won't enjoy this anime.   While mostly being episodic Little Witch Academia deals with great themes of achieving your dream, appreciating others, determination, change, and friendship.  The worldbuilding for Little Witch Academia is great as it gives relevant names for every location in the show. We get certification of how some witches can only use magic in certain places than others, We get information about the history of magic, how the students in Luna Nova Academy must obey the rules such as not leaving campus without permission to no allowing them to go to locations that Luna Nova that is off limits for students. I could go on about how great the worldbuilding is but it will end up spoiling the show and I don't want anyone to get spoiled.  I also really like how it references a lot of other Gainax/Trigger anime as well as humor and jokes in this anime.  The last thing that I want to mention is the second half has a more serious tone and it's more plot driven and to be honest I really liked the second half more than the mostly episodic first half.  Little Witch Academia (TV) is a very engaging/well-written series that will never bore you and it will keep you smiling from start to finish.  Overall the story for Little Witch Academia (TV) to be pretty awesome and it's very refreshing when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays. 9/10  Charterers. The characters in Little Witch Academia is honestly amazing and very likable in they own ways. Not to mention they have great character chemistry to one and another. Akko is a great female lead. She's a very energetic and determined girl who wants to achieve her dream despite her shortcomings by being an ordinary girl with no witch blood. Some people may find her annoying in the beginning but in my opinion, she's the perfect type of annoying you can relate to from start to finish. Not mention he she has great and believable character development especially in the second half. Plus she's very relatable. She's one of my favorite female protagonist in recent memory.  Sucy is the aloof, sarcastic and sadistic character of the show who likes to use Akko as a text subject for her experiments. I can't say anything more about this but all I say is she a fun and likable character overall but I wish she had more screen time in the second half of the show as well as having a bit of character development in my opinion.  Lotte is a rather patient and studious character of the group. She also a supportive character who likes help her friends mainly Akko. Like Sucy she's a fun and likable character. Also like Sucy I wish she had more screen time in the second half as well a bit character development because I found her to very interesting and likable.  Diana is a serious esteemed witch from a long line of witches who is the top student in knowledge and magic. She's honestly my favorite character in this show. I personally like her personality as well her development as the series progresses on. Not to mention like Akko she very relatable. Overall Diana is an awesome that I adored from start to finish  The rest of the characters are also great. They are very likable, enjoyable to watch from start to finish and they brought more life to the show  Overall besides the lack of screen time for Sucy and Lottte in the second half, this character cast was great from start to finish. 9.5/10   Visuals. Visually Little Witch Academia looks good for the most part The background scenery is defined by thin lines and washed out colors. They are very well detailed and well drawn but they are mostly static. The characters designs minus Sucy have very similar size and body types. However, the characters faces and movement are very different for each character and it gives them a personality of they own. Immediately by watching the show, you will see that Akko is an energic, Sucy is an old sarcastic girl or Diana is a hotty top student.  In terms of actual animation, the character movement is easy to follow. Things like the motions of clothing hair, ribbon caps, magical effects or broomsticks are what gives the visuals a lot of their flare. Plus it's very well animated. Overall the visuals are great but can be a bit repetitive at times in terms of size and body types  8.5/10  Sound.  The soundtrack is almost entirely orchestral pieces and consists of a handful of themes with lots of variations and rearrangements of each. These orchestral pieces are amazing, very enjoyable to listen and have a purpose for each scene. Michiru Oshima did an amazing job with this soundtrack as it makes each scene more impactful. The sound effects used in this show is great.  The opening and endings themes are really good. From the happy adventurous of the first opening Shiny Ray to the more slightly serious opening that some foreshadowing towards the end of the opening, Both ending themes are really  The voice acting is simply top notch. All of the seiyuu's did a great job for voicing each character. I cannot about the dub because it hasn't been released yet but the dub of the TV series will be available on Netflix soon.  Overall the soundtrack was amazing the openings and ending themes were great and the voice acting was wonderful and well acted. 10/10  Final Thoughts. Little Witch Academia (TV) is a breath of fresh air when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays. Cough *Eromanga Sensei* The story was great and very enjoyable, has great worldbuilding, great theme exploration, a strong likable cast from start to finish, great visuals and animation. The soundtrack is amazing as well as the opening and endings and voice acting is wonderful.  It has some minor hiccups such as lack of screen time for certain characters in the second half as well mostly repeating the size and body types for the character designs but these minor hiccups are easily ignored due how great the story and characters were.  This is easily one of the best anime to ever come out in the last two years. Unlike Eromanga Sensei that represents everything that is wrong about modern anime and it's also one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Little Witch Academia (TV) represent everything that is great about modern anime and for that reason, I give the show as well as the director You Yoshinari full respect.  It may not be the perfect anime but compared to most anime that I have seen over the years this show almost represents everything that I love about this entire anime medium.  This show will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you smile with joy and determination.  Thank you to all the creators for making this wonderful anime and I hope this gets a Blu-Ray/DVD release in the future.  I give Little Witch Academia (TV) a 9.5/10.  Anyway this was Shawn aka KurataTrigger and I will see you guys next time.";Recommended
1;Little Witch Academia (TV);LIQfilms;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LIQfilms;8;"Watching Little Witch Academia is like looking back into a portal to my youth. A time when Cartoon Network ruled the world! While I was born at the tail end of the nineties, and thus didn't experience what many people consider to be the golden age for the network, I did grow up watching re-runs of many of the shows that established the network and what made it so infamous during the early 2000s. Shows like Johnny Bravo, The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and a plethora of others quickly became my favourite cartoons, and I still love them to this day, looking back on each with found feelings of nostalgia. Little Witch Academia evokes these similar feelings in me of nostalgia, and it's a sort of feeling that I honestly find hard to properly articulate since it is so raw and personal. The anime genuinely feels that it could have aired on Cartoon Network considering how fun, charismatic, and full of energy the entire show actually is, and with each passing episode, Little Witch Academia becomes even more charming and lovable, so much so, that this anime has become a personal favourite of mine! Through its wonderfully creative world, diverse and interesting cast, and bouncy animation, Little Witch Academia is easily the most fun I've had with a piece of media in a very long time, and despite some flaws in terms in its narrative, the entire show, in my eyes, is a wonderful representation of what can be accomplished in animation. With that all said and done, let's dive into why I believe this show to be as great as I proclaim it is!  Little Witch Academia is set in a world in which the use of magic is being used less as a viable means in everyday life, but, despite that, there are still a plethora of witches who wish to learn and study magic for themselves, keeping the world of magic alive. One such girl happens to be our main protagonist, Atsuko Kagari, or simply Akko, who, after seeing a live magic show by a witch named Shiny Chariot, inspires her to take up magic herself, with the ultimate goal of meeting her idol one day, and learning how to use magic in order to put smiles on people's faces and help them forget about their troubles and grief. However, there is only one problem. Akko is totally inept when it comes to magic, having come from a family with no lineage of witches, and performing terribly in her classes at school when it comes to magic participation. She can't ride a broom while everyone else can, finds basic spells difficult while messing up everything she attempts to do while dragging everyone else into her mishaps and incidents. While we do learn the reason why Akko is so incompetent when it comes to magic in the twenty seconded episode, resulting in a great emotional plot twist, Akko's lack of ability and lack of knowledge for the magical world, in general, helps make her more relatable for an audience watching. She assumes the underdog role for this tale, and there is a general sense of cathartic pay off seeing her succeed in her magic studies and spells when others doubt her or assume she will never succeed, yet still proves them wrong. Much like how the audience doesn't know anything about this world, nor does Akko, and this allows the audience to experience the world through her eyes. As Akko learns and grows in this world, the audience does too, which helps the audience grow more attached to Akko as a person. It's the same emotions evoked in watching someone try their hardest and then eventually succeeding after hard work that makes the series incredibly addictive to watch, at least for me anyway.  Anyway, back to the plot, as Akko attempts to get to Luna Nova for her first day of school, she finds it impossible to get there since a broom is needed to go through a magical road, but she meets a girl called Lotte, who becomes a good friend of Akko, who then gives her a ride to the school. However, whilst travelling in this magical road, they are thrown off course and are transported into another area, where they meet up with Sucy, whom will become another friend of Akko's. They're attacked by strange creatures, Akko finds Chariot's Shiny Rod, saves the day by enchanting a magic word, and makes it to the school just in time. The next few episodes sees Akko and her friends attending school will many different magical problems ensue, but the series begins to introduce a more central and focused narrative with Akko attempting to find seven magic words that she believes will bring her closer to Shiny Chariot, which will also activate the Grand Triskelion. A powerful magic that has the power of reconstruction, but, for the most part, the series is fairly episodic, which can be used as a critique against the show. However, each episode has enough energy and charisma, as well as variety to keep things fun and never felt boring and repetitive. From a race on broomsticks to reviving a skeleton, to building a giant ship that turns into a giant robot reminiscent of Gurren Laggen, the entire series uses its magical world in neat and creative ways, making the show an absolute blast to watch. Since anything is possible in a world full of magic, the show remains incredibly addicting to watch since we never know what the show may bring to the table next and each scenario the characters find themselves in is fun as all hell, and the character interactions never fail to put a smile on my face. The world of Little Witch Academia feels alive and vibrant, with so many things to discover and find intrigue in. One thing in particular that I always found interesting was Akko's journey to find the words needed to meet Shiny Chariot. As she searched for each one, she always ran into interesting witches of the past and discovered several past secrets about the world of magic. There is a lot of care put into its world-building elements and each one feels extremely memorable. Each event and scenario is tangential to this main idea of Akko growing, not only as a witch in regards to her improving her magical abilities, but also as a person too, and each one of the words, and their meanings parallels this growth as well.  As the show moves into a more central narrative and introduces a villain for the show, the story is filled with much more emotional depth and is genuinely heartwarming in a lot of places too. One of the most interesting themes the show presents is the idea of old customs, such as magic, slowly being less needed in the world as it becomes more developed and technologically advanced. This theme of technology versus magic is integrated well, as if it was an issue in our very own world, and is explored in interesting ways to aid character development, especially in regards to Diana's characters, in which one of her arcs as a character is focused on her wanting to continue the proud lineage of her family, which is becoming increasingly difficult to do in this ever-changing world. Another example where this element is done especially well is the relationship that builds between Andrew and Akko after Akko sneaks into his party, where many upper-class witches and people gathered. Andrew, being incredibly sceptical of the world and potentials of magic, and Akko, being the loud person that she is when projecting her love for magic, initially clash upon their first meeting, but as the show goes along, Andrew warms up to Akko, and, in turn, the world of magic as well, and begins to slowly appreciate its potential use in society. This also results in some of my favourite movements in the show, seeing Akko and Andrew working together and their chemistry is genuinely great as well. Each episode is devoted to fleshing out a character or giving some them some time to shine, through the use of magic in creative ways. The comedy and character interactions feel organic and the show has such a wonderful charm about it that I found myself smiling a plethora of times, especially seeing Akko grow as a person. As the show goes along, Akko learns shapeshifting magic, allowing her to change into various different animals, all of which are fun and are used in smart ways, while also looking absolutely adorable, especially the mouse transformation. This is perhaps best integrated in the twenty-first episode when Akko is rapidly changing between different animals whilst fighting against a large python.  While I have praised the story of Little Witch Academia a lot, it's still without its problems. For starters, the plot can feel a little too convenient at times, such as in the very first episode where Akko just so happens to come across Shiny Chariot's rod while in a forest and some of the moments can feel too silly or contrived for my liking, such as when Akko comes across a super fast broom that is legendary in the world of magic, in a simple magic shop rather than in a museum, or, better yet, in Nuva Lova itself. However, while there are a few of these issues, I never found it ever to be too intrusive on my immersion or enjoyment of the series nor is it necessarily a game breaker either. The episodic plot lines may be annoying to some people wanting an overarching story all the way through, but, as I said, I believe each episode to be fun and creative enough to stand by itself, so I had no problem in regards to this area. One plot line can feel a little too predictable if you ask me, but, again, is something that doesn't really take all too much away from the overall experience or narrative.  The characters are also pretty great too, with each one having a very distinct personality that bounces off each other very well, especially in regards to the main trio, Akko, Sucy and Lotte. Akko is a character I've already talked about in detail, but her development and her character arc presented in episode twenty-two after learning something that changes her perception of her world are easily the best parts of the show, and seeing her grow into a more rounded person proves to be highly satisfying. She is a good lead for a show of this nature, taking into account her inquisitive nature, and she is often used for comedic, slapstick effect as well. While she can sometimes be a little too annoying in the early parts of the series, and some of her lines and dialogue and lines about dreams and passion can come across a little too corny as well, Akko's character is one that I wanted to see succeed; I became invested enough in her character to do so. Not only that, but she has a clearly defined goal in the series, which helps with plot progression as well as direction.  Lotte and Sucy are two of Akko's personal close friends who share one room together, and, as the series progresses, begin to bond closer to one another too. Lotte is much simpler than the other characters, both in design and personality, as she is perhaps the most down to Earth and calmest of the bunch. She plays the typical nerdy sort of character, and while she does receive some development, she is kind of pushed out from the forefront in favour of Akko. She has her moments but is far from being one of my favourite characters. Sucy, on the other hand, is the best girl of all times. Her appearance alone can convey everything about her character, and her voice actress does an amazing job at enhancing it too. She is essentially a pessimistic mushroom magic user, who finds enjoyment in using Akko as an experimental guinea pig while laughing maniacally about it. However, in the eighth episode of the series, and one of the best in my eyes, Akko has to dive into Sucy's subconscious, and there she meets hundreds of different versions of Sucy, all of which have different personalities to that of the original, representing Sucy's repressed emotions. While in this world, Akko watches a bunch of movies, that are Sucy's memories, and we learn that one of Sucy's best moments comes from her first meeting with Akko, and the various adventures they had up to that point. It's a sweet moment and gives us more indication that Sucy does care about her deep down, than what we were lead to believe from the start.  Diana's character also goes through a lot of development, as she begins to respect and grow fond of Akko more and more in response to Akko's improved magical abilities such as in episode thirteen, when Akko proves her magical capabilities in front of a massive audience while taking on, and even helping, a large, cursed creature. While Diana, in the early parts of the series is stuck-up and pretty bitchy, she becomes more bearable and likeable as the episodes come along, especially over the course of her own respective story arc in the nineteenth and twentieth episodes, which I touched on briefly before, but also in episode twenty-three when she is talking to Akko in a cafe and opens up her own childhood love of Shiny Chariot as well. It explains why her character acts and behaves the way she does and also adds deeper insight and depth to her as a person too. Andrew's character too, as I've touched upon too, also develops in the scene that he comes to understand and appreciate the world of magic a bit more, but his character is also a gateway to understanding the rest of the world's stance of how magic is used in the modern era, and, I've said, I really liked the relationship formed him and Akko. While it is nothing romantic, there are slight hints of it here and there, but it never comes to any surface level or feels too intrusive on the more interesting aspects of the show.  Undoubtedly, the crux of the show and its narrative weight is the relationship between Akko and Ursula-sensei, and while I won't get too much into the specifics why and what this entails, since I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible in this review, just note that this is the one that forms the backbone for the series to rest upon. The other members of the cast are also very fun to watch as well, whether that be the various teachers with their odd eccentricities, such as professor Lukic, a mad potions teacher who lines never failed to make me laugh. One of my favourites of the side characters was Constanze, who doesn't even utter a single word yet we can understand what she is thinking just from her body language and facial expressions alone. We don't really learn or understand why she doesn't speak in the series, but she allows us to understand that the world of magic is not all about wands, but also machinery, as she seems to merge both technology and magic together, adding onto the theme I was talking about earlier. She also has my favourite episode in the show in which she builds a giant ship that transforms into a robot, which is an obvious homage to Gurren Laggan, typical of Studio Trigger. Also, that little smile that Constanze delivers the end of the episode after being thanked by Akko is wonderfully adorable.  In terms of animation, this is probably the best (and most consistent) show that Trigger has made thus far. The animation is very bouncy, with lots of energy and pull and stretch for that cartoon-y esque feel. It genuinely feels that, while not as polished, it could be a show that someone like Disney would create, in regards to how colourful, creative and fun everything is. It's character designs are great and can tell you everything about the character's personality just from a glance and it can sometimes showcase some absolutely fantastic animation. However, there are some art issues here and there, but, for the most part, the animation is so bouncy that it doesn't really affect the show all too much. The music is also pretty damn good with two amazing opening tracks, ""Shiny Ray"" and ""MIND CONDUCTOR"". I especially love the opening animation to MIND CONDUCTOR too, and the music used in the show itself is also great, especially the main theme. It is catchy, memorable and damn well composed, adding onto the more heartfelt and emotional moments the anime attempts to convey.  If you can't yet tell from my relentless praise, I love this show. It is a wonderful reminder of why I love animation as a whole and the entire show has such an innocent, child-like wonder about it as well. From its wonderful characters, great narrative and creative world, this show ticks all the boxes for me personally in terms of what a show should have, and I do highly recommend this anime, as well as the two movies that came before it as well. Little Witch Academia has the luxury of being an original show, and thus also has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've seen in a long time, which only further cemented this anime as one of my favourites of all time. Everything about this show has a genuine sense of, well, genuineness about it, and it feels like the team behind it put their all into making it, and had a blast while doing so, which is all I can really ask for at the end of the day. With that, I thank you for reading my review, and I wish you all a great day!";Recommended
2;Little Witch Academia (TV);Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"A magical world in Little Witch Academia is one I can describe as imaginatively beautiful. Beauty is expressed there not just by world fiction but by the context of its creativity. I don’t mean just the world either but the show itself is filled with characters, themes, and storytelling that make you want to go back and watch it all over again.  Little Witch Academia is perhaps unique with the fact that it’s an adaptation of a successful film. The first film originated in 2012 as part of the Young Animator Training Project and spawned a sequel titled Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade. Now, we have a full TV series based on the franchise that all began from the creativity of those animators. Watching Little Witch Academia is pretty simple with an open mind especially if you’re a fan of magical girl theme series. It has the characters that makes the storytelling feel special, a world with seemingly endless possibilities, and moments that will be unforgettable.  From the first few episodes, we are introduced to the world that shows its content by events and story rather than a dull dialogues. School life at Luna Nova is also shown in details as we see how Akko, the main female protagonist lives her daily life. Of course, Luna Nova is no ordinary school and in fact contains lots of secrets that defies the law of nature. From here, you’ll find witches, magical creatures, spellbooks, and iconic flying broomsticks. The storytelling connects to the history of the school with its characters as well so from in it, viewers will learn the origins of the world. What I find impressive is how this series continuously build on its world setting with every episode that makes you want to find out more and more.  At the centerpiece of the story is Akko. She’s a young girl who has grew up to admire Shiny Chariot, a famous witch performer. This inspired Akko to actually attend Luna Nova and in essence, she hope to meet Shiny Chariot one day in person. While she’s there, Akko also makes friends and rivals. Along her side, she is good friends with Lotte, a friendly girl with a talent of summoning spells. Then, there’s Sucy the mischievous girl with a talent of potion making and causing bizarre incidents. These three characters all have different personalities but manages to get along as they learn more about each other. The character chemistry between the three evolves throughout the show although it doesn’t exceed expectations. For instance, Lotte and Sucy gets less screen time later on as the plot evolves into much more complex twists and turns. Akko’s growth as a character is what this show focuses on the most. From the start, she’s a talentless witch and known for causing trouble. These often result in unintentional hazards but nonetheless, Akko is viewed as a fool by many of her professors and classmates in the beginning. Most interestingly though, Akko is able to wield the Shiny Rod, a staff that previously belonged to Chariot herself. In the meantime, there’s also Diana, a character that stands as a foil to Akko. Unlike her, Diana is talented, comes from a prestigious family, and is respected by many of her classmates and professors. Her philosophy of magic also contrasts with Akko and in turn, she serves more or less as a rival; although this seemingly comes from Akko’s point of view. As the series progresses, we can see that Diana is both impressed and surprised by Akko’s feats in certain magic from certain episodes. In retrospect, character relationship in this show between friends and rivals evolves for fans to enjoy.  While the series itself contains a lot of goofy moments, it does have a serious side. The first half of the show involves mainly of how Akko and her friends gets used to academy life while the second half concentrates more on plot with the series getting more in-depth with its characters. One of the more noticeable character in the series is Ursula, a friendly professor that takes Akko under her wing. The two has a close relationship and Ursula realizes Akko’s strong desire to become a witch. Furthermore, Akko and Ursula holds a similar belief in magic and it’s from their philosophy that we can see how close they become. Now you may be questioning yourself: what about antagonists? Are there real threats that comes to surface against the main characters? To answer that, it’s more about how the characters deals with them rather than just resolving certain conflicts. I can say honestly that the show is much more appealing when you invest into the character motivations and realize why characters do certain things. As such, Little Witch Academia isn’t a magical girl show that’s about saving the world from evil but rather much more focused on character building and realization.  As much as creative as Little Witch Academia seems to be, you may not be too impressed if you’ve seen a lot of magical girl theme shows before. Magical schools is hardly a hot new theme as many series have done it before. Furthermore, our main character Akko can be frustrating to watch at times. Sure, she is fun to watch and brings a lot of comedy into the show. However, she is still considered one of the most talentless witches at the school and it’s frustrating at times to see her fail in certain subjects. I can confess that sometimes, I wish she would just get it right the first time. Other characters in the show such as Amanda excels in certain areas that makes her look like an idiot at times too. This show does teach a valuable lesson though and is that hard work can have its own rewards and consequences.  As a fan of studio Trigger, my expectations were definitely met with the production quality. It’s goofy, cartoony, yet visually appealing that captures the magic of this series together. Characters’ personalities matches with their appearances and everything seems to be in place according to its world fiction. Nova Luna is also designed in the way that I’d picture it would be and like in the movies, it expands much more than just what it appears. Character expressions are also crafted in ways that look humorous especially for cases such as Akko and Sucy. I mean, who can forget when Akko transforms into an adorable mouse and running around at school? On the action side, the show does a neat job with formulating magic and showing how spells work beyond than words.  I have to give some praise to the voice actors. Akko’s voice sounds exactly how I would imagine with her impulsiveness and eager to succeed. On the other hand, I’m also impressed by Diana’s voice of confidence that makes her character status believable. Sucy is also noticeable for her meek yet mischievous voice tone that fits her personality perfectly. The OP and ED theme songs are also done with colorful choreography. While I can’t say the OST is anything to take home, it’s still serviceable to get the job done.  Little Witch Academia is a beautifully crafted show that brings magic to a level that’s larger than life. With a graceful cast of characters, memorable moments, creative storytelling, and imaginative world, it’s definitely worth getting invested into. Even if you’ve never seen the films or a magical girl show in your life, it’s still a show that I can recommend for some wild and vivid fun. It hits the right numbers in many areas for what a magical girl show should be.";Recommended
3;Little Witch Academia (TV);LeaderTGW;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LeaderTGW;8;"Before I being, let me say this. I am very grateful to Tattun the producer, for visiting 4chan during the time LWA aired. Many fans, myself included, had the opportunity to ask him a bunch of questions, and learn a few interesting things about the story and characters. So in the unlikely chance you’re reading this, Thank you buddy!   Little Witch Academia’ (depending on viewers’ opinion) can be summed up as either “a charming, adventurous title; full of unique characters, interesting storylines, and filled with fun & entertainment.” On the other hand, it can be summed up as a disappointing, overly self-referential, lackluster title; full of too many western references, terrible pacing, filler, shoehorned, and plain one-dimensional characters.  Inside the magical, heartwarming tale of Little Witch Academia, we follow our annoying (but loveable… admit it!) protagonist Atsuko “Akko” Kagari. Akko is human with the burning passion of becoming a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot! Watching the story unfold is one that viewers will certainly enjoy watching. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable things about little witch academia’s story is that it provides multiple re-occurring themes that fit well with the story.  The best one that is shown over and over throughout the series is ambition. Many of the women enrolled at Luna Nova academy show determination, and work hard to achieve their personal goals. Akko of course has to work the hardest because she has no talent. It feels like such an accomplishment to witness Akko and the others achieving their goals! I felt like that was the biggest payoff the story had to offer.  I was skeptical during the first 6 episodes; the content provided had failed to meet my expectations. In comparison to the OVA and movie, the quality of the TV anime appeared a bit more childish. The plot for each episode was overly simplified, coupled with terrible pacing. It was so bad that I felt like I was watching a children’s show.  Compared to studio triggers other titles, the content provided in LWAs’ story is tame. You won’t find over the top violence, blood and gore, overly sexualized characters, and other mature themes that you would usually see in a Trigger anime.  The transition from mature content to child-friendly was a little disappointing, and hard for me to get used to. But, after giving it some time, I got used to it. I must admit that Little Witch Academia’s story is fine as it is, childish and all. Some of the best episodes provide viewers with interesting narratives, humorous content, a wee bit of romance, and finally thrilling action. The lackluster episodes are almost filler like, with unnecessary and unwanted subplots, which do not add anything further to the story. In short, the subplots ruin the pacing of the story.  The middle of the series, the rising action, and the events leading to the climax of little witch academia was very disappointing. The pacing and action leading up to it was awful! It kills the hype that the show had previously had. It felt as if writers and director just wanted to rush into something bigger, as seen in episode 24. The writers ended whatever evil plot the antagonist had earlier, just to create another conflict which would have the Akko and friends defeat it.   Supporting characters in the story?  The supporting characters that are not Ursula-sensei, lose their value towards the rising action. During the last four or five episodes; Sucy, Lotte, and Amanda‘s crew, are demoted to background characters, and get at least 10 minutes (if even that) of screen time. It isn’t until last three episodes that we see the supporting characters comeback however; they’re basically around just to cheer Akko as well as give her help when needed.  The 25 episodes of little witch academia were generally good, and at times decent. While I was not impressed with the pacing and filler; I did enjoy the sweet and tender parts the show had to offer. I gave the story and 7 and a half out of 10 because I felt that even though the show was good, it still had a bunch of glaring problems and wasted potential.   Characters  I feel bad that there isn’t much that I truly enjoyed about the supporting characters other than Ursula.  I felt that Ursula was the only support that mattered because she helped the story progress. Diana would be a close second however; even she gets pushed to the side. Other than that, I felt that the characters were great. They were full of personality and fun to see on screen.  In the beginning I hated Akko. She’s so one-dimensional. Not to mention she’s annoyingly loud & dumb to the point where I just want to fast forward through every scene she is in. Despite this, Akko does have redeeming qualities to her; especially when her character starts to develop. In a weird way, she sort of reminds me of Naruto Uzumaki from the Naruto franchise. She’s loud, annoying, and stupid. However, when she’s determined to do something, she’s willing to work hard, train, and never give up! It makes her fun to watch.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, supporting characters lose all value (and to an extent) purpose. They’re subjugated to being nothing more than background characters with little to no lines. I felt that, in exchange for an episode based upon a supporting character, they would have to lose their screen time in order for the story to focus more on Akko.   Art and Visual direction/Sound  Could have been better! I liked the designs; some of the settings were unique. The animation was okay. I wasn’t impressed with it, I felt like some of the special effects were poor in quality. As far as the character designs go, I felt that they were great. I’m honestly looking forward to the art book! WE WILL SUPPORT IT TATTUN!  The opening and ending songs were great; some of the background music was okay. I felt that some of the songs composed for this anime didn’t quite fit well with the atmosphere & settings they took place in. Also, the music didn’t do that good of a job bringing exciting moments to life. The voice acting was great however, the audio quality sounds like they were using budget microphones in the studio. I listened to Little witch academia using “Bose quiet comfort 35” headphones. I must admit, if you have a good pair of headphones or speakers, listen closely and you’ll hear how bad the sound quality is. Especially during scenes where there are monologues.  Enjoyment and overall feelings.  Is Little Witch Academia Academia a project Trigger should be proud of? I would say yes! It’s different. It’s something unique, I feel that it’s one of those shows that could catch on, and sell well if marketed correctly. I strongly believe that LWA needs a push. It needs to branch out more to be successful. I’m not saying that the series isn’t, it’s just that Trigger needs to make it stand out more.  I felt that little witch academia was well worthy of an 8/10 and I would strongly recommend it!";Recommended

Warning: if you are an OVA/Movie Fanboy that didn't like this series because they aren't like the OVA/Movie, then fuck off, because neither the OVA or the movie matters here, this is a 100% original anime from the hands of TRIGGER. also bewary of spoilers  Story 8/10:  ohh were to Start? Little witch academia goes around Atsuko Kagari (AKA Akko) a girl that always cherished Magic from the bottom of her heart. her dream to become a Witch and spread happiness to the world started when she saw a Live magic show from ""Shiny Chariot"". with that on her mind, she decided to go to ""Luna Nova"" the magic school where Shiny Chariot assisted in order to become a powerful and incredible witch just as Shiny Chariot was, and maybe she could meet her Idol. sadly, there is one big problem Akko has, she isn't very good with magic, and for some reason is very difficult for her to use magic or even to fly on a broom. this way, she gets to meet Sucy and Lotte, 2 witches that helps her to reach Luna Nova, but on the attempt something happens and they fall over a pretty dangerous forest, and right here, starts the adventure of our favorite Witch: Akko  After finding the Shiny Rod, and dealing with the dangers inside the dangerous forest, Ursula-sensei appears and tells Akko some magical words that Akko must cast in order to use the Shiny Rod and save their asses, teleporting everyone into Luna Nova (also falling in the middle of the ceremony) and that summarizes the introduction of this show  it might become boring and frustrating after this point, because the very first episodes are mostly dedicated to slice of life, character development and character introductions (might be the reason why so many people gave up on this show, they basically didn't want Trigger to save Anime) but after a while, they get us into the main plot of the show, which is to restore magic with the power of the ""words"" that Akko must find and cast, Akko, and only Akko, because she was the one chosen to do the task. each single ""word"" has a major meaning to magic and the show itself, since most of them comes from the bottom of the heart, from that heart that stills believe in magic, that heart that won't give up no matter what, but Akko must find first the meaning of each single word in order to cast them, once that happens, the Shiny rod will shine and cast the most beautiful magic you're going to see, I'm pretty sure you don't want to lose such an marvelous watch like that  as for how much this show has to offer, there are a lot of secrets that most of magic holds, and the witches itself. secrets that might make you happy, sad, hyped, Yay +100000000000 or Yay -100000000000, even references to other anime (Specially from Trigger itself)  Art 10/10:  from this point I think that people is retarded, I've seen a lot of people complaining because the animation sucks... are they blind? what anime did they watch? because the animation of this show is TRULY a WORK OF ART, there is almost no usage of CG animation, which makes it even better when it comes to animate huge things and action scenes with a lot of movement, or even scenes that are tranquil but the animation quality makes up for it to deliver a gorgeous experience and keeps you hooked into it while you have your mouth open wide as how beautiful it looks. completely refreshing and gorgeous, even the animation of the OP and ED are really well done and makes a good resonance with the Sound department.  if what people criticizes here is by any means some derpy looking faces, then they should just jump off from a bridge, because how the hell will you expect to have good looking faces most of the time, while spending a lot of budget into great and beautiful scenes? or would they like to see no derpy faces while having bad choreography at action scenes or gorgeous scenes?  Sound 9/10:  I didn't got attracted to the first OP and ED, yet they were quite good overall, but nothing compares to the second OP and ED that are simply beautiful with 2 excellent songs that hyped me even more (specially the Ending that is really beautiful, or in the Opening where Chariot and Croix appears as Akko and Diana faces against each other)  the whole cast of seiyuus on this anime did a great job (heartbreaking me of course) but I didn't find myself hating any character by their voice or anything like that, in fact, having one character just making some noises (Constanze) makes it really cute. and lets not forget about the soundtrack of the anime itself, it just not only makes a good resonance with the Art department, it delivers the feels it has to deliver to your ears, call it eargasm if you want. but the whole OST is lovely  Character 9/10:  oh boy, one of the biggest appeals of this show is their characters cast, it can have some generic characters, Like Amanda or Diana (the bully and the ""perfect"" in this case) but their development is really like REALLY great, and guess what? all that development greatness happens because of Akko's greatness and invincible will to believe in magic. just like Simon Believed in the Simon that believes in himself on TTGL, that kind of power, the power that made Simon a Man. its the same power that made Akko a great character that influences those that are around her, making them great characters in the progress. even more as we get to know about their past and reasons (for example Diana, Ursula and Akko) with a really heartbreaking connection that explains everything, that and how each single one of them supports Akko, its like they got ""Akkoided"" hahaha understand? ""Akkoided"", I know, I'm really bad at jokes  lets not forget about Chumlee or that dude that looks a lot like that History channel show of ""Pawn Stars"" (mostly known in spanish memes as ""No lo sé Rick Parece falso"")  Enjoyment 9/10:  after losing my faith into anime with your typical seasonal generic garbage, and seeing how some great jewels gets underrated because they don't have anything like boobs bouncing or something like that. Little Witch Academia and Triggers delivers and my faith has been restored. Trigger has saved anime one more time with a gorgeous fantasy world of magic that is really appealing with a heart touching story that will make you believe in magic  Overall 9/10:  I'm not implying that you will mostly likely love this show, that depends on you yourself, and no one else, not even my review. that belongs on your sole experience while watching this anime. if you like it, then welcome to the club, if you don't then just pass away.  TL;DR: Trigger saves anime, Witches earns the love of their watchers while showing off gorgeous animation, great characters, great soundtrack, original ideas, and the power of believing in magic  I would like a second season now... please Trigger ;~;";Recommended
5;Little Witch Academia (TV);KingKatsura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KingKatsura;9;"A believing heart is your magic – with Little Witch Academia, Trigger furnishes something so enchantingly brilliant in its simplicity and heartfelt resonance, executes every detail with the utmost bliss, and ultimatley drowns the viewer in a recurring feeling of wonder; unto the conclusion that a believing heart can amount to nothing more and nothing less than that certain thing we all hope for but can't quite materialize.  I realized I was in for a treat as the first episode ended and I was already wholeheartedly immersed in the characters and lore, which is a fleetingly rare way to feel one episode into such an admittedly accessible and light-hearted series. I realized this anime was something special during the final scene of the third episode, as Akko looked on as a Shooting Star took flight, or so to speak. In the briefest of moments, Little Witch Academia gracefully painted the most beautiful picture of the essence of everything magic is, all the hopes and dreams it embodies, and all the unduly weight, whether ethical or relating to personal growth, it can hold in such a fantastical world. It achieved this without even a hint of dialogue, but that’s not to say Little Witch is something pretentiously rooted in an aversion to exposition, it just knows when a visual narrative is better suited than a verbal one, and vice versa. I realized this anime was most assuredly going to be my favorite series to air in years during the twelveth episode, when Akko was shown a vision of Chariot's youth; full of relatable blunders and missteps, but also joy in the purest form. Akko saw herself resonating in the the tumults of her idol, and through this she understood the cost of her dream, but more than that, she began to question her dream. Was it even her dream at all, or just the willfull embrace of another's dream that she sought to grasp onto with all her might? I realized Little Witch Academia was something bordering on truly great during the sixteenth episode, as Akko trudged through a snowy night on her lonesome in a desperate bid to save her friends, but never without her relentlessly believing heart beckoning her on and on. Reckless, unabashedly silly and floundering as she is, Akko never abandons her heart. She questions herself, becomes enveloped by doubt in her own innate ability on a regular basis, and struggles with her self-identify alongside the overcast shadow of Shiny Chariot and her opulent brilliance. But what is adversity to the human spirit? (Cue the plethora of Gurren Lagann parallels).  The cast is full but never overly packed; Akko’s compatriots all undergo their own trials and tribulations in a magical youth. Lotte blossoms into a confident aspiring witch from a timid and insecure young girl, whilst dealing with her own passions and dreams. Amanda grows from a delinquent to a warmer and more joyful person as Akko helps her battle against the price of perception. Andrew sheds the predeterminations of his upbringing to the tune of his own destiny. Diana, in particular, experiences a journey of personal growth rivaling Akko, literally and figuratively, as she grapples with the desire to fulfill everyone else’s immaculate expectations for her future, against her own aspirations. But behind her façade of flawlessness, Diana also struggles with pettiness and jealousy, which cleverly mirrors the main antagonist’s own conflicted youth, yet she seeks to avoids a similar folly through the kindness of others and her own stoically altruistic tendencies.  Little Witch Academia, simply put, has it all. Action, adventure, humour, tragedy. A captivating soundtrack befitting of the series's dynamic tone. Fantastical world building transpiring in the midst of a surprisingly relatable coming of age story. Hopes, the shadows they cast. Sorrow, and the malice it begets. Friendship, family, a penultimate story that delves into the potentially questionable integration of technology into our lives, and even a dash of romance. These various elements and directions all synthesize into a breathtaking typhoon of a final episode in which Trigger accomplishes everything that should have been acheived in the Kill La Kill finale, but wasn't, and unequivocally more, because while less ambitious in scope, Little Witch wondrously surpasses Kill La Kill in depth, and it does so on a much more profound level.  Little Witch attains a tremendous dichotomy between innocence and sin, and it does so without ever compromising its cheerful composition. This is something not seen often in the medium, or any television medium for that matter, as so many series tend to spiral down a path of ever-directionless developments in an attempt to double down on the seriousness they wish to hone in on. Fun characters and happy endings are so typically cast aside in favor of gratuitous darkness; and fun series are so typically averse to achieving realism in spite of their fantasy, almost too intimated at the daunting prospect of creating something timelessly relatable and enjoyable to even make an effort. Trigger shoot for the stars with Little Witch Academia, as they always do (to mixed results), and at last they reach their luminous destination after the wildest of rides.  Every motif and achievement in Little Witch can be translated to the real world upon equating what magic represents, to what the human spirit is and can be. Romanticized as it may be, the human spirit is infinite and life is geniunely whatever you make it. Little Witch articulates this through the hopes and dreams of its characters and how they relate to the convictions within their hearts. A person's actions can bely their hopes and dreams, but that is not to say hopes and dreams are so sedentary that they won't spring up when you least expect them to.  Yet, when all is said and done, Little Witch Academia doesn’t achieve artistic excellence via all of the above. It does so much more ephemerally, it does so simply and with solace, it does so with marvel and intrigue, it does so with everything it is and everything it does and everything it can be. Little Witch Academia is mesmerizing because it transforms magic into a believing heart.";Recommended
6;Little Witch Academia (TV);Hybrid_Rainbow29;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hybrid_Rainbow29;9;"1966: Mitseteru Yokoyama, inspired by the Japanese popularity of the US sitcom ‘Bewitched’, created a little Anime called ‘Sally the Witch’ about a young girl from a magical kingdom who came to earth and used her magic to help with the troubles of the world. This now sadly obscure title would go on to be highly influential in leading to the creation of the ‘Cute Witch’ genre, which would go on to be a subgenre for a much larger genre, the ‘Magical Girl’ genre. 1969: ‘Secrets of Akko-chan’ would expand upon the Magical Girl genre by introducing elements such as shapeshifting, and instead of involving a girl born with magic, involving an ordinary, relatable human character who attains such abilities. 1970: Osamu Tezuka’s ‘Marvellous Melmo’ further expanded the realms of the genre, intending it for an older generation of young girls than previous titles in the genre had been by implementing the mature themes of other Tezuka works. 1973: The most revolutionary title of its time, ‘Cutey Honey’ introduced concepts such as the Magical Warrior Girl, an influence of American Superhero comics. It also introduced the transformation sequence which has since been a staple of the genre. Additonally, its provocative and unapologetic fanservice made it one of the few magical girl titles that appealed to men and women, as well as one of the first aimed specifically towards an adult audience which would mould into the growing Otaku fan culture. 1975: ‘Meg the Witch Girl’ introduced the dark magical girl genre with a series involving domestic violence, substance abuse, extramarital relationships, and a politically charged mythos which introduced the Queen/Conquest element to the genre. 1980s: A decade in which Studio Pierrot effectively dominated the genre saw an increased focus on commercialisation to the now established Otaku subculture, as well as an increased focus on Magical Girl team dynamics. 1992: Naoko Takeuchi’s Genre defining ‘Sailor Moon’ became the first Magical Girl series to really break through into the West, becoming by far the most popular entry in the genre, and making the Magical Warrior the definitive face of Magical Girls. A series which embraced each trope of the genre (messages of love and hope, cute animal sidekicks, aimed towards a primarily female audience, elements which could be considered more Sci-Fi than Fantasy) to influence the likes of ‘Precure’ and ‘Wedding Peach’, but also had a compelling mythos and likeable cast of characters which causes it to still resonate with many to this day in a way that previous entries in the genre had not. 1998: ‘Cardcaptor Sakura’, the most minimalist and subversive entry in the genre up to that point bridged the gap between ‘Cute Witches’ and ‘Magical Warriors’ by including aspects of both genres, as well as mixing in Slice of Life elements. 2003: A 3 episode OVA remake of ‘Cutey Honey’ co-produced between Toei and Gainax saw a more self-aware, stylized interpretation of the genre, which was particularly notable due to its outlandish, fast-paced animation style which in part can be attributed to the Key Animation of Hiroyuki Imaishi who would go on to direct ‘Gurren Lagann’, and of course found Studio Trigger with fellow Gainax key-animator You Yoshinari who held much of the same kinetic animation style. 2011: Following a decade of increased evaluation on the genre in titles such as 2002’s ‘Princess Tutu’ and ‘Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha’ which branched out beyond the trappings of the genre, perhaps the most well-known subversion to the genre came with Gen Urobuchi’s ‘Puella Magi Madoka Magica’, an extremely dark, psychological Magical Girl series which looked at the traumatic side of being a Magical Warrior. This anime would prove to have an enduring popularity which resulted in an increased market of Dark Magical Girl series such as the ‘Wixoss’ franchise and ‘Magical Girl Raising Project’ 2013: In the midst of this backdrop of dark series came Studio Trigger’s crowdfunded debut feature, a 25 minute OVA titled ‘Little Witch Academia’, a ‘Cute Witch’ piece which endeared to a large audience with its likeable cast of characters, establishment of story threads which set up for potential continuations, and the Imaishi inspired high-energy and inventive animation style that would go on to define Trigger’s other works. It’s popularity of course then launched a sequel OVA, and a television series. The LWA project has resultantly become Trigger’s primary selling franchise, similar to Type Moon adaptations for Ufotable, or ‘One Piece’ for Toei. Fall 2016: A new subversion to the genre came in ‘Flip Flappers’ where rather than darkness, abstract surrealism which from a superficial perspective provide entertaining eye candy, and from an analytical perspective provides an intellectually stimulating observation on art and philosophy. Neither interpretation is wrong, but for the purposes of this review I will say it’s enjoyability is more relevant, as the series presented an alternative to series like ‘Magical Girl Raising Project’ the same season through its upbeat happiness. 2017: Coming immediately off the heels of ‘Flip Flappers’, the ‘Little Witch Academia’ tv series can be seen a confirmative shift away from the seemingly overpowering influx of darker Magical Girl series as of late with the series’ positive and upbeat attitude. Whereas ‘Flip Flappers’ had an abstract nature which caused it to go outside the Magical Girl genre however, ‘LWA’ is a Magical Girl series through and through, and is proud of that fact.  Ok, I apologise for that extremely long intro, but I decided to make that to service the point that I wish to make in this review. The simple version of it is that ‘LWA’s appeal stems from it being fun. The greater version of it is that there is more to it than simply “fun”, or that the “fun” of it holds an even higher emotional resonance for its audience. That it expertly creates a work of escapist fantasy which is exactly what the average anime fan is looking for, a goal which is reflected in its trademark Trigger style and expansion of what was established in the two OVAs. To gain a proper understanding of the series, one should certainly watch the two OVAs before giving the tv series a shot, as although it does begin at a point chronologically before them, there are multiple references and call-backs to them which require prior knowledge. As a magical girl series, ‘LWA’ feels very much like a reconstruction of the genre, with a premise which takes it back to its roots in the concept of ‘Cute Witches doing Cute things’, and while the witches in question certainly are cute, it also reverses that age-old concept in having Akko be an ordinary human who discovers the wonders of the witch world, as opposed to Sally who was a witch discovering humanity. This restoration, in addition to giving the series a unique place in a modern market dominated by the warrior subgenre, also allows for us, the audience, to experience this world through Akko’s eyes. Akko Karagi very much makes this series what it is, with her upbeat and excitable attitude matching the overall tone of the show fluently. Her desire to be achieve greatness in spite of her shortcomings and her stubborn nature and her relentless misdemeanour makes her a compelling and greatly relatable character who in equal parts is able to provide moments of comedic relief and incredible sympathy. Of course, this is all stuff we’ve before in the OVA, but what is unique to this series is the way in which her character grows and develops, as the timespan of 25 episodes allows for a large length of time for her development of her powers to feel authentic and realistic, while also slow enough that one can’t help but cheer when she finally succeeds in using them in episode 13. Akko is essentially us, the audience, the Otaku. The way that she looks up to Chariot reflects how many of us look up to our favourite Anime characters and how she sees value in what is essentially intended as merely a piece of escapist entertainment in Chariot's performances. The other characters previously seen are great also, Lotte is still the wise and humble voice of reason in Akko’s trio, Sucy, despite not going through any real development, does display her delightful eccentricities and hints that she cares more greatly for her friends than she is willing to openly admit. The greatest achievement of the cast however would have to Diana Cavendish, or Best Girl Diana, who goes through a significant development throughout the series. Many of us remember her from the OVAs as a snobbish and selfish antagonist to Akko, but the series highlights why she acts the way she does, as we learn more about her life and her personal situation. Although she seems stubborn towards Akko, she truly does care the wellbeing of the other students and like Akko hopes to prove herself. It is through her interactions with Akko that the quality of the writing shines brightest, as the success of Akko’s brash actions initially alienate her, but eventually helps her, causing the two to grow a closer bond with one another and eventually developing something resembling a friendship when they learn that they have more in common than they initially believed, note the festival scene at the beginning where you may notice a certain someone. When I described the series as ‘escapist’ earlier, I was referring to how it is able to embellish such a feeling of positivity in the viewer. This is reflected in many ways throughout the series, one such way is in how its world is presented. The series is split into two halves, with the first being an episodic, largely character and comedy driven series focusing more on character development than story progression, while the second half is more plot driven. While story elements such as Akko’s quest for the seven words to restore magic to the world and find her hero, Shiny Chariot, permeates through the whole series, the amount of time we have allows the writers to present a fully fleshed out world. This is particularly noticeable when we see the ordinary world where technology has largely replaced magic, and the conflict this presents to Luna Nova Academy. The concept of Magic becoming obsolete by way of technology is one that I can’t think of having been done in any other work of fiction before, so it is an interesting direction to take, bringing to the forefront the theme of traditionalism vs modernity, which we are able to view the multiple facets of, whether they be the stern and traditionalist attitudes of the Luna Nova elite, or the prejudiced attitudes of the modern world. The series never tries to take a side, as our main character opts for a middle ground in this conflict, though the series even confronts itself on that front when the main villain, Croix, takes such a position (seemingly, at least). This applies to one of the key themes of ‘LWA’, the idea that nothing exists in absolute terms. Sticking to the ways of old are clearly not working out entirely well for the Academy, but the negatives of life in the outside world are also emphasised, with many obvious references to real world political events such as football riots, racism, and the epidemic of internet trolling towards Yetis (and you thought this series was just “fun”). Yeah, I wasn’t expecting to see stuff like that from this franchise. In case you’re worried the series gets too political, you needn’t worry as, in keeping with that theme, the story never allows one side of itself to completely take over, thus this aspect is left primarily as an interesting backdrop. It is also reflected in the tone of the series, and some of the criticisms that I have seen. The first half of the series received some criticism for lacking story progression in favour of humour, while to a lesser extent some have also criticised the second half for being overly serious. I respectfully disagree with these viewpoints, as I feel that while the second half did indeed give us dramatic moments (well executed ones at that), they never reached too overboard with it or tried to become too melodramatic. The first half meanwhile did still see some story progression, particularly in the excellent episode 6. This theme is once again examined in the characters, many of whom at first may appear to be unlikeable, but we grow to like them more as the series progresses and they are shown to have more dimensions to them. Dianna is the most obvious example of this, but in one scene we even see this change in her two sidekicks when they thank Akko for jmgjb cvvnjkhf (spoilers). The new character of Andrew Hanbridge, a male non-magical equivalent of Dianna who holds society prejudices towards witchcraft, believing it to be an outdated tradition, but eventually grows to respect them through his experience with Akko, whom he initially takes a disliking to, but comes to hold a certain admiration for. Or in the sterner leadership of Luna Nova’s professor Finnelann, who ends up helping towards the climax. Even our main villain is shown to have a tragic and sympathetic backstory and is given a chance for redemption towards the end. If I must dispel with some negatives towards the series, I would say that while I wasn’t as bothered by the series pacing as most people were, the episodic nature of the series did hurt it in some places, such as when we get an episode which is mostly filler gets in the way between some significant story progression. One example of this for me would be episode 5, which I found to be a rather dull episode, lacking the series’ usual kinetic activity. Though I say mostly because even episodes such as this have something in them which does add to the series such as this episode being the one which introduced the technology conflict. Another thing is that being stretched across 25 episodes, the animation quality takes a significant downgrade from the OVAs, and can often feel a bit lacking in some areas. Finally, I would add that despite the length of the series, there are still some story elements which are left underdeveloped towards the end, such as the secret society of witch hunters from episode 18, or the fact that Lotte and Sucy, despite being Akko’s closest friends and getting their own individual episodes, do end up taking a backseat in numerous incidents. Yoshinari has expressed interest in creating a second season, and it feels like some elements were left in the dark to serve as potential sequel bait, though considering the question of whether a second season will come to fruition it does feel like a bit of a shame that the series doesn’t end on a conclusive note. That said though, the series we got was great. It was magical. Despite the animation taking a downgrade, it does still imbue Trigger’s trademark energy throughout, displaying a brilliant mix of speed and visual cohesion in the displays of magic in the series, with the highlight being a fast-paced broom race in episode 3. It additionally features visual influences of Disney cartoons and 70s Shoujo series, as well as multiple references of other works such as ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Evangelion’ (this is a Trigger work after all). I am also a fan of the decision to have the second ED be computer animated to reflect the shift in focus towards technology. Speaking of which, the magic also shines through in Michiru Oshima’s soundtrack. The Main theme and its variants are always a delight to listen to, whether it is the triumphant, loud rendition which plays during some of the series more visually spectacular moments, the lowkey version played during some of the more laid back, comedic moments, or the slow and quiet rendition played in the series’ more sombre and intimate moments. Being an Oshima soundtrack, it also incorporates elements of world influences, such as a Celtic track serving as the accompaniment of the series’ deeper mythos (it has a legitimately interesting mythos btw) or a soft, winterlike piano melody which we alongside the ‘search for Akko’ scene late in the series, those who’ve seen it know what I’m referring to. One word that I don’t think a lot of people will really bring to mind when thinking about this series is “balance”, as people wouldn’t normally associate high-octane Trigger-ism with that word. But I for one think that it does accurately describe ‘LWA’ as it’s episodic nature, despite being a negative in some areas, is a strength for the majority of the time, as it expertly expands upon the world established in the two OVAs. I’ve barely even mentioned the story of Ursula in this review, though I will say that it provides one of the great student-teacher duos in a year full of such duos. It all feels exactly like Yoshinari had planned this from the very beginning, and to see this long running, crowd-funded project come to fruition is truly a sight to behold. The fact that it does so while also providing a great escapist experience for our troubled times, reflecting those troubled times in the backdrop, and displays a multi-faceted and nuanced mythos and cast of characters makes the series a definite success, as well as an effective reconstruction of the fun side of Magical Girl series, and definitely one of my favourite Anime of the year. TL;DR: ‘Little Witch Academia’ is utterly magical! The character are magical! The setting is magical! The style is Magical! The series represents all of Trigger’s best qualities as a studio, and stands as possibly their strongest work to date, as well as serving as a fun dose of Magical Girl entertainment with a broad appeal. This right here, is why we watch Anime, because at the end of the day, it’s fun!";Recommended
7;Little Witch Academia (TV);atropicalpenguin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/atropicalpenguin;9;"Little Witch Academia is a story about a girl, Akko, who dreams to be the greatest witch, inspired by her idol, Shiny Chariot. In order to accomplish her dreams, she enrols in Luna Nova, an wizard academy to where her idol went and one of the most prestigios.  Story: Trigger follows its Kill la Kill formula with a first part that's mostly episodic, rarely moving the plot forwards, and with a basic objective the MC has to follow. KlK, nonetheless, executed it better. LWA tried to build around its characters with some very successful episodes and other somewhat boring, ""fillerish"". However, when the second part kicks in, it does with full force and it payoffs greatly.  Art and sound: Trigger does what it does best, with some breathtaking backgrounds and a great soundtrack. The way it plays homage to other animations styles is beautiful.  Characters: Much like the plot, characters at first may seem annoying, specially Akko, since she often tries to do things her way. Nonetheless it is easy to get attached to her, specially near the end of the anime. The rest of the cast is enjoyable, with girls like Sucy and Amanda that introduce a lot of fun.  Overall a very fun anime full of awe and magic. Little Witch Academia keeps the ""Trigger saved anime"" meme on and I hope this isn't the end of the story of Luna Nova.";Recommended

Imagine eating the same type of food for the rest of your life. That would be horrendous! In any case, my point is, after watching an immense amount of romance anime. I've begun to develop the feeling of tiresome towards it. So I had no choice but to gather up my will and try something other than romance. Which is, Little Witch Academia. An anime that I thought was simply one of the ridiculous anime where cute girls do cute things. Shockingly, I was wrong. I was so wrong. OK, I might be correct with the cute girls. But that's about it in a nutshell. This anime shattered my feelings of tiresome and boredness in a mere instant with just one episode. I did not expect this anime to surpass my expectations I first set AT ALL.  The excitement and thrills I get from this anime is overloaded. Every episode is just filled with happiness, tears of joy, and of course, fun! To put this anime in a serious perspective. It might've even surpassed Violet Evergarden even if it was just for a few seconds, minutes or hours. That's just how fun Little Witch Academia is. Though the plot of the story is not too great. The comedy fills the gap for it. Though it doesn't make me laugh. It made me smile and feel rejoiced. The art style is also great. Its unique. Its like a mixture of anime and cartoon together. As well as the sounds. The musics that fit scenes perfectly, the catchy OPs and EDs. The voice acting, the sound effects. Perfect.  Oh we're not done yet! I am also in love with the characters. Though I 100% agree that Akko is slightly annoying. She shares the same feeling I get of Suzumiya Haruhi but better ( no offense ). Furthermore, the character development of Akko is also...Impressively impressive that I subconsciously utter ""impressive"" although it isn't that impressive. ( I don't expect you to understand this part )  If you struggle to read this review. Sorry. I just don't really know how could I possibly write out my feelings towards this anime. Its nearly as hard to write as Violet Evergarden. Anyways. I'll just try to keep it short. This anime is an absolute MASTERPIECE! A hidden gem! So entertaining and thrilling to watch! I recommend everyone to at least try out this anime first and not judge it by its look. Seriously. You may not regret it at the end and come out like me. Who knows?  OK. That's about it. Now. Allow me to end this review with a magic spell.  Noctu..  Orfei..  Aude..  Fraetor!!!  Shiny-..Arc!!";Recommended
9;Little Witch Academia (TV);MasterHavik;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MasterHavik;10;"Sigh....here we go. It has been a long time since I watched a show this good. Studio Trigger does it again with another Little Witch Academia! This time it's different compared to a show like Kill la Kill. Instead of an emotional impactful ending like Kill la Kill. We were given a more heartwarming feel good ending. Now, let's breakdown how this show was able to differ itself from Kill la Kill.  Story: Our story tells the tale of one human Atsuko ""Akko"" Kagari with the drive and passion to become a great witch like her hero Shiny Chariot. Along the way she makes friends with two other young witches in Lotte and Sucy. The story first party takes an episodic approach as a way to introduce to the world of LWA, specifically Luna Nova Academy and the city it is not far from. I felt this was a good idea and not a bad approach. I know some would argue they wanted it to be more story driven from the start, but I would argue it is better to set the scene and give life to your setting first. The first half of LWA avoided two HUGE pitfalls from a narrative perspective because of this approach.(See episode 5 and episode 10for example).  The first half does a good job showing off all the goals and passions of Akko making this her story. Everything is about her journey. That's important to remember. Now the second half is more story driven as Akko finds these things known as words. They become very central part of the plot as Akko is collecting them. The show uses this chance to pair her off with other side characters like Amanda and Constanze. This works very well for the narrative because those characters get their moments to shine and you show how they bounce off Akko too. I will say early on I felt Akko was just being used as the punching bag for comedy, but then I realized around episode 8 and 10 where the story was.  At the end of the day, Little Witch Academia is about Akko. It is written in the same vein kind of like Kill la Kill, but Kill la Kill flush out more than just Ryuko. This one is more focus on its main character and does a good job building the story around her. The ending of this story shows us that. That is why many were so happy for Akko in the end.  Art: Studio Trigger joins the short list of animation studio that give you high quality and top notch artwork and set design. It is a huge treat that we an original production that is 2D hand drawn from start to finish. The character design of each and every character in Little Witch academia pretty realistic for the most part outside of some monsters, but they do a good job with making a mostly female cast look different. All of them have a look and quirk to them. For example, when everyone is dress up in their witch attire has their legs showing. Sucy doesn't show her legs.  Another can found in the teachers as they are all varying heights and sizes. Ursula has bigger hips compared to the other teachers. The principal is very short and you don't see her legs. See what I mean? That is just a taste of the amazing art in the show. Having varying designs will makes your cast of characters stand out.  The animation, especially the action scenes, are top notch and very exciting and intense. I really like the camera work and perspective shot they used in big magically moments. Little Witch Academia is easily one of the best animated shows of the decade along side Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking.  Sound: I have yet to watch the English dub of this show. So, I won't be able to talk about the dub sadly. Though, I will say it has a cast that I like a lot. I look forward to hear Erica Mendez as Akko.(She was also Ryuko in the last Studio Trigger show that was dubbed.). Now with that said, Little Witch Academia has some of the best Japanese voice acting I have heard in a while. It is usually not as sharp you get in other shows. Megumi Han does a great job making Akko cute and likable. She really shrinks her teeth into this role and makes the most of it. She is a joy to listen to and really bounces well off others. A couple of other performances I'll like to also take note is Noriko Hidaka as Ursula, Junko Takeuchi also plays one of my favorite characters but it's a huge spoiler, and lastly Yoko Hikasa as Diana. Studio Trigger did an amazing job casting for this show.  For music and sound design, they are also pretty topnotch and very good with music always fitting the scene and going along with the flow of the story. They really do a good job of placing the right sounds to fit every scene. They really do a good job of placing the right sounds to fit every scene. They really make sure the music doesn't overpower the scenes.  Character: A good show is nothing without characters. Little Witch Academia has lots of that. But keep in mind majority of the character development is only happening to a handful of characters. Most of the cast in Little Witch Academia are playing supporting roles that help the main character out. So yes this even goes for fans of Sucy and Lotte. They have roles to play. So this show really is gonna be up to if you like Akko or not. I love her, but I don't know everyone would like her. She is brash, loud, but has such a huge drive and passion that makes me want to root for her. So, I believe she is an affective main character. This is boosted by how good the supporting cast is around her.  In closing this show is amazing and desperately needs a season 2. I won't spoil, but I will say it didn't end like Kill la Kill. that isn't to say Kill la kill's ending was bad or anything. I am just telling you this show has more to tell and I know me and others want to see more.";Recommended
10;Little Witch Academia (TV);Thebigredsky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thebigredsky;10;"So it was a couple of months into quarantine, and the boredom was finally starting to get to me. And for the longest time I've wanted to get into anime, but never had enough time or energy to sit down and get into a show. That however changed may of this year when I finally decided to take my true first steps into the medium. I'm mentioning all this now because if I come across as bias in this review then I apologize in advanced, as this show means a lot to me, and has helped me through copping with this year. That being said I still plan on being as unbiased and objective as possible when reviewing lwa.  I felt the story was great for what the show set out to do. Season 1 is very simple yet also extremely charming. As it has Akko and co living there school lives and dealing with the challenge that come with learning how to be a great witch. It did a great job introducing me to the characters, as well as slowly leading into Akko's true journey in having to collect the 7 words of Arcturus. Where as season 1 gives us an introduction to the world and characters, season 2 is where the story truly begins, as in introduces the series villain, and has Akko go forth in completing her quest that was teased in season 1. With a plot twist regarding Akko's idol that had my jaw on the floor, this season does a great job at telling a story with the characters that were built up in season 1. My only real issue with the story is the fact that the ending doesn't really feel like an ending to a series. It's a good ending to the season but as the ending to the series, it feels off. Like while Akko's abilities in the very first episode compared to her abilities in the very last episode are a definite improvement, I still feel as if her arc as becoming a great witch feels unfinished. If I had to compare it to anything it'd be like if mha ended at the moment Deku learned to use 5% of one for all. The story we do have tho is still great, and there's nothing about the story itself that I feel is bad personally.  The artwork for this show is beautiful. It's very cute and magical feeling, and it does a great job at really getting you immersed in this world. The music is also amazing. It takes me back to when I was a child, and really does a great job at giving me this child like wonder when I listen to it. Would definitely recommend you give the soundtrack a listen to if you get the chance.  I don't have a problem with any character in this show. We get to see a lot about a wide variety of characters in this show, with some episodes being dedicated to learning more about a side character, turning what would be a eh-ish background character, into someone interesting. Even characters such as Diana's goons (Hannah and Barbra) ended up being really funny. The only character the show I feel neglected was Jasminka. She's cute and I like her but she legit feels like the only character that ""is just there"". Tho I still felt as tho the characters in this anime we're great.  Overall I had an amazing time with this anime. It's become one of my favorite anime, and I thank it for helping me get into anime. I'd definitely recommend give it a watch, I'll definitely be re-watching lwa sometime in the future. With all that being said tho this show could REALLY benefit from getting a new season.";Recommended
11;Little Witch Academia (TV);Tyrannicswine117;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyrannicswine117;10;Warning possible Spoilers  After Kill La Kill, I was always wondering what Trigger's next big hit would be and after seeing the first LWA short film and the Enchanted Parade, it made me think that this could be a great TV series and after finally watching it, I wasn't just surprised, I was amazed.  Story (10/10)  The story follows a girl named Atsuko Kagari or Akko for short, who wants to be a witch like her idol Shiny Chariot so she can make people smile and be happy with her magic, however her journey takes her on many adventures, meeting new friends, a mysterious quest and what it takes to be a true witch albeit a clumsy one. I loved the story, I wasn't expecting it to be as fulfilling and enjoyable when I started. I was more expecting it to be jam packed with Comedy, which it was, but it was also serious when it had to be and had a lot of charm to with where the story was going. The first 10 episodes go about in a random sort of fashion, where we see Akko getting on the ropes of magic and trying to improve it while also giving some time for friends Sucy and Lotte to have a couple of episodes to each other, this was nice giving them more character development. Once you reach episode 11 however, the story really starts to settle in as Akko starts to find the missing words of the shiny rod and trying to find Shiny Chariot, new characters are also brought in, who are linked to Chariots past. Some other characters also get episodes dedicated to them along with Diana who becomes a better character compared to her movie counter-parts, showing she isn't the meany she isn't cracked up to be. Then we reach the final episodes which were just brilliant, I mean the episodes before were really enjoyable, but once you reach the final episodes the emotional scenes really start to get to ya and I was surprised how touching some of these scenes were, plus the show ended in a way where I felt satisfied and actually think this show doesn't need another series, because it cleared everything up. I also liked how there were certain messages in there too, for example changing the old ways into the new ways isn't always a good thing and how believing in yourself is the strongest kind of magic, it's always nice to see stuff like this which create a bigger picture.  Characters (9/10)  I think the characters is the only short coming here, but it's not because any of the characters were bad, I just think a certain few didn't get the screentime I was expecting. Akko is probably hands down my favourite female character from this year, because she was fantastic, sure she's clumsy, stubborn and a little irrational, but seeing her journey throughout the anime shows that she can be a caring, loving and determined person. Whenever she got stuck or kept failing she would always keep trying till she did it and she would always put her friends before herself, plus she could be surprisingly smart at times. Akko is the definition of a great character and enjoyed every moment she was one screen, although I will admit some of her decisions were a bit much. Sucy and Lotte are Akko's friends that she meets on the first day at the academy, these two were a great pair to team up with Akko as their reactions to her misdeeds were always funny, yet they would still follow her into dangerous situations showing how much they care about her. Lotte was the most cautious yet the smartest of the trio and would always come with a spell to help Akko out and Sucy was goddamn hilarious with her don't give a fu*k attitude and obsession with mushrooms, it was funny seeing her pick on Akko's attics, but she still cared about her none the less. Now despite getting an episode each Sucy and Lotte do sorta drift in the background when the episodes started focusing more on Akko and the story which was a bit of a shame really, although luckily they start to become more of presence during the final episodes. Diana is Akko's rival in some cases, but despite being her rival at first she actually does become a much better character once you find out more about her background and family history. She may look like someone who is the best at everything that she does, but she has become a person who detached themselves from something they love and Akko makes her realise that, so before you hate her character it's best to stick it out and wait for her development stages. Amanda, Constanze and Jasminka are the trio that Akko and the others befriend over time, Amanda is pretty much a tomboy, Constanze is a quiet engineer whizz and Jasminka is just a food lover. These 3 characters do provide some extra comedy and actually prove to be a bigger help to Akko than even she realises, they were enjoyable characters especially when they got an episode of their own showing the true extent of their personality. I know there is other characters like Ursula, Croix and Andrew, but I'd rather keep these characters under wrap and leave some of the mystery to find out for yourself, because they were really interesting characters that push the story forward in many ways.  Art (10/10)  The art team at Trigger did a fantastic job on this show, because even though it might remind you of Harry Potter, this anime still feels like it's own world and every episode had that one or more scenes that would just blow my goddamn mind, because of how amazing it looks. I never doubted Trigger for one second when it came to the art department, especially after Kill La Kill, but I have to applaud them for paying very close attention to the detailing of the show and the characters look great too in the Trigger like fashion. I also really liked how it was also set in the UK (much like Harry Potter), But I feel like the UK is the best place for this type of setting.  Sound (10/10)  Between Shiny Ray and Mind Conductor it was very difficult to think which one was better, because Shiny Ray gave off that magical feeling while also feeling like it was expressing Akko's love and determination towards magic, while Mind Conductor had a more action feel to it and this did fit the second half of the series as the story really started to escalate. I think Shiny Ray wins by a small margin, because it really feels like the kind of op LWA would have. The soundtrack is also very well done, it would always hit the right notes at the right time, like whenever Akko was giving some kind of speech the music would start to feel heroic in some way while during emotional moments the notes would have a sorrow feel making you feel sad at the same time, so the soundtrack was definitely nailed here.  Extras:  When it comes to having a magical feeling, LWA definitely got it completely right, yes Magic is it's main focus, but there have been anime's or even normal TV shows and films that haven't done it very well. LWA goes into a lot of situations to do with magic that seem relatable to certain things that happen in the real world like how technology has gotten rid of many things we used to use a lot, which is something we see in LWA and seemed like a good plot point for the story, because it makes Akko realise just how vital Magic is. I also really loved the Comedy too, everything Akko and her friends did that got them into trouble or made them manage to miraculously figure out a situation in the nick of time was very funny to watch, but the most important part was it's timing and it always did it at the right time, well maybe except a few times where Akko made a decision which was meant to be funny, but ended up looking a little silly, however the comedy did keep me entertained and luckily backed off when a serious or emotional moment appeared.  Enjoyment (10/10)  Overall (10/10)  Overall Little Witch Academia is a true example of how awesome magic can be, while also giving us a fantastic story, characters, soundtrack and a beautiful artstyle which made me feel glad to see after watching how brilliant the other adaptions were, it's definitely one of my favourite anime's from this year.;Recommended
12;Little Witch Academia (TV);Artrill;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Artrill;7;"[7.5/10] _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  A testament to the episodic format, Little Witch Academia is, at least in the first half, closer to a Saturday-morning cartoon from the west than it is any anime that I've seen. It made me nostalgic. Nostalgic to moments, years ago, which I hardly even remember. The lazy, early mornings, having a hand resting on my shoulder slowly pushing me awake. My eyes fluttering open and the sight of a loved one telling me to get my breakfast. Running down the stairs and being greeted by a bowl of cereal and my favorite cartoon.  Put frankly, the first thirteen or so episodes of Little Witch Academia were exactly as wonderful as ""The Enchanted Parade."" This first half was the most wholesome and enjoyable experience I had in anime since I watched Nichijou. It felt as though, through my older eyes, I was thrust into a new, quirky world that I got to uncover through the images shown and through the experiences of our protagonist. It was so rewarding to appreciate the intricacies that Trigger is known for, the tiny details that would ultimately go unnoticed by anyone who isn't keenly paying attention for them.  The utterly amazing character designs which I praised endlessly in my ""Enchanted Parade"" review. The wonderful, lively, eccentric character animation that fully breathed life into every soul that enters Luna Nova. So much so that recurring tertiary characters were often more memorable than the majority of secondary characters in other shows. While the series didn't have the kind of consistent animation of the OVA's, what I really enjoyed were the few episodes that clearly had the most visual effort put into them.  The first half was pure joy. However, what detracts from the show was a second half that really struggled in creating an actual narrative to follow. The narrative it did create was at best, serviceable, at worst, everything I don't like about action anime. From an absurd, over-the-top, nonsensical climax that is rife with plot-holes and contrivance, to a lack of secondary characters and actual, emotional connections. The second half wasn't bad, per say, it was just such a drastic turn from the wonderful and endlessly love-able first half. Little Witch Academia is a family show with exceptional characters, and I felt like it's attempt at a more focused narrative didn't deliver as much as I would have wanted.  Little Witch Academia, towards its final stretch, buckles under the weight of expectation. When creating an anime you are expected to have these bombastic resolutions, where the soundtrack flairs and the characters yell loudly and tears are shed and while I do, honestly, adore these characters and felt completely empathetic towards them, all of these potential emotions were drained out by how grandiose and absurd the finale ended up being. From happy slice of life to world-ending threat in the span of a few episodes.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Character and Narrative]  Similar to my thoughts on The Enchanted Parade and the first OVA, the characters in Little Witch Academia carry this show. But that's exactly what characters do. A great story doesn't make good characters, good characters make a great story. In fact, characters are perhaps the single most important element of a film or series. Without them, even the most captivating world would be dry and witless. What carried me through this series' less interesting moments was always just how attached I was to the characters.  Specifically Akko, who at first reminded me of Yuuko from Nichijou, with her blind, ditsy optimism and relentless energy. I loved her arc, hell, I loved her. She's the best. I eagerly followed some of the forums from episode to episode as I watched this series, trying to see what people were saying as it aired, and to my surprise I saw such a negative outlook on Akko and her entire arc as a character.  From what I saw, people not only expected, but wanted a character that was more overpowered, more capable, smarter, and all these elements that define the majority of anime protagonists. From what I saw, for some crazy reason, people were criticizing Akko for actually have admitted flaws. I think once I saw that, I quickly understood just how different my opinions and expectations for the television I watch are, especially when compared to the more broad anime audience. I was baffled by just how many people didn't even bother to appreciate what Trigger was going with her with character. Which honestly made me realize exactly why the second half, which I didn't like remotely as much as the first, was better received by that audience. They wanted the loud, abrasive, bombastic action where the protagonist pulls out massive, overpowered moves that solve world-ending conflicts. Meanwhile, I just want a cute, wholesome series about friends overcoming conflict that feels grounded in a charming, magical world. Because that's what this series was!  To continue to address Akko's characterization, this young Japanese girl, who has absolutely no history of magic in any of her family, is the first student in Luna Nova without said magical background. Luna Nova being the Hogwarts of this universe. Unlike a character like Harry Potter, who was always destined for greatness and came with powerful talents, Akko was relatively hopeless, even after she found Shiny Rod, a celestial staff that was once wielded by her hero, the entertainer, Shiny Chariot. Even with this potentially powerful weapon, she still endlessly struggled through her schoolwork, and that was the prominent focus of the first half of this series.  While the initial episodes were episodic in that they contained a narrative that was resolved within that episode, the over-arching story was about school and learning. Which I think the majority of people can relate to. Akko entered this school trying to be like her hero, however, she didn't posses any of the knowledge to actually succeed. In fact, she was abrasive and downright stupid in a lot of her beliefs. Akko thought that she could succeed simply through believing, and that made her almost drop out. This arc, following her rude awakening and the ultimate catharsis felt when she finally put wand-to-magic and began to truly work hard was infinitely more appealing than any other story-focused element delivered in this series. Not only because it was a story that felt grounded, yet delightful because of the world it is set in. But because, through this episodic half, we got an insight into Akko's attitudes and the obvious flaws within them.  Like it or not, this is neat characterization. You can't succeed through just believing. You have to work hard. When Akko ultimately does, we, as viewers, finally get to see her using the magic she learns to succeed in more difficult tasks and we grow with her. This connection that was formed between viewer (me) and the protagonist was wondrous because of this. This is without even mentioning just how great some of these side-stories are, especially since a lot of them focused on the wonderful secondaries. The surreal Sucy-episode, where we got to see the inner-mechanisms of the most mysterious student's mind, all storyboarded by the venerable Hiroyuki Imaishi from Gurrenn Lagann and Kill la Kill fame. Other stories include some fun cartoon tropes, such as the love potion, and others are simply there due to the world created, such as broom-races, which end up being some of my favorite outings of the series. Not only because it clear just how much effort was put into animating these episodes, but because they all exuded so much character and fun, providing that nostalgic feeling I talked about.  A lot of Little Witch Academia's plot elements are hinted at through background details and surprisingly subtle character moments. Which is great. I think these moments work so well because of how invested we are in these characters.  There is a lot of subtext and meta-commentary in this series too. The more obvious ones being gags in reference to other Trigger shows, like one episode paying total homage to Gurrenn Lagann, to other moments referencing various western cartoons, which is natural since Trigger seems to have an infatuation with them. There is meta-commentary on the state of critics and reception and negativity within the entertainment industry, too, which wasn't too subtle, but was fun to have none-the-less. A permeating theme of characters, which were entertainers, being driven to brash decisions based on the reception of their audience. The parallel here being to the entertainment industry within the real world. This felt so preposterously ironic because It felt as though this series was victim to that too. I felt much more passion in these more episodic stories that built towards the end-goal in the first half, and the few we had in the second half, than just about anything within the main narrative of the series.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Visuals and Sound]  Similar to most Trigger shows, the character design here is amazing. I won't go on about this, since I'm pretty sure I wrote a whole thesis on it in my Enchanted Parade review. The design is, ultimately, perfect. The way each character is characterized through distinct eyes is wonderful. The lines are pretty thin and the designs are simplistic in the sense that the characters themselves don't harbor an immense amount of detail, which makes character animation easier and it actually breathes more life into these characters. Giving them all unique attributes through animation.  The animation, while not remotely as impressive and consistent as the OVAs, was pretty good overall. Certain episodes looked utterly breathtaking, such as the the Sucy episode that I'm sure is a fan favorite of many, the broom-race episode, and even the Wild Hunt one. As I already said, these more episodic moments were filled with passion for the product, and it left me feeling as though this was what the creator wanted to do the most. Which I wish he had, and didn't pander to the fans that needed some kind of silly, shoehorned narrative to strangle this series towards its conclusion.  The sound was solid as well. There were certain stings that were more memorable than others. The first OP and second ED were solid as well. The more classical swells in the emotional scenes were surprisingly poignant, though, although I think the reason a lot of the emotional scenes were so affecting was due to the characters and not the music.  What I do want to point out is that the voice acting here is generally pretty top-notch. I'm not one to constantly notice Japanese voice acting as easily as I can notice exceptional performance in English television and film, however, here it is very clear. Especially Akko's voice actress, Megumi Han, is spectacular in her role and provides so many amazing inflections and cadences. She's a true standout.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  [Conclusion]   The first half to Little Witch Academia is unrestrained near-perfection. It was a testament to the wonders that an episodic show can do. Just because something is episodic, narratively, doesn't mean it can't have character growth, and seeing Akko go from optimistic believer to optimistic doer may have been the single most inspiring thing I've seen on television in years. I was genuinely inspired by this this ditsy girl, and I think that alone warrants huge praise, since my hard, cold exterior is hard to break through.  The second half wasn't without merit, as some of the episodic stories were great there, and even some of the more cliche story beats within the main narrative were emotionally powerful simply due to the connection already established with our protagonist and her professor, Ursula. I think their bond, as well as Diana's arc, carried a lot of this series' weaker elements. Speaking on those, the finale was too over-the-top for me. I think it wasn't properly built up and the entire thing felt much too stupid. A bombastic, trigger-esq finale for a series like Kill la Kill was natural since the series was absurd and over-the-top from the get-go, but here it just felt shoehorned. The final scene in the finale was great, but that's because it was restrained and pulled back to the character beats we fell in love with at the start of the series, pulling Akko's wonderful arc closed in a somewhat messy, yet cathartic way.  I hardly even had to touch on my other negative of this series, the romance elements, but this problem, while semi-persistent, was never too distracting. I honestly feel like romance didn't belong in this series. While thankfully it wasn't as distracting as a lot of anime is, with endless, exploitative lesbian-bait and senseless fanservice, which this show thankfully had none of, the tame romance was unnecessary as well. Although I think my view on this is slightly skewed because of how obsessed with romance the fans are, from ""shipping"" characters to constantly reading into every scene as if it has something to do with the creators trying to hint at these characters falling in love. It was just needless. That being said, it didn't actually play a huge role and I never felt as though it fully ruined anything for me.  Little Witch Academia was an excessively fun experience. While the second half dips in quality due to the series losing sight of what made me love it so much in the first place, the episodic first half built such a strong connection to the characters that I was still wholly invested in the majority of this show's cliched story. It wasn't as good as The Enchanted Parade OVA, which promptly blew me away, but it had it's own positives as well. More characterization of the side characters, specifically Diana who was more of a main character by the end, and a deeper look at what makes this intriguing world tick. I loved that. Trigger's focus on minutia shows, and the elements that were left subtle were incredibly rewarding to notice.  The entire series was reliant on its characters though. I'll repeat once more, every character in this show is great. Even the love interest, Andrew, has his own set of interesting character-related emotional battles to fight that I actually felt connected to. Each character, or, in this case, person, brings something unique and interesting to the table. While the climax left me a little high and dry, the conclusion to these character arcs still left me feeling warm inside. Watch this series, not for the world, not for the animation, and definitely not for the story. Watch for the characters. They will live in your mind forever, and you wouldn't want it any other way.";Recommended
13;Little Witch Academia (TV);Jhale;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jhale;10;Little Witch Academia is easily the best anime I have seen and I have seen a lot. Some of the reasons are quite subtle and people might not see the charm.  In my opinion, Little Witch Academia is a magical girl show without any disappointments. Even the smallest of scenes avoid falling into disappointing cliche results. They made this entire show optimistic and positive and I think it is really powerful with the lessons they deliver.  During pretty much every episode, I felt like crying near the end. Everything really comes together in each episode and what seems like it would be a bad episode ends up being something special that imparts a lesson on the viewer. Even the main character and her development of her power deliberately teaches the viewer through the lessons/magic words that she learns.  I would say that not one of the episodes would count as filler, but that isn't too surprising considering this was a show made without source material besides the movies. Each of the people Akko meets is charming and refreshing in their own way. Every character that Akko grows to care about is impressive and important in Akko's adventure. Even the character who didn't get enough to do (and the creator themselves said they wish more had been done with her) Jasminka, left a strong impression on me as she seemed capable in just about every situation she found herself in despite looking like someone who isn't paying much attention to anything.  For the mood of the show, much of the opening and ending themes are perfect. The first opening felt really cheesy at first, but it ended up being something that opened my heart to the show's pure optimism. The first ending is one of my favorites in anime... The second opening is really cliche in animations, but it is still such a good song and it really was important in marking the tone shift that happened.  Speaking of the second part of the show, I think that they came up with the best possible plot twists and directions for things to go. I had no suspicion that the situation would be the way that it was, but it also fleshed out the characters and plot progression very well and made the show feel undeniably perfect.  It is amazing that this show also manages to feel relevant politically, even showing us a powerful solution to problems like fascism.  And the characters who were the most powerful (Diana and Andrew) were depicted in a realistic way that I was very happy about. In fact, all of the characters in Little Witch Academia felt very real to me, which is part of why every episode makes me cry a bit and why Akko's small successes are so rewarding.  Overall, this is a definite 10/10, maybe even 11/10!  Watch this show if you want an anime that is meaningful and educational and helps you mature.;Recommended
14;Little Witch Academia (TV);yukinoneno;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yukinoneno;9;The most slept on anime of all time. I seriously cannot understand hard pressed people about this series. Yes it may lack I'm strength in it's plot yes it may be predictable but have you ever had so much fun and sparkle in your eye just as if you were a child again watching an anime? It is an incredibly fun anime to watch without thinking too much, the animation is (as always) absolutely amazing. Maybe if all you watch is seinen or all you care about is how full life is, you won't find this to be your favorite. Absolutely appalling that this is even below 8. I will defend this series ever since the movies.;Recommended
15;Little Witch Academia (TV);SovietWeeb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SovietWeeb;10;This is a show i will not be forgetting anytime soon i can tell you that for sure.  ~~Spoilers~~  Characters: Akko: Tends to get way too nosy about other peoples business. She has the mentality that if she doesn't think this is what people actually want than she will go and do what she thinks is best for them ( You know, A very annoying character trait) When i compare her to other characters in the show. I just can't really get behind her as the one who is actually deserving of all this attention she gets. We have two other characters in the show (Diana) (Chariot) These two are more deserving of these powers cause they actually seem like they have worked for it.  Diana: At first i thought she was gonna be the typical know it all girl that's also stuck up. But she is my second favorite character in the show actually. She is caring and isn't rude to others. She can be blunt though. But she has spent her entire life working on magic and has put a ton of effort into magic stuff. She even had to go and learn how to do magic all over again. I personally feel that she is a character who is more deserving of the special magic Akko got.  Chariot: Is by far my favorite character. I really wish she was the focus of the show and not Akko. By far one of the most interesting stories. Imo more likable than any other character. She also has over of my favorite character designs i'v seen. I also feel that she should have been the one to use the special magical powers and not Akko. She was the original owner of the magical rod. I also feel that the story should have ended on her being the last to use the power .  Art: I love this art style. I feel if it wasn't for the art style i don't think this would have grabbed my attention the first episode.  ~~ Spoilers Over~~  I really loved this show. Even if i do get annoyed at times with the MC. This is defiantly gonna be something i remember for awhile .;Recommended
16;Little Witch Academia (TV);ABPAEAE;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ABPAEAE;10;"To merely call Little Witch Academia a ""Japanese Harry Potter"", I believe, is a great disservice. While true, the settings are similar; a school teaching magic arts - that is where the similarities end. The Little Witch Academia TV series is a result of incredible dedication and talent from everyone involved. I love everything about the short film, movie, and series all together, but for this review, I must retain it only to the TV series.  Little Witch Academia (now on referred as LWA) has the charms of an absolutely banger original story, despite anything the creators may or may not have taken inspiration from, purposefully or otherwise. From the beginning of the first episode, I was entranced by a wondrous fantastical world, brimming with lore and everything beyond imagination. Every episode feels like its own unique chapter in a greater overall story, and they absolutely are. Now, granted, I've came across a patch of free time to allow me to do this, but LWA is the only anime I've felt compelled to binge-watch over the course of two days, despite me knowing it'd be much better to separate my watching into more sessions. The story and the characters were all just too gripping.  Artistically, the LWA TV series is above par, but for understandable budget and time restraints, the original LWA short film is still far superior. But this really isn't to trash the TV series' art. From the unique design of every individual character, to the very talented animation of complex scenery (not to forget all things silly as well), the LWA TV series is a modern, moving Mona Lisa.  The music should almost be included in the art category because of its quality. I believe in anime, quality of music cannot always be judged by the raw, upfront quality of the music, but also by how well it suits any given scene, and how often that music is recycled. LWA's music feels like a suit custom-made by some fancy yuppie tailor in 1980 Paris who charges more than you make in a year for one suit. There are some cases of recycled tracks, but not nearly as many as most anime, and it's only briefly used, so the overall charm of the music is never lost.  On the category of characters; this is a tricky one. The topic of character writing in regards to LWA is something I feel is deserving of an in-depth analysis many pages long written by someone far more talented than I. Though I'll try to put my emotion and beliefs into words the best I can here. Overall, I must say, the character writing is LWA's strongest feature. As mentioned previously, every character feels unique in their own ways, from their appearance, down to their emotions, actions, and motivations. Kagari Atsuko, the main character, is written in such a way to be relatable to many viewers, specifically younger adults and teenagers who might find themselves lost in the modern society that constantly tells them what to do, resulting in an individual unable to pursue their true passion for a fear of failure or embarrassment. The role of Atsuko is to assure those viewers that anything they desire is possible as long as you truly want something. Sometimes you fall down, sometimes you fall down a hundred times, perhaps you even feel like you ONLY fall down, but as long as you keep picking yourself up, you still have a chance to make your dreams a reality. With the gushy gushy aside, the character writing in LWA does have its downfalls (mostly due to time/budget restraints, which are understandable for such an expansive story, even a well-funded one). Particularly with introduced characters who don't get much of a spotlight, even though they clearly had effort into their development at one point. Specifically with Frank and Jasminka. I do not wish to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't watched the show yet, but for those who have, I urge you to consider how much screentime they got and what that screentime was for.  Overall, Little Witch Academia was an emotional roller coaster that never slowed down at any one point, and genuinely touched me passionately. From the lessons we can learn from some of the characters, to the immense amount of dedication put behind the creation of this story - short film, movie, and all - there are a lot of good lessons even older adults can still learn from Little Witch Academia. I give a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to the inception of such a gem.  Remember, a believing heart is magic :)";Recommended
17;Little Witch Academia (TV);Jackospider;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jackospider;10;"Story 9/10  The premise of the entire series follows Akko, our beloved Disney-like protagonist. Her goal of becoming a top notch witch is a simple one, but open enough to allow room for silly sub-plots. Overall, by the end it was a plot you might've foreseen, but one of the most fun rides I have had watching anime.  Art 10/10  Purely subjective, but once again ""Disney-like"" is the best way I can label everything in this anime. The vivid display of colors, all the way down to the goofy expressions, pump nothing but life into this anime world.  Sound 9/10  What good is a beautiful world, if not for the music to back it? As you would expect from looking at the art, the music gives a very jolly tone. At certain points in the show I found the music was actually making me feel intense emotions.  Character 10/10  if you don't love the bubbly, not-so bright main character Akko...Then there is such a vast array of cast that honestly, its hard not to find one to love. Just to name off a few, the bookworm, the chill gothic, the mechanic, the hard on the outside but sweet on the inside rich girl. Thats only a hint of the amazing cast you have to explore!  Enjoyment 10/10  I can watch the series over and over again. It never stops being what it sets out to be, magical.  Overall 10/10  If it wasn't for any one of these pieces working as well as they did, I may not have rated it so high. However, not a single aspect of this anime was looked over. There is no troupes or over bearing cliches, just a beautiful, magical anime that can cheer up any mood.";Recommended
18;Little Witch Academia (TV);SanaeK10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SanaeK10;8;"A DOKI DOKI NO WAKU WAKU review. (Minor spoilers follow)  Studio Trigger is like Akko Kagari in a way. They ain't the best but damn if they didn't try their best in doing what they love. And seeing their hard work always brings a smile to your face, even if their work isn't the greatest ever.  Little Witch Academia 2017 stars Akko and her friends, Lotte and Suc- wait scratch that, Lotte and Sucy hardly appear in any meaningful capacity. Let's try that again.  Little Witch Akko stars the titular Akko and Diana having adventures together on their journey to save magic. Along the way, Akko meets a cast of colorful characters who are immediately forgotten after a few episodes with the exception of Chariot and Croix.  Before continuing, I would like to utilize the ""Triangle of Truth"" concept which classifies films on a triangle diagram with 3 attributes: Story, Characters and Emotion, used initially by RedLetterMedia to describe Rogue One in their Rogue One review. A film typically can only have, at max, 2 of the attributes. In our case study, we can conclude Little Witch Academia 2017 excels in Characters and Emotion, but suffers greatly from a bad plot.  Let's start with Characters and Emotion. LWA's biggest strength is in getting the audience to truly enjoy the characters and their personalities. Every character, even throwaway ones like Annabel or Lotte, are immensely enjoyable onscreen. Akko's character is good enough to standout on her own, it's charming to see her struggle against impossible odds and her optimistic demeanor on life is refreshing and invokes an emotional connection with the viewer, making her very relatable and likable. Seeing Akko smile and go ""Doki Doki no Waku Waku"" is enough to bring a smile to even the most cynical viewer. Chariot and Croix's characters and their relationship with each other is also worth mentioning. Their friendship/romance is cute to see unfold and painful to see fall apart. The drama surrounding them is very much human and down-to-earth, and even the villainous Croix has very human traits that redeems her character and make her seem all the more tragic and sympathetic. In addition to that, the animations portraying them are so vividly crafted that you can tell from a glance how the characters. And thanks to lovable characters, whenever they're in a predicament, we suffer along with them; whenever they're joyful, we celebrate alongside them. We grew along Akko across this 25 episode journey. And therein lies the emotional resonance within the viewer. In the final episode, when Akko went ""Doki Doki no Waku Waku"" in the preview video as she always does in most of the preview videos, I had goosebumps all over. A testament to how lovable the characters in the series are.  Which is to say that it's a grand disappointment and a damned shame that the plot of LWA is weak as hell. Even with strong characters, the plot is barebones and unfocused. Now a simple plot isn't bad, even great films like Star Wars (1977) have simple plots, where the plot is just a loose framework to depict a grand adventure in space. However, in the case of Little Witch Academia, the framework in which the plot provides is insufficient and poorly utilized, resulting in a lot of wasted potential. The unfocused element comes in as the show itself doesn't know what kind of anime it wants to be, a slice of life with an overarching storyline, or a plot-focused story where each episode advances the plot to its goal. Little Witch Academia at its very core is a Hero's Journey type story, with Akko receiving the call to adventure, undergoing several conflicts (of which include refusal of the call) and finally triumphing against the odds and returning home a hero. That's all well and good, but the ultimate goal and the antagonist isn't established until halfway through the series. The first half of the series is a very slow Slice of Life type tale with a hardly anything tying the episodes together until the overarching plot is finally established midway through the series.This essentially leads to very erratic pacing issues in the overall narrative. Hell, the standard ""Hero conflict moment"" only happens near the very end of the series, making Akko's recovery breeze by very quickly and providing very little buildup for the final climax.  The flashback scenes with Chariot and Croix are very enjoyable but they break the pacing very badly by inserting them into random episodes. It could have been easily fixed by giving the duo one or two dedicated episodes to flesh out the characters and their history with each other. The flashbacks don't even occur naturally within the context of the anime, which makes them very jarring when they appear. And as I mentioned earlier, Akko's roommates are given very little attention despite their importance in the original OVA series. Diana's conflict where she's saved by Akko is bookended with Akko being saved by Diana a few episodes later happened in such a short interval that the bookend effect doesn't provide much of a response from the viewer. Which is a shame, Trigger has plenty of good tools to make a great plot but they just don't know how to utilize them properly. In the end, even with 25 episodes, not much happened plotwise and I could summarize the whole plot in 3 short sentences. Even if they had more episodes to work with, I'm doubtful they could add much to the series without breaking the pacing even further. It's a cardinal sin most of the characters and world building go underutilized. For instance, Lotte's ability to talk to fairies is only briefly alluded to in the series despite it being a massive plot point in OVA2 and an awesome climatic moment in the Terio manga.  The series also has a big problem with exposition and character dialogue. Exposition is done very unnaturally and at times, it feels as if the characters are directly telling the audience what is happening. I had hoped that the overreliance on exposition in the first episode was just there to guide new audiences into the world of LWA, but almost every episode features this, even for scenes where it's clearly shown what is happening or for events that can be inferred naturally from the context where it takes place. For instance, there's a scene in episode 1 where a monstrous chicken is shown to have petrification abilities as it turns parts of a forest into stone. Even the most passive viewer would know by then the monster chicken can petrify objects, but Sucy butts in and essentially tells the audience that the chicken can petrify objects after the scene occurs. It's unnecessary and a waste of time for Sucy to explain this. In addtion, character motivations are always spelled out for the viewer and the viewer feels like they are very passively being spoonfed information they already know. This eats up time which ought to be better spent on more scenes establishing or expanding the overall plot.  The series conclusion is masterfully done. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel anything as it happened. It more than makes up the lackluster ending of Kill la Kill. While not quite TTGL levels, LWA's ending is so well done you will end up staring at the screen as I did and reminiscing of all the fun times and adventures you had with the show, wishing there was just one more episode to go.  Still, in spite of all its flaws, I can't in any good faith rate this lower than an 8. The passion Trigger showcased is endearing and more than makes up for it. The love for their project makes you root for them every single step of the way. Which is why I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to everyone. In the end, it's the journey that counts, and what a damned great journey it was, being hyped for every single episode and having fun all the way though. The series is , as Akko would say , a Doki Doki no Waku Waku adventure.";Recommended
19;Little Witch Academia (TV);NexusThread;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NexusThread;10;Little Witch Academia TV is another instance where Studio Trigger has completely stolen my heart, and whisked me away into a beautiful adventure to see some of the most amazing moments in entertainment media as a whole, and Trigger carries it without breaking a sweat with their smooth, breathtaking animation. The art style, even though the shading has taken a downgrade from the movie and short to compensate time for the rush of making a TV anime, is still just as breathtaking, and some shots for me outdo the movie and short in its entirety. The story is heartwarming. I cried from the happy feeling I felt in some episodes... And from the sad in others. As most Trigger anime do, it made me quite emotional with it's impactful moments. The sound design continued to stun me. During fights I could hear the quality of the sounds they had in full force... I'll save the details for your watch. Each character managed to make me smile at least once. I find them all interesting in their own way, and love them all equally and I hope they all have safe and loving lives ahead of them. I enjoyed this anime very much, and its a breath of fresh air compared to the fanservice, or cliches the rest of the industry is offering right now. The messages the anime gave me with each episode was beautiful and it filled me with joy to see Yoh's talent as a director and writer... With all that said... I think Yoh did a flawless job. 10/10. Please, if you have Netflix... Watch it there. Trigger needs as much support as it can get. If you can then buy the blurays even. Thank you for reading and enjoy the show. Its showtime.;Recommended
0;Little Witch Academia (TV);NSpectre7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NSpectre7;5;Hey folks, this will be a review for Little Witch Academia. This show is not to my taste, or more specifically what it turned into wasn't. This show has some fandom behind it and I'm not a part of it, I haven't read the manga, or even watched the other movies. Everything I'm writing here will cover just this show.  The show for the first five or so episodes has a slice of life type of story. A normal person joins a prestigious school of witchcraft, and she is unable to do magic herself. Her idol is a woman named Shiny Chariot who is an unpopular witch in the magical world who suddenly disappeared. Her goal is to meet and be like Shiny Chariot. This of course is hard because of many things, but namely she cant do magic.  After these initial episodes however the story becomes very similar to Harry Potter with a few tweaks, but I wont go more into this. This part of the story revolves around our incompetent main character while she discovers ancient words, fights against a villain, learns about herself and the one she idolizes, and learns about love, friendship...and all the other typical tropes of a shounen show.  This part of the story imo is fairly bad. There are large and gaping plot holes. Most of the early story plot has no buildup time either. It just poofs into existence and finishes equally as quick. It's like they were in a rush to push the story forward but I cant really understand why. The plot twist towards the end was indeed unexpected but it just gets brushed aside. It felt like most of the writing energy went into the characters and the story was rushed and patched into the show as a whole.  The art and sound were both great. The art was frankly beautiful, and fits a setting of magic and fantasy well.  The characters were great. The general cast is fun and magical. From the word go each character is given a personality that is vibrant and fun. Each character is given a decent amount of time. However this all seems to become pointless as the show continues. Akko(Atsuko Kagari) becomes pretty much the sole focus of the show and the other characters are just background noise.  Akko is not a character type I enjoy. She is overly cheerful and stubborn, yet she has almost no ability and is constantly dragging her friends into her messes. At first her character is cute because she has drive and though she doesn't wield magic like the other girls she doesn't give up. She finds interesting ways around things, she relies on her friends who are good witches, and she grows and tries to better herself. This however stops and she just becomes an interfering character that should be nothing more than a side character or comic relief. Watching Akko work herself into her stubborn phases was incredibly annoying and the furthest thing from an endearing character.  When I started this show I entered with no preconceptions and was really pleasantly surprised by what I found. The show was adorable, it had life lessons that were not shoved down your throat, the story was basic and broad. I was prepared to give it glowing reviews and high praise but then the fire nation attacked. After the first few episodes the show changes, the characters become backdrops for this new and gloriously poor story. Akko being central the story is given too much time and becomes a chore. The show seems self aware and has good moments which are killed off to keep this overarching happiness and friendship theme.  I tried to keep this condensed and without spoilers but seriously I could rant on about how Akko is poor excuse for a main character, and how the story doesn't really work, and how the pacing felt both rushed and dragging. I wouldn't really recommend this show, but I hate that I have to say this. The first few episodes were like delicious candy that didn't rot your teeth and made you skinny. Then it becomes garbage.  TLDR: Don't be fooled by first few episodes. Really a poorly written story, decent characters become backdrops, and strange pacing issues. Art is great but not worth the price of admission.;Mixed Feelings
1;Little Witch Academia (TV);ThorNN-heim7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThorNN-heim7;5;"By the time I am writing this review I have seen everything that has to do with Litlle Witch Academia. Little witch Academia is an anime about witches and the power of belief. Story: The story in this anime is simple and easy to understand (Akko wants to be a witch that inspires awe and dreams) and that is all fine and good. I can however not say I was impressed by it, as nothing really evolved. Sure, there were some fighting against ""magical beasts"", but there never was any real tension or purpose in it all, as everything would always be resolved in a so thorough and easy way that it reminded me of these kid shows tailored for 2 year old children. In the end the story made no sense and was quite pointless. Art & Sound: The art was a bit messy, but fit the show, as it was supposed to be a bit wild and simplistic, but easy on the eyes for younger audiences. The sound was ok, but there was nothing that impressed me in any way, with the exception of how stupid and childish all the spells and their pronunciation sounded. Characters: The characters mostly all had very simple characteristics and backgrounds that, except for Diana's story, and ever so slightly Akko's. There really was basically no character development during the anime or any of the movies except for Diana becoming more open and admitting herself to be a fan of Shiny Chariot. Overall: This anime had it's ups and downs. Sometimes I kinda liked it, but for most part it was somewhat disappointing. As the story is one of the most important things to me in, basically, anything, I couldn't really enjoy this show to much, and I don't really see why it's so popular. If I had to recommend it to someone it would as some thing when you're really bored and need something flashy, but that don't require any brain power to watch.";Mixed Feelings
2;Little Witch Academia (TV);BlackCicero;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlackCicero;6;Summarizing my thoughts on Little Witch Academia, I was interested in the premise of the show since I have enjoyed stories that involved witches and wizards in the past. However in the end, I was left feeling that the anime was just ok. The story, while not bad, did not do much in drawing me in. There wasn't much story progression until the second half of the anime with the first half mainly consisting of slice of life moments centered around the lives of the young witches at the academy as they learned the Ins and Outs of magic. The art and animation is instantly recognizable as that of Studio Trigger and in this regard I felt like it was both beautiful and unique. There were good characters in Little Witch Academia although they were a little bit cliche in the way they were portrayed and in how they interacted with each other. Even though this anime has a lot of good points to it, I simply wasn't able to enjoy the show overall. So in closing I can recommend that Little Witch Academia is at least worth giving the first couple episodes a try to see whether it would be one for you or not.;Mixed Feelings

Art 8/10 A bit poor the first few episodes, but the simplistic style grows on you.  Sound 8/10 Solid voice acting and sound track, but it was missing that bit of extra oomph.  Character 7/10 There where some perky people but one aspect of just about every character really bugged me, though it could arguably be considered a spoiler so I'll refrain from stating it.  Enjoyment 5/10 To put it simply, in a way that everyone will understand: meh.;Mixed Feelings
4;Little Witch Academia (TV);Hyouron;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hyouron;5;Little Witch Academia is a very simple anime. After watching a enchanting show by Shiny Chariot, Akko is dazzled by the display and taken by the performer’s words, “A believing heart is your magic.” Inspired, the child declares that her dream is to become like the magician on stage, and decides to go to the same school as her proclaimed idol. The aspiring sorceress is straightforward, stubborn, and never gives up on her dream. At a time when magic about to lose its relevance in the world and Akko herself is not magically inclined, she is determined to continue to become a wonderful witch that makes people smile. She does whatever it takes and makes things work out somehow.  It’s the basic shonen formula on moe moe cutesy girl estrogen pills. Admittedly, it wasn’t bad per se. There were times when it seemed to drive some significant plot points - realities of labor, upholding traditions vs. modernizing, how those with knowledge power take advantage of those who need help or don’t know any better. It’s also nice how the main character pushes herself and others to not succumb to so-called destiny, because one’s fate should be something chosen by the self. However, despite it having these potential pluses, the series did not process the issues properly and nor were they actually resolved. Countless plot holes, conveniences, and characters that lack logical progression or genuine development contribute to it being lackluster. Perhaps more fleshing out of the story and explanations through the dialogue could have helped. Upon investigating why it was rated so high, many reviewers stated that the show brought feelings of nostalgia or something about the OVA. Given how simplistic the narrative and characters were, it could be called an entertaining child’s show.;Mixed Feelings
5;Little Witch Academia (TV);Azukus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Azukus;6;I'll keep this short.  For those interesting in watching, I'd recommend it. It has a nostalgic feel and a cliche main character. If you've seen Black Clover, the main character is just like that. Very similar to a typical shonen.  I'll say that the idea of the story is great, but the execution seemed flawed. That's probably because the episodes were limited. A majority of the episodes feel like filler, but that is because there is no true objective at least until we are near the end. But, even then, the main antagonist does not really seem like one either.  One thing that makes the main character both unique and annoying is how she gains new powers. To avoid spoiling, I'll just say that she can become stronger by doing every day tasks and getting lucky. Most of her big power ups happen in what feels like filler episodes. Nearly every single important moment feels out of place for me.  Despite some all of these flaws, I couldn't help but smile at the main character's attitude. It felt genuine, which is something most cannot pull off. I would still recommend watching this to anyone, but I would highly recommend it to a younger audience.;Mixed Feelings

Nothing like…that hasn’t been done before that blew my mind but a very pretty show!  SOUND: 7/10 The openings and ending were good, I wasn’t a huge fan of it/paid a lot of attention to it, I liked the visuals of them more then the actual sounds LOL  CHARACTER: 3/10 Gimmicks. SO MANY GIMMICK CHARACTERS. There were a few with potential that I expected to learn more about like, say, Suizie and Dottie who we meet in the first episode. We get a couple episodes with them mostly featured but then that’s pretty well it…like I think there’s just a huge portion of the show where they literally just get…forgotten about LOL. I like Diana and what we got to see and learn about her, she was probably one of (if not the?) best developed character, I remember the most about her. Akko is a screaming girl with a dream to be the best witch and gets through life with sheer volume and plot devices, she’s a fine typical MC and at least she wasn’t OP like plenty of boring main characters but her trait of being “really bad at magic” was pretty grating at times. Also she literally worships Chariot, whatever floats your witchy boat I guess.  And Chariot herself. She seemed pretty cool at first but as we learn more it seems her personality(if she had one) got extremely watered down and just…dull. Like I get it, she’s not a ‘hero’ or ‘famous’ anymore but to literally get rid of your personality and not really with any good reason other then “I realized what I did was hOrRiBle AnD I cAn’T fOrGiVe MySeLf so I became boring”. Cool cool. Pretty boring resolution for her “arc”.  There were more characters but I don’t feel like talking about them or remember much abut them LOL…the one science/modern witch lady…Croix I believe? She was so gimmicky it made me laugh. What a lady.  Overall, they were all pretty flat and boring once more and more episodes showed the m=not much was going to change, maybe the manga had better development?  ENJOYMENT: 6/10  It was just fine…fun to turn my brain off a little and watch cute girls try magic with teen drama and lots of yelling with nice animation. Wouldn’t watch again, if I did I would most likely just watch the first and last episodes and just skip like the whole middle LOL  OVERALL: 5/10 To quote my mom: “That Akko girl sure does yell a lot of her lines”  She was and is very right about that.;Mixed Feelings

8;Little Witch Academia (TV);sopw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sopw;5;This will be a relatively short review, for you to see whether or not you would like it.  My overall opinion and impression of this anime are honestly pretty poor. It has some strong points, but in terms of plot, characters, and enjoyment, I think there was a lot to improve on.  I think the animation was stunning and the soundtrack fits beautifully. In general, the world of LWA was fascinating.  The biggest problem for me was the actual story. The first 20 episodes contain almost no plot in them, only dropping random information about characters or the world. Now in some cases, this can work out very nicely, but not in this one. For me, the episodes were dreadfully boring, and I got very little enjoyment out of them. I almost never drop anime, but after 20 episodes I couldn't will myself to continue. Of course, a few months later I decided that I might as well finish, and I don't regret that I did. The last episodes were more interesting and there was a satisfying ending to the series, but even though I enjoyed the ending, the process to get there was almost painful. I had several friends watch LWA as well, and they all dropped it after 3-10 episodes, saying that they thought continuing was pointless and boring.  I also started out hating the main protagonist. She often acted in ways that I found were extremely dumb, naive, immature, and annoying. Her strong belief eventually became her strong suit, but in the beginning, it was simply annoying. While some of the other characters were unique and interesting, many had flat, 1 sided personalities, and only a few characters saw any development.  I think if you'd like, you should watch a few episodes (maybe 3-5,) if you enjoy it, continue on, but if you don't, stop immediately, because it's not getting any better any time soon.  I hope my review was helpful, have a nice day! :D;Mixed Feelings

Like most media concerning questions of witchcraft, LWA is overtly traditional and revivalist, but at such a late stage of genre-writing that its most interesting themes are dealt with only as framing tropes for what is clearly the true text of the show, the character motions played out in subtle and obvious drama as the story movies forward. At the very least, an interesting door is opened in interpreting the role of media and theatrics in showing the path for the protagonists to unlock this magical tradition, with the revival of the past being done through the benefits of this theatrical figure restoring a sort of poetic magic to life. In doing this, fantasy is coping with its own role in enabling access to mystical encounters, ie, the Lovecraftian ""grimoires"" concocted by varieties of authors inspiring true experienced as they have truth in form, if not content.

0;Little Witch Academia (TV);Omen_7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Omen_7;4;"Disclaimer: the following review/analysis is oriented towards those who finished the series, and as such, there will be spoilers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Little Witch Academia is Yoh Yoshinari's precious child, who is one of the most important and iconic animators this industry has. It's at the same time, a love letter to it, with clear intent, wanting to be a message of hope to everyone looking to be part of it eventually. Unfortunately, he is an animator, not a writer (though he most likely wasn't alone in this), and said intentions are not backed up by the execution of the piece once examined under the cold eye of the monocle-wearing critic who thinks too highly of themself despite of their own contradiction-riddled writing, yet far from a complete dreck. This ""love letter"" has fundamental problems with its setting, plot, pace, characters, and a strangely ambiguous thematic simplicity that I can only attribute to the core idea Yoshinari tried to bring forward getting in the way of the show's story, and that's without touching details like the amounts of redundancy in the dialogue or some poorly paced scenes that end with no momentum. Little Witch Academia is an anime that always finds a way to squander its potential, and I'll proceed to explain myself.  First, lets talk about anime and animators. How is this related to our little witches? The show acts like a metaphor to the journey of the young animator in the industry, an ideal represented by Kagari Atsuko (Akko), where the magic world symbolizes anime and its institutions. Many animators are inspired from a very young age by one piece of animation that resonates with them, which leads them to choose said profession. The world of animation (and anime) is alive as long as there is new people that wants to work in it, and it's also necessary that veterans are able to train them for that.  Besides the obvious Nine Old Men (google it) reference within the show's lore through the Nine Old Witches, there are more nods to this metaphor. The show alludes to3DCG animation with Croix and her technology entering the scene, and the end of the series calls back to the cycle that perpetuates the existance of magic/anime in this world. During the spectacle that the outcome of the final showdown against Croix's mad missile generates, we see people being enchanted again by magic, and then we cut to a close shot of a little girl being amazed by it, symbolizing that Akko has inspired a generation younger than her to pursue the road of magic, same as how Chariot inspired her, in the same way this series and its climatic ending may inspire those who see it. This is why the show is a love letter to anime.  At the same time, Little Witch Academia is without a doubt the most consistently high quality production Trigger has made (Kiznaiver exists, but this is also two cours), with a similar artstyle to western cartoons, mixed with limited animation techniques here and there like heavy use of smearing, and intense focused ""sakuga"" moments that manage to impress on a technical level. All of this coupled with a brilliant OST composed by Michiru Oshima, that adds in a fantastic way to the tone the series has both in its heavier and lighter moments.  Poetic, isn't it? But the praise stops here.  About pacing, Little Witch Academia starts with Akko finding the broken underexplained McGuffin known as Shiny Rod in her road to Luna Nova, which is followed by a series of western inspired episodic adventures of little importance that will either reveal some detail about the world or a quirk about the characters. We don't get exposition regarding the words plot up until episode 11, and the main antagonist is only introduced by episode 14. What follows during the second half is a weird alternance of proper plot related episodes and episodic content similar to most of the show's first half, making for some jarring contrast between episode and episode. Even then, the show finds its focus again around episode 21, and rushes to the conclusion. It's uneven, and tries to tie things up way too fast, with too little to keep itself interesting in the first half, and too much to cram in the end without forcing it.  There is no inherent problem with an episodic structure, many magical girl anime like Princess Tutu, Full Moon wo Sagashite and Shoujo Kakumei Utena got it right. The problem with Little Witch Academia is that most of these episodes are bland, employ cliché plots, are cheap excuses to force screentime for irrelevant characters, and overall give way too little substance (or have little value) besides spectacle, which again wouldn't be a problem if the series wasn't trying to get you invested in anything else than that. At the same time, the series has a strong tendency to forcefully validate Akko's disruptive and intrusive behaviours, usually through the implementation of some plot device that achieves this (often the Rod) and often resolves the conflict. Then, one other time the show rewrote a character from the opposing side to reach a resolution, during Diana's arc, where after showing her aunt as this one dimensional snake lady, it's revealed that she actually cares about the family's legacy, and will try to keep it up while she follows her dream in Luna Nova. This makes the resolutions idealized and convenient. Little times a conflict is solved by the agency of our characters or an instance of personal growth, and while the series often returns to the status quo, these rare ocasions end up being the best episodes because there's real catharsis to be found in them. These exceptions are episodes 11, 13, 14, and from episode 21 onwards where the show focus on what matters, exploring Akko's relationship with Chariot, the past of the latter, and finally resolving who Akko wants to be. Even then, it takes 21 episodes of justifying everything with passion and simple motivations until something more interesting happens with her character. Finally, this ends up making Akko a character favoured by the plot, result given by the rather low stakes situations the show puts her in, which are resolved with no real growth from her part (see the exceptions). The series hides in Akko, whose story is about maturing and personal growth, someone with a Mary Sue treatment. Akko is rewarded for who she is and what she represents, not for the person she grows to be during her journey, in the same fashion as Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds (but Crowds doesn't pretend that there is a journey for Hajime, who is a stand-in for most of her show's ideas).  Other of the problems Little Witch Academia has is its handling of the setting. We see some places and factions, but they are vaguely explored or barely important, like witches from other places who appear on one episode and are never brought back again, meaning that there is little to no expansive worldbuilding outside what's relevant inmediately to the story. We learn that the witches had a 1500+ years old debt with a dragon because no one took responsibility to learn/recover dragon language in order to read or translate the damn contract, but then Diana comes with her teenage wisdom to save the day and put the drake on his place, since she DID study/learn dragon language apparently. The ""adults are useless"" trope is implemented to push this idea of the incomeptence veterans have for training the new generations, drawing a parallel with the anime industry metaphor. In doing so, said execution generates a tonal clash regarding a situation about the world that should be taken more seriously, compared to how the series treats other similar moments, and it's one of the elements that leads the series to validate otherwise questionable developments, for how it makes impossible to take the old witches in charge seriously (and end up being fairly irrelevant to the plot... as expected anime, you can't have people that make sense solving your plots, can you?). For example, there's no ambiguety when Ursula defends Akko from being expelled/suspended from Luna Nova after clearly breaking the rules (Akko avoiding being expelled for Ursula's intervention and instead being suspended would make for a nice moment of self-reflection, that still rewards her efforts in some way, adding complexity to both her character and the outcome of her actions), or that never in the second half the authorities of Luna Nova question or check what Croix is doing in her suspicious omious tower (which is in reality a minor contrivance).  Then there's the faction of british gentlemen, which includes Andrew. It's implied that they finance Croix, but it's never explored why, and out of them ""hating witches"" (which is also not explored) they don't have an interesting dynamic with the world. Andrew himself is sidelined, and his role in the climax is very small (Gentlemen: -Shut down the cameras! Andrew:-No! I believe in these witches! Gentlemen: -Ok.) but he is more important as an ear to Akko, as well as someone who she inspires the capacity of trusting witches, eventually. He also gives Akko the idea of being herself, by herself, rather than by Chariot.  The rest of the side cast (Diana, Chariot, and Croix are mains) have personalities defined by only one trait or superficial quirk. Jasminka eats a lot, Constanze does tech stuff and doesn't talk, Sucy is sadistic and experiments with mushrooms, Lotte is shy, likes Nightfall and has fairy magic, Diana's minions are just that, and Amanda is a tomboy archetype with nothing else. All of these are characters you can define in half a sentence, that exist to represent how Akko through her forceful behaivour managed to have friends who act later as an emotional cushion for her. It's incredibly basic and boring seeing how Akko instead of building most of these relationships through mutual understanding, she's forced into being accepted by external plot elements. The exception to this is her relationship with Diana, which has its problems, but nontheless it has conflicts, a dynamic, and only when Akko helps her to face her family and understand her problems is when they really become friends, and it make sense that it's Diana the one that puts Akko back on her feet in episode 23 after the twist of episode 22. Which leads us to the next point.  The story between Chariot and Croix, once revealed, destroys Akko emotionally, who eventually gets back on her feet once Diana conforts her. The problem is that besides using a lot of contrived friendships as a reinforcement (note also how little Lotte and Sucy appear during the second half of the show), this makes Diana's character being limited as an emotional support to Akko, and the show in its intent to portray its metaphor, ends up giving more value to her passion above Diana's ethic towards hard work, which she upheld all her childhood (or even more important than Akko's own resolve to work hard and not take shortcuts, since it's never brought up in their exchange!). This leaves a mixed message, almost on some wish-fulfilling tone, extremely simplified and idealistic. Luckily the series doesn't intend to depreciate hard work (scenes like Akko meeting Woodward and Diana's arc suggest this), yet ends up doing it because of its execution.  The revelations themselves during episode 22 (extended to 23) give new meaning to the series in many layers, and make it interesting again in a moment where it was feeling empty. Even then, the series limits its potential again by making Chariot ultimately a victim of Croix's deception, which goes back to a simplistic characterization that doesn't innovate nor is particularly interesting, if not for her burden and regret regarding her negligency (and projection of her wishes on Akko) towards her student. Meanwhile, the show makes its best to paint Croix as a mustache twirling villain (who does unquestionably bad things) to redeem her at the last second when everything goes wrong, without implying that her actions in the end have been punished, since she had ""good intentions"". But that's probably sadism on my part. The true villain of the series is Woodward and the garbage tier guidance they offered to the girls (Chariot and Croix) which is never genuinely addressed even if it's where Croix's character and misguided actions come from.  The conflict during the last act is based on the antagonist accentuating negative emotions in the population with a fishy football game acting as a cathalyst, to then gather said emotions as magic energy and destroy the seal of Grand Triskellion. Finally, the climax goes from a final boss battle where she finds out that the power she sought wasn't what she thought it was, to said boss (Croix) losing control of her technology, (in the same way Chariot lost control of her magic collection technique) unintentionally releasing a mass destruction missile built by the uncontrolled rage of the mob. With the conflict now not being focused on Croix, everyone is now a good person, and all that's left is convincing the world that magic is cool, which happens. The thing is that this outcome is forced, since Chariot and Croix are suddenly able to livestream and comment the event from thin air (an event that occurs in the stratosphere(!)) which enables people to see it and do the 180° turn from almost starting a war to cheer and give them energy (don't ask how, Grand Triskellion does the trick) so that Diana and Akko can defeat the missile. This is, again, as it's an habit of the series, idealistic and forced plotting because magic is wonderful. Friendship is magic, and passion is what's most important. The major credit I can give to the finale is that it's extremely climatic, features the best bits of animation in the whole show, it's somewhat possible to just take what it presents at face value for that, and closes the meta-text the series has been building with its analogy regarding the anime industry in a clever, subtle way, even if the communicated message is ambiguous without this interpretation.  In summary, Little Witch Academia had good intentions, but not the chops to carry them forward. In its ambition, it leaves blurry many details of its execution, which falls apart analyzing it bit by bit or as a whole, with an extra of mixed, unclear morals. Its intent enters in conflict with what it did, but it at least looked and sounded good. I begin to wonder if this could've been tighter if it was 13 episodes long.";Not Recommended
1;Little Witch Academia (TV);Fircoal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fircoal;3;Warning: There may be some spoilers here, I tried to clear all of them out of the way so there shouldn't be any. However, I don't know what one would or would not consider as a spoiler in corner cases.  Little Witch Academia is a show that wanted to have its cake and eat it too. It tried to do so much from Western Animation tropes and fluffy episodic episodes to a serious plot with the ramifications of the magic world up in the air. However that attempt to do so much is it's downfall as it ends up failing at each thing it tried. While the art and animation were great as to be expected from Trigger, the actual writing under it was subpar and had a lot of problems. The biggest of which is: What is Little Witch Academia trying to do?  It starts off as an episodic show which very little that carries over from episode to episode. While there are hints of something important in the first episode they are mostly brushed aside to go with these episodic plots. And while one's mileage may vary on that, it leads to the first half of the show having a more Western Animation feel. Not only are there tropes ripped straight out of Western Animation, but the lack of solid progression of the characters and the story points towards this. However, in the middle of this Little Witch Academia brings up numerous subplots, including one big plot to drive the story. None of these are able to make a good impression, and even worse the plots don't fit together at all.  There is a grand words plot, which to me doesn't feel compelling. While I understand the reason for using those words I don't understand how one would be able to find out those words especially with the draconic language being so dead. How would one be able to find out the words? Furthermore is just knowing them enough or does it rely on strength of character? This is where the words plot falls apart for me. If knowing them is enough, it doesn't really matter what the character does and they would be better off just doing research. It makes for a lackluster story and could be done by anyone. That probably isn't the answer but if it is it points to an uncompelling narrative. If it's based on strength of character that means the rod can read that, and if the rod can read that, why does it need the words in the first place? The finding of the words feels useless when ultimately the rod should be able to tell the pure heart of its user.  But that's not the only problem. The other problem is Akko. Akko doesn't grow. At all. They even lampshade this late in the series. And while I like a good lampshade it fails to work when the thing being lampshaded is one of the key aspects of the plot. It's hard to take it seriously when the main character who is fixing everything is just as flat and flawed as she was in Episode 1. If the rod works off of strength of character, then what is it in Akko, a character will little character development, that resonated with the rod? In either case, the word plot doesn't work as a compelling narrative.  Nor does it really add much. While Chariot is one of the most developed characters the plot revolving around her isn't very interesting. Not to mention the plot doesn't do anything special. Despite teasing complex relations it never goes through on that. Whilethere was the chance to make the characters developed and interesting, they ended up falling back into flat cliche characters that fit exactly with what one would expect from their roles.  While they had room to make the plot complex and show many different sides of an issue they elected not to do so. There were opportunities to flesh out Criox's character and give good reasons behind her motivations, and there was time to pay more attention to their dynamic, however rather than do that they made Criox completely and utterly evil. Everything she does is for her own gain, and whenever there is something wrong in the latter half it's always the fault of Criox. No matter what bad things happen in LWA somehow the root of that negative cause will be traced back to Croix. She is a cartoon villain except instead of LWA being a comedy, it's a more serious and magical story. The two don't fit together very well, as it's hard to take such an evil character seriously as a villain.  To make it worse Little Witch Academia can't commit. While the plot wasn't the best idea in the first place, they did have the time to be able to make it strong and shine. However instead of doing that they decided to split it up between all sorts of different subplots and episodic episodes, reducing the time that they had for the plot down to a point where it felt forced in and didn't resonate.  The episodic episodes weren't bad but they did lack a point. They were usually overstuffed with Western animation cliches to the point where there were moments that could have existed without them but instead had them shoved in for no good reason. In one particular episode, the start of it has Akko and friends getting caught doing something bad and as punishment, they have to study with a teacher on a weekend on the same day that Lotte has this convention that she really wants to go to. They sneak out and go to the convention, and then the fact that they snuck out was never brought up again until the very end of the episode. The trope of being forced to do something on an important day is very common in Western Animation, and its inclusion here isn't necessary as it's ignored for most of the episode. But because it's there it only murks up the episode with another cliche, that adds unnecessary and unrealised tension that distracts from the main focus of the episode.  The bigger problem with these episodes is that they don't develop the characters. Most of them focus on what the Character is already like or on comedy. That means while each episode can be entertaining they don't help the narrative as a whole. If Little Witch Academia was solely a collection of fun episodic episodes that wouldn't be that big of a problem. Even though they didn't hit anything big in them, it would be fine if isn't it wasn't designed to. And at the start, it felt like that's how it was. It was supposed to just be fun events that had happened. However it strives to do big things, and for those big things to work there needs to be developed. It's hard to take the plot seriously when the development of that plot is weak and cliche. It's hard to care about the characters in that plot when they aren't developed and are just flat archtypes. As these episodes rarely developed any other part of the show, and so even though Little Witch Academia had the space to fit together, it never actually worked because they never did so. Not only did the episodic episodes do a poor job of setting up the later plot heavy episodes but it also meant that switching the tone between the two would leave a stark difference between the two sides, possibly alienating the distinct styles of each side from each other.  That was not the only distraction. There were other uneventful plots such as Andrew's plot that ended up not going much of anywhere. His inclusion does not add much to the story, nor does it stand well on its own. Rather all it does is introduce another cliche subplot to take up space from the main plot which could have used the additional focus. Little Witch Academia did not need a love interest, nor did it need the another character's struggles to be present in the story, especially when that character's struggles are not focused on magic or the main themes of the work. His role also is played in the most cliche way possible played completely straight. He adds nothing new, and the show wouldn't be different at all without him. And yet he takes valuable episode space on his ultimately unimportant plot.  The problem is while the ideas aren't the worst they really don't work when put together. The plot-based elements aren't able to be explored nor do they have the intensity that they could have if they were focused on alone. Rather they feel more like afterthoughts that are shoved into the episodes. Often enough they don't even have enough time in those episodes and suffer from rushed pacing as well. They feel unnatural and with the exception of a couple of well-placed moments, they don't fit into the general tone of the show. Its the same with the episodic moments. They're fine on their own but the tone between the two parts don't fit together well. The episodic episodes are light and comedic, while the plot is more serious and important.  I touched on the characters a bit and for good reason. The characters were a big problem in Little Witch Academia. Even though the characters did have moments of focus very few of them grew as characters. The characters were mostly the personalities that they established in their first appearances. They never seem to grow and they rarely get any depth. This is most critical is the case of Akko who is just as reckless and impatient as she was at the very start. Most of the characters follow this same pattern though. The best character they have is Diana who actually developed and showed more interesting sides to her outside of her know it all role. She is able to express the conflicting feelings between her interest in magic, as well as her interest in tradition and her family history. However, even her strong points are countered by the fact of just how talented she is. Even though she has the most interesting struggles of the show, she happens to be incredibly talented and respected to a degree that stretches believability. Outside of Chariot the rest of the characters aren't very developed and Chariot has the same problems with being too talented although not on the same scale as Diana. Overall the characters don't add much, as most are flat, and the more developed ones are overpowered.  And it's not like the character interactions save it either. While some characters like Akko and Diana have natural chemistry this isn't the case with most of them. Even though there are other friendship groups besides Akko's most of the attention focuses on Akko with whomever else the episode decides on. And while there are moments that bring Lotte and Sucy closer to Akko, they also barely even appear together after the second half. Their friendship also feels a bit forced as even though the show does say that Sucy cares about Akko it's hard to believe that considering how they generally treat each other. The combination of the weak characters and awful mess of a plot makes a crap filled wreck.  Luckily for Little Witch Academia, it is very pretty. The art is very nice, and the animation is fluid and works really well. It's a nice feast for the eyes. It also does well at building and animating hype moments. But that's about it. It also has a good deal of references and sequences designed to draw the attention of the fans. While these are not bad in nature, when they are inserted into the more serious moments of the show, it does hurt the moment.  While Little Witch Academia works for the eyes, it doesn't work on any other merit, and overall is a large undeveloped mess. If it wasn't for the nice Trigger style I'd call this one of the worst shows of the season. Actually, it still is. Unless you just want to tune out and watch nice visuals I suggest giving this a hard pass.;Not Recommended
2;Little Witch Academia (TV);Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;4;"Little Witch Academia   This anime sets a great example for all the others, showing how with an almost unlimited concept, it still manages to waste all its potential and simply create subpar results. On the outside, Little Witch Academia looks like a promising work. Animations, drawing style, colorful depictions you could almost think ""This is going to be THIS anime!"" but no, it's just a bluff.  Through this concept you had a limitless reserve of creative actions that could have been accomplished, there are no limitations here. Everything can be as irrational and bizarre as you want. And yet they decided that this anime is simply a witch version of Sailor Moon or Wedding Peach. With this I can practically explain how bad the dialogue has been, it's practically been an oversized play.  Among other things, I'm not sure if this anime like Digimon/Pokemon was made for kids in the 10-year-old range, but it feels that way. At least I got the same vibe with it after rewatching Digimon. The dialogue is spongy and I occasionally get the impression that everything has been simplified so that even a toddler can understand it. Maybe it is, I just couldn't find any more specific information on this.   [Story 3]  After -Midori..- Atsuko has admired witches/mages since she was a little girl. She became a real witch fanatic after a performance of her favorite idol and also wanted to go to the same magic school as her. Which she also ... managed to do. But unfortunately, it's a weak-to-strong plot, whereby the protagonist can't do anything and has to mess with the ""cool"" kids to get her point across.  Honestly, it goes on like this until the end. She builds friendships, screws up and creates problems, and figures out new legendary things.   The only thing that surprised me was the plot twist at the end, which resolved the entire story between Akko and her idol. Honestly, it was simplistic but good. I liked this twist because it created some drama and added depth to some of the characters.  But you had to wait for almost 20 boring episodes for it.  [Characters 4]  Akko... I hate this girl. I see not only naivety and stupidity in her eyes, but also bottomless arrogance. The fact that she builds SO much nonsense and caused so many problems and still always acts innocent was possibly acceptable in the first 2 scenes. But not after 20 episodes of pure nonsense. The fact that she is constantly forgiven even though she is a complete troublemaker is not understandable.  I thought she was going to be a naive dimwit who wants to make people smile, but she did the exact opposite.  The rest of the characters are practically just comedy asides that aren't even decent. There's nothing to say about them. The mushroom girl of course has been Best Girl as expected.  The antagonist in the story had his motivations and little story arc but was so cliché that it almost killed me.   [Music 5 /Animations 7]   The two intros are pretty similar and average. The osts were staggering but some decent ones were there. Nothing to ever be remembered for.   Little Witch Academia's animations were the best point of the anime. With their bizarre and flexible drawing style, they created many dynamic scenes. Together with very appealingly drawn backgrounds, there was a good overall picture. It's something to be proud of, at least.   [Conclusion 4]   It's not like Little Witch Academia is bad. This anime just has a lot of flaws and not enough strengths to make up for it. Most average series I've seen are simply better than this one. And that's sad, I like this setting and this waste of potential is a crime.  In the right hands, Little Witch Academia could have been outstanding. Unfortunately, we will never see it.  [Enjoyment 4]";Not Recommended
3;Little Witch Academia (TV);kallocarina;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kallocarina;2;Okay. I'm not going to go so far as to call this anime bad but... Actually never mind it sucks.  So Little Witch Academia is just bad. Aside from two or three people who caught my eye the characters suck. The storyline is pretty boring. The protagonist is the most annoying protagonist of any anime I have seen by far (worse than Shinji from Neon gay and that's saying something) and I don't know why they even bothered making this anime in the first place.  Okay let's start with some positive things about this anime.  Everything else sucks. The story is stupid and feels kind of like a Harry Potter ripoff lol. I can never take this anime seriously. The protagonist is obnoxious and stupid. The emotional moments fall flat or are painfully cringy to the point that I wouldn't even call them emotional moments. This anime has so much cringe and is ridiculous. There are plot holes and pointless episodes that have nothing to do with anything. Everyone is GAY. So much to the point that this show should be called Little Gay Academia (insert audience laughs here). Also did I mention the protagonist is obnoxious and stupid? The show is not based on reality at all in any way shape or form. The only scene I liked was this one where the dragon guy is talking about stocks and generating income via investments. That was actually incredible and is the only reason I gave this a two instead of a one. Also there was this one scene where this Andrew guy started playing Flight of the Bumblebee on piano despite having NOT PLAYED PIANO IN 15 YEARS (I know this because he literally says it five minutes before playing it). Do these people not understand how piano works? I mean, Kosei from Kimi no uso couldn't even do that after even less time on hiatus AND HE WAS A FREAKIN' PRODIGY. What even is this anime? The only characters I remotely like are Constanze who is awesome, Sucy who is gay but still awesome, and Dianna (who they make out to be the villain during the first season for whatever reason?). The only reason I watched this anime was because there aren't many animes that are family friendly enough for you to watch with your little sister that aren't like, Pokémon or something. It was still a waste of time.  Overall, you can watch it if you want? I mean... if you enjoyed it good for you ig? But like, NO. I don't recommend this anime at all. If you need a family friendly anime go watch cardcaptor Sakura or something, it's way better and a lot less CRINGE. My suggestion, watch until you get to the scene with the dragon (it's only like three episodes in) and then burn your copy of the DVD, burn your Netflix account if you watched it on Netflix, and if you watched it anywhere else get an exorcism to purify your house of the cringe that is Little Gay I mean Little Witch Academia.  -Sincerely, Kallocarina (this review was mostly a joke I'm not actually mad or triggered but it's not a good anime so don't watch it lol);Not Recommended
4;Little Witch Academia (TV);Makinghandties;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Makinghandties;4;"As a casual viewer, Little Witch Academia’s went from the legendries OVAs that the show is based off of to being a Kill la Kill/Darling in the Franxx in disguised, and while both of them were very good show, they enjoyed a better focus, and ultimately much better writing that LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA lacked to stand next to them.  Those who loved KILL LA KILL and DARLING IN THE FRANXX will definitely find LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA similar. The cast contains a mix of unique characters and favorites archetypes with an interesting and developed world. It had a clear formula that worked before in KILL LA KILL and DARLING IN THE FRANXX where the first 13 episodes is a curve up for Akko, the main character, to slowly grows as the casts are introduced and the end goal. The later episodes were used to explore more about each character, and ultimately ends in space. Trigger-y! Importantly, Akko never fell into the archetype of the “fully geared main character who has beat everyone except the final boss”. There’s something humanizing about this, even though we all know that she will succeed. Then there’s also the quality of art and sound. They were of top quality and extremely consistent no matter the episode. It’s the kind of show that you would expect from Trigger, a high-quality anime that’s punchy, colorful, and a go-happy adventure. What the show suffered from is, first, a lack of focus on Magic. As a show about witches, the spells, the magic presented were uninspiring, boring and underused; it was either used as a convenient plot device or simply not used at all! For example, only a handful of the spells were introduced earlier in the show, and one would expect more interesting spell or spell interactions to be performed. Instead, we see the same spell performed over and over again uninterestingly by though around Akko, or even not at all, like when (spoiler-ish) Naomi used her wand to enhance a sword and proceeded to poke her opponent down; why wouldn’t they just have a use simple spell? or how Ursula literally pulled out a light saber from her wand to fight; why? She’s a powerful witch! even Constantine no longer use any magic to build her tools, which was what made her special in the OVA; now she literally pulled out an MP5 (spoiler ends), and those were just to name a few. The daily activities and action sequence, while beautifully animated, had no magic about them, Ursula even did the Naruto run in one of the sequences. With the exception to episode 12 and 13, the entire 25 episodes of the show simply lacked the magic and importantly an imagination that were showed in the OVAs.  However, all of this would’ve been fine if not for the low quality of writing of the show; Those who have watched the OVAs that inspired this show will find that this is most disappointing. While the show may have got more physical actions, it is the convoluted plot that Trigger built to create drama that made it tiresome. The biggest one is (spoiler) Croix. What was the whole point of Croix in showing magic is believing in your heart? Akko was already a commoner. Of course, it would not have matter, as the plot is carried by its character, if the writing was not so subpar. No longer are there any subtly in the conversations or in the actions of characters to shows their intentions and personalities. In its place are unnecessarily drawn out conversations, or even unnecessary episodes that ultimately achieved nothing or could’ve been done in a shorter time. Take, for example, the original OVA from 2013. From how the girls talked to each other in their room, naturally expositing the world and their friendship, the little curtsy that Diana gave to Akko in the cafeteria, to the demeanor of Ursula while introducing the dungeon, to Diana and Akko interaction after the dragon was released, to how Ursula very briefly showed her identity, to Diana and Akko interaction about Chariot. In 22 minutes Sucy, Akko, Lotte, Diana, and Ursula had more personality and relationships developed between them than the first 13 episodes of the series.  In the end, LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA wanted to tell a shounen-esque story while its original OVAs an imaginative magical story, and that’s fine. However, its writing is a disappointment and that ultimately puts it below its OVAs and other Trigger show. It’s a shame, because when Trigger change to Akko from being bad with magic to struggling to use magic to the point of virtually having no magical capability at all, ironically, they also took the magic out of the show.  As a personal note, no anime has ever made me leave a review. There are many other problems with this show, but most are subjective and could've been carried with a better writing. I’m sure that there are other reviewers have already laid them out. I do not hate what they have changed about the the show, but just that it could be so much more than just another adventure anime. I suppose that I’m still very much in love with the 2 OVAs and if a season 3 ever comes out I would still watch it in hope to find that magic of the show again.";Not Recommended
5;Little Witch Academia (TV);Seregosa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Seregosa;3;I almost couldn't finish this. Not sure why some people like it, though it seems a lot of the people are just fans of the OVAs that I haven't watched. Maybe if I was younger and less tempered by countless anime, manga and novels from different countries, I might've enjoyed this more. Maybe. Or perhaps it's just not for me? Though I'm sure I would've loved it as a kid.  I really can't stand this anime. The story is dreadful, so many question marks about the story. The characters are all boring and seem to be one-dimensonal, they stick too rigidly to their personality quirks, they lack the flexibility of any human being, which makes them seem forced and artificial. In other words, way too simple.  What I can't stand the most is the protagonist. She's a prime example of an overdone ADHD character and I'm using that knowing perfectly well what it signifies. She has the attention span of a goldfish and the hyperactivity and silliness or plain stupidity of a husky. She runs around doing stupid crap 24/7, putting her life at risk, thanking people who almost get her killed, screwing simple things up by acting like a spoiled toddler, just in the first few episodes we're treated to things like her not researching how to get to school, almost getting them killed by not throwing away some salty food, jumping in front of something akin to a magic bullet instead of talking, running around trying to cast spells loudly with no idea how to, making a huge joke of herself over and over again, just not learning from being burned, screaming her lungs out repeating herself when the broom spell doesn't work instead of listening to the teacher's advice and so on. She's nothing but a walking joke.  Do people REALLY find loudmouth super hyper fools to be funny? Is it because she's a girl so it's supposed to appeal to people who like the cute girls doing cute things stuff? Thing is, those animes work because there is no danger, there is no need to care about anything and no getting shamed either and even then they're usually not this hyper or stupid... Screaming and running around doing stupid crap is funny, right? If that's the level we're going for, comedy suddenly became real damn simple. I'm not actually asking her to be very smart or calm/collected, just want her to not act like a nutcase with questionable brain status and a body on hard drugs. Hell, this would've been more bearable if only they focused on some things instead of trying to cover a lot. How about not making the world dangerous and bring into play issues like borderline bullying and class/status conflicts. I mean, if you want to make an airheaded character like this, at least make the scenario/world setting fit her so that it doesn't come across as plain annoying.  The art isn't even particularly good, it feels like they wanted to go for a good visual experience with lots of cool visual effects but ended up half-assing it due to budget and time constraints so everything just looks rushed.  It's really a question mark to me why people like this. Perhaps it would be fairly enjoyable if the protagonist could be a happy go lucky girl that, while fairly hyper, happy and outgoing, actually thinks with her brain as well and doesn't repeatedly and actively make a fool of herself. A character that can stop herself from acting on impulse 24/7 like some kind of a f*king animal. Even your typical beast would act more wise and intelligent than her, at least they wouldn't actively jump into a blazing fire that couldn't be more obvious.  So, yeah, this might be a wet dream kind of anime for kids and younger teens might also enjoy it immensely, but I really wonder about loving it as an adult who values story and characters to at least some extent.;Not Recommended
6;Little Witch Academia (TV);Meshikufu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Meshikufu;4;This anime is pretty good if you are below 10 years old or 50 IQ. Then you will definitely enjoy it.  If the show's target audience is kids it means that logic can be bent however you want? To the point when characters don't even feel human... What's up with 25 episodes too? 6 could be a perfect fit, because characters don't develop anyways. Everything is shoved in the last 4 episodes.  There is a somewhat unique world with non-typical art, that looks pretty cool. But it all is overtaken by bad writing. The main villain is driven by god knows what and she is not the only one. They have specific rules tied to them and they will act accordingly to the set rules no matter how dumb it is in some situations and common sense isn't known to them either.  Conclusion. This anime is big bullshit. Doesn't have comedy or story, the only thing it is good at is wasting time.;Not Recommended
0;Little Witch Academia;smileyboyrocks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/smileyboyrocks;9;Much like the creator of this little gold nugget, I'll be keeping this review short, but sweet.  Aside from Ryo, which I can't seem to find anywhere (if you happen to know a site, a link would be very helpful), I've seen all of the Anime Mirai 2013 films. All 4 are about half-an-hour long, so they're pretty concise with their story. Death Billiards is pretty good, but it feels a bit pretentious, shoving a little philosophical question down your throat but not really making you think that much. Arve Rezzle feels like the pilot to a full series, and as such offers very little closure, but it has some nice ideas, even if those are undermined slightly by some rather half-baked characterisation and poorly executed exposition.  I'm giving my little mini reviews to the other episodes simply to give my review of Little Witch Academia some context. As someone with a rather cold demeanour, and who typically enjoys a dark thriller or gore-heavy action series, it may come across as somewhat surprising when I say that LWA is my favourite of the three. It's almost Disney-esque, with genuinely loveable and quirky characters, a strong and functional, if not particularly complex, story and a completely uplifting tone. The humour is solid and hits you enough to make even the most stoic individual smile a bit. The animation is brilliant, with the art differing just enough from the conventions of the Japanese style to make me completely fall in love with it. Voice-acting is probably my primary gripe, but it's not so bad that it distracts from the episode. It's fun, and reminds me of why I need to be less tolerant of those angsty action-thrillers like Arve Rezzle that seem to make up the meat of today's anime industry.  LWA is like Shrek. Far from being childish, this little gem is fun for everyone (though it doesn't share Shrek's gleeful love for sexual innuendo). Even if, like me, you've grown into an emotionally-jaded, highly critical badass, you may just find that Little Witch Academia has enough substance and upbeat tone to penetrate your doughy cynicism and really cheer you up.  I would genuinely rather they made a full series of this than Arve Rezzle.;Recommended
1;Little Witch Academia;Kimuraaaa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kimuraaaa;10;Little Witch Academia is a standout anime, even though so far there is only one part and it is about 25 minutes long at this stage I would definitely consider this a masterpiece.  Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if an anime is worth watching you usually don't want to read all that much.  Positives  - A short story which leaves room for expansion yet ties up the major loose ends and sticks to a three act structure incredibly well. - The characters are all very different from each other, none are stereotypical archetypes and each are likeable in their own way. - The soundtrack is not something I noticed too much, but it was enough to create the correct atmosphere for the scenario's. - The animation, I feel like this really needs to be stressed, by god the animation is amazing, everything is so smooth I think this might be the smoothest and most consistent animation i've ever seen.  Negatives - Hard to think of many. - The soundtrack wasn't extremely memorable, hardly much of a negative.   Like I said, it's very difficult for me personally to find faults in Little Witch Academia, I would recommend this to almost anyone and am certainly looking forward to the future of this project.;Recommended
2;Little Witch Academia;Nachteule;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nachteule;8;"""Trigger saved anime."" This is a phrase the anime community got to read a lot alongside Kill la Kill's airing until a little while. I'd go this far and say that Trigger DID save anime. But it had nothing to do with Kill la Kill. Read here why!  Actually, Little Witch Academia caught me by surprise. I didn't know Studio Trigger had something like that in stock and after I found out about this little gem I almost instantly decided to download it and oh boy was that a fine decision.  Reminder: This review will be spoiler free and I will refrain from going too deep into happenings and just summarize it really, really quickly. We have the main heroine Akko Kagari. As a child she was attending a magic show featuring the witch Shiny Chariot who has become an idol for Akko. Even though she is not born into a magic family she attends the name giving magic school and is friends with Sucy and Lotte.  Let's split up this review into the five categories as usual:  Story (7/10):  There really isn't much I can say about a one episode anime with 25 minutes without coming up with a summary or spoilers. So let's just say that Little Witch Academia features a coherent plot. It features a look in the past of the main character and her motivations, parts of the everyday life at the academy and the interactions between multiple different characters. It's just one episode but felt concluded and not rushed by any means.  Art (7/10):  Since it has been Studio Trigger working on this it has this certain touch you instantly get out of it if you have watched Kill la Kill before. In general the backgrounds are very nice to look at, the animation is fluid, lightning looks gorgeous and the character models are full of variety in looks and facial animations. There is nothing to complain about here.  Sound (8/10):  As it is a single episode anime yet I would have never thought so much effort has been pumped into the soundtrack. It was outstanding and had a broad variety of different tunes to set the mood. I really loved that it consisted mostly of orchestral music. It just fitted so well. Another part worth mentioning in the ""Sound""-category is the voice acting. Trigger got really, really talented people on board for Little Witch Academia and it was a pure pleasure listening to them.  Character (8/10):  For a one-piece show they had a pretty adorable and varying cast reaching from the arrogant but talented witch with her two friends and the goofy main character as well as her sidekicks which would be a clumsy glasses girl and the superficially more introverted girl with the not-so-obvious but kickass abilities. All in all a very good cast of likeable characters.  Enjoyment (9/10):  I can't remember when it was the last time 25 minutes felt that short. It was over in almost an instant and had no dull moments. It was funny, suspenseful and full of quality. Pure entertainment!  Verdict (8/10*):  A very good anime. It is nice to see that projects like Little Witch Academia are such a success (600.000 clicks on YouTube according to Trigger). Also the second episode has been an insane hit on Kickstarter, fulfilling the 150.000$ mark in just one day. I can't wait for more. It was fun all along. You shouldn't miss out on this enchanting tale! It's worth your very time and appreciation.  ---------------------------------  *) Score is not an average";Recommended
3;Little Witch Academia;pikacece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pikacece;10;"I just want to rate this special as a 10 to applaud the young animators on a job well done! Your story goes like this a typical magical girl has aimed to become like her idol ""Chariot"" and this connects to the minds of our youth because you know we hold lots of dreams, ambitions, and imagination. So this special takes that and creates the opportunity to take this dream head on. Bits of comedy and adventure with a hint of wonder, i mean its about magical girls ;] The characters are all unique. Including the art, oh man the ART. The scenery if fabulous and as for the character designs...gorgeous. I'd also like to add that the style changes from cartoon-y to normal to detailed in their faces to match the situation such as embarrassment or laughter. The main ones have different facial features so you can easily recognize them not only by their hair color. The music matched very well. Especially at parts that needed suspense ^^ I really enjoyed this special and it will go down as one of my favorites for now :>  Typical magical girl, so why now give this special a try? The special effects are pretty dramatic ^^";Recommended
4;Little Witch Academia;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"Trigger does it again.  Yes, and what I mean by that is is achieving entertainment. Honestly, coming into this series, I didn't expect too much. After all, it involved young amateur anime producers who wishes to get their hands on the experience of making an anime. However, after watching these 26 minutes of awesomeness, I got the feeling that Trigger will pull more exciting stuff out of their hats.  Little Witch Academia details of a single 26 minute episode that is seemingly based off a setting taken place in a form of Magical Academy. The title of the series is what you get - an academy about little witches. The series stars Kagari who plays the role of the main female protagonist. Along with her at the academy are other students. Based on her role, Kagari seems to be a lazy student. Additionally, she seems to be naive as her character and is usually deceived in various forms of witchcraft and wizardry. To make matters worse, she is ridiculed by an elite witch (Diana) in front of her peers. Still, we can see that she has a dream, one which she wants to make into a reality.  Following dreams isn't easy though especially with her skills...  Among other things, the episode adapts the fantasy/magic theme well. There's the magical academy, the various tests that students must endure to become elite witches, and the magical spells. Even the way the character dresses seems to reflect this with black wardrobes and magical hats with that special wand to complete the package. The various creatures and critters also adds a nice feeling of magical touch. They have little resemblance to humans but instead are portrayed as the threat to the academy's students.  That of course requires the students' abilities and magical skills to survival. As such, the students uses the knowledge they learned from their classes and employs them directly. Speaking of which, that spells out the action of the series. Personally, I find the action presented to be a bit cheesy. Seemingly, spells fired and crafted gives off sparks of that magical feel. The usage of broomsticks also fits the trope of witches and the way they travel among the skies. Then, there's the deal again with Kagari...  She just wants to be part of the spotlight whenever she can. Whether it's in the face of danger or humiliation, she faces them directly. Despite her lack of magical skills, Kagari can be seen as a determined and daring. Her friends also shares similar personalities and often rushes to action in the face of danger. Among other things, the episode seems to adapt some tropes from the Harry Potter franchise. The theme of a main character rushing into the face of danger, witchcraft, dragons, and magical stone are all there.  ""Believe in magic"" because it's all magical.  The animation of this episode was a bit cheesy from my perspective. It felt like watching a cartoon but does reflect well on the whole magical theme. The academy's basement along with the wardrobes gives off that feeling in which the girls really are witches. The soundtrack was a bit mediocre. Surprisingly enough, the voice acting was pleasant. All the characters played their roles even if it required a bit of teamwork.  Overall, this episode was a fun delight for me. Don't watch it out of seriousness because if you do, it might end up with a different result. However, out of entertainment and respect for Trigger, this episode was quite enjoyable for me. Sadly, it's only 26 minutes that I hope will transit into greatness. By that, I mean a full length 1, 2, or hell 3-core series. It's not a waste of time to watch this honestly though; only 26 minutes. That's about 1560 seconds of your life.";Recommended
5;Little Witch Academia;5camp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/5camp;7;Young Animator Training Project/Anime Mirai short reviews: Part 10/12  Little Witch Academia has had a bit of underground hype building for it because it’s by the newly formed Studio Trigger, Hiroyuki Imaishi’s studio he formed after he left Gainax. Little Witch Academia really amplifies the Saturday morning cartoon feel their previous works had with its bouncy animation style and cartoony visuals. The plot feeds into this too, being basically an animated version of the early Harry Potter books. This was particularly apparent during the broom flying lesson scene. I did get a laugh from Draco Malfoy being recast as a posh stuck-up ojou-sama because it allowed me to imagine Malfoy doing the ojou-sama laugh where he puts the back of his hand against his chin and goes “ooooohhh hoh hoh hoh hoh~!”  The whole thing is very colourful and joyous with a real childlike energy to it. The animation and artwork is bloody great, and feed into this bouncy energy it all has. If I feel like being nitpicky, it’s very shallow. The attempts at having a larger theme about believing in yourself are not well worked in at all, particularly since there’s a better theme there about childish wonder that they didn’t tap into as well as I think they could have. If I were to compare it to the other YATP, it doesn’t have quite the same IMPACTO~! as Wasurenagumo because the story is so rote. But for what it’s trying to achieve in being this energetic Saturday morning cartoon, it does that perfectly.  Verdict: Watch;Recommended
6;Little Witch Academia;Manglex;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Manglex;8;"Fabricating a world in a mere 26 minutes is no easy task, and that task is made even more difficult when you are challenged with adding characters and plot-line to the fabricated world.  While not perfect, Little Witch Academia accomplishes the aforementioned task quite stunningly, and is more than worth the 26 minutes of your time.  The story of Little Witch Academia is definitely not the highlight of the show. You follow a young witch named Akko as she attends Witch Academy to try to become more like her hero, Shining Chariot, a flashy stage magician that most witches look down on. It is relatively simple and could have been very interesting if given time to develop. Due to time constraints, however; the story is not given the necessary time to develop. It does its job of giving the world a structure and nothing more.  This also goes for the characters. Its surprising that in such a short time they can be so enjoyable and even seem to have underlying depth to them. Sadly, they are not given the needed time to develop in only one 26 minute episode.  But that is okay!  What the show lacks in plot and in overall character development is made up for by the fact that the art and sound are absolutely stunning.  The art itself has a certain air about it that a western animation would have. It could put many leading anime to shame, and that is what the competition was all about! In 1080p(and even 720p) the show has extremely fluid and enjoyable animation to the point where it makes the characters seem quirky and interesting. The animation is made even more impressive when you thing about the crew of young animators that put it together.  The sound is also extremely incredible. It has a great soundtrack. A really great soundtrack, but what really makes the sound stand out is how well it fits with the animation. Sound effect were used alongside the animation to produce quite an alluring experience over all. The voice actors also did an immaculate job at giving the characters the proper quirky vibe needed for the show.  Needless to say I enjoyed all 26 minutes of Little Witch Academia. I am really blown away by what these young animators did in a 26 minute time frame, and I'd recommend the show to anyone. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Story - 6 Art - 10 Sound - 9 Characters - 7 Enjoyment - 8  Overall - 8";Recommended
7;Little Witch Academia;azuslu7jpg;https://myanimelist.net/profile/azuslu7jpg;8;"An enchanting short series that exploded in popularity for good reason.  As always, my reviews are spoiler free.  Little Witch Academia was created by a small team at Studio Trigger under Japan's Young Animator Training Project. In only 26 minutes, it told a story that was able to captivate an audience large enough to donate over $625,000 to create a sequel.  Story - 7/10  It is very difficult to tell a compelling story in 26 minutes. One could argue against that by saying that there are thousands of single episode arcs that tell a good story. LWA differs from these greatly, however. In these 26 minutes, it is able to introduce a cast of characters, a setting, and a solid plot, whereas most episodes already have the cast and setting established.  LWA's story is simple yet charming; Akko sees a witch perform at public event, and aspires to become like her. One time skip later, she and her friends are attending a magical academy studying to become witches. In these 26 minutes, they face rivals and monsters, form friendships, and even throw in a bit of comedy.  Of course, the story is not especially deep, but it is tremendously done for how short a period of time it is.  Animation - 9/10  LWA has some of the best animation of any series, let alone a short made by a small studio. It has a beautiful color pallet, superb character design with great detail and shading, and stunning backgrounds that totally immerse the viewer in the setting. On top of this, LWA has nearly perfect fluid animation (best appreciated with 24/120hz playback or SVP).  Sound - 7/10  LWA has a very strong voice cast, but has little opportunity to prove itself with a soundtrack. However, the few tracks that are included do well. I will be very interested in seeing a larger soundtrack upon the release of LWA2.  Characters - 6/10  With the allotted time, a full cast is introduced, each with their own personalities and quirks. While many are close to cookie-cutter stereotypes (Akko being the ambitious underdog type, Diana the talented and stuck up perfect girl, etc), we get a few interesting characters such as the gloomy looking yet mischievous Sucy. Her potions are a source of comedy and defense.  It was quite the cast for such a short time, with some 12 episode series having less interesting characters.  Enjoyment - 9/10  Any anime fan should devote a few minutes of their day to see this light-hearted short by Trigger. The fact that it was able to inspire fans to fly past the target monetary goal should be reason enough for you to give this show a chance.  In short, you get nearly all the fun of a half-cour series in just 26 minutes. It can be found for legal streaming all over the internet, so you have no excuse not to watch it 30 seconds from now.  Other Thoughts  Not much to say here. I'm looking forward to LWA2 and Kill la Kill, with the hopes that Trigger can prove themselves to be a strong force in the anime market.";Recommended

No pun intended.  *SOME SPOILERS FOR LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA*  Remember childhood? That time where any sort of magic can truly take your breath, spray some magic dust onto it, and shove it back into your mouth for you to feel the excitement? Well, this movie/special wants to remind you. Magicians, sorcerers, and witches were often some of the coolest things ever for a kid, aside from dragons, and whatever gaming console and favorite video game they might have. Also, this IS a family friendly feature, so invite the family for a magical adventure, and who knows? You may even find a piece of innocent childhood you once lost, if only for a brief moment. So, did this movie enchant, or did it fall off its broom? Let's find out, shall we?  STORY: 7/10  Many years ago, a little girl was enchanted with amazement watching a magical performance by a pretty witch named Shining Chariot. Now, that same girl, named Akko, along with two friends, try to become good witches at the Little Witch Academia. After their semi rival, Diana, accidentally breaks an unknown seal, it is up to Akko to take down the evil dragon that was once sealed, and save the day!  Ok, let's get this out of the way. This short film is VERY straight forward and base. Hell, if it botched up anything, the already 6.5 would drop. Premise and theatrics aside, almost nothing you've seen here hasn't been done a thousand times over by other films of its young 6-11 year old demographic. It's just a girl and two quirky friends getting antagonized by some stuck up snooty girl, having a mentor who just so happens to be a figure from the past, and saving the day with the power of (insert Aesop here). It dosen't try to be more than a kids film, and it does a good job at that and not leaving any plot holes, even if the story is very basic. What helps it is the humor and the little nods to other things like dungeon crawlers, that and the final act is still really good at escalating tension and scale, and the dragon actually has the ""don't attack it's mouth with powerful attacks or else it gets stronger"" deal, and yes, there is a mcguffin, but it DOES leave a more ambiguous ending instead of the generic ""congrats girl, you saved the day and now everyone likes you, even the snooty girl"" thing.   CHARACTERS: 6/10  Again, nothing you haven't seen already, but they are still fine characters none the less. Basically 6 material, but stil done decently. There's the energetic rising hero protagonist Akko, her two supportive and quirky best friends, Diana aka the rival snooty girl, albeit what's special about her is that she actually takes responsibility for her stupid actions and try to fix this and do so humbly, and there's Ursula the professor, who is really just a retired Shining Chariot. The actual presentation of the characters, once again, makes them just a tad more interesting and flavorful than most of their archetype brethren, but even still, nothing particularly noteworthy or groundbreaking.  ART: 9/10  This is where the movie really shines, again, no pun intended. Studio Trigger was formed by ex Ginax employees, and as such, they've really taken notes from the likes of Gurren Lagann, so bombastic and flashy animation is kinda their thing, and this short film only helps that notion. Many scenes have some impressive witchcraft, and even cooler fireworks. The action scenes look like if Gurren Lagann used magic rather than mechs, and that is definitely a complement. Everything is fluid and fast paced, so, it wind be hard to be drawn in by the flashy witchcraft in this short film. The character designs on nice as well, especially the moments where we get a close up on Akko's amazed eye as it reflects the light of the fireworks.  SOUND: 7/10  The music is nothing too special. Decent orchestral pieces that fit the situations but aren't really memorable. Also, no OP or ED. For the dub... It's sorta mixed. Some performances could've been better and more assertive, and others are just fine. Nothing extraordinary about the dub though. It's decent.  ENJOYMENT: 8/10  Once again, I must reiterate, the magic used in this movie, and the bombastic animation throughout, really sell this short movie to us, as we can marvel at the fast-paced and vibrant magic, and put up with the fact that aside from that, this movie is rather straight forward. It's definitely fun movie, and it really makes magic look cool, and that's just what it needed to do.  OVERALL: 7/10. RAW SCORE: 69/100  This is definitely a family movie, and I recommend spending the 26 minutes it uses in order to have a bit of magic fun with the family, even though this is still not much different than an average kids film, however, the magic and humor can definitely help you forgive that. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu.";Recommended
9;Little Witch Academia;mdude009;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mdude009;8;"How I found out about this anime is a little bit of a funny story... Well not really, a guy posted a gif on funnyjunk of Suushy turning her gaze and I liked the look of the art style so I asked for the source. Anyway, what is LWA? We'll it's a little indie film (well it's called a movie even though it's only about half an hour long) to train people new to the animation job in Japan, and it was good enough that people wanted a series made. Oh, did I mention this shit was made by studio trigger? You know they made some good stuff like Gurran Laggen... Doesn't ring a bell?... Well how about INFERNO MOTHERFUCKING COP! Yeah, that alone is reason to watch this. But enough of speaking of the greatest anime ever created, on the this anime!:  Story 7/10: The story of LWA is a fairly simple one to be honest (but considering it's only a single episode I suppose it has to be). And aspiring young witch, Akko, joins an academy of witches to emulate her hero, Shining Chariot, a performance artist witch who most ""real"" witches look down upon but who taught Akko to follow her dreams. Like I said, pretty simple. Oh and toss in an ancient dragon in there because we need an epic final battle. Yeah, the story is fairly decent and for the most part well executed, but not without it's flaws. For the most part the plot seems a bit shallow in actual execution due to how short it is: Girl see's her personal hero preform, time skip, girl is in witch academy, someone puts down her hero, she gets made, few quirky bits, big epic dragon fight, more quirk and big epic ending. Honestly if we had more time to expand upon this it would have been much better but as of now it just comes off a little shallow. Not bad, just shallow.  Art 10/10: As you may have read above it was a single small gif with barely any movement that made me watch LWA and I will still say it was my favourite part of the show. The animation was wonderfully fluid that it put many things to shame (then again in this industry that's not a very hard thing to do. Have you seen Infinite stratos and the like, I mean Jesus fucking Christ). But the main point is the art style, good god that wonderful art style. I mean you can debate whether you liked it or not but you can't deny that it was refreshing unique compared to about 98% of the stuff in this form of media. The far more cartoon-y look giving the whole thing a more... Disney feel. Actually that's a pretty apt comparison as much of this show feels like a short disney film, the story, the art style, and the...  Sound 7/10: Yes the music feels very disney and it even has the exaggerated western kids cartoon sound effects like the big popping noise when someone pulled their (apparently skull-less) head out of a helmet with a thin neck brace. All of this really helps contribute to the overall feel of the show, quirky, cartoon-y fun for the whole family. Until the elitist mature anime pricks come along and demand a pregnant woman has her fetus forcefully- No! Bad mdude! We're talking about wholesome cartoon-y fun! Think happy thoughts. Lalalala, so happy and upbeat!  Character 8/10: What quirky upbeat disney-esh show wouldn't be complete without an equally quirky cast of totally non-child mutilating characters? Well we have plenty. We got Akko, the very bad witch who's trying to emulate her hero. Lotte, the voice of reason. And Suushy, the kinda goth girl who seems to carry several horrible mutilating poisons on her at all times... God damn it, quirky fun! Oh and Diana, the series antagonist who despite being bit of an arrogant bitch is genuinely a good person. I want to put special mention to that last character, this is how you're supposed to have us like an antagonist people, give her plenty of redeeming qualities early in, not have the being a baby mutilating cunt since day one and then about ten seconds before the end do a ""oh, I was only doing _______ because *insert traumatic past experiences here*"" this is why I hated Vi from the night angel series, you do everything you can to make us hate her and then expect us to start liking her after a few pet the dogs moments after we already firmly hate her? Anyway yeah, the characters are fun and quirky despite not really doing much in terms of development, what did you want? It's only half an hour.  Enjoyment 9/10: This is not a gory anime with a bunch of bullshit philosophical rants that every elitist prick for a ten mile radius clambers around and starts telling everyone it's the greatest thing in existence because it's ""deep and mature."" This is a fun for all ages quirky little show for fun, and that's fine, you don't have to kill like seven thousand people by pulling their heart out of their nostrils and then whine about the sanctity of human life to be entertaining and don't let anyone tell you otherwise because the people who crusade that only gory super serious anime is the only good anime probably haven't showered in years. If you go into it fully expecting a somewhat childish but fun to watch show you'll be sure to thoroughly enjoy it. And if you can't enjoy anything that you think children can also watch without being scarred for life than go jerk of to some gore porn or something.  Overall 8/10: Taking all the previous scores, adding them together, not actually doing that because I'm too lazy to get an actual average, and then picking a random number that seems about right considering the other scores we come to a very respectable 8/10. It's only 26 minutes and it's fun to watch, what more do you want? If you basically hate anything cartoon-y (despite the fact that anime are cartoons, just Japanese cartoons, deal with it) that is somewhat childishly fun and quirky then avoid this thing like it's a plague that's only symptom is making anyone infect by it crack a smile every now and again you gloomy sod. If you actual have a face that isn't so hard it'll crack if you don't scowl for three seconds than consider giving it a chance.";Recommended
10;Little Witch Academia;Randy_Drews;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Randy_Drews;7;"With the length of a single anime episode and the lack of pandering to a community that gets too much pandering, Little Witch Academia is a nice break from the usual anime seen from season to season. From Studio Trigger, this show keeps the audience engaged and entertained throughout its short runtime.  The story of this short ""movie"" is almost nonexistent as this feels more like a slice of life anime with conflicts mixed in. Because of this, shows like this have to rely on its cast of characters as well as the little conflicts that arise to keep the audience entertained. So does it do that? Yes, it does.  The premise of the story is basically the anime version of Harry Potter, but with more charm and a lighthearted feel to it. This mixed with bright colors and a main character that the audience can root for makes this a good movie.  That's all it is though, good. It isn't a masterpiece because it's not moving the animation medium forward in any way. It isn't trying to be anything more and does what it does well. For a show like this, I can respect that. I mean, if it tried to push some underlying message of racism through an allegory of witches and non witches relating to races, I'd say that's it's biting off more than it could chew because that doesn't fit the tone of the show.  It is what it is and that's all it's trying to be.  This idea follows through with the characters. For one, they aren't victimized by society in any noticeable way. We get to see why the main character wants to be a witch aka her motivation, which is nice to see in a medium where the plot drives the main character's actions instead of the other way around.  Her actions feel natural and something that she would do rather than what the plot wants her to do, which is refreshing. She has a personality and I feel like I could imagine how she would react to certain situations. This is the same with the main rival too as we get a little more to her than other characters.  I wish I could say this for the side characters, but that's sadly not the case. With 26 minutes, the other characters get less than the main character and her rival, but still have a little to them. It would be nice to see more, but what we got is fine, considering the circumstances.  One more thing I would have liked to see are male characters, but seeing as this is a WITCH academy, it makes sense in context. It would be nice to see a wizard academy too though. Maybe having some sort of rivalry? That would be fun to see as the characters would have some nice contrasts.  The animation is astounding with 2 parts of the 26 minutes being of note. The beginning and the end. It's like they used their budget to draw you in and then leave you with something great and it works well. The fight scene is well choreographed and it keeps the tension of the scene.  This is the same with the music, but I found myself not focusing on the music as much as everything else. It adds to the scenes its in, but it doesn't blow me away. It stays in the background, but I would have liked one track of note to blow me away. Nothing feels out of place and it fits and that's all it really has too do.  Overall, this short is nice too watch with a little down time, will keep you entertained, and will be a breath of fresh air from the usual anime we see every season nowadays. It's lighthearted, fun, and engaging. There's more I'd like to see from it, but at the same time, doing too much would most likely ruin it. It's a solid show that should be watched at one point and that's all that needs to be said.";Recommended
11;Little Witch Academia;daky-kun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/daky-kun;7;Cute and visually pleasing. That's my first impression of this anime.  So, the main character is some fusion of Twilight Sparkle and Sabrina, set in a Harry Potter-esque world (even the Sorcerer's Stone is mentioned). There is also a fair share of action, as well as some comedy. All that packed in 26 minutes.  The other characters are also interesting, especially Sucy. The overall atmosphere is nice.  The story is simple but very effective. It's fast-paced (well, they did have only 26 minutes to tell everything they wanted), almost every scene is important and relevant to the story, and the climax is just epic. If you like this witch-in-training stuff, you might want to check this one out.  Actually, I think the biggest problem is that I'm not a fan of this witch stuff myself, otherwise I would've probably liked this even more. Even so, I still found it amusing. The art is just wonderful and the story/setting makes this worth watching.;Recommended
12;Little Witch Academia;SirTifide;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SirTifide;9;I find this review hard to start. It's difficult to come up with a tagline that'll grab attention but also let me have more to say later on.  If it sounds like I don't have much to say, that's because nearly the only thing that comes to my mind is that Little Witch Academia is fun. Good, plain, clean, for the whole family fun. It sure isn't overwhelmingly deep, it doesn't break new ground, nor does it set a new bar for production value. But regardless of this, it still remains one of the best things you can watch.  It isn't too long, only about the length of your average anime episode, and not something you'd think of watching since it's not overwhelmingly popular or necessarily critically acclaimed. It's the last item that you haven't tried on the menu because given the hit or miss quality of the other items, you're not sure if it's worth spending your money on.  Let me tell you, if time is money, then Little Witch Academia gives you plenty of bang for your buck.  If I haven't said anything that makes you consider watching this, think of the nostalgia watching your favorite childhood movie gives you, or when you watch something that makes you happy just because. That's what Little Witch Academia did for me, and I hope it does the same for you.  If you ever find yourself with a free half hour on a lazy afternoon, give this a whirl. I promise that it won't disappoint.;Recommended
13;Little Witch Academia;AnimeCascade;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeCascade;7;A refreshingly innocent and simplistic experience that provides you with fluid visuals and a memorable narrative.

14;Little Witch Academia;Agent_Redacted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Agent_Redacted;10;"After finishing the Little Witch Academia ( TV ) version. I felt happy, joyous, and grateful. However, something was missing..The feeling of ""real"" closure. When I finished the TV version, I did not watch the other two because I thought that it was pretty much the same and it'd be a waste of time. But I was wrong. After finishing the two movies, I finally feel fulfilled as if the heavy thoughts of guilt from not actually finishing all the anime has to offer inside my mind have been lifted.  If you watch this after the TV show then you'll probably think that its very good like me right now despite the fact that its not as good as the TV show itself. Still. This series is fucking amazing and I enjoy every single moment of it.  If you want to watch Little Witch Academia then you should follow this watching order :  1 ) Little Witch Academia ( TV )  2 ) Little Witch Movie 1  3 ) Little Witch Movie 2  I think this order is better than the original one since we'll get the full experience from the TV version without getting any spoilers from the movie. Then, after finishing the TV you can go to the two movies and watch them to feel better.  Little Witch Academia is an amazing show. Fuck them haters, most of them haven't even actually watched the show. Ahh, I'm glad I found this hidden gem.

16;Little Witch Academia;321yummytime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/321yummytime;8;"Are you sure that was half an hour because that felt like a feature film  The general idea of the story goes by quickly: a childhood memory sparks the protagonist's dreams of becoming a witch, but she's rather clumsy and is falling behind. The characters are all very distinct and likeable. The story, while progressing quickly, draws you in; every scene is significant, and that's what they did right. At the climax of the story I almost teared up because the buildup was done so well, it's exciting, action-packed and funny.  Knowing that it was a 'young animators' project I paid a lot of attention to the animation, and I was extremely satisfied. I would say the animation was very active; the characters are very expressive and the movement is very clean. The colours are great too, especially when they cast spells. I didn't catch any of those 'animation smears', if you know what I mean. The animation was probably perfect.  Overall, if you watch it without knowing anything about it you wouldn't know that they were done by 'young animators', I'd say they pretty much reach quality anime levels (or even higher, compared to certain ones)";Recommended

19;Little Witch Academia;xm0123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xm0123;8;"In 2013, a Japanese governmental program known as “Young Animator Training Project” raised money to fund four animated short films for release during that year. One of these was Little Witch Academia, a twenty-six minute film from Studio Trigger, then an upstart company founded by former members of Studio Gainax.  The beginning shows a little girl sitting with an audience in front of an outdoor concert stage underneath the starry night sky. What’s everyone gathered here for? To watch a show, and sure enough, a performer appears; a witch known as Shiny Chariot. Her magic dazzles the audience, none more so than the little girl in the audience, who is astonished beyond description. Flash forward several years later, and we now see that girl, Akko, as a student at Luna Nova, a school for teaching young girls on how to become proper witches. However, Akko is not very studious; she can’t even fly on a broomstick properly. What sort of witch can’t do that!? Then again, unlike the other students, Akko doesn’t come from a family of magicians. But that’s not her only problem; her idol, Shiny Chariot, is considered a childish fraud by the witch community, which only angers and frustrates Akko even more. She is not alone, for she does have two friends, Lotte, and Sucy, who act as her support. One day, during a training exercise, the three of them are working together when a crisis occurs, one threatening the entire school, and by happenstance, Akko is the only one who can save the day. Can she succeed, even despite her lack of ability?  Despite being only 26 minutes in length, Little Witch Academia manages to flesh out quite a bit in that timeframe. We see how some of the magic works, we get an idea of what the characters are like, and there’s a clear beginning, middle, and end. Its length is its strength and weakness. Since LWA isn’t very long, it never drags on. Every scene serves a purpose. On the other hand, while LWA does a fine job with its setting and characters, it’s not overly “deep”. At first glance, it looks like a Harry Potter knockoff, and LWA is more family-friendly than certain “mature” anime franchises. Those who skip out are missing out on another distinguishing feature: its animation.  Simply put, LWA is one of the best-looking works of animation I’ve ever seen. And I have seen a LOT of animated film throughout my life. Thanks to governmental funding, Trigger was able to produce an anime more visually pleasing than nearly everything else coming from Japan. The character designs are all unique, without re-using faces and hairstyles, everything is fully animated, the coloring and lighting is majestic, the backgrounds are lush, and not once could I spot any gaffes anywhere. I would even say LWA looks better than some of Ghibli’s movies. But the budget doesn’t stop there; the music is a full orchestra composed by Michiru Oshima, the same composer for the older Fullmetal Alchemist anime, and just like in FMA, her music here is outstanding. There aren’t a large number of tracks, but what’s here is truly beautiful, especially in the first scene with Shiny Chariot. The voice acting is also well done. Most of the VAs I don’t know by name, (Besides Megumi Han, but I only know her from Hunter X Hunter) but again, everyone sounds spot-on. Nothing feels rushed in any aspect of this film.  When I first saw LWA, it -immediately- took me back to my childhood. I grew up in the 1990s, the decade of Disney, and the renaissance of animation in general. I saw a lot of cartoons back then, some better than others, but the ones I love truly mesmerized me in the same way Shiny Chariot mesmerized the young and impressionable Akko. When I was done, I wanted more. Sometime after the release of LWA, Trigger started a Kickstarter to fund a sequel. The Kickstarter was a big success, and there will be a 40-minute follow-up coming out soon. Trigger has even stated that if LWA 2 is successful, they will continue on, and I hope they do. They have created something truly wonderful, something that deserves a sequel. LWA is a work of passion, not something created by a business committee to appeal to whatever is “hot” right now, for this is something meant to be timeless. This is a setting I hope gets expanded upon, because it deserves it. For now, the first film is an exceptional introduction.";Recommended

Well, this anime really don't have a solid story, is just girls in a magic school, and it seems like is taken from Harry Potter books. The story is fine for a OVA, and I wasn't expecting much from this even.  Art (6/10) Really like the cartoon tipe animation. Was something enjoyable to the eye, and funny sometimes. But I will take some points because there is some points when the animation seems kinda bugged out.  OST (5/10) Nothing memorable, but isn't bad, and it kinda goes with this anime.  Enjoyment (8/10) I really enjoy this anime, and really laugh a lot because there are characters that are so kinda retarded that is funny.  Verdict (6/10) This anime was fine to pass the time, but it really needs a lot to be considered a 10 or 9 anime like in the other reviews.  Remembering that this is just my subjective opinion.

I heard of it before, but I was worried to watch it because it had a kid protagonist and usually, kid protagonists are bratty, overly silly, precocious and stereotypical. I thought that Akko was going to be one of the annoying characters but she actually wasn't that annoying, and she carried the story well.  Though, the characters don't bring that much new to the table. Akko is an aloof fourteen-year-old girl who has an attitude, and too childish. Don't be like ""Oh, it's for a younger audience. I don't care if it's cliched!"" I'd like something original and not just something we've seen a thousand times before.  The art was alright, and so was the decent voice acting. The art doesn't deviate too much from other anime.  Though, due to the anime being so short, it was a little confusing to watch, I think if it had more development instead of being rushed and showing a cliched ending where all the girls were flying, it would've been more enjoyable.  All in all, this is a cute story, though people over the age of 10 might find this too silly but isn't unwatchable.  Rating: 6.7";Mixed Feelings

Story While the story did may a 'special performance' for an intro which was spectacular in it's own way it was... what's the word... flat. A girl, a dream, an accomplishment. There is nothing fancy. There were just some moments that could have been expanded on to make it more entertaining. Like the silent eavesdropper who hid in the shadow makes more of a reveal. Or better yet there is a feature done that relates back to the intro for a conclusion. Because the current conclusion is about the same as the introduction. The nice lights, the stage, the dr____, hopefully you get the idea. The main difference were the seats. Although, it did have a nice little message of never giving up on your dreams.  Art Not a fan of the characters. Something about the way they were drawn seems bland. I am not saying terrible and i am not saying beautiful. Maybe it is the lack of detail? Transition were fine.  Sound- nothing to comment  Character very singular based on the main character. Not only that the main character had a rushed bio. Not a very good transitioning for timeline.

Imagine having to watch Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone condensed into the length of a half-hour TV show, that's what it's like. But it shows promise, and thankfully it gets expanded upon with an hour-long movie and an anime series (which I will definitely have to check out).

6;Little Witch Academia;saitou2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/saitou2;6;"Aside from the animation, everything else feels super amateurish.  The writing especially; the dialogue feels like it was written by someone who has watched anime and nothing else. It really feels like everyone says what they say and act the way they do because 'that's what it's like in anime'. This short reminded me of Miyazaki's issue with the current anime industry, where now, the people who are making the anime are people who grew up on anime, and so are replicating what this 'anime community' has deemed the norm, instead of trying to create something wholly original. As I said right at the beginning, the only real merit I can give to this short is the stupendously well crafted animation, and the presentation in general. Poppy, vibrant colors, both cute and cool character designs, and fun, energetic movements. I'd say give it a watch just for the sake of the presentation. It's only 26 minutes. This is a Japanese person reviewing this by the way.";Mixed Feelings
0;Little Witch Academia;Ciaran_Zagami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ciaran_Zagami;4;I mean, it looks good. Like really good.  But the characters are flat and annoying, the plot barren, the world is derivative and uninspired  I managed to stay awake through it all, somehow. But thats not really praise. It feels like a pilot for an actual show (which it basically is) but if this pilot was shown to me I can't honestly say I'd green light it.  Sure there is quite a few cute scenes and the characters clearly have some decent dynamics worked out, maybe the comedy is lost in translation.  Then again everyone else likes it so maybe I'm just a weird outlier? I really don't have a lot to say.;Not Recommended
0;Little Nemo Pilot (1987);Gay4Pay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gay4Pay;8;A lavishly animated, dazzling pilot for what I can only assume would've been Japan's answer to Disney's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, or conversely the 1939 adaptation of the Wizard of Oz. Such a movie would've been too good for this world. The great irony of the situation is the realization that such a lush movie about dreams became little more than a fantastical dream itself.  If you're reading this, I'm sure you already know that Little Nemo cost a fortune, went through years of production hell, emerged with little more than a superficial resemblance to its gorgeous pilots, and completely bombed in both America and Japan. Tokyo Movie Shinsha hasn't tried to produce anything this ambitious since, and everyone is worse off for it.;Recommended
0;Little Nemo;kokohamstar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kokohamstar;9;Flowy artwork and enjoyable storyline along with amazing characters make this movie worth watching. I watched it when I was a toddler and grew up loving it. Nemo is a boy plagued by nightmares and when the circus comes to town, he's taken off to Slumberland. There he meets the princess, King Morpheus, and many more friends that bring this adventure to a wonderful climax. If you liked Spirited away, you'll love Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland. It's based off of a 50's comic strip by the same name. Very underappreciated and underexposed, but well worth watching.;Recommended
1;Little Nemo;0keitan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/0keitan;9;Magical and exciting, this classic will keep you entertained.  After watching this movie once when I was little I immediately found myself hooked! I still watch it 10 years later! It's just so full of adventure, comedy, and sad moments. The plot, characters, scenery, && music are illustrated && played out very well. It's probably the most unique && original work of art you will ever come across next to Miyuzaki's 'Spirited Away' and 'Howl's Moving Castle'. I would recommened this to just about anyone who shares a love for imagination. This is deffinately worthy of the title 'classic'.;Recommended
2;Little Nemo;IantheSilverfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IantheSilverfire;9;"What an odd little movie. So bad, and yet such a colorful history.  You may notice I generally gave some poor scores, but highly recommend this movie. Why? It's a perfect example of why communication is important. This movie has everything it needs to be amazing. It was worked on by some true animation giants. Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame, who invented many standards of animation that are used to this day. Ray Bradbury, writer of Fahrenheit 451. Music by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a ton of music I guarantee you know! Even Hayao Miyazaki, the man the myth the legend, worked on the film for a brief time. If you look closely you can see their influences. And there are some other big names linked to this project.  So why do so many rights make a ginormous wrong?  Lack of communication.  Some are quoted as saying they asked the animators what they were working off of, ""we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing"" and when Bradbury was asked what he doing he said ""I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing""  Insert screaming melty man pop art. I highly recommend you watch this movie simply because it is such a piece of animation history with so many big names on it. You can see Chuck Jones' influence in the design of the squirrel Icarus. And some scenes, like them fancifully bouncing around the kingdom on balls while a song plays, are clearly worked on by Miyazaki. It's fun to watch and try to spot who animated what.  This is definitely a film to watch when you're in the mood for a bad movie.";Recommended
3;Little Nemo;WeeabooHunter101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WeeabooHunter101;7;So, I recently rewatched the English dub of Little Nemo on Crunchyroll. Some of the movie I remember watching as a kid, but other parts I seem to have forgotten. Story wise, tackling the idea of a repeating dream sequences can present problems, but the film seemed to mostly handle that well. The 'Oh, I'm still in a dream' notion does wear thin, but thankfully they don't dwell on that for too long. Other than that, the narrative is simple and family oriented. A good morality tale on keeping promises and finding the courage to fix mistakes. I think that this film's animation has held up reasonably well, on par with other animated features of the 80's and 90's. Not as good as Disney Renaissance, but better than Rankin & Bass. Sort of that Don Bluth film area. Slumberland and its inhabitants are whimsical and colorful, while their nightmare counterparts can be appropriately frightening to younger audiences. Perhaps too frightening for some children, so grain of salt for parents. Is there an edited version of the English dub out there? I remember the clown character Flip being a typical hobo clown (light face makeup and dark mouth makeup), not a Minstrel Show clown with all racial baggage that carries with it. Now there's a third cringe joining Jynx and Mr. Popo in the world of Japanese animation transitions to the US. The English dub has some issues. Moments of missing or awkward lip flaps, line delivery that is mismatched with the tone, and dialogue out of sync are all present at one point or other. Thankfully, this is more of an exception than rule. The music is alright, if a little flamboyant at times. For a film that went through so many hands while in development hell, it has survived to be a decent film for the family. Hope you enjoy.;Recommended
0;Little Nemo;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;5;"Overview:  Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children's movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn't re-watch this film until recently.  Background:  Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s, right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid's movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki's Nausicca, and America's Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy"" led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca.  Plot: 5/10  The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn't much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children's films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn't really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn't have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.  Characters: 3/10  The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan's favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn't dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that's...better?  Sound: 5/10  It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not.  Overall: 5/10  Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don't blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn't really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious.";Mixed Feelings
1;Little Nemo;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;5;"I actually seen this baby nearly 20 years ago when I was a kid. But due to how little I could recall of Little Nemo, I never got around to writing a proper review for it until I got a copy of the film just recently to cover.  A little known fact about this film to many folks is that Little Nemo was made as an attempted collaboration between American and Japanese animation studios planned during the early 1980s. However, differences in the creative direction of the film led to enough disputes between both sides that it took years before the film finally got a theatrical release, which shows rather prominently in how the animation and plot to this are laid out. The look and feel for both are very Western-influenced as Little Nemo looks almost like a Disney film with its character designs and scenery, while sporting fluid movements and animated sequences. For an 80s anime, Little Nemo is easily among one of the better-looking animated films I've seen from the decade, being on par with Studio Ghibli films made during the time.  In terms of its plot and characters though, Little Nemo is rather underwhelming in both departments if you're not this baby's intended target audience of younger children. The cast mostly fill simple character types related to Western animated films and the plot's rather haphazard pace limit any world-building or character exploration that could have been utilized. The plot for it also milks a number of storytelling cliches that never get explored as Nemo is the ""chosen one"" to be Slumberland's prince, a typical good vs evil conflict involving the Nightmare King in the movie's later half, a number of the Slumberland residents looking like those part of the circus troupe he encountered at the start of the film and an attempt at incorporating some sort of moral related to Nemo's adventure. Pretty much, the film's intent is to keep its plot and characters as simple as possible for its target audience while anyone older may keep wondering why certain stuff to it is never explored.  Little Nemo also has its sloppy points in its writing. The later third of the movie features a couple points where Nemo is in some sort of hostile situation, yet he ""wakes up"" away from it only to discover he is still dreaming. The ""wake up"" bits function as a sort of deus ex machina to get Nemo out of trouble and seemed rather lazy in execution. The film's attempt at a moral is also rather questionable as it tries connecting a rather mundane incident that Nemo is involved with at the start of the film to later events in it when Nemo unintentionally triggers the threat of the Nightmare King for the film's second half. However, the events leading up to the moral being utilized are rather idiotic as a certain character was dumb enough to entrust the safety of his entire kingdom to Nemo (and not warning him of the danger in question) and our lead gets rather easily duped into triggering said events.  Overall, Little Nemo is mostly fare for younger children as its plot and characters are way too simple to appeal to older audiences in the same vain that many Studio Ghibli films are. I might have been in awe of the movie as a kid. But being older, it really loses its appeal when you begin to question the ""whys"" to it.";Mixed Feelings
2;Little Nemo;RobdeFR;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RobdeFR;6;I first read about Little Nemo comic strips in a comic journal that I used to buy before it went bankrupt. I read there that the Little Nemo comic strips in the beginning of the twentieth century went to be highly influential with most comic authors that came afterwards, Disney being one of those.  Little Nemo does have something American and occidental in it, but it is an entirely Japanese production, but it certainly doesn’t seems like that, it sure looks more like a Disney or other occidental production. The character designs, as well as everything else in the animation, backgrounds, story, screams Disney. Some trivia regarding the pre-production of this movie is that Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata were to pick this in the beginning, unfortunately they never got to work on it, I wonder how it would have turned if they remained in charge here.  Here's a brief description on the story. The story starts with a boy named Nemo and his weasel friend. Somehow Nemo is chosen to be the sole heir of Slumberland, so Little Nemo goes from his home back in NY to Slumberland without thinking twice. He is to learn on how to be a prince and everything that involves being a prince. But the king only asks Nemo to promise him one thing, the King gives Nemo the master key that opens every door in the castle to little Nemo and only makes him promise not to open the door which has the same symbol as the key, the forbidden door. While roaming through the castle, Nemo gets to know a little weird and malicious character, which incites him to run away from his lessons on how being a prince and later while escaping the guards in their fun, incites Nemo to open the forbidden door they that they had found… The rest, you can easily guess asthe story develops in a rather simplistic way.  The story was done thinking on an younger audience and it does have a simple story very easy to get without major plot turns for a easy understanding. But the good animation makes it for the simplicity of the story, even I get the feeling that I would like to watch this at a tender age.  While being a Japanese movie and being often referenced to Ghibli lovers, Little Nemo is by far a innocent view without any conscious and adult meaning in it. Ghibli recommendations, would probably be Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro for their both innocence.  Unfortunately, the file that I got was a dubbed old file, so my enjoyment could have been greater. The English voices sounded too much higher than the other background sounds and the usual music. But still I could notice that they were good voices and did fit each character well. It's a pity that I didn't get to hear the background music in all it's glory, I'll wait for a proper DVD release in the future.  Rate: 6/10 - A nice movie, but not really necessary to most folks. Only recommended if you're really into childrens animated movies.;Mixed Feelings
3;Little Nemo;GarlandReese;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GarlandReese;5;"""Little Nemo"" is one of those movies where the backstory on it's creation is more famous (and probably more entertaining) than the movie itself. With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it's not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be.  To start with the animation itself, it's actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It's smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...  I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best.  This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie.

4;Little Nemo;EggheadLuna;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EggheadLuna;6;"Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland is like a flash fusion between Disney's Fantasia, Peter Pan, and Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal. Many people watched this during their childhood, but I did not. I watched it for the first time a few weeks ago, and am completely fresh to the material. And boy, is it a gorgeous film, the landscape design, the animation, the score! The visuals are very pulchritudinous, but do the characters and story live up to this elusively complex, visual spectacle? Let's find out!  ⚠️ This review for Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland will have spoilers ⚠️  —Story/Characters  The story incorporates elements of both storybook dreamlands and Greek mythology. Probably the weakest link of the story is how transparent the plot is, as soon as King Morpheus gave Nemo the key, there was a voice in my head that screamed, ""That little boy is going to mess everything up, isn't he?"" The iteration of Morpheus in Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland resembles the description of the god in Ovid's Metamorphoses, with his ability to manifest into a human form, rather than simply being a formless entity. From his first appearance, to the irresponsibility he displays at the gala (after Nemo and Flip unleash the wrath of The Nightmare King), the mighty ruler is simply written off as an old oaf.  I give Little Nemo the same benefit of the doubt as I give other children's films, but it does seem odd that a king, the ruler of all sleep and dreams, would entrust a little boy with the power of an entire dimension and leave him alone with his only daughter, Princess Camille, after barely knowing him. It's similar to openness of Mufasa's trust towards the insidious Scar in The Lion King, except Scar was actually Mufasa's brother and not some random kid from another world. Nemo's decision-making was similar to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter—the protagonist makes the worst decisions imaginable, as a device to progress the plot forward.  Princess Camille exists to put the buffoonish men in their place, but her stubbornness alone isn't enough to prevent Slumberland from being plunged into darkness. The adorable sugar glider, Icarus, is often proven to have more sense than his human owner. I would say the crux of the film is a) not many of the characters are able to employ logic, and b) some scenes seem to drag on too long towards the end.  —Technical  Luna's Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅  Masami Hata (director), notable works: * Aesop's World * Anime TV de Hakken! Tamagotchi * Chirin no Suzu ✅ * DT Eightron * Elmer no Boken: My Father's Dragon * Go! Ina Junior High Ping-Pong Club * Nayuta ✅ * Mouse Story: The Adventures of George and Gerald * The Sea Prince and the Fire Child * Stitch! * Super Mario Brothers: Peach-hime Kyūshutsu Dai Sakusen * The Tale of Osamu Tezuka: I'm Son Goku * Yōsei Florence  Commentary: Apparently, Hayao Miyazaki was working on this film, alongside Mr. Hata, but left mid-way through the production. It makes you wonder how different Little Nemo could have been, if he had stayed on! The main issues with the directing was the pacing. I have had similar issues with Mr. Hata's other films, The Sea Prince and the Fire Child and Nayuta specifically struggled in this regard, Chirin no Suzu didn't struggle with pacing as much because it was a very short film.  Mœbius (character designs), notable works: As Jean Giraud * Blueberry * La Jeunesse de Blueberry * Jim Cutlass * Marshal Blueberry * XIII As Mœbius * Arzach * The Airtight Garage * The Incal * Les Maîtres du temps * Le Monde d'Edena * Silver Surfer * Après l'Incal * Icare * The Halo Graphic Novel  Commentary: The original comics for Little Nemo, known as Little Nemo in Slumberland by Winsor McCay, are polychromatic and surreal. The choice to hire Mœbius as the designer of the project was perfect, because his comics have the same kind of perspective, detail, and richness put into their panels! Mœbius is one of the most prolific artists out there. Dragon's Heaven (an anime and manga, originally created by the mangaka, Makoto Kobayashi) has a similar ambience to his Mr. Giraud's bibliography, it's clear that the creator of the OVA was heavily influenced by his art.  I watched Little Nemo with the English dub, so I will list the Japanese seiyū, but comments will be on the performances of the English voice actors.  Takuma Gōno as Nemo, notable roles: * Badrinath Harchand, Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor * Yūjirou Ishida, Yawara!  Gabriel Damon as Nemo, notable roles: * R.H. Sarnac, Call to Glory * Bobby Mynes, Amazing Stories * Lyle, Punky Brewster * Timmy Frankel, Diff'rent Strokes * Simon Flynn, Riptide * Roger Hatton, One Big Family * Mark, Webster * Joel Forbes, Convicted * Tommy, Our House * Mati, Terminus * Little Cornelius, Who's the Boss? * Willie, Journey to Spirit Island * Cody McKussic, Tequila Sunrise * Littlefoot, The Land Before Time ✅ * Tod, Baywatch * Jeremy Aster, Star Trek: The Next Generation * Kenny, Growing Pains * Hob, RoboCop 2 * Tommy, ER  Commentary: I really liked Mr. Damon's role as Littlefoot in The Land Before Time, he is able to convey the same innocence and defiance in that character as he did with young Nemo! Great work!  Kenji Utsumi as King Morpheus, notable roles: * Senbei Norimaki, Dr. Slump * Shen Long, Dragon Ball ✅ * Alex Louise Armstrong, Fullmetal Alchemist ✅ * Yoisho, Gamba no Bōken * Kenji Kamogawa, Hajime no Ippo * Raō, Hokuto no Ken ✅ * Zodd Nosferatu, Berserk ✅ * Braiking Boss, Shinzō Ningen Casshern ✅ ￼ Bernard Erhard as King Morpheus, notable roles: * Munkar, Deathstalker * Cy-Kill, GoBots: Battle of the Rock Lords * Wolf, Rover Dangerfield  Commentary: I have never seen anything that Mr. Erhard has done previously, but his voice was suited for King Morpheus. He has a very booming and jolly voice. I could kind of imagine his voice actor doing a performance as Santa Claus!  Hiroko Kasahara as Princess Camille, notable roles: * Naomi Armitage, Armitage III ✅ * Maron Namikaze, Assemble Insert * Seara Arisugawa, Baby☆Love * Ami Kurimoto, DNA²  * Katue Pearson, Ginga Hyōryū Vifam * Ishtar, Macross II: Lovers Again ✅ * Fū Hōōji, Magic Knight Rayearth ✅ * Mint, Mahō no Angel Sweet Mint * Newtar, Master of Epic: The Animation Age * Ryo Narahara, Megazone 23 * Yukina Kurimoto, Seraphim Call * Saori Fujimura, Tanjō: Debut  Laura Mooney as Princess Camille, notable roles: * None  Commentary: Ms. Mooney hasn't had any other notable roles, but she did a magnificent job at conveying Princess Camille's sass!  Chikao Otsuka as Flip, notable roles: * Piemon and Apocalymon, Digimon Adventure ✅ * Tao Pai Pai, Dragonball * Goemon Ishikawa XIII, Lupin III ✅ * Professor Moriarty, Meitantei Holmes ✅ * Boshu, Legendary Gambler Tetsuya * Ivo Robotnik, Sonic X ✅ * Tora, Ushio to Tora  Mickey Rooney as Flip, notable roles: * Harvey, Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva * Gus, Night at the Museum * Santa, The Happy Elf * Sparkey, Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure * Fugly Floom, Babe: Pig in the City ✅ * Archibald, Time Bandits * Adult Tod, The Fox and the Hound ✅ * Santa Claus, Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July * Lampie, Pete's Dragon * Santa Claus, The Year Without Santa Claus * Scarecrow, Journey Back to Oz  Commentary: I knew of Mickey Rooney before watching this film. I mean, how could you not. He's one of the biggest, classically celebrated, Hollywood names! Disney's The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite films of all time, his voice as the grown-up Tod was really compelling and heart-breaking. His role in this film is not like that, at all. Flip is the sleaziest grifter out there and his greasy behavior leads Nemo astray. His character reminded me of the ""talent recruiters"" in Disney's Pinnochio!  Kōichi Kitamura as Professor Genius, notable roles: * Murao Mima, Key the Metal Idol  René Auberjonois as Professor Genius, notable roles: * Father John Patrick ""Dago Red"" Mulcahy, M*A*S*H * Roy Bagley, King Kong (1976) * Colonel West, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country * Dr. Burton, Batman Forever  Commentary: I don't remember any of Mr. Auberjonois characters in his other films, I have seen Batman Forever and miscellaneous episodes of M*A*S*H on TV, but I don't remember him. He plays his role very well. The English cast for this film seems to have been carefully curated, to fit each role. It's impressive!  Tarō Ishida as The Nightmare King, notable roles: * Shikishima, Akira ✅ * Tenkai, Kamui no Ken * Lazare d' Cagliostro, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro ✅  William E. Martin as The Nightmare King, notable roles: * Broadside, The Transformers * Claw, Karate Kommandos * Samhain, The Real Ghostbusters * Shredder, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ✅  Commentary: I think that it's amazing that The Nightmare King is Shredder from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! Mr. Martin makes The Nightmare King very menacing, it reminded me of the Night on Bald Mountain segment in Disney's Fantasia!  To wrap this review up, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland is a phenomenal achievement in animation. I've never seen anything else quite like it. It seems to be a love letter to many of the other, foundational children's stories! The characters and story could have been stronger, but I still rate it a 6/10 and plan on purchasing the Blu-ray!

0;Little Nemo;Fear_the_Reefer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fear_the_Reefer;3;"Can we all just agree that dreams are fucking weird? They’re one of the least understood aspects of human life, and everybody but Mike Pence has them. Their are tons of theories about what their purpose is, what they mean, and why we’re always naked in them, but to this day, nobody can pinpoint what these bizarre movies we get to watch while we’re recharging even are. Sometimes they have purpose... Back when I was in a bad relationship where I felt trapped and with no control over my life, I’d constantly dream that I was stuck on a labyrinthian waterslide that I couldn’t escape from. But they can be completely nonsensical, too. Maybe you’re fighting in a war with flamethrowers, but they suddenly turn into waterguns. Maybe you’re running from a spider that can fit through any crack. Maybe you’re beating up pedophiles, taunting serial killers, throwing horses at witches, fighting demons in the wild west, meeting people you don’t see anymore, running from a golden car like it’s a metaphor for Satan, or hell, maybe you get into a car crash but wind up in your living room, with your family ominously telling you “It’s waiting.”  For little Nemo, dreams aren’t quite like that. Every single one of his dreams is a lucid one, and he can use them to escape to big fantastical worlds, all by riding on his bed like it’s a magic carpet. One day, after seeing a parade and wanting desperately to go to the circus, Nemo drifts off and is invited to the world of Slumberland, a country governed by a kind, jovial king and his prickly little daughter, and inhabited by a whole host of wild and zany characters. Nemo is declared the King’s heir, and entrusted with protecting it from harm, but it isn’t long at all before one of these inhabitants, a chain-smoking green minstrel named Flip, tempts him into letting Slumberland get taken over by a terrifying sea of darkness, which leaves it in shambles and takes the King away to a faraway land. With the order of a whole world now at stake, there is only one chance at saving it... Joined by Flip, the princess, a wacky professor and his talking squirrel sidekick, Nemo must brave the horrors of Nightmareland to make everything right again!  If I were to show you Little Nemo directly, there are two reactions I expect from you almost immediately. The first would be disbelief at the fact that Nemo’s not a clownfish(although his world is populated by Clowns), and incredulity at the fact that it really doesn’t look like an anime. It is, I assure you... It was produced by Japan and released in Japan three years before it was released in the States, although I’d say roughly a quarter of the people credited to making it are american, including both of the screenwriters. The production was a mess of almost legendary proportions, with huge names from both sides of the ocean coming into the project and then leaving it just as quickly, leaving influence behind but rarely ever any guidance on how to implement it. Even Hayao Miyazaki himself was attached at one point, which is probably why the movie opens with a sequence of Nemo flying through the city on his bed. It was ultimately produced by TMS, a company that made Akira and animated several american cartoons.  And speaking of american cartoons, that’s exactly what this movie was based on. Little Nemo was originally a newspaper comic that ran in the early 1900’s, which doesn’t sound like something an anime would ever be based on, and yet lo and behold, that’s what we have here. Visually, this is exactly what I’d think of if I was told that an anime was being designed to look like an American product. First of all, being that this WAS a product of TMS, the animation budget was high, so there’s a lot of fluid animation and graceful character movement, sometimes almost to a fault. It is very lively, and it makes the movie feel really energetic, but there’s also a certain feeling of over-indulgence to it, like what the Nostalgia Critic might call movement porn. It never stops moving, which can almost feel exhausting at points. It’s one of those cases where something was new at the time, and had never really been attempted to such a degree, so of course it was impressive at the time for what it achieved, but looking back, it could have been done better.  For example, there’s a scene where the cast engages in a dance at the palace, and Professor Genius starts doing a weird dance(I’d be surprised if The Duke of Wesselton wasn’t at least partially inspired by this), and then the king joins in, and for this strangely surreal moment, it looks like the two are moving in synch, probably through some sort of rotoscoping, despite being at least a foot apart in height. It’s a really creepy bit of Uncanny valley. Oh, and speaking of uncanny valley, there’s also the facial animations, which I actually kind of had trouble watching. Characters were so far removed from your typical anime style that it honestly looks like something Chuck Jones would have animated while shit-face drunk, and this is reflected in the character designs. Most of the characters look all right, if a bit generic, but the animation doesn’t always work in their favor. Princess Camille, for example? Whenever she lets her shoulders slump, she looks more arrow than human. She looks like the love child of Bob Belcher and Marzipan from the Homestarrunner cartoons. At least the demons look cool, I guess.  When it comes to the music, I was actually kind of expecting the American and Japanese releases to have different soundtracks, but surprisingly, they don’t. Even though this movie was originally released in Japan, the OST was comprised of English language songs. On Wikipedia, the music is credited to a few American sounding names, including the Sherman Brothers, who are absolute legends in the field of family film musical scores. The film’s main theme, which is simply named Little Nemo after the Japanese title of the movie, is beautiful. I love it. It works great in the film, carrying the kind of epic whimsy that can only be found in nineties children’s movies, and it’s just as strong when listened to on it’s own. Melissa Manchester has an amazing voice, which I really shouldn’t have to tell anyone who’s familiar with her work, and it’s a testament to her strength as an artist that she can carry the Sherman Brothers occasionally awkward and flowery lyrics without ever sounding hokey or condescending.  Unfortunately, this mark of inspiration doesn’t really carry over to the rest of the soundtrack, which sounds about as standard for a generic children’s movie soundtrack that you can get, with some of the songs being directly attached to scenes that were clearly added to the film just to pad out the run time. This is no more clear than with the song Etiquette, which I think was supposed to be funny, but just winds up coming off as annoying. Melissa Manchester is nowhere to be found on this track, but she might not have been able to save it anyway, because she wasn’t able to carry her majesty from Little Nemo over to the song Slumberland, which is just kind of boring over-all. Songs like Fun and Laughter, The Boomps Song and Princess of Slumberland are safe, saccharine and forgettable, which is sadly par for the course with this soundtrack. The instrumental tracks are okay, but they’re not the kind of thing that could ever set the world on fire, and there’s nothing about them that really justifies going out of your way to find them.  The English dub is... Well, it’s also okay. There are a ton of really popular names credited to this film, including a pre-Simpsons Nancy Cartwright and a post-Vampire Hunter D Michael McConnohie. Actually, there area ton of voice actors attached to this project whose resumes would surprise you, as even beyond famous names like Tress Macneille, Jennifer Darling, Sherry Lynn and the late June Foray, there are names that may have flown under your radar like René Auberjonois and Gabriel Damon, and I’m sad to say this, almost none of them brought their A-game to this project. There are a few exceptions, like Laura Mooney in the role of the Princess, who was the only cast member who CLEARLY wasn’t trying; Bernard Erhard, who put his heart and soul into making King Morpheus the most likeable guy in the world, and strangely enough Mickey Rooney, who was obviously having a blast playing the mischievous and duplicitous Flip. It’s not a great dub, but it’s passable enough, which is good, because western releases don’t include a Japanese language sub track.  So, here’s an interesting little bit of trivia for you guys: this was the first anime I ever watched. It predates my experiences with Pokemon and Dragonball by nearly a decade, even. When I was little, like really little, my Dad would often rent movies on VHS and bring them home for my brother and me to watch. He’d go to the grocery store... Wegmans, in my area... Rent somne random movie with a G rating and bring it home for us. For those of you who are confused by those last two sentences, ask your parents. He’d bring home Disney movies, Don Bluth movies, straight-to-video shitfests(I saw Once Upon a Forest at least three times), and on one occasion, Little Nemo. Now, as a kid, I didn’t have the greatest attention span, but I always found myself getting absorbed in stories. I watched movies mostly attentively, and shamed people who didn’t(To this day, I get really annoyed by people who play on their phones during a movie), and as soon as I learned to read, I could go hours without putting a book or comic down.  There are some exceptions to this rule, however, and Little Nemo is one of them. My memory’s not great, but I’m pretty sure I only saw it once, and didn’t really pay attention to it. Even only a year later, all I could remember about it was the Princess Camille stuff, because even Little Naru loved him some princesses. I only really wound up thinking about it a few tiomes in the years that followed, like one time when I was reading up on the history of newspaper comics, or when Finding Nemo came out, or when I found out it was an anime, or when The Nostalgia Critic and The Mysterious Mr. Enter did some really good videos on it, ... But I never really started thinking about it seriously until I started reviewing anime, and I knew I’d have to hit it again eventually. Well, almost five years in, that time has finally come. I bought the movie online, let it sit on my coffee table for a few months(don’t judge me) and finally, I popped it in and watched it for the first time in over twenty years, and let me tell you, there’s a reason it bored me as a kid.  There’s a lot to unpack here, so to stay focused, I’m not going to go too far into any of the behind the scenes stuff. Production of this film was famously a nightmare, it’s apparently one of Hayao Miyazaki’s worst professional experiences, it was a huge bomb when it was released, and the production company, TMS, who were riding high after the success of Akira at the time, were so badly damaged by it that they haven’t been the same since. I don’t personally know any more about any of this than I’ve been told, I haven’t exactly done any research into it’s history... That’s not really the kind of thing I do here... But it’s lack of success isn’t really a surprise to me, and if you’ve ever seen it yourself, it doesn’t take a lot of run time to pick up on the fact that it was never going to be anybody’s favorite film for any reason but childhood nostalgia. The only thing I can really talk about here is my personal experience watching the movie, and if it helps, my thoughts as to why it flopped as hard as it did.  First of all, the main character... The titular Nemo... Is a special kind of bland. He has no personality to speak of, he has no interests or goals outside of visiting the circus and doing whatever the plot tells him to do, and if I had to guess, his companion, a little sentient flying squirrel with flight goggles on his head, was added to the story to make him more interesting in the new medium(it didn’t work. also, how weird is it that they had June Foray in the cast, the voice of rocky, but she didn’t play his arguable rip-off?)). He just goes with the flow while spouting off lazy little boy one-liners like Yippee! Gee Whiz! and Wowwee! He doesn’t even immediately grasp that a princess is a girl, a conversation which... to be fair... Was even dumber in the NES game. The worst thing about him isn’t how boring or bland he is, however... It’s how little agency he has in the story. for the bulk of the movie, he’s just following orders, going along with whatever the other characters want him to do, and when Flip pressures him to go back on some of these orders, he folds like origami.  The first real choice he makes is to try and undo that mistake... about twenty minutes after making it. He gains some agency in the third act, where he’s leading the charge to the Nightmare castle to rescue everybody, but even then, it’s hard to get invested because you never feel that he has any connection to any of it. He’s only known any of these people for less than a day, the whole world is just shallow eye candy with nothing substantial to offer, and I’m sorry, but a king who’s willing to hand a key to what’s basically the doors of hell to a child he just met fifteen minutes ago was asking for his kingdom to get taken over. In stories like these, the hero has to have a personal reason to save the world he’s wandered into, but with Nemo, he just feels like our excuse to explore a bunch of Candyland backgrounds in a barely story-driven animation demo, and the moments of actual story feel either distractingly stupid or gratingly annoying. When Nemo is being tossed around by spastic tutors trying to educate him on proper behavior, I wouldn’t care if he woke up, got up to use the bathroom, and then went back to bed and dreamed about running from monster tornadoes. I’d be just as engaged.  But perhaps the biggest problem is that we KNOW he’s just having a dream, and that there’s no more to it than that. Right in the beginning of the movie, we see most of the characters from Slumberland walking down the street in a parade, which is how he came to dream about them. That’s it. They’re not real. None of this is real. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if the dream-like aspects were the whole point, and it was just supposed to be a trippy experiences, but there’s a story and plot involved, and there’s almost no urgency behind any of it. If he fails, nothing is lost. If he succeeds, nothing is gained. There’s no interesting subtext, no metaphor to speak of, no commentary, just the classic artwork and imagination of Windsor McKay being shown off in a story that doesn’t do any of it justice. I mean, the only thing that does any work moving the plot forward is the character of Flip, but his motivation in the story is so completely bankrupt that he almost feels like the personification of the audience screaming “Get on with it!”  It doesn’t even manage to be dream-like. Like I said before, dreams are weird. They don’t have plots, they don’t contain full stories. Little Nemo is too conventional of a story to even grasp the surrealism that any good dream-based narrative should, at the very least, be able to pull off. Remember in Nichijou, when characters are put in bizarre situations like having to eat noodles off of a shoot before they hit the ground? Or having to buy a snowman off of the shelf before it melts, and they do so with actual sincerity, like they believe these tasks to be important? That’s how dreams work. Remember Alice in Wonderland, or the old Nightmare Ned computer game? That’s how dreams work. Okay, the Nightmare Ned TV series had consistent stories, but at least they had the benefit of being smart and well written. You wanna show me a dream with a solid narrative? Make a movie where someone has to deal with a cult of people who brainwash each other into mutilating the bone structure of their faces, or getting stuck in a pizza place that’s a metaphor for purgatory.  The actual story is bad enough, but there’s almost no creativity to the visuals, and while I get that the whole movie is based on a preexisting work, and they had established content to work with, but that shouldn’t have limited them so harshly. It’s an adaptation, but the concept surrounding it was just ripe for updates. They could have unleashed their imaginations upon the world, using McKay’s imagination as a pretty solid foundation for interpretation, but everything just feels so lazy and uninspired. The Slumberland sets basically went from Candyland to the ocean to a dark and dreary underworld, and a King of nightmares(or something) who just looked like Chernabog on a juice cleanse. That’s the best you got? Give me a demonic three headed goat or something(can you tell I crowd-sourced some weird dream ideas for this review?)! I haven’t been this disappointed since the villain in Insidious turned out to be Darth Maul’s edge-lord little cousin! There are so many ways this movie could have been great, but sadly, they didn’t take any of them.  Little Nemo, which has the additional subtitle of Adventures of Slumberland over here, is way out of print, but the Easternstar DVD is still really easy to find online for cheap. The original comic is also easy to find online, but it ain’t cheap, and the books they’re contained in tend to be gigantic, and can be a pain to display because of it. The entire Little Nemo franchise is in the public domain, so if you want to use it for yourself, you can do so without issue.  When I reviewed Spirited Away, I went into detail on my revised feelings towards children’s media, and that a movie doesn’t necessarily have to be critically good for kids to watch it. The only exception is when a movie teaches a bad message or could potentially provide a negative influence, and there’s nothing like that in Little Nemo, so do I recommend showing it to your kids? I guess so, but I can’t honestly see them asking to see it. It’s a fairly obscure movie, and if it didn’t develop a huge cult following after getting put out on DVD early this decade, then I doubt it’ll happen anytime soon. If you have fond childhood memories of it and want to show it to your kids for that reason, go ahead, but there’s no guarantee they’ll like it. I certainly didn’t. That aside, it’s a pretty firmly forgotten movie, and while I’d love to see someone else take a shot at adapting McKay’s opus... come on Disney, this shit has your name all over it... This is one nostalgic movie you can leave right in your memories where it belongs. I give Little Nemo a 3/10.";Not Recommended
0;Little Monica Monogatari;andrew7878;https://myanimelist.net/profile/andrew7878;8;This hentai would be good for Beginners, and for guys who don't like shockingly weird moments in their hentai.  GOOD MOST adorable girls ever!!! They are so cute!! So cute!!! If Google the most adorable puppies ever it will give you the pretty much the same feeling.  The cat girl takes charge of her man, and is the highlight of the show.  There was a really good moment where the main character had sex on stage.  BAD The story keeps the show moving but that's really all it does.  I can understand cat girl doing her thing, but for all the other girls all the main character had to do was show up and they where jumping all over him.  My wife said the main character needs to be more handsome and that the visuals of him could have been better.;Recommended

The plot stayed on soft core. No blood and gore. Just a nice romantic/comedy/harem.  I was unfortunately faced with some questions like how is it the evil person came to be? Was what was lost a god?  If possible i would recommend removing the subtitles if you can understand the audio for they eng subs did not match up 100 percent to the audio.

2;Little Monica Monogatari;Hitman26x;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hitman26x;7;I liked this hentai for a variety of reasons. One, it was one of the first uncensored hentai I ever watched and man did I enjoy that. Let's get into the review part thingy. (This is my first Hentai Review). This anime's artwork is decent and adorable. So very cute! Loli's everywhere. If you don't like loli's avoid this hentai as all of the heroines ARE lolis as previous reviews said. The plot is decent for a hentai actually, but who ever watched hentai for the plot? Music is average, we have your typical moaning and groaning. Animation is standard and smooth. I enjoyed this because, it was uncensored, had lolis, had a cat girl (YIP YIP HURRAY), and was just faptastic. You should give it a shot if you like lolis, uncensored hentai, or just kemonimini's!;Recommended
3;Little Monica Monogatari;GonzoLewd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GonzoLewd;7;We all have that hentai that we repeatedly watched when we were at that young age, where we explored the internet and discovered that glorious pornographic medium. After years of watching clips of hentai from Newgrounds porn games, the one that I remembered watching all the way through and had a title to the hentai was The Story of Little Monica or Little Monica Monogatari. I watched it the entire way through without skipping to the sex scenes. I was young at that time. I didn’t know better until now.  That isn’t to say the story is terrible. I could name hundreds more that have worse plots, not counting ones that barely have plots. It’s very bare-bones, involving a guy who comes back to a city that has succumbed to degeneracy and girls he hasn’t seen in years wanting to jump his bones. There is nothing too quirky or exciting to enhance the tone to help the sex scenes out, so it fails.  Whenever this hentai gets brought up in certain circles, the one thing that comes to mind is the character Meow. Why? I have no clue. Besides the fact that she is a cute neko girl and everyone loves to see a catgirl getting dicked or sucking a guy off in hentai. Maybe it’s because she has a way more exciting presence than the other girls combined. She has a sly personality on top of a cute slutty one whenever she and Will have sex. It is charming to look at and is the best sex scene out of all the rest.  I should also note that this hentai introduced me to loli. Being a ten-year-old at the time, I guess you could say it was the perfect age to be introduced to it to where it didn’t feel weird to watch it. While Meow is the best girl out of the rest, I won’t say the rest of the girls aren’t bad. They are adorable too, and their sex scenes are good in their vanilla way. The only issue is that the main girl, Celia, only gets one sex scene, and it doesn’t last as long as the others. I would have loved an orgy with all the girls, but that might be asking too much.  As far as hentai from the early 2000s goes, this is one of the better-looking ones. It still has the problem a lot of hentai of this era have where the penis looks like just one giant brown rod with no bother to draw the head of the dick or any veins. Due to censorship of private parts in hentai, I know they never bother to add much detail. But, to me, you have at least shown some effort on the off chance that it gets dubbed overseas and they uncensor it. Other than that problem, the girls look incredibly cute and sexy like you would want out of loli hentai.  Little Monica is the perfect hentai to recommend to someone who has never watched hentai before. Something that is entirely vanilla, no rape, no torture, etc. There is the issue of loli, but if you can get over that, this is a good one to watch. I would not put it up there in the top tier of hentai, but it is perfectly serviceable. And sometimes, that is all you would want of it.  Grade: B;Recommended
0;Little Monica Monogatari;Rendhart;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rendhart;5;do you like pettanko ? or maybe Loli ?  then you might like this anime, because all of the heroine in this anime are loli character. there are around 3 or maybe more heroine that do hentai scene here.

I like loli especially those who doesn't have oversized oppai. but I just don't like how they draw this anime,.. they don't maximized the camera effect on the picture that they use. it just like you over zoom in an video it's a horrible experience for me but I think it's okay since I'm be able to see kawaii loli here.

0;Little Monica Monogatari;TrashDax;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TrashDax;3;Doesn’t everybody know this problem? You’re just trying to save the town, but somehow you’re constantly forced to fuck. Life is unfair.  Excuse for Porn (Story): The once blooming city of Little Monica is under control of the evil Kajo, who banned music and randomly strips girls. But who cares about that, what about the fucking? Within the hour of the two episodes we get 5½ sex scenes, which is an okay average. I personally prefer some story with my porn, because, as a wise man once said “when I care more about the characters, I care more about the fuckin”. Episode one does this a little better in my opinion, as the second one takes quite a while till we get to the action. The reason why every girl wants to hump the protagonist is…erm…well, they just want to fuck him. That’s a little weak, but it’s lampshaded, so it’s not that bad. 5/10  Can I fap to this? (Art): The variety is lacking sadly, as all the girls that get screwed basically have the same body. They are more or less lolis with tits, which is kinda cool, but gets old really fast. Really the only thing that differs is their tan, which is not enough to make me want to see multiple girls naked. I also hated the nausea-inducing cuts and camera work in the second episode, that was completely unnecessary. One big plus of Little Monica is that it’s uncensored, though the genitals aren’t that breathtaking to look at. 4/10  Oh god, where are my headphones? (Sound): There is absolutely nothing of notice here. The girls are high-pitched as always so your parents and neighbours will think you watch child porn. The music is rather mediocre and the ending song…well, the less said about it, the better. 2/10  Victims of the D (Characters): It would be fair to say that the characters are extremely shallow. Celia is probably supposed to be a tsundere, though I’m not sure. Mei and Tina have the exact same character, they are the clueless children who are for unknown reasons interested in sex (like most token lolis in hentai). Meow is just there to get fucked and our protagonist Will does not have much of a motive either. There is literally nobody interesting in this show. 1/10  Taking Responsibility (Enjoyment): There is no reason to watch this hentai in total, it provides nothing that you can’t get anywhere else. Watch the sex scenes with Meow if you want (cause she is pretty hot) and skip all the rest. Neither the plot nor the porn will really hook you. And you just want to rub your salami anyway. It is not a total disaster, but certainly a waste of time. 4/10  Overall: 3.2/10;Not Recommended

0;Little Busters! Refrain;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;9;"It is rare to find a sequel as emotionally powerful as Little Busters: Refrain. Where the first season blundered with its melodrama, Refrain instead provides a much more thoughtful and meaningful story. If you have developed any sort of attachment to the characters in Little Busters, you will undoubtedly shed at least a few tears by the end of Refrain. It is the second best Key anime to date.  As somebody who regards the Little Busters visual novel as one of the most emotional stories they have ever experienced, I was sceptical hearing about an anime adaptation of Refrain. Did it turn out to be some dreadful abomination in the end? I don't believe so, but the visual novel is still undeniably the superior experience. Large sections of story (including half of Rin's route) are skimmed over or ignored entirely in the anime. Other important scenes, such as Masato's backstory, are misrepresented as something silly when they should be serious. There are so many things that could have, should have been better, and yet it still manages to be one of 2013's best anime. Perhaps that is a testament to how strong the characters are.  For anime-only viewers, Little Busters: Refrain is certainly no featherweight. The story directly follows the events of the first season by developing characters who were largely overlooked in the past. Perhaps you found Rin adorable or Kyousuke amusing, but Refrain succeeds in elevating the main five much higher than that. It is one of very few anime where the relationships between the characters feel genuine rather than forced or manufactured. As a series rooted in the theme of friendship, Refrain does a magnificent job of making the viewer feel like they are a part of the story rather than merely spectators. That is no easy feat in a visual medium.  Little Busters does not rely on fanservice and other cheap tricks to hold your interest. Surely, there is an ever-present feeling of 'moe' among the girls (isn't Rin just the cutest thing?) but it is never used as a crutch for characterisation. Even Komari, arguably the weakest character in the first season, is given a considerable amount of depth through her relationship with Rin. Refrain goes further than giving more-- it makes us care. It does not find complacency in characterisation without meaning.  What about Kengo and Masato, then? There was never much depth to them in the first season, amusing as they were. Masato in particular seemed to exist solely as comedy relief, like a more idiotic version of Clannad's Sunohara. That is no longer the case with Refrain. An entire episode focusses on Masato's backstory: why he is obsessed with the idea of strength, why he acts like an incessant moron in front of others, and how he became friends with Kyousuke and Kengo. The only issue is that the anime portrays these scenes as something silly (zombie eyes and battle music blasting in the background) when it is meant to be emotional. I'm not so sure the anime-only viewers will appreciate his characterisation as much as they could, which is a shame, as all the characters enrich the story in a pretty significant way.  Kyousuke's characterisation is where the writing truly shines. While his presence as a leader is often taken for granted in the first season, Refrain shows there is a far deeper reason for why everyone respects him so much. It is more than mere charisma. He cares about his friends more than anyone else and will go to any lengths to protect them from harm. Even if it requires him to play the role of a villain. And often he does. It is easy to be frustrated or even infuriated by Kyousuke's actions, but once all the pieces start clicking together at the end, you can't help but respect the poor guy. He's a deeply flawed person, and that's the way it should be. He is not perfect and makes mistakes like anybody else. Rarely do we find a character as genuine as Kyousuke.  While the handling of Rin's route is disappointing, Rin manages to stand right beside Kyousuke by the end of the story. The second-to-last episode focussing on Rin is so touching, so masterfully directed that it genuinely surpasses the visual novel. I do not say that lightly. Unlike many other Key stories (and even anime in general), there is no melodrama. The entire series has been building towards a very specific point. Once Rin starts crying into Komari's arms, it is nearly impossible to resist choking up a bit. It's similar to the ending of K-ON's second season in many respects... although I might argue that Refrain does it better.  And that is to speak nothing of how powerful Kyousuke's episode is. Or the lyrical significance behind the insert song ""Haruka Kanata"". Or all the subtle details hidden in the first season, or even how it gives meaning to all the alleged dei ex machina within Kud's and Mio's routes. Little Busters is Jun Maeda's masterpiece, and while not everybody may appreciate his style of storytelling, there is almost nothing to criticise about his work on Little Busters. Even if the anime only captured a tiny fraction of the visual novel's charm, I still believe it would be a satisfying experience. J.C. Staff's adaptation isn't fully there-- but it comes close.  ""Comes close"". I wish it could have been on par with the visual novel, but that is regrettably not the case. The amount of scenes (and important ones, no less) that are skipped over is truly disappointing. All J.C. Staff needed to do was simply tone down on the foreshadowing (which can really undermine the surprise) and find the budget needed to double Refrain's episode count. If the anime did reach the same heights as the visual novel, I have no doubts that it would be regarded even more highly than Clannad: After Story.  The artwork has been noticeably improved over the previous season, though. A surprising amount of effort was put into the first episode, and J.C. Staff has worked to eliminate most of the bizarre, off-model faces that were so prevalent before. There are still occasional scenes where the animation quality dips but it is nowhere near as egregious as it used to be. My only complaint is that many important CGs from the visual novel (""called game"") are lacking any sort of visual impact in the anime. The visuals should have been used to enhance the story rather than merely assist it.  Refrain makes near-perfect use of its soundtrack. ""Boys Don't Cry"" (Kyousuke's theme) is a subtle track that does not seem to carry much significance at first, but eventually evolves into what I believe to be the most emotional track in the story. It is a perfect tribute to Kyousuke. Most people will also find themselves pulled by the sheer emotional weight of ""Haruka Kanata"", the farewell song of the series. Considering the lyrical significance and all that was building up towards this point, it achieves more than simply being sappy; it is a massive tsunami of emotion. Special props should also be given to ""Song for Friends"" which achieves much of the same impact as the previous two. While Little Busters may have one of the best soundtracks in anime, it also has one of the best uses of music.  The seiyuu work is also commendable. The actors do not simply state their lines. During the more emotional moments in the story, you can clearly hear the actors choke up as their character begins to cry. We do not often see this level of effort in anime. Kyousuke's and Rin's seiyuu evidently care about getting into the role of their character, and the result is some of the best voice acting in years.  Little Busters: Refrain is a superb anime. It is an experience that is more than the sum of its parts. Few anime have managed to create such a thoroughly endearing cast of characters, and even fewer have managed to strike such an emotional chord with its audience. It may not be as good as it should have been, and while the visual novel is still several steps above, the anime adaptation is a solid alternative for those unable to dedicate the fifty-some hours into reading the visual novel. Those expecting a deep, convoluted story brimming with 'mature' characters may not find what they are looking for. Little Busters Refrain is particularly well-written and well-produced, but it does still rely on your ability to empathise with the characters. I don't think that is a bad thing at all.  And I wonder, why do we live in an era where stories are judged solely by their complexity? Why must a critic feel forced to act is if they are too high-brow to value emotion? Human emotion is a powerful, powerful thing that gives our transient existence a meaning and a purpose. If a story is capable of bringing you to tears, it is a damn good one, I would say.";Recommended

If I were to choose one stand out improvement however, it would have to be the animation. I found the previous series almost unbearable at some points but this series, well was top class compared to what we have already witnessed within the Little Busters universe. This series blitzes the first series. One thing I must add is that to those who didn't watch the first series and have noticed the popularity of this series and wondered 'can I watch this series without watching the first?', you must watch the first series to fully embrace this series.  This series kicks off right where the previous series left off, focusing more on the 'Secret of the World' and the original Little Busters themselves. When the 'Secret of the World' starts to become more apparent, one realizes that this series itself is far darker and serious compared to the first. A personal love of this series is how subtle hints are dropped throughout concerning 'the secret of the world'. Some moments are incredibly clever and well, blow your mind!  One thing that is very apparent in this series is that it is very emotional. In the first series, there were incidences that weren't emotional at all and yet in the VN, they had me reaching for the tissues. This was due to things being lost in translation, literally. For me this was most obvious during Haruka's route but let's save this rant for another time. However, I was simply blown away at how well they transferred the emotional scenes over from the VN. I even felt that at certain points, the anime was actually more emotional than the VN!  Unlike the first series, Refrain actually contains character development! Hooray! This in turn makes you feel more connected to the characters and thus enjoy the series more. Whats more is that this 'character development' didn't just apply to the 'original little busters' but the newcomers aswell such as Kurugaya. Happy days!  Now, before I tie up this review, I wanted to dedicate a section the music. The music in LB is simply astounding. Be it instrumentals like 'Lamplight', which sends a shiver down my spine due to how harrowing it is or songs like 'Faraway' or 'Song for Friends'. I must add 'Faraway' is simply one of the most emotional songs I have ever heard.  This story is full of so many twists and turns that you couldn't possibly predict what could happen. Its a compelling, sad and funny story all in one! But the main reason I gave this series such a high rating is simply because of how well the JC staff adapted this story into an anime. I knew what was going to happen and yet I was glued to the screen from the get go.  This is a must see. One of the best of 2013!;Recommended
2;Little Busters! Refrain;tukky12;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tukky12;10;"Little Busters Refrain is (loosely) based of the key visual novels who have notably produced some great shows such as Clannad, Kanon and Air. Little Busters Refrain is no different. For a LB refrain is the sequel to Little Busters and in my opinion (and widely regarded to be) much much better than the first season, not that LB was bad in any way. This 2nd season is 13 episodes long.  I should mention at this point that this again would fall under the category of high-school life (almost all of the action occurs here), fantasy and slice of life perhaps. As we have come to expect from key, LB Refrain is just as emotionally hard hitting in its own way but I will leave you to decide that for yourselves.  Now for the actual show itself. It picks off basically where LB left off and continues to develop characters stories from there. However the way it goes about this is in much more depth and each and every episode will invoke strong emotion. They only give themselves 13 with it all to do and they pull it off pretty well. You may be wondering if it is possible to further develop the characters stories in such a short time however the pacing and the mixture is just right.  Where LB was a rather nice, slow setting into the story, you really have to feel that it was all building up to LB Refrain. Be warned, LB Refrain takes a much darker angle right from the outset, some sensitive themes are explored and are very thought provoking. It goes to show that not everything can always go smoothly and it is here that you can really start to connect with the characters.  STORY + CHARACTERS: The story itself continues in the high school, we still don't know the answer to the universe (to those who have watched LB) and the episodes go through with each character. They all have very different stories and they are all fascinating in their own right. The characters you may have thought to be on the fringe suddenly make much more sense and everything is never as it seems at first ;). The best bit of this show in fact how well all the episodes were integrated with each other right from the first episode of LB to the last of Refrain. When you reach the climax, which personally I found very satisfying you can come to appreciate everything that has occurred in the previous episodes, it all suddenly fits together with amazing effect.  One thing I found with LB Refrain which was distinctly different to LB was the way they just dropped bombshell after bombshell without really ever giving you any chance to recover, the plot gets thick and very fast. In order to wrap up the show in 13 eps, each of the eps feel meaty and full of content and in fact the intricacies all make it more pleasurable to watch a second time once you know what is actually going on.  The soundtrack was very good I thought, the music complemented the action just as you would expect from a key adaptation and once again it was used to add an extra dimension to the atmosphere, made you feel something a little extra. The OP in my opinion was especially pleasant as well.  As a final word on LB Refrain, if there were one thing that I would stress the most, it would be that you have to keep yourself aware and keep your mind open. The story really does take you on ups and downs in the 13 episodes and it executes it so well in such a short period of time that there are various emotions that are evoked. The characters of this anime are probably some of the best worked characters or rather collectively they are the most interactive bunch with everyone having an affect on the other.  Expect the unexpected on this emotional rollercoaster that is Little Busters Refrain.  Kyousuke, Rikki, Rin and co. make for one heck of a show with perhaps my most favourite story line full of twists and turns.";Recommended
3;Little Busters! Refrain;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"There is a ""secret of this world""….  If there is anything, it’s no secret that Little Busters Refrain is a sequel of the first season based off the visual novel of the same name. Also no secret is the fact that the visual novel has gained tremendous success as one of Key’s works. Key is known to produce a variety of their works with supernatural elements including Kanon, Clannad, and Rewrite. The Little Busters franchise tells the story of a boy named Riki Naoe who is a member of the team known as Little Busters. Along with three other boys and a girl named Rin, they are led by Kyousuke to play baseball at their school. But little do they know there’s much more than meets the eye...  If the first season of Little Busters was the prototype, Refrain would be the final product. This means that it’s a direct continuation from the way season 1 was set up. Of course, not everything usually goes right especially in cases of visual novel game adaptations. Usually, fans expect more than what they can bargain for in terms of consistency with its characters, story, setting, music, artwork, and the list goes on and on. There have been some series that pulled it off quite successfully with its adaptations while others not so much in recent years. Little Busters Refrain falls under the category of a mixed bag at some occasions. It’s not a masterpiece but neither is it a shipwreck beyond salvage. It’s more of a work that fans should appreciate as it wraps up the story of Little Busters as a whole to deliver satisfaction and something to remember by.  Little Busters Refrain takes place in the same setting as the first season with most of the characters returning. However, it’s noticeable that the story changes dramatically in tone with its previous predecessor. A key (no pun intended here) concept involving the supernatural element of the “secret of the world” becomes prominent throughout the season. However, it doesn’t always go that way as we still some humorous moments. Not only has that but Refrain also added in some hints of potential romance between Riki and Kurugaya. The beginning stages of Refrain drops many hints of this with Kurugaya’s desire and wish to live her best days. Her presence in the show will leave a short yet memorable impression to viewers because of her wish. However at the same time, her departure lacks morality on her own behalf as what she wishes isn’t exactly what viewers may hope for.  But that’s only the beginning stages as viewers will find out that Refrain has many secrets to be unraveled as each episodes goes. This is accompanied by a balance of light and darker themes. Unlike season 1, the show ventures into a darker element involving tragedies along with themes of adolescence in growing up, dealing with losses, and experiencing the unexpected. At the same time, the show still brings in the slice of life fun at occasions similar to season one. The feeling of being part of a team and enjoying life with friends is an experience that I’m sure most people would cherish. In Refrain, we get to see five childhood friends enjoy their life. Unfortunately, not everything goes as they expected.  As Key is involved in the show, adolescence and growing up becomes a major role for our characters. In particular, Kyousuke (the leader of Little Busters) plays a guardian role and bringing in the foundation of the show of growing up. At the apex of the story, his feelings are poured out that truly allow viewers to see how he expresses them. More than that though, characters such as Kengo and Masato also play prominent supporting roles. All the characters are joined together by friendship that defines the importance of closeness and appreciation. As the series goes on, fans will learn the truth and more about the ‘secret of the world’.  The story of Refrain might also seem confusing at first with the various twists such as montages, narration, and climatic like scenes. There is a presence that something is not right in the world that Riki and his friends are part of. This is where foreshadowing comes into play as various hints are dropped with the dialogues, character interactions, and scenes are shown to give viewers firsthand what they might experience. As for the experience itself, it can be different for everyone. Key is a company known to bring forth themes of tragedy as well so emotions are to be expected. As one grows up, they will embark on a journey to learn from the various events in their lives. For our characters in Refrain, they too experience that journey.  The journey itself is explored in various arcs and episodes that connects the story as a whole. As a way of presenting the show, Refrain gives most of the prominent characters their spotlight including Kurugaya, Masato, Kengo, Riki, and Rin. Kyousuke becomes a driving figure in this show as mentioned before and the experiences he goes through reflects on Key’s reflection – the way it illuminates his feelings. The story itself also conveys comedy despite the grimmer atmosphere. Comedy exists not as fan service but rather as the character interactions and dialogues that holds various meanings. Although Refrain also lacks a bit of the more battle theme setting, it retains its sports style of baseball. Obviously, the show isn’t about sports but the moments are memorable especially for our main characters that enjoys their everyday lives just being together. Viewers will appreciate the concept of friendship that connects them as a whole while discovering the secret of the world. The surprise might not be pleasant but their experiences are unforgettable.  Refrain still lacks a few aspect that might not be appreciable for viewers. As an anime only viewer, I did get quite the satisfaction from this show. However at times, I feel like something is missing such as resolutions to sudden conflicts. Some of the comedy also seems to be oddly coordinated or expressed such as Masato’s reactions. There’s even one particular episode focuses on him that gives him the highlight but doesn’t seem fitting with the Refrain atmosphere. Among other things, visual novel adaptations also sometimes suffers from consistency. In the case of dialogues, it nails it on the spot but not always the expressions or reflection of its ideas. There is an emotional impact to be felt but some parts aren’t tear jerking by Key standards. Perhaps a show being one cour is a problem here but at some cases, the arc/story feels rushed such as montages and resolutions. Also from what I understand, sudden elements of the VN are omitted that would of given the impact of tragic scenes. Despite this though, Refrain still balances itself between light and dark with its style and presentation.  Animation wise, the show remains decent but sometimes lacks impact or rather the maturity of its darker tone for Refrain. Characters are designed to look innocent such as Komari, Kud, Rin, etc. Kurugaya and the boys have a more mature while Riki has more of a childish appearance. On the other hand, the backgrounds are portrayed well and consistent with its fantasy-like atmosphere. The dream like sequences are prominent features that brings supernatural elements while dropping foreshadowing sequences for viewers. As an anime only viewer though, some of the expressions of the characters bothers me such as Masato and Rin. In fact, Rin isn’t very noticeable compared to the other main characters. Even when she takes the stage, it’s hard to take her seriously with her body language and expressions. On another note, JC Staff is known to adapt various anime series with a school life setting such as Sakurasou no Pet Kanojo, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko., and Shakugan no Shana. While not all of them contains elements of supernatural, they do convey the innocence reflections of the characters. However, I question sometimes if this style fits given the more serious style of Refrain.  The soundtrack balances well on most parts whether it’s during scenes of emotional, comedic, or suspense. Various OST are incorporated from the visual novel while certain new ones are inserted in. It’s also noticeable that Jun Maeda, the creator of the VN is directly involved in coordinating the soundtrack so some of the experiences will feel similar according to his style of presenting the series. The OP song ‘Boys be Smile’ stands as a prominent song to convey the friendship that brings together the team of Little Busters. Even though not all the characters get their own spotlights, it portrays the show in a way that is remarkable with its messages. On the other hand, the main ED song “Kimi to no Nakushi Mono” lacks impact with its orchestra. Voice acting wise, most characters fits well although I sometimes find Riki’s voice to be irritating along with Rin. Kyousuke on the other hand has that authoritative mannerism thanks to Hikaru Midorikawa’s talents. The way he speaks gives him a sense of command and shows why he is the leader of Little Busters. Other characters such as Kurugaya and Kengo demonstrates maturity with their own tone of voice.  Little Busters Refrain isn’t just about discovering secrets but also finding paths to connect the characters together in a complex story. The romance might not be promising but the connections are through friendship and loyalty. There are certain elements that might be confusing especially for anime only viewers so be sure to pay attention as each episode unravels itself. Dialogues in the end should not be just memorable but also matching to Key’s style of presentation. Thankfully, it did that even with some of the oddly coordinated scenes involving expressionism of the characters. And because the show lacks fan service, there is no stupidity with the common misunderstandings or cliches that are overused in the anime industries on many occasions. What it does have is an impact that give viewers an experience they won’t forget. Refrain is not just a continuation but an appreciation as a gift for fans to open up.";Recommended
4;Little Busters! Refrain;ChargedCoin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChargedCoin;9;"Little Busters! ~Refrain~ Full Review  This fall season, I get the joy and honour of reviewing Little Busters Refrain on Anime Corner. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this good. It surpassed my low expectations garnered from the mediocre first season, to one of my favourite series of all time. However, please note that I have not played the visual novel, so this review will be solely based on the anime only. Anyway, let’s get on with the review.  Story (9/10):  “I totally didn’t expect that to happen.”  If you have watched the first season of Little Busters, you must have found it rather boring and mediocre. Everything was kinda predictable, and as such when they hit you with the feels, somehow the tears just don’t flow. As such, Refrain is the reward for managing to watch all 25 episodes of the first season.  Refrain is totally different. Every episode is interesting with a super-annoying (but satisfying) cliffhanger at the end of each episode that just keeps you at the edge of your seat. There are so many plot twists within the show; you almost never know what’s coming up next, which causes so many emotions to be experienced when they do hit you with the emotional scenes.  Refrain basically continues directly where season 1 left off. Riki and Rin get closer to the secret of the world, which I have to say, be extremely satisfying when it got revealed.  Moreover, everything from season one has been linked together here to form this masterpiece. If you do go back and watch season one, you’ll get a newfound appreciation for it because you can see exactly what the characters and doing and why they are doing so.  Characters (9.5/10):  Honestly, Little Busters is nothing without its characters. This is an anime where the characters are so masterfully done where it just carries the whole show forward.  *Spoilers Ahead*  Of course, with characters being the main focus, you would see a lot of development. Hell, the whole story is centered on the development of both Riki and Rin. Without a doubt, Riki is developed the most. When he was young, he was super depressed because he lost his parents, but Kyousuke and the Little Busters helped him get back on his feet. But even in season one, he was more of a follower. A follower of Kyousuke. As such, the entire story was basically to make Riki into a more independent leader. You could definitely see the difference between Riki’s confidence and decisions in season one as compared to the last few episodes of season two.  Another commendable character is definitely Natsume Kyousuke. The writers did an awesome job in portraying Kyousuke, such that halfway through the series, he was made to look like the villain. An extremely terrifying villain at that, being able to control whatever happens in the world, and trying to make Rin do things against her will. However, at the end of the season, we finally see his true intentions. I would say that Kyousuke is somewhat of a fatherly figure to both Riki and Rin. He did his best in order for the both of them to grow and develop, even if he knows he’s hurting them, because as the saying goes, “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”. As much as it pains him to see them getting hurt, it is for their own good.  Lastly, is of course the entire Little Busters team. They have all done their best till the very end in order to help both Riki and Rin grow, even though they do not benefit from it. I sincerely believe that if all friends in this world were as noble and kind as the Little Busters team, the world would definitely be a better place.  Animation (9/10):  The animation for Refrain is amazing. If you have been looking carefully at each scene, you would notice that there are actually very minor details that serve as foreshadowing to the later parts of the story, something that is pretty commendable. An example would be from episode 2; many scenes are white and look cold. This actually signifies Kurugaya’s loneliness, which is seen later on.  Sound (9/10):  The soundtrack of the anime is extremely fitting, complimenting each scene to make it feel more lively or to add to the sadness.  Special credits to the insert song, Song for Friends, by Rita. It’s sung with so much emotion, and if you look at the lyrics you’ll feel even sadder for the characters during the scenes it is played.  “Dare no tame ni bokura wa yuku? Dare no tame ni mata mezameru? Dare ga itemo daremo inakutemo koe wo okuru yo”  (For whom do we go on? For whom do we awaken again for? Whether that person exists or not, I call to them)  It basically captures the essence of the entire Little Busters anime.  Enjoyment and Overall (9/10)  I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed Little Busters Refrain. It was an absolute blast to watch, keeping me on the edge of my seat every episode. Moreover, I finally had the feels that I have craved for so much from season one, from an anime by Key. If you haven’t even picked up the first season of Little Busters, I highly recommend you do so right now, because Refrain is worth every episode and you’ll definitely be craving for more at the end of the series.

5;Little Busters! Refrain;ZachM;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZachM;10;"""I'd forgotten That living Meant losing"" -Naoe Riki  Coming of Age is a really tough genre to pull off, especially in recent anime. You have to establish characters, and as the story progresses, force them to endure certain events and cause them to grow up, whether from a child into an adult or grow as a human being. Little Busters pulls off coming of age as good as I've ever seen an anime do it. And it does it while adding such emotional power to the story that only enhances the impact that the story will leave on you. This is thanks in no small part to Key, of whom the original Visual Novel was originally conceived. Key knows how to touch your emotions. And some would say that they've been hit or miss with some of their stuff. But when it comes to Little Busters, which I just finished rewatching, the messages they convey are on par with their best.  Many people dislike the first season of LB (For reasons other than adaptation decay). And I can't really blame them for doing so. When you watch this anime, you'll see season 1, and you might feel a little disappointed. Because to be completely honest, it is exactly what you'd expect from a Key Visual Novel adaptation. Protagonist meets an assortment of girls, and helps them out with their problems, which tend to have a lot of sad moments sprinkled throughout them. It also consists of a lot of moe characters doing moe things. And has a few stand alone episodes that at first, feel like they aren't really important to the overall plot, but in the end, are integral. But don't let that ruin things for you, the first season is vitally important to the success of this show. I for one loved the first season, it had many lovable characters, hilarious comedy, some very good story arcs, and subtle nods to ""something more"" that was yet to come. Season 1 establishes all of its characters, it gets you attached to them. Which will make the emotional jolt the story takes in season 2 much more meaningful to watch. This anime succeeded where the incredibly similar Angel Beats didn't, in its length. Angel Beats threw at you 15+ characters, and tried to make you get attached to them in just 13 episodes, which, is almost flat out impossible. Little Busters as a whole is 39 episodes. It gives you an immense amount of time to get invested into these people's lives. More comparable to Clannad, season 1 serves as pretty much the 26 episode prequel to let you know who everyone is, what they're like, and attempts to prepare you for the much bigger and better sequel.  When season 2 rolls around, it will begin to take a turn. A turn down a path that's quite unlike season 1. It introduces things into the story that you hadn't seen before. Those nods to ""something more"" in season 1 all come to fruition here. All your questions will have answers. Your opinions will change. And, unlike most anime that have come out within the past 4 years, you will see the growth of a character. This is a Key anime. And as said before, some Key anime are hit or miss. Some of them, like Angel Beats, exist only to make you cry. It's not trying to tell you a good story, nor is it trying to throw out real character depth. It exists solely for the purpose of pulling at your emotions. And if you're like me, that won't work, because you can't become emotionally invested in a story and characters in only 13 episodes devoid of meaningful development. LB isn't just some melodramatic tear fest, forcing you to cry is not Little Busters' one and only objective. This is a show that's going to tell you a story. A story that you can become easily invested in, and if you cry along the way, so be it. Little Busters Refrain takes the Clannad After Story method of establishing characters in a first season, and putting them to the test in the second. Really forcing them to do what they are capable of doing. No longer is our protagonist just a protagonist, he is, in Clannad's case, Tomoya Okazaki, a man who has lost everything, a man who has given up, but a man who still finds hope, and must fight his hardest to regain the things that he once held dear. Little Busters, has Naoe Riki. A boy who is young, naive, and not ready for the real world, Relying too much on others to do what they think is right rather than what he thinks. Throughout Refrain, he has to grow stronger, not particularly physically, but stronger as a person. Grow into someone who can deal with loss, and overcome hardship. Little Busters conveys the theme of growing up insanely well. Saying that you can't rely on your friends forever. Your going to have to deal with very bad and awful situations, and your friends won't always be there for you. You have to become independent. You have to grow up.  As I said earlier, I just finished rewatching Little Busters. Now, I've rewatched a lot of anime now, and while Little Busters is one of my all time favorite anime, it is not my absolute favorite. But I can say that it was definitely the most rewarding rewatch I've ever experienced. I never knew just how much season 1 references things that have to do with season 2 that you won't understand until you get there. You're able to more knowingly understand certain character motivations, and some things they say will make a lot more sense knowing the overall outcome. My opinion on the characters was different the second time around, and it made for an incomparable rewatch experience. Originally, I had thought that I just loved LB, not that it was a great show by any means, but upon seeing it a second time, I can objectively say that it's one of the best anime I've ever seen to date, season 2 specifically. It is something that will grip you, attach to you, and emotionally drain you. Something I feel takes what both Anohana and Angel Beats did, and does it 10x better. With a coming of age story that will surely blow you away from start to finish, it's something that I'll wholeheartedly recommend to anyone and everyone who either wants a great story with great characters and character development, or if you just wanna sit back and cry a whole days worth of tears.  Little Busters ~Refrain~ is a masterpiece among modern day coming of age anime.  Thank you for reading.";Recommended
6;Little Busters! Refrain;Raghnaq;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Raghnaq;9;Drama A lot of good series out there depict an emotion-filled story where the romance comes secondary, if at all. Strong depictions of friendship and in challenging situations can really draw a viewer into the story and start making them sympathize with the characters. It’s a bit of an all-encompassing genre, but only a handful of series really pull viewers in with their screenplay.  It took a while to build. Little Busters! started out slow, and after the first few episodes some people were condemning J.C.Staff for ruining the latest Key adaptation. many of the fans dropped it but I hold on to it. It built slow because the fast punch isn’t nearly so devastating as the freight train slamming into your soul. By the time Refrain rolled around it had built up a head of steam, and when all the emotions finally came crashing down, I wept. I wept unabashedly for two whole episodes, so potent was the drama unfolding on the screen. There were many great dramas this year, with Uchouten Kazoku almost winning for a similarly slow build up and an emotional gut punch on Episode 8, but only one show pulled us in so deeply only to rip our hearts out with friendship and love. It made every minute that proceeded it worth it many times over.  Mystery Who doesn’t love a good mystery? Thought-provoking storylines that keep inquisitive viewers watching and speculating on where things are headed? Yes, please. They don’t necessarily have to have a horror element to them.  Like last year, 2013 didn’t provide much in terms of mysteries. That didn’t mean that there weren’t good additions to the genre however, and one mystery ended up particularly good. By that, we mean the “Secret of the World.” Set up in its original run and finally culminating in this past season’s Little Busters! ~Refrain~, this was a mystery that hung around for over two dozen episodes, occasionally disappearing and reappearing when we least expected it. It taunted us with red herrings and subtle hints, giving viewers the general feeling that something wasn’t quite right while holding the actual secret until the very end. And what a secret it was. No matter what you thought about the original series, the fact is that Refrain was a spectacular piece of storytelling, and its mystery elements were a big reason why. This was a mystery whose revelation sucker punched you when you least expected it, turned the entire series upside down, and was something whose emotional impact made it an easy winner for this category in my list.;Recommended
7;Little Busters! Refrain;Cosmic06Star;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cosmic06Star;10;"Now that I watched the last episode, I can finally write a review for this anime, I can go on and on about this and list 675 reasons why you should watch it, but I am just going to keep it simple so that people who aren't sure about it, can at least consider it.  Little Busters!: Refrain is a continuation for the first season, where in that they just focused on introducing the characters best way possible. But Refrain is where things start to get really interesting, the main story will start to unfold, and many plot twists and shocking moments will occur that will pull you in.  Story: 10/10 Nothing shocked me as much as when the true story of little busters! started to unfold. The story just hits you on the head without you even knowing, you start noticing things that you didn't notice before because you didn't know what is going on, episode by episode questions start to build up in your mind, and by the final episodes all of them are answered and you just sit there dumbfounded by the awesomeness (while crying of course).  Art: 9/10 Even though I never really had an issue with the first season's art. I will admit that it is more improved here, the characters look better and the animation as well... And that's about it, if you're watching an anime just for the ""art style"" and going to judge it based on that, then you're watching it for the wrong reasons. (Of course art is an important reason, but it isn't EVERYTHING.)  Sound: 10/10 I don't think I have much to say here, just listening to it's soundtracks, you will know how amazing they are. Every song fits perfectly, and without these strong and emotional soundtracks the scenes wouldn't have left an impact as they did.  Characters 10/10 Little busters!: Refrain offers such strong characters, and all of them are different from the ones you already saw in season one, because in Refrain, they show their true selves and you will be surprised by how different they are. And not to forget the emotions each character shows, it's as if the characters are real.. you can feel the pain they are going through. Your thoughts on the main characters before will surely change for the best.  Overall 10/10 I enjoyed every episode of Little Busters!, I thought it was an amazing anime and I think everyone should at least give it a try, and watch it until the end before judging. People shouldn't compare this to the visual novel, or even other titles. This should be looked at as an individual, and should be judged based on that.";Recommended
8;Little Busters! Refrain;Micsupreeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Micsupreeme;10;"I don't usually review sequel series' for shows, but Little Busters will be an exception.  After being completely blown away by the original series (10/10) mostly due to the amazing character development - despite its predictability, i loved it.  Then i completed Refrain.  Completely different ball park  It was EVERYTHING and more that i wanted it to be.  The best phrase to describe this masterful sequel would be ""Edge of my seat"", and it does this seamlessly, not through cheap action scenes. Instead, throughout these 13 episodes, doors are constantly being nudged, you lean forward - hoping to find out more, but it wasn't even a door in the first place. I guess what i'm trying to get at here is the utterly different frame of mind that the show induces so differently to the original, it completely overwhelmed me...  THIS THING HAS MORE TWISTS AND TURNS THAN THE BIGGEST (Emotional) ROLLOCOASTER IN THE WORLD.  and if you've completed Little Busters (original), you would be a FOOL not to look into refrain, i can't put it into words well at the moment but EVERYTHING becomes truly explained, you have no idea what's in store for you...  Yet i do :-) And i can honestly say that it is the most outstanding series of TV I've ever seen. When it comes to media, i'm not a cry-er - it just doesn't happen, yet this show pushed me to the limit, that's how immersive it is. But no, it's far from one dimensional, after all, i didn't tell you what emotions i felt so strongly.  It may seem like a Cliche, but those cliffhangers and the revelations in the show will make you want to watch through it all as soon as possible. If you do decide to go binge watching though, i advise you check the floor for a safe landing zone: as you'll be on the edge of your seat!  -----  10's across all boards, though the original series was 90% character based, now you have a wonderful STORY to cherish! ^.^";Recommended

Refrain;Salmo69;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Salmo69;10;*No Refrain spoliers*Now i played the VN and little busters changed the way i lived entirely and has always had a place in my heart and the anime is now exception  Story:10/10 Now unlike in the first season of little busters.Refrain is changed in NO way from the VN the only thing missing are the alternate endings to refrain which if you LOVED little busters and refrain i recommend you pick up the vn on steam (not released as of this time if you are reading this at a later date check)however one thing i noticed is that key might have noticed that refrain in itself was to short to make it into a anime by itself so they included Kurugaya's and Rin's (part 2) Route into refrain to make it long (refrain if it was by itself would only be like 5 episodes of content) and the problem i have with this is how again they kinda changed Kurugaya's route to match the story layout of the anime but besides that thats the only problem i have with the story of refrain.  Art:10/10 The art hasn't changed from the first season but the scenes are amazingly beautiful and breath taking.  Sound:10/10 If you've played the VN or seen the first season(which i hope you have cuz theres season one spoilers in this review)the music is just appealing to the ears and i still listen to the soundtrack of the VN and the anime from when i first saw the anime and read the VN in 2013.  Character:10/10 Now without spoiling anything Refrain just ties everything together bout the characters there friendship,hardships and worries all come together in refrain.  Enjoyment:10/10 Well i just finished watching Refrain and i have a shotgun blast size hole in my heart and my face is full of tears...........i f**king love little busters.  Overall:Why are you still reading this if you've seen the first season GO WATCH REFRAIN LEAVE and if you seen refrain you are welcome for cookies and milk and a box of tissues all provided by the great Saigusa-san..........I'm sorry but seriously its worth a watch if you've read the VN and enjoyed the first season.

11;Little Busters! Refrain;Asfaria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asfaria;8;"As soon as I saw the first season of Little Busters! end announcing a second season, I couldn't help but think that it would be similar to Clannad After Story (I'm assuming almost everyone planning on watching Little Busters has already seen Clannad in this review but I won't spoil anything from it). Having not played the visual novel and only knowing how other Key anime have done so far, I knew Refrain would bring tons of drama that the first season only a small amount of. Since Little Busters! is basically the friendship version of the family-focused Clannad, it's easy to imagine that Refrain would follow in it's footsteps of being much better (to me) than it's prequel. And Refrain did just that.  Refrain is a bit of an odd sequel as far as sequels go. For most shows, it is a requirement that you watch the first season for whatever reason before moving on to the second. I would only recommend watching the first season of Little Busters in order to get acquainted with the characters a little better, but otherwise (since almost nothing happens in the story overall aside from the original group of five members doubling in size) you could just skip it and go right to Refrain. The characters acquired in the Little Busters group during the first season become minor characters and the focus shifts to the original quintet who had less development during the first season.  So what makes Refrain so much better than the first season? Everything. A moving, dramatic plot; plenty of character development for the main characters; an improved soundtrack and better animation. And, of course, it's much more enjoyable.  The story of Refrain begins not long after the Little Busters! baseball team won their first (and only) game. The show moves away from baseball now and starts focusing specifically on Riki and Rin. But the first arc of the story focuses on Kurugaya, the mature genius girl who was the only one of the new recruits who didn't get an arc in the first season. This arc leads the way into the real story similar to how Clannad After Story's first few arcs did.  The story of Refrain is the biggest improvement from the first season. Rather than just the typical ""go around and help all the girls solve their problems"" plot which you can find in basically every harem anime ever, the story focuses only on Rin and not the other girls. Rin has always been shy and slower to grow attached to the other characters than everyone else, however her shyness starts to become an even bigger problem and neither her older brother Kyousuke nor Riki seem to be able to solve it completely. To make matters more difficult, Kyousuke and Riki are both going about trying to help her in different ways.  Aside from Kurugaya during her arc, the only important characters for the most part are Riki, Rin, Kyousuke, Masato, and Kengo. Along with many flashbacks to their childhoods, the show also develops them incredibly well in the present time. This was one of the main problems I had with the first season. With all the attention given to the other girls who were joining the Little Busters, the original five had very little development. Even Riki did not have very much development despite being the main character. Refrain does a great job of giving enough screen-time to each of the five and building their characters separately and developing the group as a whole. The only real problem with the characters is that they start off so weak that it takes a while before their development makes them really likable. The group of minor characters now gets even less development than the main quintet did in the first season and are only really important for their impact on the main characters.  Refrain's soundtrack uses many of the same songs from the first season, but it focuses much more on the dramatic tracks and (with the decreased amount of comedic scenes) has much less of the forgettable, lighthearted music that was used plentifully throughout the first season. The OP theme also changes to fit the mood whereas the OP and ED from the first season were much more upbeat and cheerful (that's not to say I didn't love the ones from the first season, and it was very nice to hear the first OP return once).  The animation improves just like everything else, though not quite as much. The animation of the first season, though it had spots where the quality fell, was good. The quality of this season's animation was improved in part due to the story requiring it to be much better. The scenery moves away from almost primarily the high school setting and incorporates many other places as well as some more surreal moments. The character designs (though the majority of the colorful hairstyles disappeared with the minor characters) improved as well. The actions of the characters are detailed much better than before and the dramatic mood the animation sets is astounding. There were still some problems especially early on where the animation was more similar to how it was in the first season, but for the most part it improved very well.  But as much as I've been saying positive things about Little Busters, it still only gets an 8/10 overall. So where does the anime have problems? Going back to the how it's similar to Clannad After Story, Refrain has problems in both the beginning and end mainly in the story, but also with the characters in the beginning. With the beginning being similar to the first season, the story then is more of a setup for the real story which begins about a third of the way through the season. As for the ending... well it's a Key anime and what Key anime doesn't suffer from it's ending a little? The strongest part of Refrain is the middle once the anime begins to shed some light on the real story and what is actually happening. All I'll say about it is that it really is one of Key's best works.  Story -- 8/10 Animation -- 8/10 Soundtrack -- 9/10 Character -- 8/10 Enjoyment -- 9/10  If you've watched and enjoyed any of Key's other anime (especially Clannad), then I highly recommend you watch Refrain. If you want to build up more of a connection to the characters, then also watch the first season. If you know that the end of Refrain will probably not make you cry no matter how much of a connection you have to the characters, then you could probably just skip to this season. Refrain is (in my opinion at least) Key's second best anime adaptation (second only to After Story). It is a vast improvement over the first season in every way and I believe it is something you should not miss if you enjoy high school romance and/or slice of life anime.";Recommended
12;Little Busters! Refrain;jc9622;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jc9622;9;"I thought this was going to be ""another season, another crappy drama"" kind of show but my god was I wrong. This, folks, is an example of a sequel that is a lot better than the original. I'm not a VN reader so I'm reviewing this as an anime-only viewer.  (There will be some SPOILERS in my review)   [Story]: (9/10) (SPOILERS) The story continues from the season as Rikki now successfully recruited enough members for the Little Busters and won their first game. Compared to the 1st season's story, the story told in the 2nd season is a lot better. Just by watching the first episodes, you'll think that they haven't learned their mistakes and are doing the same mistake but nope. After the 1st episode ends, the show starts to get serious and you'll know that this isn't going to be the same as the first season.  The show focuses on 4 main arcs. The first arc is Yuiko's arc, the second is Rin's arc, the 3rd is focused on Riki and the original Little Busters (without the girls), and finally the final arc, where the show answers everything that happened in the first season, the early second season and the things going on in their ""world"". I am not going to summarize the arcs. Anyways, Let's focus on the first arc. This arc primarily focused on Yuiko and Rikki. The first season didn't focus that much on Yuiko so I'm glad they did it here so they can give her a character development. This arc maybe focused on Yuiko but if you take a closer look, this arc is preparing you for what is about to happen at the later episodes. The big hint that this arc gave away is the ""time loop"" and it also foreshadowed some events that is about to happen. Now the 2nd arc which is focused on Rikki and Rin's relationship and the ""secrets of this world"". This might not be the best arc but it's still a great arc. They have now received the final mysterious and they must solve it and the writer of the messages will reveal the ""secrets of the world"". At first, I thought this ""secrets of the world"" crap is just a filler but it's not. The ""secrets of the world"" is a plot point that makes the whole story of the second season. The arc also focuses on Rin and Rikki's relationship. In my opinion, them being a couple felt a little bit forced and it was predictable because Rin and Rikki have been spending a lot of time together. Now the 3rd arc which is focused on Rikki and the Little Busters. When I first watched this arc, I was very confused. I was asking myself ""What happened after the police took Rikki away from Rin?"" and ""What is this, a flashback episode?"". I just ignored those questions and proceeded to go forward. Apparently, Rikki is now recruiting members for the Little Busters while Kyosuke is in his dorm, depressed and reading mangas, because Little Busters is now broken up. Now the 4th and final arc, where every single plot hole gets filled, everything is explained and how this arc stabbed me right through my heart. I just want to get this out of the way, this arc made me cried and I rarely cry when I watch TV shows. Especially when they showed the bus accident scene. All of the character's actions in season 1 started to make sense, all those forced dramatic character arcs, why Kyosuke wants Rin and Rikki to become stronger, the time loop that Rikki experienced on the 20th on June, and the ""secrets of the world"" also started to make sense. I also felt sad and depressed when Kyosuke revealed why he's doing what he's doing. I'm just going to ignore the fact that Kyosuke can repeat time and create a fake world without a scientific explanation. Now my opinions on the story. It's great. It shows how Kyosuke is doing everything just so when they go back to the real world, they become stronger. The dramatic scenes and emotional moments are not forced this time so the drama was thought out and not something the director just came up with. There are a few flaws and one of those is the story pacing. Characters arc are still rushed but they're not as rushed as the first season. Now my opinions on the ending. Thank the Lord that they did not die. I don't want the show killing off all my favorite characters. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Art/Animation]: (9/10) The Animation is a lot better than the first season but there are still a few flaws. Details are still somewhat lacking and the character design is a bit better than the first season. Their hair are also somewhat better but I don't know if this is just me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Sound]: (9/10) I didn't really like the soundtrack in the first season but the soundtrack in this season is a major improvement. The OP theme song fit so well in this dramatic show. At first, it sounded bland and boring but later on, I understood why. The OP also got more and more depressing as the show goes on. The ED theme songs are also better than the previous ED. I only liked the 1st, 3rd and 5th ED theme song but I didn't really like the 2nd one but this is my opinion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Characters]: (9/10) (SPOILERS) In the first season, I loved all the characters except Riki because of how he's able to go around and solve the girl's problem without him having any problems. However, in this season. It showed that Kyosuke was resetting time everytime Rikki gives up on one of the girl's problem so it pretty much shows that Rikki is not a perfect main protagonist. What was shown in the 1st season is Rikki successfully solving that girl's problem and they didn't show his failed attempts. It also shows that he becomes stronger everytime Kyosuke resets the time. Because of that, I now like Rikki. The whole season pretty much gave Rikki and Rin a major character development. Showing their flashbacks, their struggles, etc. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Enjoyment]: (10/10) Easily a perfect score from me. I wasn't expecting to cry this much when I started watching Refrain because the 1st season was just forced dramatic moments so it didn't really make my cry. I don't think I'll see anymore anime that can make me depressed. (Besides Clannad) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [OVERALL]: (9.2/10) If you're holding back on this anime because you didn't like the 1st season that much then you'll regret it. This season is a lot better and the emotional moments can really hit you so hard. This is one of the best drama anime I have ever seen. The last 4 episodes made me depressed as hell and cried my eyes out. I shouldn't have watch the last 4 episodes all in one go.   Pros: +Great Story +Great Animation +Improved Soundtrack +Emotional and Dramatic moments are successfully executed +Happy Ending +Great Characters +Heavy Character Development on Rin, Rikki, Kyosuke, Masato, and Kengo  Cons: -Story Pacing is still a bit rushed";Recommended
13;Little Busters! Refrain;gregdubin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/gregdubin;9;"""Wait, let me cry just a little longer.""  I don't think any quote from this series can really sum up the emotional energy it carries. Forget the overdrawn melodrama of the first season flicking you on the nose; Little Busters!: Refrain is here to punch you in the face.  Everything about Little Busters! has been revamped and improved for Refrain. The story is tighter, more focused, and more emotional. Since this season is only half as long as the last and only focuses on one main story arc, events move along with a much better rhythm and flow.  The art, while still pretty bland and uninteresting, has been made crisper and clearer, and the animation has been made smoother and more natural. However, there are some moments of great imagery that elevate the show's visuals.  The music is much the same: the piano melody from the last season is carried over and used repeatedly, but the tune is used to great effect, representing nostalgia, melancholy, loss, regret, relief, and happiness. The opening and closing themes, especially the former, are perfectly suited to the tone of the show.  The characterization of this season is executed much more naturally than the last. Gone are the cumbersome multi-episode character arcs, replaced instead with slower paced reveals and moments of growth that feel much heartier and effective. Refrain focuses much more on the core Little Busters (Riki, Rin, Kyousuke, Masato, and Kengo). That's not to say that the other characters do not play a role in the story, their role is just not as pronounced. You will care about these characters. You will cry for these characters.  Refrain is much more enjoyable than the previous season. The story is paced much better, the arcs are more focused, the emotions are more intense, and the visuals are crisper. Everything is better.  Little Busters!: Refrain is unreasonably good. It's the only anime I've cried at, and I never expected to do so after finishing the mediocre first season. Refrain is worth the time spent slogging through the original Little Busters ten times over.";Recommended
14;Little Busters! Refrain;IrohaUtsugi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IrohaUtsugi;9;"Little Busters! ~Refrain~, the sequel of Little Busters!. This anime was adapted from Little Busters! VN Refrain route. Maybe some of you will compare this anime with Clannad. In my opinion, we can't compare these two anime because they have different genre and different main story. It will be great if we compare this anime with Angel Beats! because both of them have a same genre. That's my preface of reviewing this anime :)  Okay, i'll start my review of this anime.  Story: The story was based from LB! VN. The anime producer of LB! Refrain, J.C. Staff, is doing good enough to represent the story. The first story is about Kurugaya's route. It has a little different story from the VN because J.C. Staff made Kurugaya's route become the intermediary to Rin's route. It is nice because when you play the VN, Kurugaya's route and Rin's route are separate and can't be connected. I have a little disappointed in Kurugaya's route because it can made me cry but J.C. Staff didn't made a little dramatical as sad as AB!.  In Rin's route, the story is really good. The story is about Riki and Rin who will ""going out"". This story also continuing the mission about ""The Secret of The World"". One part what made me confuse is when Mio, Kud, and Haruka are going out and didn't say goodbye. I think they will going back to the dorm. But if you're the VN reader, you have know that three of them are disappeared.  After Rin's route finish, you will watch the real Refrain's route. The story is same as VN. J.C. Staff only cut the part when Riki is going to hospital. That's a disappoint. In a good news, J.C. Staff made a nice farewell of Riki and Rin with Masato, Kengo, and Kyousuke, who made a dramatical farewell.  Art: Little Busters! Refrain isn't the best of the art but it is better than Little Busters!. J.C. Staff improved the quality of the art and it reminded me to Angel Beats art.  Sound: There's no doubt about Key's music. For the OP, ED, and some of BGM, i think it's not Key's work. Boy's be Smile, the main OP of LB! Refrain, is deccent and nice to hear it. the lyric is describe what will happen in LB! Refrain. Kimi to no Nakushi Mono, the main ED of LB! Refrain is deccent, too. It's like Clannad AS, who has melancholy music in OP and fun music in ED. For BGM, is good but there are some mistaken place of BGM and the moment.  Character: You need to watch Little Busters! first if you want to know the detail of LB! Refrain character. Some character also missing like Futaki Kanata, A-chan, and Sasasegawa Sasami, who will play in LB! EX. Overall is good.  Enjoyment: LB! Refrain is enjoyment because the story has one goal and have the storyline is forward. Not really lack and it brings a moral value for us.  Overall: LB! Refrain has a potential to make you cry. But there are some missing. And i really appreciate for J.C. Staff because they has improved the quality of the art rather than the prequel, but they also cut of the great moment in LB! VN. In Little Busters! Refrain, you can find the moral value.  This is my review. I hope my review is useful for you.";Recommended
15;Little Busters! Refrain;jchang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jchang;9;Usually I do reviews following more technical matters but in the case of Little Busters!: Refrain I feel it's more important to talk about it's impact and it makes you feel. All in all Refrain is a great sequel that tied all the unknowns of its prequel in an outstanding way. However just like its prequel, the concept is splendid but suffers from some execution mistakes. There are behaviors you can't understand and things that seem to short due to lack of depth in the arcs. However all of this is forgivable if you consider the way it strikes your senses. With its more serious vibe, Refrain is a powerful tearjerker.  Now let me tell you the feelings this series provoked on me.  To me little busters is about friendship something that we seriously lack in Anime. Friendship is always a side to romance, girls always fight for a guy and guys can never have 'bromance' without it being depicted in a humorous ways. Little Busters! breaks all of those being about just a group of friends spending their days having fun and solving their problems to become stronger. Due to this, all characters grow together and so do you. It's truly refreshing to see a series like this which comedy doesn't rely on outrageous situations or sex appeal (in most cases) but to the crazy interactions between characters. I guess it kind of remind me of my school days, when i also used to do idiotic things and care way too much about transient matters. I relate to their group and recall the days that i used to be like that. What and idiot i was but what a fun i had!  And then through unexpected twists the series gets serious. I don't want to spoil anything but seeing this group of characters go through hard situations you can't help but to relate and feel sad. It made me want to just call my friends and tell them i miss them.  To me Little Busters! is a reminder of our youth, how great it is and how short and fragile it can be.;Recommended
16;Little Busters! Refrain;Moonsolol;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moonsolol;9;Muscles or Physics?  Around two months ago, I took a try at the Little Busters visual novel. So I downloaded the 3 GB file and I played through it. I have one word.  Amazing.  The visual novel was beautiful in many aspects. It had some great comedic scenes like the 'Loli-Loli Hunters', the Muscle Sensation, and other laughable parts. Then there were the feels, with the character routes and Refrain, the true route of LB.  This review will be about the anime adaptation for Refrain.  So, this fall season, after the JC Staff announced the second season for LB after their first 'mediocre' season, I took a try at the VN. I had not watched the first season anyways, so I didn't know shit. There.  So after being blown away by the Little Busters visual novel, I took a try at the JC Staff version.  Lets just say... it was good, but not as good as I was expecting.  The story for Refrain is directly adapted from the visual novel, making it beautiful and, well, great. With a ton of plot twists and tear-jerking scenes, the story for LB is better than most anime out there. I can't go into detail for this or the whole thing will be spoiled.  Here's a big downfall for Refrain. The art. JC Staff is famous for their, cough, 'mediocre', cough, art. Refrain was a big step up from their first season of LB, making this anime more decent for the eyes. Still, the art can't really compare to the visual novel. Heck, I really wanted this to be remade by KyoAni, I would give that an eleven or twelve.  Back on topic, the art for Refrain is decent at best. I still enjoyed it, but deep inside of me, I still wanted it to be a bit better.  The sound for both seasons of LB are taken directly from the VN, even the OSTs. All credits go to Jun Maeda. The exception was the opening for Refrain and 2 of the EDs. Sort of surprising, wasn't expecting it. I still liked it, and it still matched the mood of LB a bit.  Anyways, the soundtracks for Little Busters are very nice and they almost always match the theme of the scenes. Jun Maeda is a great composer, and Rita is a great singer.  The characters for LB, simply amazing. Mostly extremely likable, GO KURUGAYA!!!  Okay. Each character gets development, and anyone can grow to like at least 5 of them after finishing the series. Even the guys. Sadly, I cannot go into much detail for the characters because many of their personalities affect the story.  I enjoyed this even though it did not live up to my expectations. I even marathoned the first 10 episodes, being the Little Busters fanboy I was. It was a nice ride, and now it's over.  Overall, play the visual novel first. After that, watch Refrain. Don't even watch the first season. Just follow me.  9/10;Recommended
17;Little Busters! Refrain;Jammin_Rabbit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jammin_Rabbit;8;"Little Busters! has been quite a ride. From the first season when Kyousuke invites us to partake in his missions, to the second season where we are disillusioned alongside Riki & Rin, and made to face a harsh reality. Refrain! brings an emotional end to this journey as a sequel that teaches a lesson.  The story of Refrain! is a sequel to the first season, Little Busters!, where Riki and Rin embark on a path as they become disillusioned by the truth of the world they live in. Continuing their pursuit in discovering the ""Secret of the World,"" they are met with revelations of tragedy that they must overcome. It is a story that has been given a dose of the traditional KEY, a visual arts studio, supernatural elements to it. These elements are blended into such themes as ""growing up,"" and ""becoming stronger,"" among other motifs, that seem to centralize on the idea of adolescence. In essence, this is a story of friendship of the main Little Busters gang, as well as Riki and Rin's maturity and how they must bear leaving their childhood behind. In the bulk of Refrain!, the focus of the story is narrowed down to five main characters- Riki, Rin, Masato, Kengo, and Kyousuke. Each character whose actions and rationalizations are symbolically linked to how people tend to face the concept of adolescence. Riki and Rin are the two who go through this process of growing up. They are challenged by Kyousuke and Kengo who exemplify different approaches to adolescence, while Masato acts as the neutral man between the polar ends. In detail, Kyousuke represents the parents who want their children to develop their strength and become independent enough to face reality. Kengo represents the parents who want to shelter their children and protect their innocence from reality.  What really made me fall in love with Little Busters was the character interactions as well as their inner thoughts. I believe this is where the Little Busters excel the most at. A noticeable improvement from the first season is the better animation and focus on each character's emotions and their reactions. To name a few- Kengo and Kyousuke's altercation, and Kurugaya's out of character rage were conveyed and executed so well that it sent shivers down my spine when I heard their outbursts. Another instance of great execution is during the Little Busters' final baseball game where Kengo and Kyousuke break character from their usual stoic demeanor as they burst in to tears. That and the animation that accompanied their breakdown also brought me to tears as they, and the audience, take the full brunt of emotions over the realization of their departure. I also must credit Kyousuke's episode which is dedicated to his monologue; Kyousuke's trembling voice and tonal shifts along with his reaction to his own reflection was stunning to me. While not up to par, to me it was reminiscent to Kyon's self-questioning monologue in Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi. All of this is to be attributed to the spectacular work of the voice actors and the ability to animate what were originally still images(CGs) from the visual novel. However, not all scenes were done well and to say the characters were done perfectly would be a lie. There were several scenes that appeared as if their emotions were out of place if not forced. And while such scenes may have been the result of pacing issues, it is unfortunate to see characterization suffer as a result of pacing a one cour. That said, despite some parts being rushed, the characters were incredibly well done.  One thing that really stands out about Key works is Jun Maeda. His music seems to strike all the right chords during the right moments in these adaptations. This wouldn't be possible however, without Rita. The two worked together on the music for the VN, and while bringing it over to an adaptation still conveyed the right emotions during the animated scenes. While the music was fantastic, the sound department was lacking. I'll be a bit nitpicky here but sound does encompass background noise. Little nuances like having the sound of thunder/lightning/firework come at the same time as the light is simply lazy editing that could have been avoided. This, as well as certain sound inconsistencies aren't too noticeable, but nonetheless makes the overall adaptation seem lazy.  Little Busters: Refrain! has set the bar of expectations high for its adaptation due to the loyalty of the fanbase towards the Visual Novel. As a result, people who are only interested in the anime are given this illusion that the adaptation will grant the same feelings and emotions that were evoked from the VN. While the effect is different for every person, keep in mind that one shouldn't compare works made with a different medium. This is the trap that visual novel readers tend to create for adaptations, and the same applies to adaptations of light novels and mangas. So take Little Busters! Refrain as its own story, it was well done and conveyed what it wanted despite small inconsistencies here and there.  8.5/10";Recommended
18;Little Busters! Refrain;Willthemost;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Willthemost;10;SPOILERS This anime, right here, is the single biggest improvement from a season one to a season two I've ever seen.  Something I hate in anime is when fans compare an anime to a different anime, just because it was made by the same company. Whenever a new show adapting a key visual novel is announced, everyone just instantly compares it to Clannad and Clannad after story. I think this is unfair, because this show, while having many very similar aspects was its own show and should be taken as such. Anyways, onto the review. Little busters was a nice little high school drama show, but suffered from unoriginality and some of the sad moments felt forced to me. This is all fixed in the second season, where all the buildup done in season one pays off for a very satisfying conclusion.  Story- *MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD* 9.5 (rounded to ten on the ratings) This story took everything wrong with the original's story, and fixed it. It took the biggest problems, the unoriginality, and got rid of it. This follows directly after season one, and really just changes things up immediately. It starts off a bit slow, but then immediately really picks up. Once Riki realized that Kyouske was the one who sent Rin off to the other school, he completely hated Kyouske and for a while it looked like he was going to be the main villain. A very well done red herring. Another awesome idea was the plot twist in episode 11. The plot twist in episode 11 completely shattered the foundations and destroyed everything you thought you knew about little busters, and really was just well executed and unexpected. It also seems to have much more mystery than any other drama I've seen, which I commend it for. Everything that happens happens for a reason, and it comes together to make one of the best stories I've ever seen in anime.  Art-8 The art style for this show is good, the animation is nice and fluid, and everything just worked well. The problem is that nothing about this stands out, it just all seems plain and like all the other key adaptations. Not bad, actually its good, but it didn't do anything new.  Sound- 9.5 The soundtrack for this anime was just amazing. There were many amazing songs, but the real stand out ones for me were lamplights and boys don't cry. Boys don't cry was Kyouske's theme, and it really sums up his character very nicely and was just nice to listen to. Lamplights however, is one of my favorite songs in any anime. It reminds me a lot of Lost My Pieces from Toradora, another one of my favorite songs and it just gives me the feels so much when I listen to it.  Characters- 10 (Spoilers) This is, without a doubt, Little Busters strong point. Little Busters Refrain has possibly my favorite cast of characters in anime history, they are all just amazing. Riki is a fairly normal main character, but the rest of the characters are amazing. Rin starts off really shy and not wanting to see the world, but she gradually opens up and becomes a likable female lead. Inohara seems to just be a dumb muscle head, but he turns out to be very well developed and more than meets the eye. Kengo is the exact opposite of Inohara, he looks like a calm and collected martial artist, but is actually very simple and not that smart. Finally, there is Kyouske. Kyouske is one of the best characters I've ever seen in an anime. He kind of reminds me of Kamina from Gurren Lagann, my favorite character of all time, because he always seems to be leading people and tries to help people improve themselves. In season one, he was very upbeat and was kind of a badass. However, in season two so much stuff happens with his character. At some points they make him look the villain, and quite a formidable one at that. He always knows what is going to happen and what is going on in the world somehow. However, he is actually just a very nice guy who wanted Rin and Riki to grow up before facing reality and making it so they can stand on their own.  Enjoyment- 10 I enjoyed this anime so much. All of the characters and the way they interacted really just made this a fun watch and kept me watching.  Overall-9.2 This anime was a fun watch with a great story and fantastic characters. If you haven't seen it yet, I would highly recommend it, it's one of the best dramas I've ever seen. It is very sad, but an extremely interesting and fun watch.;Recommended
19;Little Busters! Refrain;-pyrrhomaniac-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-pyrrhomaniac-;7;After the predictability and lightheartedness of the first season I was pleasantly surprised with the story and tone of the second season. The characters were definitely developed better and there was more of a purpose or driving-factor to the story line.  I feel like the message gets a bit jumbled up in the works. Riki and Rin are the focus of LB Refrain, and we watch them progress as the plot unfolds. I feel like much of what they learn is lost however in the end of the series. They finally learn to face reality as it is, but then the story lets itself off the hook and creates something that just feels rushed. I would have given LB Refrain a significantly higher score if it weren't for the last episode.  The whole series was entertaining to watch, and had some fantastic characters. It's a shame that the ending is the way it is, but I guess audiences will definitely eat it up.;Recommended
0;Little Busters! Refrain;nishfx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nishfx;6;Once in a while, I find myself craving for good drama with at least a decent story depth and a somewhat intense atmosphere. Apart from the latter, Little Busters ~Refrain~ was not able to deliver.  There's one thing in particular that is always inherent to KEY anime: borderline drama. In some cases (Clannad, Kanon), this drama plays out well because it feels genuine. In other cases (Angel Beats!, LB ~Refrain~), it is forced upon the viewer with all one's might and consequently feels artificial. While I must admit that Refrain does have its strengths, especially in terms of plot twists and tension, the characters totally fail along the way, which is the primary reason the drama that is being told here sadly mutates into something melodramatic.  When there is one thing about the story that I have to point out as a definite success, it is the way the 'secret to the world' is being uncovered step by step in a very consistent pace. With each episode, the viewer gets drawn more and more into the mess with which the LB gang struggles to cope. This is the reason why there is a rather intense atmosphere to be felt that encourages to jump to the next episode and continue watching. Nevertheless, despite the decent idea underlying the story and the well planned-out conclusion, that, what was intended to be its greatest strength - the dramatic climax - turned out to be the most significant disappointment. That is not because of how the story was written, but first and foremost a result of poorly conceptualized main characters.  I really love the drama in Clannad ~After Story~, but even there it becomes apparent how clichéd the (side) characters were designed to be. In Refrain this blatantly swaps over and affects the entire main cast, which is simply not acceptable. The fact that it is possible to summarize the personality of the main characters with one, at most two sentences is something that not only prevents the characters from driving the story forward, but has also a strong negative impact on the perceived credibility of the entire thing. The emotional attachment and the ability to relate to characters is what makes drama dramatic, when the appropriate plot elements are introduced. Refrain leaves it at presenting tearjerking scenes, which are emotional because of their nature and the viewers' cognitive associations, and not because there is genuine drama inherent to the content of the show.  Well, but if someone perceives the emotional impact of an anime - be it artificial or genuine - as its quality, it is basically a good thing, isn't it? Basically yes. The good thing about Refrain is its level of entertainment and the degree to which most people enjoy this series. Only a minority of the viewership actually thinks about whether the drama is rather artificial than genuine. That is why Refrain can without fail be recommended as an anime that has the ability to entertain in various ways. In my rating, however, I give credit to those anime that succeed in thinking things through. Moving someone to tears is simple, building a structure of attachments between the viewer and the characters and killing it off is something that requires method.  Unfortunately, considering that I always loved at least the technical aspect of KEY anime, Refrain, in contrast to previous works, disappointed here as well. A mediocre (beautiful but not noticeably varying) soundtrack, a standard-type ending song, and a slightly more original opening song with some build-up tension don't suffice to warrant a higher rating. Even in terms of visuals, Refrain is sloppy. We live in times of high quality productions, yet Refrain - with its highly emotional content - doesn't make use of the potential that a decent colorization offers to shows like these. Camera angles, transitions, character design, there's nothing that reminds me of the quality of KEY's previous works. Apart from these comparisons, Refrain as a standalone series is definitely enjoyable in terms of arts.  I was looking forward to Refrain, since it ranks among the best anime on MAL, but it yet again turned out to be a tearjerker without substance. Tearjerkers are perceived very differently by the anime audience. Those who actively search for meaningful, authentic drama won't be satisfied by watching Refrain, while those who predominantly value the emotional impact a show (forcefully) produces discover a first-class series. One reason for the great success of Refrain might be the huge improvement since season one. Personally, I really enjoyed watching Refrain because of its atmosphere, but in each and every episode I was reminded of the fact that this cannot in any way be compared to Clannad. It lacks passion and method.  Rating: 6.32/10 (A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.);Mixed Feelings
1;Little Busters! Refrain;-Remix-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-Remix-;5;"Our past shapes who we are.  Really. It’s that simple. And this is what LB Refrain is all about.  After watching the first season of LB, I was seriously looking forward to the second season of LB. In the first season, you had a series of arcs that centered around nearly all of the LB’s new additions. These arcs – even though they used supernatural/surreal plot elements that were presented in a very Key-/visual-novel typical fashion – did flow surprisingly well as they were all built around the same common themes: friendship and identity. Sure, not too much character development for the original five members of LB (although there was some for the new additions, but definitely not fully flushed out – after their arc was over they didn’t change much anymore), but the plot was definitely solid.  But damn, the second season – talk about wasted potential.  The second season is the complete opposite: strong character development, but a super weak, unsubstantiated (haha get it because my username) plot.  The second season was arguably more moving and emotionally stirring than the first season, but to achieve this, it introduces a series of plot elements that are (1) poorly transitioned, (2) out of the blue, and (3) very deus ex machina. Sure, the same themes that were present in the first season are also here in the second season, but the plot (despite being built around these themes) is executed much, much worse than the first season. Kyousuke’s “powers”, for one, came out of nowhere. There were no hints during the first season that alluded to what Kyousuke could do. In the first season, Riki and Rin were only given “clues” and Riki knew something was up with Kyousuke, but we, as the viewers, are not given sufficient clues to Kyousuke’s true powers until halfway through the second season.  Another example of poor transitioning is towards the last three episodes when Riki and Rin “switch” worlds. If you’re just another average anime watcher like me, these last three episodes were pretty hard to follow. When you think Riki and Rin finally left the “fake” world into the “real” one, somehow, just somehow, one of them is able to transition back into the “fake” world to search for some lost clues. This transitioning was not only hard to follow, but personally I thought the “fake” world disappeared because of Kyousuke’s lack of control over his powers – so how are they able to go back into the “fake” world? Again, there are some plot elements like these are not fully explained and thus left me extremely confused.  Although Kyousuke’s little monologue towards the end of Refrain does string together these weird supernatural/surreal plot elements together, by this point in the series the damage is already done. Everything seems too coincidental, too artificial, and too forced for anything to seem even remotely coherent.  One more downside: the new, supporting members of LB play a significantly less role during the second season. They were pretty much the entire basis of the plot throughout the first season (since the friendship theme was only primarily explored through their presence); in the second season, they simply fall out of the picture. If they were better incorporated into the second season I feel like Refrain could have been even more impressive.  The plus side: very strong character development that is blatantly and obviously pointed out by Kyousuke. Throughout Riki and Rin’s arc, Riki and Rin grow, mature, and do what even Kyousuke thought was impossible. This character development is fully flushed out and is substantially better than the first season. Definitely a nice way to tie the entire series off.  Also: the art is still crisp and never ceases to amaze me. (Go J.C.Staff!) Some of the soundtrack is recycled from the first season, but the voice acting is still on point. No major complaints on that front.  So, to summarize, what is LB Refrain? It gives you feels just for the sake of feels and does so through a series of plot elements that doesn’t make any sense.  tl;dr  Pros: + Strong character development + Emotionally stirring + Strong thematic content that was present in the first season and also in Refrain Cons: - Questionable plot elements that are poorly explained/linked - Although the characters are developed well, the plot does not have an equal level of depth - Poor transitioning - Hard to follow, especially towards the end of Refrain - Supporting members drop in significance  Story: 4 Art: 6 Sound: 4 Character: 7 Enjoyment: 6 Overall: 5";Mixed Feelings
2;Little Busters! Refrain;cringeylazy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cringeylazy;6;"This review has very minor spoilers, which I have carefully and somewhat ambiguously worded to spoil the least amount possible. This review is from the perspective of a fan of the visual novel who rewatched the anime a year later.  Positives: -Kurugaya: Kurugaya's route isn't a very good adaptation, but it makes drastic changes that, in my opinion, improve upon some scenes from the visual novel. While yes, it is missing the great romance and the chemistry between Riki and Kurugaya it makes drastic changes to fit the anime story telling, which in my opinion works better as a whole for the story despite its very fast pacing compared to the VN. -Beautiful new original opening for this season with an original song. -Refrains story is all covered and unchanged. -It uses (mostly) the same soundtrack. -Komari and Rin's friendship building from season 1 into Refrain is a very nice touch that fans (including myself) appreciate. -As said for season 1, Riki's voice actor/actress change to Yui Horie is an improvement; her voice suits the role better. -There's a minor improvement in animation in general from the last season.  Negatives: -Massive lack of CGs referenced. I can only think of 3 of the many many CGs in the VN that actually get used as references. They would have drastically fixed a lot of the poor production. -Komari and Rin: My favourite scene in Little Busters as a whole is entirely and utterly obliterated by horrendously brushing over the scene. The most ridiculous part is that they spend 15 minutes building up to it really well, adapting the VN almost perfectly, but don't flesh out my favourite scene in the series. Making it feel soulless. Also, the direction/story boarding is awful, with really weird camera angles. Are we supposed to just use the CGs in the game? It looks so tacky. -Rin 2 not adapted fully: Rin and Riki's scene in Kyousuke/Rin's grandparents house is supposed to go over the course of 3 days, not one evening. Ruining Riki and Rin's character building for the conclusion (making it less impactful). -Kyousuke's backstory reveal: It looks like it's made in Windows Movie Maker because of the weird editing used for added content for flashbacks. It looks more like a fancam than a series scene. The climax scene of the series: While it is a good adaptation of the story and follows the VN the production quality looks bad, not awful. But it's remarkable how the PNGs in the VN tell the story better than the full animated production. A lot of the camera work is poorly directed, as if it's some sort of fanfilm or a student project. It clearly has some passion behind it but it looks so messy. Mostly, the way characters fade on screen looks very tacky and unprofessional. It would have worked a lot better to moving the camera or changing the focus (like Angel Beats for example). -Rin and Riki rescue scene: Changed soundtrack ruining the tone of the scene. (I won't complain about not seeing the bad end in the VN as that's difficult to replicate in anime format.) This is carried over from the first season, but the different art style lacks the charm of the VN.  Overall, the anime for Refrain, while I do think it is the best adapted content of the visual novel I think for an anime adaptation, it's mediocre at best; the production quality is a worse way to experience the story than just reading the visual novel, where it's a much better experience of essentially the same thing. Even though it's essentially PNGs over actual moving animated frames, VN has better visuals overall, over the anime adaptation. While this is a mostly negative review, this adaptation is definitely serviceable compared to a lot of worse adaptations for things out there, but I still think it's a mess that could have easily been a lot better with a little more thought put into it. Before reading the visual novel, I originally had the anime at a 9 and even during reading it, I thought it was a good adaptation. The reason why is because story wise it was ,it's visually I'd forgotten how it'd looked.  My Anime vs VN Ratings: Kurugaya route - anime: 8.5/10 VN: 7.5/10 Refrain - anime: 6/10 VN: 9.5/1 (If you would like to see my short review of the VN check out my backloggd or vndb)";Mixed Feelings
0;Little Busters! Refrain;cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;3;"Quick Thoughts: I strongly dislike the type of storytelling that's reliant on some plot twist or info-dump at the end for the story to make sense, and Little Busters!: Refrain was no exception.  Story: The pacing was incredibly off this season. The first few episodes were fine; the typical 3 or so episodes were spent developing Kurugaya, which is about the same amount as the other characters. However, the next 3 episodes blaze through what I thought was a pretty important arc, with one notably climatic moment being condensed into just a four minute outro. Then there's the ending, which I felt gave many more questions than answers. It also makes a lot of what happened throughout the series seem pointless and unnecessary. The motives behind the key characters of this season were questionable at best. There's one bit of foreshadowing that I thought was pretty neat, but that doesn't make up for how unsatisfying this ending was.  Characters: In the moment, I kind of liked seeing the main cast develop, and their motives become clearer as Riki slowly figures out the ""secret of the world"", but as mentioned before, I felt the ending invalidated a lot of this. Rin is probably the best example this, but it applies to most of the cast. Several main characters get much less screentime, and the reasoning for this seemed arbitrary at best.  Enjoyment: I'll say it again and again, the ending really did suck a lot of enjoyment out not just this season, but the series as a whole. Some non-story related elements were enjoyable though; The art/animation maintained its quality, and soundtrack hard-carried the emotional tone of the season.";Not Recommended
0;Little Busters! EX;Antarcticite_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Antarcticite_;9;"~Spoiler Free~  An anime adaptation of the new route additions in key's visual novel - Little Busters!: Ecstasy, Little Busters!: EX is a good summary of the arcs in the visual novel, however it cannot be compared to the masterpiece of which the VN is. That being said, covering three entire arcs over only 8 episodes of such an amazing visual novel cannot realistically be of the same standard as the visual novel. However, the eight episodes are indeed still of very high quality.  The expectations I had for this anime, were naturally very high given that I had just watched Little Busters!: Refrain, now one of my favourite animes that I have watched so far. However, I was not disappointed, and was instead met with an anime definitely worth the wait of one month per episode for. Little busters EX, although not nearly as sad as Refrain; still builds onto the series wonderfully and does it justice.  The characters in this anime are in a word, incredible. Keeping in line with the original series, each and every character has a tragic background that is completely contrary to the facade they portray in public at first. However as the main character (Riki) progresses, their facade is removed and their past is revealed. Choice of music in Little busters EX, like the original, is amazing, and Jun Maeda should be commended for this. If you liked air, angel beats or clannad, it is likely that you will enjoy little busters EX too. The art style is the same across the series, and is quite good.  The only con of this anime, would be that the second and third arcs could be a bit longer, as two episodes each can not adequately cover their stories in as much detail as I would like. That being said, they are still made very well. Saya's story however, is told across the first four episodes. This is probably because she is entirely new to the series, while the other two main heroines of little busters EX appeared in the original series, though only briefly.  If you have not yet seen this brilliant anime, then you should really stop reading this review and go watch it. However, if you haven't already, watch the original series first (Little busters and Refrain). Also, if you have the time, definitely give the visual novel a try as it explores all the characters in greater detail than the animes. However, currently Little Busters Ecstasy has not been fully translated yet.";Recommended
1;Little Busters! EX;HaXXspetten;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HaXXspetten;7;"Ecstasy is an 8-episode sequel/expansion to Little Busters, taking place before, during and after the events of the original story. For various plot-related reasons however, you should not watch this before you've finished the first series as well as its second season Little Busters Refrain, as Ecstasy's plot goes under the assumption that the viewer is fully aware of the events taking place during Refrain. If you watch them in any other order you will end up getting spoiled.  Ecstasy adds three new arcs to the Little Busters story, two of which are focused on the already well familiar Sasasegawa Sasami and Futaki Kanata respectively, but one revolves around an entirely new character named Tokido Saya. Therefore you can easily split up the series into three separate parts and talk briefly about them independently which is what I'm going to do here.   Saya's route: eps 1-4  Half of the anime consists of Saya's route which is the first one off the bat. Saya is a very energetic and self-torturing mayadere character, which is an extraordinarily rare trope to ever stumble upon, but she's extremely entertaining and funny to see in action. The first thing you'll notice about this arc is how vastly different it is compared to all the other arcs of Little Busters. In fact it's much more similar to Angel Beats by having cute girls, guns and action. The story is about a giant underground labyrinth located beneath the school where mysterious shadows lurk, and a rumored treasure supposedly existing somewhere inside it which Riki and Saya together are trying to find. The only problem with this is that in the original visual novel, Saya's route is actually a dungeon crawling RPG containing a map system, traps, puzzles, shooting games and more, and none of this really translates into an anime format very well which makes the atmosphere feel a bit awkward at times.  Overall this route is still very enjoyable and a breath of fresh air compared to what the main series has to offer, but it suffers a bit from adaptation issues and some slight rushing. That being said it's still a very good arc.  Final score: 8/10   Sasami's route: eps 5-6  The ever so loveable Sasami finally gets her own arc here, but sadly it ends up being extremely disappointing for the simple reason that the adaptation is rushed beyond belief. Her route revolves around her being transformed into a cat for some unknown supernatural reason which she and Riki has to figure out and deal with together. This is actually a very emotional story in the visual novel, but here it sadly misses its mark completely because there is no time for the viewer to get emotionally attached to Sasami as a character or the story itself because the arc is already over after a mere two episodes. So unfortunately this arc is kind of butchered.  Final score: 6/10   Kanata's route: eps 7-8  Last but not least we have Kanata's arc... actually that's wrong, this is definitely the ""least"" of the three stories as it's actually incredibly bland and boring. Again this is only two episodes long, but in this case that is not the issue; rather her arc is really bad in the visual novel as well. It's basically just a rehash of Haruka's route but from her sister's perspective instead, as Kanata's route is also revolving around her family problems. The problem here however is that there's almost nothing happening in this story from start to finish, and it just feels like the whole thing was slapped on there because they could, not because they wanted to.  Final score: 4/10   Overall, if you liked the original Little Busters as well as its second season Little Busters Refrain, then I still encourage you to pick this up. It's only 8 episodes long after all, it's not like it can hurt very much. Just don't put your expectations on it too high, consider this more as a bonus than anything else.  Better still of course would just be to play the visual novel as it is a lot better in the end, but at the time of writing this Ecstasy hasn't been fully translated quite yet so you'll have to wait a while longer for that, if you can't read Japanese that is.";Recommended
2;Little Busters! EX;jc9622;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jc9622;8;"After seeing all the 8 episodes, I'm just going to assume that these 3 routes are non-canon. I tried to put this routes in the chronological order along with the first season of LB and Refrain and it's completely impossible.   [Story]: (6/10) Little Busters: EX is an anime adaptation of a visual novel called ""Little Busters: Ecstasy"". Were they on Ecstasy when they made the VN? What's with the name? Anyways, it added 3 ""new"" heroines. Notice the quotation marks? Yea, 2 of the 3 heroines are not even new. 1 new character that was added is Saya (we'll get more into her in the characters category) and the 2 ""new"" characters are Sasami and Kanata which we have already seen in the first season of LB. There are 3 new heroines, meaning that the show has 3 arcs.  The 1st arc which is Saya's arc, lasted for about 4 episodes. No surprise, Riki comes in and helps Saya get the treasure inside the underground labyrinth. There are more things that happened between Rikki and Saya but I don't want to spoil the scenes. The ending of the arc.....well......all I want to say is they tried to make everything dramatic but failed to do so.  The 2nd arc which is Sasame's arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. Sasame asks Rikki for help after she finds out that she has been turning into a cat for unknown reasons. Again, I don't want to spoil this arc. The ending of this arc ended on a happy note, reuniting Sasame and her cat.  The 3rd arc which is Kanate's arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. If you saw her past in LB then you shouldn't be surprised that this arc will again focus on her past and her family. I mean, it's all the same but the EX goes more in-depth, showing that she has been on her sister's side all this time. The ending of this arc, again, ended on a happy note. Instead of Rikki helping Kanata alone, the whole Little Busters crew helped her.  Now my thoughts on the arcs. The only arc that I liked is Saya's arc because of Saya, the romance, and the bad-ass gun action scenes. I didn't really like the remaining 2 arcs that much because of how boring it is. Hell, I find Sasame's arc ridiculous. You'll find out if you see the ending of Sasame's arc. Kanate's arc was so poorly thought out. It's like they run out of ideas or something. Kanate's arc is mostly the same as Haruka's arc except it just goes more in-depth and tried to be more dramatic. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Art/Animation]: (9/10) The Animation is exactly the same as Refrain's animation so I'm not going to write my opinions on the animation again. It's on my Refrain review. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Sound]: (9/10) The background themes are mostly the same but there are new ones, used for the action scenes in Saya's arc. The OP theme song used in EX is exactly the same as LB's OP but there's a slight difference. The OP in EX is more of a rock version. I personally love the OP here than the OP in LB because of those electric guitar in the background. There are 4 ED's used in this show but I only liked the first one. I didn't really like the remaining 3 ED's. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Characters]: (8/10) The show only focuses on 3 characters but Saya got a lot more development and a more screentime. Saya is an attractive and a popular girl in school due to her attractive face and her figure. . However, at night, she can be found at the school, wandering around in order to obtain a ""treasure"" from those she calls the ""Darkness Executives"", and even has to fight them for it. Just like LB, something tragic happened in her past and I don't want to spoil it. It's kind of dramatic but not that sad, in my opinion. Sasame which we know in LB as a cat-hater is really not a cat-hater. She had his reasons. Kanata is the chairman of the public morals committee and head of the girls' dormitory but you should already know that. The show just goes more in-depth with her character, her past and explains why she ""that"" personality. Out of the 3 heroines, I personally liked Saya more because she's more of a bad-ass compared to Sasame and Kanata --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Enjoyment]: (8/10) I personally enjoyed EX for the first 4 episodes because of Saya's arc but it just got boring during Sasame's arc and Kanata's arc. I did enjoy the ending of EX. We get to see the Little Busters crew work together to help Kanata. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [OVERALL]: (8/10) If you watched Little Busters and Little Busters: Refrain then you might want to check this out. It's not as dramatic or tear-jerking as Refrain but it's still quite an enjoyable side-story anime.   Pros: +Great Animation +Great Soundtrack +Saya's arc is well done +Enjoyable action scenes  Cons: -The last 2 arcs are mediocre -Forced Dramatic moments -Character arcs are rushed -Mediocre ending";Recommended
3;Little Busters! EX;Micsupreeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Micsupreeme;7;Right off the bat, similarly to refrain i would immediately recommend this to those who have watched the original series - as you'll be enthralled by this additional show consisting of yet again, well thought out, powerful and untold stories: of 3 supporting characters.  EX has a good blend of a spectrum of genres, from the start you'll be hit with a very cinematic, action packed main plot, and as you observe these other characters too, their untold relevance is seamlessly revealed. Fans of LB will be pleased to hear that yes, all of the base components well reflect that signature narration - a powerful hybrid between emotion, twists and dark sides.  As a special, you've probably already realized that this installment doesn't go on for too long, and so when the creators opened a building-full of great possibilities, they had to shut at least a few windows to fit everything in. The first told story line was definitely comprehensive, yet i can't help but feel that the remaining two were a tad rushed.  It is still a win for the viewers though, a special series that will further enrich your knowledge on that faithful group of childhood friends. As i expected it was an enjoyable watch :)  Not really much else to say. So See You ^^;Recommended

Another fact is that, I believe Rin as rikki's supremecy, but saya comes from nowhere and takes the place.Are you kidding me, They give this much key point to rin and rikki relationship , and give another lovey dubby rote to rikki.  The best thing I liked is Kanata's route , which is coming from First half of her story is before Refrain and second half is after Refrain. I just love the love the way they help kanata from the forced wedding, and the ending scene, Is just too perfect.  Bonding is what Little busters Means!;Recommended
0;Little Busters! EX;ProfaneValkyrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProfaneValkyrie;6;No Spoilers or only minor.  Little busters! Ex is the third season/OVA after little busters refrain, here the show tells us 3 different stories, two are about some supporting characters Futaki Kanata and Sasasegawa Sasami from the main series, and a totally brand new heroine Tokido Saya (More for the litttle buster haram XD).  So yeah if you have seen first and second season of little busters! then this is somewhat quite recommended even though I think when the stories are so short that it is hard to get the feels which the series tries to give us. The feels in this OVA series is nothing compared to the ending of Refrain.l  the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things - More in depth story about two supporting characters which we only did know a little bit about from the main series. - It did keep a somewhat same overall feel of little busters! (only difference being that the little busters group wasn´t that important in the two first stories which was a little bit weird compared to the main series) - Me myself loved the story about Sasasegawa Sasami, Nekotears!! <3  The flip coin - either cons or pros depending on your taste. - 2/3 of the stories was not a haram route meaning that is wasn´t about Riki getting a new girl (I liked that because then it didn´t make everything urealistic haram ish) - The Futaki Kanata story did end very optimistically happily (maybe a little bit too unrealistic which annoys me, but you may like it :3 )  All the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons - The Tokido Saya story was for me very weird? Riki seemed out of character (He was dummy like, didn´t really ask or reacted normally to all the weird things happening around him (I don´t understand why he fell in love with her and the other way around) and many things didn´t really make any sense. - The 2 last stories about the supporting characters were waaaayy too short, it was hard to get a really satisfying story.  So yeah if you like to see more of little busters and the same key studio style of story building and feels, then go ahead. But you won´t really miss anything (maybe only the last story about Futaki Kanata which gives a ending of unfinished business in the main story);Mixed Feelings
0;Little Busters! EX;-Remix-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-Remix-;4;"Little Busters!: Ecstasy is an additional (and likely final) eight episode addition to the Little Busters franchise that was coupled with the DVD release of Refrain. Although LB! EX certainly had its moments, its ultimate downfall was due to its script writing. Simply put, the plot was not strong enough to keep the show flowing in a straightforward, unidirectional manner.  Before I jump to my criticisms, I want to say briefly that I certainly enjoyed LB! EX. In fact, I watched it twice just to make sure I'm not imagining any of the cons that I listed, but unfortunately, they are there, and there are some pretty glaring issues that I can't ignore.  The main issue I had with LB! EX was the same issue I had with the first and second seasons of LB (and pretty much any VN from Key that is adapted). By trying to incorporate a bunch of supernatural elements into the plot line, we are ultimately left with, frankly, a mess that doesn't follow any coherent flow. A good example of this in Saya's arc. Yet despite having the most screen time of the three heroines, Saya's arc was by far the weakest arc simply because there are a lot of unanswered questions that forced us to accept things at face value. For instance, how and why exactly does Saya come into existence? Who exactly are the Darkness executives, and why are they such an integral part of this world? And why was Saya able to make it out at the very end of her arc? Frankly, any creator that leaves so many open questions cannot argue that they have a strong, well-written script, no matter how feels-y or charming it can get.  Fortunately, LB! EX is not all bad. The other two heroines, Kanata and Sasami, finally get some much needed screen time. Although the two of them showed up every now and then throughout the first season, they are the stars of their respective arcs and we get to learn substantially more about their past. For Kanata, it's a continuation of the first season - that is, what we learned about Kanata's past in the first season gets even more depth. In the first season, we learned about why Kanata has such a tough exterior for her personality, and LB! EX builds on this by describing the sacrifices that Kanata made for her sister.  As for Sasami, we go straight to her past and learn about her bond with a stray cat that she took in at an early age. Unfortunate circumstances separate the two, but it is in Sasami's arc where the two reunite and resolve their differences.  The one thing I really liked about Kanata's and Sasami's arc is their consistency (in terms of their plot) to their parent story. As I've already indicated, Kanata's arc was a more in-depth description of her past and carries over some of what we learned about her in the first season. As for Sasami, her arc borrows the concept of the ""a new, secondary supernatural world that is controlled by one particular character"" from LB! Refrain. Although I still can't follow how such a world gets established (Refrain didn't explain this that well), the more important thing is that it's not a new concept that comes straight out of the blue.  As for themes, a lot of what is used is recycled from the previous two seasons. If you're looking for something new, something deeper, something more meaningful than the previous seasons you will definitely not find it here. Love and the testing of one's friendship are all concepts that we've seen not only in this show but in a lot of other anime out there. Although these two concepts are not executed worse than the other two LB seasons, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table either.  As for characters, well, frankly put - there's nothing really special here. Saya is your stock-of-the-mill tsundere who falls for Riki apparently because of the amount of time that they spent together during their childhood (this love development certainly could have been fleshed out more, but I'll just set that aside for now). Sasami and Kanata are a bit more realistic, but even so, I'm sure you could name other shows out there where you've seen cold/mysterious personalities.  As for character development, it's certainly present in LB! EX - to a degree. It certainly could have been fleshed out more, but you do have to remember that there are only eight episodes to LB! EX portioned into three separate arcs, so nothing truly spectacular can happen within that given frame. Still, Saya begins to open up to Riki towards the end of her arc (as with most tsunderes, lol); Kanata finally realizes the true meaning of sisterhood and friendship and how important the two are to her; and Sasami confronts her past, resolves it, moves on, and carries on with her life. At the end of Sasami's arc, you can see that she is clearly no longer held back by her past as she is more willing to take part in activities that she would have obviously avoided during the first season of LB.  Obligatory statement regarding the art: it is well-illuminated, consistent, and well done. J.C.Staff is godly when it comes to art designs and certainly sets the standard high in the anime industry.  And sound: I wouldn't say there's anything too exceptional regarding the voice acting. It's consistent, like the artwork. I will say this, however: LB! EX probably has some of the most interesting and meaningful OP and ED that I've seen thus far. The lyrics that they use in each song apply directly to what is happening in the anime. Yes, okay the OP remixes the first season's OP, but it's an electric guitar. Come on. Who doesn't like electric guitars?  In conclusion, will you enjoy LB! EX? Certainly. I doubt you'd drop the show. If you're reading this, you're probably thinking about watching the series, which means you probably made it through the other two seasons just fine. But do I think it is the best thing ever? Nope.  Actually I take that back, maybe the electric guitar solo is the best thing ever.  tl;dr  Pros: + Some of the plot is consistent with previous seasons + More screen time to side characters that was direly needed + Some development + Good art + Electric guitars, just because  Cons: - Development could have been fleshed out more, but it passes - Some of the plot doesn't really make any sense and leaves unanswered questions - Stock-of-the-mill anime archetypes that aren't really original in the slightest  Overall: 4. Although consistent, the plot is simply too weak to stand on its own.";Not Recommended
1;Little Busters! EX;cringeylazy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cringeylazy;3;"Only 1/3 routes are well adapted. Why bother...  This is a spoiler-free review from the perspective of a fan of the visual novel who read EX routes in the VN before watching (Thank god).  The Ex routes in Little Busters are three additional routes unlocked after completing Refrain. In my opinion, they feature some of the best stories in Little Busters, but unfortunately, this anime adaptation of 2 of them is awful.  Saya: Saya's route in the VN is one of my favourite works from Maeda, despite its quirks. However, this route is already, from the get-go, very difficult to adapt arc because of how it's structured into the VN. But that still doesn't forgive the poor, low quality adaptation that we're offered. The anime adaptation for this route has major pacing issues because of its time constraints. While yes, it does follow the story, it rushes through it very fast, not giving time to develop Riki and Saya's feelings, resulting in their relationship feeling too comical and overall flat. While a lot of people agree Saya's ending in the VN is one of the highlights of reading it, the anime feels like a rushed mess that makes very little sense. Giving so little time to try to figure out what's going on for yourself in the plot, to become familiar and attached to the characters, and this results in a very weird story that feels not thoroughly thought out. It's not the worst adaptation in the world, but it's bad enough that I would rather you not watch it than only watch it over reading the VN.  I do want to mention some positives, though it does reference some CGs use the same soundtrack, including the infamous ED. I also much prefer Yui Horie's voice for Riki.  Sasami: Thankfully, ironically, albeit sandwiched between 2 awful adaptations, Saisami's arc is probably the best adapted route in the whole series (including S1 and Refrain). In the VN I found that this route went on a bit too long for what it was, but the anime gives the right amount of time for everything without leaving anything out. In fact, I even think it improved upon it by removing the weird sub-plot of Sasami suddenly loving Riki despite loving Kengo the entire rest of the series. The adaptation faithfully uses all the CGs and plays the story out faithfully, and it feels just as good as reading the VN. I can even recommend watching it over playing the route as it's significantly shorter, saving people time. Unlike every other arc/route in Little Busters, this is the only part I can confidently say that you wouldn't be missing out on anything (aside from the more charming art style, I suppose).  Kanata: Unfortunately, the good ends there. Kanata's route in the VN is my personal favourite route (aside from Refrain, of course), and its treatment in the anime is quite frankly an abomination. Kanata's route is probably the deepest, darkest-toned story in the game and has way too much content to cover  within the time the anime offers, which ends up coming across as insensitive and unwatchable to VN readers. The anime does cover all the key scenes, but it's like a highlight reel, leaving out all the substance that makes this route so good and makes those scenes so impactful. Leaving an awful aftertaste to end the series on, unlike the VN which was the complete opposite.  To Finish: I do like the new opening and ending sequences (using songs from the VN). The things this adaptation does carry over are good and fairly faithful. Like I said in my previous reviews, the art style loses the charm of the VN and the animation isn't anything to celebrate. I do think production quality is a bit better than Refrain, less weird editing and using more of the source materials CGs to go off was a welcome change. But the stories aren't given enough time at all; it ends up feeling insulting to fans of the VN and makes Little Busters look a lot worse than it actually is. Overall, I recommend watching Sasami's arc, as it's fun to see it faithfully animated, but for Saya and Kanata's, I'd rather you not watch them at all than choose to watch it over the VN  My Anime vs VN Ratings: Saya route - anime: 3.5/10 VN: 9/10 Sasami route - anime: 7.5/10 VN: 7.5/10 Kanata route - anime: 2/10 VN: 8.5/10 (If you would like to see my short review of the VN check out my backloggd or vndb)";Not Recommended
0;Little Busters!;Veronin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Veronin;7;"Over the past decade, visual novel studio 'Key' has seen much success for their work on titles such as Kanon, Clannad and Air. If you have watched or read any of these series, you will likely be familiar with Jun Maeda's distinctive form of dramatic storytelling.  Do not expect another Clannad: After Story. You will not find it here.  At first glance, there is one startling difference in Key's latest adaptation. It is not animated by Kyoto Animation, the studio responsible for handling the majority of Key adaptations. Instead, the esteemed and beloved (not really) J.C. Staff is at the helm. For many this is a name that will undoubtedly be a cause for concern. In Little Busters, it is.  The story follows the misadventures of Riki and his four childhood friends. Set during the leader Kyousuke's final year in high school, the group of friends decide to make something of their remaining youth- not by overtly rebelling, but by practicing and playing baseball together. They cannot form a team with only five members though, which is why Riki and Rin are set to recruit more people from their school. Preferably females, as Rin is the only young lady in the group.  Little Busters' cast of characters is its strongest trait. No— not because they are especially well-written or unique, but because they are endearing- because they are entertaining. It isn't easy to make a group of anime characters feel like genuine friends with one another, but Little Busters manages to achieve this feat with its wonderful group dynamic. Even the later members contribute to the show in a significant and believable way. The characters truly do make the lighthearted segments a joy to watch.  Being part comedy, it's a good thing that the jokes are often fresh and clever. Of particular note is Masato. If you remember Sunohara from Clannad, he is a bit like that. Masato and all his muscular glory (and utter lack of brain cells) are the cause for many jokes. Usually at his expense. And usually met with a kick to the face from Rin.  It's a shame, since any appeal the show has is frequently pushed aside in favour of cringeworthy melodrama. The individual character routes were not very good in the visual novel and they are most certainly not any good here either. It would be one thing if these arcs were merely mediocre, but with J.C. Staff's lack of directorial talent they are made absolutely dreadful. The omnibus format also does little to help the rushed pacing, resulting in a format that feels highly formulaic and superfluous. One of the girls has troubles, Riki helps them to overcome it, one or two episodes of comedy follow— repeat, repeat. Thankfully the lighthearted segments are so entertaining, as otherwise you would probably detest each character by the end of their route. It is that bad at times.  The two worst offenders are Mio's and Haruka's routes. In Mio's route, the viewer is treated with illogical and contradictory character actions further complimented by a hilariously contrived deception on the writer's part. Plotholes? Everywhere. And it does not even attempt to answer them with anything besides equivocation. The climax could maybe be explained if the characters were taking psychedelic drugs at the time, but looking at it from a realistic perspective it does not make any sense whatsoever. Watching Utena may be less confusing.  Haruka's route will also make you want to scream in frustration. Her tragic backstory is implausible (why the hell were the people taking care of her not convicted of abuse?) and the motivations of the antagonist, Kanata, are silly at best. The rest of the route is comprised of more cheap plot twists and embarrassingly cliche melodrama. Heck, there's even a scene where the weather changes from sunshine to storm as soon as Haruka starts crying. How much more cheesy can you get? Little Busters seems to experiment with the limits.  Things do improve, though. After a decent start and two terrible arcs, the last third of the story provides a satisfying dénouement showing how each of the characters have grown over the course of the series. The last episode in particular is quite nice, with the long-awaited baseball game being played in high spirits. Some might argue that this improvement is too little too late. They might be right.  One area where Little Busters does not disappoint is with its soundtrack. There may not be anything on the same level of ""Dango Kazoku"" to mess with your emotions, but the soundtrack as a whole is solid and surprisingly memorable. Then again, it's pretty hard to make mistakes when you are deriving almost all music from the source material.  Little Busters' endearing characters are complimented by a highly talented cast of seiyuu. Yui Horie provides a convincing role for a male character (though does little to make Riki any less bland) while Masato's seiyuu does a wonderful job at delivering the comedy. Rin and Kud on the other hand will probably kill your heart from how adorable they sound.  There isn't much to praise about the art, but it certainly isn't bad. Just average. Just middling. For a TV anime it is passable, but when comparing it to previous Key adaptations you will definitely notice a significant drop in quality. Off-model faces are frequent and many scenes are reduced to panning and 'talking heads': devoid of any animation besides the character's mouth flapping. For an adaptation of one of the most successful visual novels, you would normally expect the artwork to at least be above-average. Not here.  As an adaptation, it is worth mentioning how it compares to the source material. Is it a bad adaptation? It is. If you want to experience the story as it is intended, it would be in your best interests to give the visual novel a read instead. On its own merits and as a condensed version of the story, however, J.C. Staff's adaptation is merely passable. It doesn't completely butcher the story but with the rushed pacing, poor characterization (especially with regards to Riki), lackluster art and incomplete story— most of the charm that made the visual novel so beloved is nonexistent here. At least there's more cute Rin scenes, though! Maybe that is the one and only good thing.  Little Busters will not be winning any awards for its writing or production qualities, but when taken as an entertaining comedy with likable characters, it is at least worth a watch. Putting aside the expectations, you will certainly find some enjoyment in Key's latest animated venture.  Hopefully, too, J.C. Staff won't let us down too much in the sequel. I can think of few things that would be more disastrous.";Recommended
1;Little Busters!;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;7;"There are many things in this world that can break a person's heart. Whether it's a tragedy, a memory, a breakup, a betrayal, or just because, these things can affect an individual's well being beyond repair. It's not like a physical injury where the wound heals. It's emotional and affect's a person's heart. Once that's damaged, it can be very difficult or in many cases, become unhealable. Luckily though, there are ways to go through this process.  For starters, friends are probably one of the best medicines. In fact, friends are one of the most valuable things that should be treasured in this world. It's not purchased at your local grocery store. It can't be collected like baseball cards. It can't be earned like points from a video game. Rather, a friend is a someone who looks after your well being and someone that you hold mutual affection for. When you're having a bad day, they are there for you and someone who can understand the situation. Through friendship comes forth a connection as people learn more about each other and more about themselves. If you look back through those memories and your photo albums, you might remember some of those memories of childhood. These memories that are built with your friends are irreplaceable and as long as you treasure them, nothing can take that away. With these friends, you learn to climb the stairs to adolescence through experiences while learning about the world. You know what that's called?  It's called growing up.  At last it's here! Fan of the popular Little Busters visual novel have always dreamed the possibility of an anime adaptation. Now, that dream has become a reality. The long awaited LB visual novel has become an anime series. The series is handed by J.C. Staff (Toradora! Sakurasou Pet no Kanojo, Hatsukoi Limited) who are already known for their high school settings involving students in a lighthearted environment in a zone of drama, comedy, romance, and emotions. Now, this could cause some mixed feelings for people especially for die-heard fans coming from the visual novel. In fact, the visual novel released in 2007 became ranked second for national PC game pre-orders in Japan as well as holding the number one top seller spot that summer. The polls set up later that year also gave the franchise a strong impression in all categories with the exception of visuals in terms of its rankings. This may all sound impressive but can the anime series live up the hype? Can Little Busters gives the fans what they want and deserve? Or rather, how can it be appealing to the fans (both VN players and anime original fans)? Is it worth watching? These may all be questions some people may wonder about. Well, let us find out what Little Busters offers from its anime adaptation.  First of all, the series is based off of a Key's work. They are known to bring viewers to tears with their strong emotional dialogue, visuals, and the soundtrack to present them in a way that is heartwarming. In fact, their previous works such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad (with its sequel Clannad After Story) all accomplished this in some way or form that have left a strong impression of emotions to fans. In this adaptation though, there seems to be a bit of lacking in that department. In fact, this series seem to shift more into the department of comedy rather than emotional appeal. Well, let's get to the part later but this is my original impression on the series after its first episodes.  LB takes place at a high school in Japan. From there on, we have Riki Naoe, the main protagonist of the series. He is a ordinary boy with nothing much to stand out with his features; the girlish look, expressions, weak build that can sometimes can be mistaken as a trap when dressed in a specific way. Furthermore, he has a sad past that we can call a tragedy considering the death of his parents when he was young. He also suffers from a case of narcolepsy, where he suffers from a lack of sleep. Yet at the same time, we can see that Riki is a very kind boy who is gentle and has a tendency to help others in need. As fate calls for it, Riki is helping to recruit others with his group of friends known as the Little Busters.  The team has it all.  We have the muscle and hotheaded member of the group - Masato Inohara. He is a roommate of Riki and a devoted friend of his. Often known for his quick anger and strange ideas, Masato is seen as loyal and sometimes a little bit too enthusiastic with things related to his friends and himself. We have Kengo Miyazawa whose loyalty is unmatched by anyone in terms of devotion to the team. His skills in kendo is one to be feared coupled with his personality. Then, there's Kyousuke Natsume who is known as the leader of the team. He is seen as the senpai (because he is older) and often has a head of strange ideas that can be abnormal. Yet, it is clear that Kyousake has the guts and skills to be the leader for his ways of thinking and loyalty. Now, that's just the boys side. Let's get to the ….*ahem* better part: the ladies of the team.  The main female protagonist in the series is Kyousuke's little sister, Rin Natsume. She is seen as a timid girl with weak social skills and often or not, hangs out with cats which is she highly fond of. Despite this, she is skilled with pitching and values the friends as well as the experiences she shares with her friends. Then we have the more childish girl Komari who is often seen as a clumsy little kid but often makes a fun impression on the viewers with her expressions and gags. Behind that image though lies a dark past, one which has left a trail of pain and sorrow. In one episode, it even caused her to go into a state of shock just based on that painful memory.  On the more serious side, there is Mio Nishizono, a calm girl who maintains a mature and reserved personality. Being a book lover, she often likes to read rather than hanging out with friends. Her parsol hides more than just her appearance as like others, she also has an interesting past that is explored later on. Likewise, we also have the more mature girl (and one of my personal favorites) Yuiko Kurugaya. Although the same age as others, she is seen as the older sister type with a replica of the katana for showing off her extra features. Despite being mischievous and almost a trickster at times, she knows when someone needs help and offers it without a second thought.  By this point now, a viewer can see the many characters of the series and get a good idea of their various personalities. I mean, LB has it all in terms of characteristics – the hotheaded guy, the mature oniisama, the cute little mascot, the shy cat-loving girl, the normal boy who has a not-so normal health, and the leader who brings them all together. However, the problem lies in some of their characters being one-dimensional. The high school outfits most of the characters wear are also a bit generic in the sense that they don't stand out much. Except perhaps the school council president, most of the characters hardly cares about the way they are dressed at school. It is amusing at the same time though to watch what they do with the team especially out on the field together.  Despite some of the action presented in the form of duels at school, the series often leans more towards the comedy department. From the first episode, we can see that the duels themselves has little serious risk on the line besides the bragging rights and earning an embarrassing name (lol). At often times, these duels are portrayed as being over the top humorous with the objects involved. The duels themselves are also often cliched and has no typical strategy involved. I have not played the visual novel but from this anime adaptation, it seems to try way too hard and at times too random. It works out at times but at other cases just seems too purposeless and unreasonable.  Because the series also takes place at high school, expect the common themes such as joining a club, making friends, relieving past memories, being school disciplined, and drama. Speaking of which, the series does occasionally pull itself through with the drama presented. J.C. Staff is known for some of their series that progresses drama in sequences. In Little Busters, it follows a similar fashion but only in arcs. The series itself takes these arcs and pinpoints individual characters who gets their highlights. In other words, it doesn't follow the usual linear storyline. Rather, it focuses on a more progressive character direction that is driven by LB's themes.  Unfortunately, the series suffers a number of problems that may be hard to redeem itself. The series often tries way too hard with its drama. In fact, one could call it as almost being artificially crafted from the the characters' development themselves. To add on more to that injury, there hardly is any development because some of the arcs either does one of the following: moves too slow or rushes it way too fast. It doesn't balance it together well. In fact, even some of the emotions portrayed in the various arcs lacks real passion with a weak feeling of realism. As there are even some filler episodes, the series lacks a true progression to fit material to be adapted. Then, there's the problem with the romance aspect of the show. For some reason, I cannot get into the feeling of romance into this at all. In fact, I hardly notice it being present because the show seems to focus far too much on comedy. Not to mention that, the moe like features, expressions, and sometimes random gags seems to become a distraction.  Then, there is a problem with adaptation. I have not played the original visual novel game even though it has a huge fan base. From the various comments, feedback, and other sources, the series seems to suffer a case of this especially involved with “things that should be there but aren't”. It's hard to meet everyone's expectations especially with a caliber of a series such as Little Busters but from an objective standpoint, that's not an excuse. J.C. Staff has a history of adaptations – some which transformed into a revolution while others dropped the ball. From the viewpoint of an anime-only viewer, I will say that J.C. Staff pulled off an alright adaptation. However, based on some technical backgrounds, the series just pulls way too many comedy with not enough what the fans actually may want. It's a bit of a disappointment but I guess we always can't get everything we want. To me though, this looked like a buildup to a greater medium.  The artwork of Little Busters comes together like a picture frame on a wall. It fits right but probably not all the way through especially in some of the earlier episodes. It does have its appealing imagery though especially with expressions on some of the characters' faces during various reaction scenes. For more of the fun factors, there is the moe incidences of some of the younger characters. The series adapts these scenes to seemingly give a lighthearted outlook because the series has a more pleasant feeling of fun and high school comedy. At other incidences though, there are serious scenes and even emotions especially in one of the later arcs. The background artwork seems only mediocre though and nothing seems to stand out. Along with the school uniforms, the series keeps itself with its generic designs.  As for music/soundtrack, the series maintains its composure of that lighthearted melody. Jun Maeda orchestrates the rhythms for the series whom is already known for his other works such as Air, Clannad, and Kanon. In general, I found the overall tone of the soundtrack to be above mediocre but not too unique. Most of the OST is lighthearted with a soft paced tone. Although beautiful and melancholic at many variances, it seems to be a bit repetitive and ultimately becomes somewhat overbearing in various scenes. It's almost as if the music is on repeat. The OP song, Little Busters! by Rita depicts the team members from the series formed by friendship, connections, and unity. It also shows some expressions from various characters that can be seen as melancholic or out of this world. (especially for Riki's case) The ED song follows a similar suit.  Ultimately, Little Busters is a charming little gem but occasionally loses its shine. By the way it portrays itself, the series suffers flaws from pacing, direction, a seemingly weak adaptation coupled with some edgy artwork problems. The series also misdirects and fails to bring emotions from what fans expected from the characters themselves. It's not pleasing when you realize that something so emotional can zoom so fast right through. The series does make its way with good comedy though and its colorful cast of characters. Along with that, LB brings for a heartwarming feeling to viewers especially when you're looking for something lighthearted to watch. The characters themselves forms the team known as Little Busters (the title of the anime itself) and with that, they walk down a future of dreams and friendship; at least for now.";Recommended

O.O )  Story:  So the main story revolves around this kid named ""Naoe Riki"" who is in high school.. enjoying the school life and just hanging with his childhood friends (Rin, Masato and kengo)... you know high school stuff. But all this changes when his friend Kyouske comes back from Tokyo and suddenly decides to create a baseball team by the name of ""Little busters!"" (weeh shcokerz!). So from there on they give Riki the mission of finding other members to join the team, and that is how our main character meets the other 5 girls, they join the team and they all become this cutey big family. So the story progresses like most Key titles with Riki listening to the other girls problems and help them solve what ever is on their minds, sounds fair enough right? well here is where it gets tricky, aside of all that Riki and Rin keep reviving these mysterious messages stating that there is a secret of the world they live in, and they have to figure out what that secret is, Riki and Rin start receiving different tasks that moves them closer to the answer. Now I don't wanna spoil anything, but I can say that the secret of the world is reaaaaaaally jaw dropping and ... just shocking (in a good way), it changes the whole view of the series.  Ok so was season 1 good and true to the visual novel? for me the answer is yes, because now that I finished season 1 I can tell where the developers were going when they made it. The main point of this season is to show us the characters in the best way possible, to let us explore the world of Little Busters! to let us see the characters such as Riki and Rin develop. They didn't rush the anime, they didn't go into the serious part, and they saved all that for season 2 (Refrain) which is a pretty good move because now we have seen all the characters, we know exactly who they are, we some them develop, now in Refrain we can relate more to them and understand them much better.  Art:  I have to be honest here, as much as I loved the anime .. I have to say that the art wasn't that amazing, It was a bit weird ... I am not sure what exactly was wrong with it, but i didn't like it as much as the Visual Novel's.  Characters:  I think the character design is a major positive point in Little busters! because the characters were just amazing, at first you might see them a bit bland.. and a tad silly, but as you proceed in the series you will discover how awesome they are. Every character is unique and has his/her special design and his/her own awesome personality. All of them are lovable, I myself loved each and every character, and I think they are one of the most unique characters of any series i watched.  Sound:  When has Key ever made bad music. The music is just freaking hawt!! ahm excuse me I just loved the soundtrack... so anyway, you might not notice the background music that much in the anime because its an anime, and you don't really focus on the music in an anime as much as when you are reading a visual novel. But the anime did use the same OST and all of them were used perfectly and they all fit the moment.  The voice acting was good. Great at times and just Ok at other times.   So if I want to compare the anime with the original Visual Novel then I can just say that it was true to it. even though it skipped some small details here and there, but the anime was quite long, 26 episodes I think that's enough to explain the main story of the series and introduce the characters and the comedy was awwwesome :DD. All that aside the anime did have some changes that I quite loved and weren't in the VN. such as showing that some of the characters know what the secret of the world is, which builds up a really strong impact towards them. And I also loved the story Komari wrote about the The boy and girl helping the 8 dwarfs, I thought that was a really nice touch.  So yeah.. All I can say is that I loved Little Busters! even if I didn't read the visual novel I am pretty sure I would have loved it as well. A lot of people are bashing the anime even fans of the visual novel... I think these people should just chill and enjoy the wonderful world of Little Busters! :3";Recommended
3;Little Busters!;SakurasouBusters;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SakurasouBusters;10;Little busters is my favorite anime of 2013, and may be my new favorite of all time, i know that alot don't like it, but i think it was a great adaption of the visual novel (Refrain still to come) Story: 10- Little busters has an absolutely amazing story, for those who havent played the visual novel some scenes will likely be fairly confusing but it all will make sense eventually :) the theme of friendship is presented here i think perfectly :) Art: 6- The only average part of this anime is the art. Its not lousy, ive seen plenty worse, but it could have been much better. Sound: 10- The voice acting here i think is very well done, all the characters except for mio have the same VA from the visual novel, but mio's replacement did a fine job. Also the Opening is amazing, the ending is as well, the soundtrack themes are one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard as well. Characters: 10- All the main and supporting characters are unique in their own way, from the eccentric Haruka, the childish Komari, the mature Kurugaya, the mysterious mio, and all of the original members of the Little Busters are all likeable and unique characters. Enjoyment: 10- While quite a few episodes were quite sad and emotional(In particular Haruka and Mio's arcs, as well as the last 3 episodes) their were plenty of bright and lighthearted moments as well, i couldn't have enjoyed it more. Overall: 10- Little Busters is an anime that doesn't come around every day, it truly is special and in my honest opinion a real masterpiece :);Recommended
4;Little Busters!;Naoe-Riki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Naoe-Riki;7;"To those who've never played the Visual novel: My review would be different for 2 kinds of audience: The People who've played Little Busters Visual Novel and those who haven't. I will explain later as to why.  I'll start off to those who've haven't seen the visual novel. At first glance you would believe it to be a usual happy-go-lucky comedy anime with very few character developments, but just like many of Key's works, Little Busters is in no way a happy-go-lucky anime. It is filled with drama that would put you at the edge of your seat at every turn. For those searching for comedy, then this anime is just for you. If your one to look for romance, then this anime is very romantic, except, not in a ""girl and boy like each other"" romance. Its romantic in a way that its dramatic romance. The characters are unique and balanced. Each character balances out the other, and makes the show even more interesting. The anime focuses on the relationship of the Little Busters, and does not go beyond friendship To be quick, if your one to find a new anime with comedy and romantic friendship and drama, this anime is perfect for you. I would recommend it. I admire the staff because they tried to change the some parts of the story and give some spice for original LB fans.  To those who've played the Visual novel: I'll be frank. It was a big disappointment as an LB fan. I waited for a proper adaption since as usual, Visual Novels are vague to me, so I clear out the visual novel and then wait for an adaption. Well, to be frank, the Anime DID clear out the vague parts which are hard to understand with words only. The problem was that the staff did unnecessary and can be quite pissing changes. I won't point out the changes since these would show spoilers, basically, how I viewed the story and its value became VERY much less. Although important parts were well in place, they made changes on how these parts were shown. They forgot to add important details and disturbingly focused on friendship rather than the actual theme. They reduced romance to mere friendship drama and focused on comedy and friendships. They added unnecessary details and to be frank, in the visual novel, after each route I was at the edge of my seat about to cry(and yes, this happened even after repeating the story many times over), but the anime did not even bring me to the edge of my desk.  Well, to conclude, the anime is certainly worth watching, but the visual novel is certainly better. As an LB! fan, the anime would definitely give you a new perspective of the story, so if your curious, GO WATCH!. There were changes here and there from the original story (which from me was very important and really pissed me off because of the changes), but the important parts were properly done. The art was very good, the voice actors did a wonderful job, the BGM was good, and character development was, as usual from Key works, wonderfully done";Recommended
5;Little Busters!;Yume_to_Tsubasa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yume_to_Tsubasa;8;"The first thing I'd like to say about Little Busters! is to ""give it a chance"". If you can get past the first three episodes, you will be probably be able to ease into it- and the story will start to make a lot more sense.  One problem with Little Busters! seems to be that people expect another Clannad (possibly the most successful anime adaptation of a Key game thus far) animated by Kyoto Animation along with Air and Kanon 2006.  What strikes me is that even before watching Little Busters!, many viewers who are familiar with other Key titles (animated by Kyoto Animation) already have a certain prejudice; that the show must somehow not be as great just because another company produced it. Or perhaps the opposite train of thought; Little Busters! should be great because Key created the game.  The fact is, however, that ""who created what"" aside, Little Busters! cannot be the same as its predecessors. It's a different game. In case you haven't noticed, it is not called ""Clannad II"" or ""Kanon the Sequel"". Yes, Maeda Jun's distinctive style is evident in the plot and characters, but walking into something with colored glasses on can really ruin the experience.  So throw the comparisons aside and prepare to enjoy Little Busters! as it is. The story can be a little difficult to understand at times, but I feel that J.C. Staff did a great job, particularly considering they had about three episodes to spare for each character's route. In addition, the game itself is structured in a way where each route is somewhat incomplete when it stands alone. The pieces really don't fall together until Refrain- which in turn won't really make sense until the first season is viewed.  Conclusion: Good luck with the first few episodes as you ease into it, forget about Clannad, enjoy Little Busters! as Little Busters!, and finish with Refrain; it's a good watch if you are okay with something with a slightly heavier storyline.";Recommended
6;Little Busters!;Asfaria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asfaria;7;Little Busters! is the newest Key visual novel to be turned into a romantic/drama anime (along with Air, Kanon, Clannad) it is the second anime to be produced (after Angel Beats which was not a visual novel before becoming an anime) to be produced by J.C. Staff instead of Kyoto Animation. One thing to note about this show is that like its predecessors, it is about a main male character helping out other characters (usually female) and solving their problems. Along the way, a lot of drama, awesome music to complement said drama, and occasionally (well really only one so far in this anime) supernatural events occur.  Plot – 5 The plot of Little Busters is nothing special. Before going any further though let me tell you that this is because the entire season is devoted to introducing the characters and sets up what is supposed to be the much better second season (Refrain) that was announced at the end of Episode 26. Unfortunately, this show still does not pull off its first season as well as Clannad did, so let’s hope the second season is just as good and even better than the After Story. The plot consists of the main character, Naoe Riki, collecting members (mostly girls) to join the baseball team that he and his four other childhood friends started at their high school. This all began because Kyousuke, the leader of this group of friends and the oldest, wanted to do something fun together with everyone before he graduated at the end of the year and had to leave them. The one problem I find with this idea of gathering characters is that for some characters (especially Komari the first to join) I kind of forgot what their backstory was by the end since I watched this over several months as it was released. For some characters, like Kud and Haruka who have later arcs after they have already joined, this isn’t as much of a problem. But if you’re watching this simply for the baseball, you won’t find much here. One last thing, unlike all of Key’s other shows, so far at least, Little Busters has almost no romance whatsoever. It’s never shown if anyone even has a crush on Riki or if Riki likes anyone as more than friend. The only romance at all is between Kengo and one other girl a little bit towards the end and between two minor characters, one of which has appearances in about 3 episodes and the other only gets one episode and nothing ever happens with that.  Art – 9 The art is pretty good. The character designs are interesting and unique, and some of the scenes really have amazing visuals like starry night skies and sunsets. The visuals fit the sadder scenes nicely and change well according to what is going on.  Sound – 9 Obviously being a Key anime it’s going to have a dramatic soundtrack (it better at least). This show doesn’t quite stand up to Angel Beats or Clannad’s soundtrack, but it does have some perfect songs for the mood (especially “In the town of continuing rain” which I loved hearing every time it was played). It may take time to adjust to Komari’s voice though as she has a “frail” sounding voice (and Riki sound really young).  Characters – 8 There are a lot of characters (much like in Angel Beats) but Little Busters does a fairly good job of getting you to know each character. One thing that they did do right was make unique characters. Naoe Riki is a good main character who helps everyone solve their problems and has narcolepsy. I kind of wish they had used his narcolepsy a bit more during this season (I think he has three attacks in 26 episodes?), but I’m guessing it comes more into the series in Refrain. Rin is Kyousuke’s younger sister and the only girl in their group of friends prior to starting the Little Busters! team. She is a very shy girl who does not like talking to new people. Masato is a boy obsessed with his muscles and relies on being Riki’s roommate in order to survive. Kengo is the only of the orginal five who does join the Little Busters right off the bat (sorry) because he is in kendo club. There are too many other characters to list them all separately but just know that all of the other girls who join later have some kind of tragic past (only Kurugaya does not get an arc in this, but I think I’ve heard she has something more in Refrain?)  Enjoyment – 7 I liked Little Busters! but I definitely don’t think it was the best Key anime so far. I’m really looking forward to Refrain, though, and I hope it will be as big of a success as the After Story was. I recommend waiting to watch this show until Refrain comes out since this anime lacks the romance that I was expecting it to have by now.;Recommended
7;Little Busters!;CamoBullo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CamoBullo;7;"Little Busters suffers from something I like to call “Key Syndrome”. Effects of it include a male lead, a bunch of attractive females who have their own characters arcs as a means of developing them, a story that really sticks with the viewer and inane fantasy nonsense that shouldn’t be there to begin with. Key Syndrome mainly works in the anime’s favour however, with Clannad being the most potent example of how the formula works. Little Busters attempts to do the same with the same attitude and demeanour as Clannad, dare I say, it’s practically the same thing. Does this make Little Busters bad? No, though it makes it very misguided as its own individual series to the point where it’s nearly the same than watching another anime altogether.  And, no: I haven’t played the Visual Novel. It’ll be evaluated as an anime only.  Little Busters stars token Key Syndrome male lead Riki, a boy who lost his parents and suffers from narcolepsy, which will put him to sleep whenever the plot wants to come to screeching halt. Compared to Tomoya from Clannad, he’s seemingly fortunate to not have parents and actually have people supporting him from the very beginning – such a lovely change of pace. Riki is a second year student at a high school along with the rest of his social group, including the most popular male in the whole school (who, interestingly, likes to fuel the Yaoi truck with Riki) and a shy girl who spends her time with cats until she is inevitably developed into including more friends into her life and comfort zone.  One of the things Little Busters seemingly did not contract from Key Syndrome is the plot – it’s surprisingly weak and instantly forgettable, which isn’t a good sign. Riki and his gang of misfits form a new school baseball team; because it’ll be the last thing they do together. The popular aforementioned male – whose name is Ryousuke – will be graduating after the school year is over, since he’s the oldest member of the group. The team is named Little Busters, due to it being their group name when they were kids. However, the plot transcends the baseball and becomes Clannad: Riki meets girls along the course of the story, they have tragic pasts and it’s up to him to basically resolve their anguish through friendship. Another plotline is that Riki and the shy girl must do eight challenges in order to find out the secret of the world.  There’s too much going on and this is the main problem of the entire anime.  At first the baseball plotline seems like the most prevalent one – it’s usually the main focus and something baseball related happens nearly every episode, so of course it’d make sense that it’d be the main focus and yet Clannad bursts into the room, holding baseball against its will. Little Busters tries to follow its older brother rather too closely, in the centre of its large shadow. Unlike Clannad, where those character arcs are mainly devoid of any fantasy, half of the character arcs in Little Busters have a fantasy element which is not explained whatsoever. This is particularly jarring in the last character arc, in which a deus ex machina saves the focused character in the most ridiculous way possible. The secret of the world plot seems to be, curiously, the main story yet it’s rarely touched upon and may as well been the entire series. Little Busters suffers from too much going on and the Key Syndrome didn’t give it the factor that it needed the most.  The unfocused plot becomes somewhat problematic when other characters are introduced, which is another problem with the series. Usually, a great plot is complemented with great characters, as both the story and characters stick with the viewer. With its messy plot, Little Busters’ characters can’t complement the story whatsoever, rather complement each other. Instead of introducing a character for the sole purpose of having a character arc about them, Little Busters did something that would’ve worked tremendously if the story wasn’t unfocused – introduce the characters long before they become a main focus. In their introductions, they’re usually the focus which allows the audience to get to know them better, allowing you to care for them later on. Not all of the characters get an arc to themselves, such as Kurugaya who acts as a voice of moral reason and always wants to be surrounded by the rest of the female cast (she pilots the Yuri plane). Little Busters’ characters are the most endearing part of the entire experience, brought down by its riddled story.  The art style and music is something that’s… not exactly worth mentioning. It’s the same studio as Angel Beats so the characters retain that style, which isn’t exactly bad but it doesn’t scream fantastic: it’s a very colourful art style that isn’t dull, yet also isn’t impressive at the same time. The music is something that could be called forgettable. The opening and ending themes are alright at best, nothing too inspiring but the music cues are usually overshadowed by Riki’s annoying narration every ten minutes or just casual discussion. This is one of the factors where it doesn’t try to be Clannad, though perhaps it should’ve been. Clannad’s music was so touching and memorable: it made it stand out. Little Busters is, unfortunately, weak in both of these areas. It’s taken its cues from areas that already needed some improvement.  Little Busters one-ups Clannad in one factor though: humour. Little Busters seems to be a lot funnier than its older sibling, which ultimately is brought by it’s interesting characters and their mannerisms. Kurugaya will always coin a lesbian joke here and there, yet it involves herself; that not only seems appropriate but also hilarious given the comedic situations that ensue later. One of the characters, Masato, will usually get into a fight with another character. This is played for laughs, as Ryousuke will ask the other students to throw any item that can manage to get their hands on, which usually ends badly for Masato, who is usually given a gag weapon, such as soap. This does happen often during the course of the series, though it’s funny every time to see him defeated in a different way every time. Upon defeat, the victor gives him a name which upon he will be called for the rest of the day or longer. It’s one of those occasions where, despite being in another language, the humour crosses over well with western audiences.  Little Busters isn’t a bad experience, dare I say that it was actually enjoyable. However, the fantasy feels very misplaced, as it shouldn’t really exist in the first place. The story was all over the place, it lacked a true central focus and the art and sound isn’t the best you’ll ever see. However, the characters are the best part of the entire series, some of the themes in the character arcs are actually endearing, which is a shame since it seems like they should be the main focus of the whole thing. The ending isn’t complete, though a second season is on its way which will basically be Littler Busters: After Story (though it’s called Refrain). In the end, Little Busters will have you remember its characters, it’s funny moments and its charm. With the preview at the end of the final episode, we can only hope that Little Busters: Refrain will be even better.";Recommended
8;Little Busters!;Zelot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zelot;9;Please bear in mind that I have yet to finish the visual novel of Little Busters, still working on getting introduced to the characters, therefore I shall not be comparing the adaption to the visual novel. I will be comparing this anime with another of Key's work, Clannad [Not After Story (Actually, the first few small arcs of After Story)]  Story - 9 The story starts off by introducing multiple characters, and then going into character arcs in where the main character helps out the character that needs the help. Very very similar to Clannad. The character arcs were great!... except a few of them had random supernatural moments, something I wasn't expecting from this anime, as the anime never really showed anything supernatural until the part it happens at. Don't get me wrong, the arcs are still wonderful, enjoyable, addicting and emotional! I did feel that the character arcs were a bit choppy, going from one arc to another without much of transition.  Art - 8 The art was wonderful, colors were pretty good, I enjoyed the style of everything. Not much to talk about.  Sound - 9 Doing exactly what KyoAni did with Clannad, J.C pretty much used the soundtrack from the Visual Novel. I still absolutely love the soundtrack, as they are great at setting the moods. I also enjoyed the OP as well, a song that uplifts the spirit, something the entire anime is about!  Characters- 10 The thing about this anime that stands out the most are their characters! I absolutely love the design of the characters (especially the female ones, they just look awesome!). Their personalities are the typical ones found in other animes, the optimistic ones, the shy ones, the cute ones, but we get to see what happens to their personality as they are presented with a conflict of some sort. (Some of the characters are so kawaii, I mean so very very kawaii.. Kud;Recommended
9;Little Busters!;rocky716;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rocky716;7;"From the makers of Clannad and Clannad After Story comes the story of group of childhood friends who form a baseball team in a last ditch effort to create lasting memories before they all graduate and go their separate ways. The main character Riki is tasked to find more members (preferably girls) to join their team The Little Busters. However, beyond this simplicity lies much deeper subplots. These subplots concern the insecurities and hardships of the new female members of The Little Busters. Some are much more simple to comprehend immediately, while others are shrouded in mystery which isn't revealed until the last minute.  To me, the story was interesting and unexpectedly good. This wasn't an anime that you could predict where it was going. It had unique scenarios that were believable and emotional. Where the anime stood the best was in its subplots.  As far as main characters go Riki is one of the first likable main male characters to exist in a show like this. Usually, the main character has a mediocre personality and the viewer wonders why girls are so obsessed with him. However, Riki is kind, honest, calm, and caring to others. He puts other peoples' concerns in priority to his own concerns. Moving beyond the main lead character, I believe the other main characters were great to. It was good to see that the main lead didn't just have that ""one guy best friend"". He had three others with outrageous personalities. The main girls were great and had a lot to offer in the show. Although at times I thought the voices of a couple of them were a little unbearable, each girl was unique and special.  The only objections I have to this show is that it didn't close some extremely interesting plot holes. Who is sending the letters? Why is Riki's narcolepsy so significant? What is the secret of this world? If the anime closed some of those holes I would have gave it a better grade, but ultimately I still think this is a good anime. I would suggest it to those who are looking for slice of life, deep character development, and unique subplots. I would highly recommend it to people who liked Clannad and Clannad After Story.";Recommended
10;Little Busters!;jc9622;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jc9622;7;"Did people watch this show and expect there to be a romance? Haha! I didn't even realize that the show's tag had romance until I finished the show. Which means I wasn't shipping any characters and expect them to be all lovey-dovey towards each other. I also didn't read the VN version and never will.  (There will be some SPOILERS in my review)   [Story]: (5/10) (SPOILERS) The story is not that interesting or even mind-blowing. The show focuses on Rikki as he tries to recruit more people for the ""Little Busters"" which is the name of their group and their recently created baseball team. I won't go with his past life, flashbacks, or his conditions. The show focuses on 2 main things. The 1st is him recruiting more people for the ""Little Busters"" and the 2nd one is Rikki and Rin trying to solve the mysterious letters that they have been getting from a cat named ""Leon"". Let's focus on the first one. Yes, Rikki successfully recruits more people which is mostly girls because their boy-to-girl ratio was 4 to 1. What happens after he successfully recruits a girl? What you get is 4 character arcs with forced dramatic moments and melodramatic moments. I mean, the character arcs did make me cry...a little bit... but one of them is just plain horrible and what's worse is all the character arcs are rushed. The arcs lasted for only 3-4 episodes. One of the arcs had some laughable ending that didn't really make sense. For example, Mio's arc had some potential but they messed it up with some imaginary bullcrap and ending that just doesn't make sense. At least, the 3 remaining character arcs are good and it gave me a few emotional tears. The remaining character arcs that I loved are Komari's arc, Haruka's arc, and Kud's arc. I won't go in-depth with these arcs but all I will say is they're great to watch and will make you cry. Even if you're a man. Probably. Let's focus on the 2nd one which is the ""mysterious letter"". I honestly don't know what the hell this is. Is this a filler or something? I just hoped that they solve the mystery letter and find out who has been writing that letter in the 2nd season. The mysterious letter is not the only episodes that happens in-between the character's arc. There are also some ""breather"" episodes that are just for the laugh and giggles. The jokes are repeated but they're still somehow funny. I'm not even going to mention the ending. It's terrible. Did the creators run out of ideas or something that they couldn't come up with a decent ending. The post-credit scene did peek my interest and I'll be watching the second season just to check it out. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Art/Animation]: (7/10) If you have seen Angel Beats before then you'd notice that the animation is very similar. The animation for AB is obviously better and I am not being biased here. Yes, I watched the 1080p version for both shows but let's not get on that. The show's animation suffered from lack of details to crappy character motion, etc. It's not a bad animation but it's not great either. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Sound]: (6/10) I can't believe they used the same opening for 25 episodes straight. This is one of the few animes where I was hoping that they change the OP as soon as possible but sadly, that didn't happen. I just skipped the OP after episode 8. The ED theme song is also horrible and I only listened to it for 1 episode only. The background themes are decent. I watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English voice acting. All of them did a terrific job and I loved most of the VA's except for one voice actor. The English VA of Rikki annoyed the living hell out of me. He sounded like an annoying teenager who hasn't dropped his balls yet for whatever reason. I know, he was voiced by a girl, that's why he sounds like that. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Characters]: (8/10) I loved every single character in the show except for one. That's the main protagonist. Riki just isn't that interesting of a guy. He's just a nice main protagonist guy that I somehow don't like. Does he have redeeming qualities? Hell no. He just goes around, helping and fixing the girls' problem before they are recruited. Yes, every girl has a problem and Rikki ""fixed"" all of them. This is an example of a forced dramatic moments. Every single girl has a ridiculous past-tragedy and they must overcome it. With Rikki's help, of course. How the hell did they all end up in this school anyways. These dramatic moments are forced as hell but that doesn't mean I hated them. After seeing Komari's arc, Haruka's arc, and Kud's arc. The show successfully made me love these characters. Except Mio's arc. That arc was just terrible. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Enjoyment]: (8/10) Most slice of life today has a crappy story but I don't really care for the story. My enjoyment rating is 8 because the jokes are hilarious and the forced dramatic moments somehow worked. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [OVERALL]: (6.8/10) --- Rounding it to -- (7/10) All in all, this is a good anime series to watch. The show has a lot of flaws but the show also has a lot of good moments like the dramatic and emotional moments and the comedy episodes in-between. If you're looking for a drama series then you might want to check this out. If you're looking for romance as the tag suggests then don't watch this show. The show has no romance and that tag was just misleading.    Pros: +Good Animation +Great Characters +Funny moments +Dramatic moments successfully executed   Cons: -Mediocre Story -Mediocre Soundtrack -Unlikable Main Protagonist -All female characters had a past tragedy -Character's arc were rushed -Terrible ending";Recommended

If you're searching for stories like Clannad, Angel Beats, Kanon or any other Key work. This is something that you should watch. The Anime ver. is not as good as the Game ver. .. Because there are a lot of information withheld here. Though it feels like cheating since I know the story through the game, which actually made me cry more than Clannad.  So for the objectives ... Story 8 / 10  Frankly speaking, the Anime version toned down the ""Tear Meter"" a lot, it could have made more impact if the last episode had shown the person who knows the ""Truth"" of the world. But the anime did a great job on the Comedy scenes, no problem with that.  Art 10 / 10  Key's art is one of the best IMHO, Still improving and going strong.  Sound 10 / 10  No, really. Since there is no more score higher than 10, the music here has a lot of meaning, same with Clannad and Angel Beats, though if I was asked which music is rated higher, then there is a clear distinction of #1 for Clannad #2 for Angel Beats and #3 for Little Busters! ...  Character 10 / 10  One of the elements that keep the story going, being true to one's nature no matter the circumstances are, to improve throughout the series and make the watchers think about their own characteristics.  Enjoyment 10 / 10  It could have been better but it easily made 10 for me. Every episode gives you another meaning of ""Watching"" though it is as expected because it is from Key. Crying, Laughing aren't the only feelings you'll feel when watching this, especially in the Refrain! part.  Overall 10 / 10  Story may not have as much impact as the last two latest anime of Key but I swear that Refrain will make it up. Really, everything in the anime has a meaning (Well, maybe except for some comedy parts.). If you stopped watching this because you didn't like how it started. Heh~ I'm telling you... You really need to watch this in order to know what happens in the Refrain.";Recommended
12;Little Busters!;DigestingAnime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DigestingAnime;7;"Why do shows wait till the last few episodes to get to the good part!? [Abridged version of the storyline: A group of friends' decide to make a baseball team to play. One of the boy's become in charge of bringing new members to the group. Each new members that he persuades to join are not exactly the happiest of the bunch. Behind the smiles, the hardship is hidden]  This show really disappointed me. Every week, as new episodes came out, I really thought the series would get better, but it didn't. Here are the reasons:  1) The main character, Riki, narrates way too much. When he explains the situation to us, it really bores me to death. Usually, I like hearing the narrator tell us what is going on, but he basically pointed out useless information and I just wanted him to shut up. Riki honey, you need to stop talking! The narration, the voice acting, and the dialogues/ monologues swayed me away from this show.  2) There are way too many supporting characters. You can't really focus on each character individually because the group is too big.  3) All of the burdens are handed down to Riki. When any of the girls have a problem, it is Riki who comes to the rescue. This is a harem genre so it definitely makes sense, but many people says this show is about friendship- no! All the other characters just tag along and watch silently while everything happens. They're like little ducklings following their mama- in this case Rikki,  4) The art is fine. I was expecting it be nicer, but you get used to it.  5) The execution of the storyline was poorly done. This was the biggest problem for me. After the first arc with Komari (the blonde hair with the squeaky voice) was finished, there was a huge gap where nothing happened (if I remember correctly). Yes, you do get new members to the Little Busters but that's about it. I started losing interest really quickly. Furthermore, when the arc of each of the girls finished, the characters were really pointless afterwards. You won't get to see them as much. Seriously, the timing of the arcs were unbearable!  6) The blue hair girl. Her arc was interesting. However, I must be really dumb because it did not make sense to me. Her problem was really confusing and unrealistic. I understand how Key loves putting surreal elements to their shows, but the explanation still does not make sense. Also, not everything can be tied down on the last episode; it is just too much!  7) As for the character development, I did actually see Rin (the red hair girl) start to grow as the show went on. She had a little bit of personality change which is a good thing because she is the heroine of the show…although; I would have liked to see her as vocal and active as Riki.  8) The guy who was meant to provides comic relief for the show was more likely to be the guy who brought utter silence to ones house. He was not funny at all. I know he is different from comedians in other anime shows, but I swear he made me hate the show more. Eventually, I tried forgetting that he existed just so I could watch the show. The anime did have potential for good humor, because I actually did laugh at episode 20 with the silly, funny rap song one of the characters created.  9) None of the characters really appealed to me. In all honesty, the perverted female character was one of my favorite… and she had no real arc! That is saying a lot because I don't like perverted characters.  10) I don't regret watching it, but I do not think I will watch it again. One thing I did like was a simple speech about how sad people view other happy people. This was not an extremely significant part of the anime, but it resonated with me. It made me not completely hate it.  11) The voice acting: it took me a while to get use to some of the voices. I'm not usually picky about it, but I wonder if the dub can do better.  12) I continued watching this anime because I read the BIGGEST spoiler of all time, and I really thought it was going to happen in this anime. At first I was mad that I learned about it, but it was the only thing that made me want to watch it. But at last, the spoiler never came to form. They hint it through out the series, but the arcs really swing you away from the main storyline, and I do not think that the last episode could ever do that spoiler justice. If there is a second season (which will probably be awesome judging from the spoilers…look, I hated Clannad, but I loved After Story), I suggest you watch this for background information, but other than that, I don't know if you should watch it or not. It is up to you!  I would have scored this anime a 6 because I didn’t like it, but I gave it a 7 because the entire arc ended with a happy feeling and a (simple) message. This bothered me at first because I thought it was hackneyed, but I know if I had watched this a few years ago I might have enjoyed it…… (Keyword: might have).  [Update: April 7, 2013] When I wrote the review, the only episode I did not watch was the last one. As of now, I have completed it. I still agree with everything I wrote. As I mentioned, it concluded with this feeling of warmth. It summarized what Rikki had done for everyone. However, it foreshadowed the tragedy to come. It ended nicely, and I do crave to watch the second season when it does come out...i probably will enjoy it more! Oh The Anticipation! Watch this series if you intend to watch the ever-so-hyped second season: Little Busters Refrain! Why? Because this season seems like the background information which tells us more about some of characters that will be relevant for the sequel.";Recommended
13;Little Busters!;Antex;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Antex;8;"Before I start, I’m just going to say that this is my first review and I probably won’t do that great of a job; and because I have not played/read the visual novel yet, I won’t be doing any comparison.  When it was revealed that J.C. Staff would be the ones to do Little Busters, I had a discussion with a friend of mine. She said that Kyoto Animation would do a much better job than J.C. Staff and that Kyoto Animation should be the ones to do all of Key’s works. For the most part, I do agree with her.  In anime your true friends will always be there for you no matter what, whether it is through depressing times offering you advice and helping you get back up on your feet, to laughing and just acting like idiots.  Little Busters has these elements, from having hilarious fights between Masato and the entire female cast to the more dark tone of the show. However, the comedic essence of the show outweighs how sad each arc (route?) can be making it hard for each character to tug on your emotions like Clannad and Kanon (2006) did. This is in my opinion due to the pointless filler that most people complain about. However, I disagree with it being pointless. True, it is not part of the main story but it is there for a reason, and that reason is to soften the impact (with comedy) of how sad and dark the next route is. It gives you a good laugh before hitting you again. But it might not need it due to J.C. Staff’s terrible writing. Other than filler problems, I had problems with unanswered questions during Mio’s story such as exactly who is Midori and she came to be as a person, and how Kyousuke knew what was going to happen with their team at the end of season 1. Despite Rin being the main heroine she is not the focus of the story nor does it even show that she is.  Despite these problems I didn’t get bored watching the show, and each character was able to develop in each of their routes (which some people might disagree with; but hey it’s my review). The soundtrack from Key was still good and had no problems with it. This show tries its hardest to survive on symbolism much like Clannad did, but could have done a better job because some people I talked to found some of it confusing (like the rain in Haruka’s route or the parasol in Mio’s route). Overall it wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t amazing; and if you like works of Key you should watch this and try not to think too harshly of the show because, well, it’s from J.C. Staff.";Recommended
14;Little Busters!;makoa69;https://myanimelist.net/profile/makoa69;7;(Note: This review is from a person who has not played the visual novel, so do not worry about any sort of tendentious opinions toward the VN.) Little Busters is a somewhat old visual novel (released in 2007) made by the company Key. After five long years someone decided they should create an anime predicated on it. Key had made many other visual novels which would go on to become animated series, some of which I am a fan of. I find both Kanon 2006 and the Clannad After Story animes to be a fantastic way to get tears everywhere due to excessive crying. However, both of those times (and every time if I'm not mistaken), Key's VN's were adapted by Kyoto Animation. Naturally, it would be fair to think that Little Busters would also be adapted by KyoAni, but no. For whatever reason, Little Busters got to be adapted by JC Staff, the same guys who made such animes as Nodame Cantabile, Azumanga Daioh, and Shakugan no Shana. So while many were upset to hear that KyoAni wasn't going to be doing the job ( it seems they were more interested in animating girls with eye patches and talking fat birds), I was not. In fact, I was rather excited to hear somebody else was given the baton this time around. So, how did they do? Well, looking at the numeric score, you can guess my opinion. So, if you've watched any of Key's other series, you'd know they all follow a similar archetype. 1) Introduce a male main character who's somewhat faceless. He doesn't really have any particular talents or interests, but lacks any obvious faults. He's usually indifferent toward most situations going on around him, but when things get rough, he's there to shine. A nice jack-of-all-trades guy that most everybody can relate to. 2) Introduce a handful of female support characters, each with their own quirks. Maybe spend a couple of happy-go-lucky episodes that let the viewer get to know all these ladies. 3) Show several plot arcs, one for each girl. Each arc will toss that girl into some horrible plight, and it will be up to the dashing main character to save her from her despair. Needless to say, Little Busters doesn't stray far from this blueprint. Our hero, Riki, can be summed up with my description above, along with the quirk that he also has Narcolepsy. Little Busters also has many women, and is split up into several story arcs, one for each lady. It's a storytelling framework that works great in VN's since for each play through you embark with the intent of winning the heart of a different girl, and the main character being sort of a blank slate allows you to put yourself in his shoes. As for anime, I don't think it really works all that well. Each arc feels very separate from both the arc that came before it and the one that succeeds it. Besides the first arc and finale, you could probably watch the arcs in any random order and not notice much difference. In the past, discontinuity like this didn't bother me at all, but now that I'm a fractious college student, it doesn't fancy me too much. On to the story, Little Buster's first introduction arc seemed unusually dull and lengthy. While other Key animations rely on getting through this first arc with lots of humor (with Clannad having the best jokes in my opinion), Little Busters doesn't hit the mark. It's main form of humor comes from the character Masato either exclaiming ridiculous one-liners, most usually related to his own muscles, or the same Masato getting picked on by other members of the cast. Maybe some found it funny, but I didn't. The character introductions were clean, but forgettable, and nothing particularly spectacular nor memorable happens. The first few episodes were a chore to sit through. The character arcs, with the exception of maybe one of them, were actually pretty bad. How were they bad? Well, they tried too hard to be sad, but in the end wound up just feeling forced. Characters would erupt in tears or unleash wild swings of emotion, but I'd find myself unable to understand their feelings. In an especially bad case I recall, an episode has one of the girls introduce her favorite bench, only to have it get destroyed moments later. During the bench's dismantling, the girl is very passionate, with lots of screaming and shouting, ya know, what you'd expect. This scene came suddenly from nowhere and was extremely unsuccessful at getting me to understand the girl, which was the scene's goal. It felt very forced, with absolutely no foreshadowing at all hinting toward it. In general, this is how I felt most of the time while watching the show, which I found very surprising, especially considering how emotionally involved I got while watching other Key animes. It wasn't all bad though. There were several stand-alone episodes that I found very entertaining to watch. Those episodes usually occurred between arcs and were a nice break from all the forced drama. Some of those episodes that were memorable to me included the episode everybody helps Kud study for an upcoming exam, and the episode where Riki sneaks into the girl's dorm to have a slumber party. Those episodes were nice and 'slice-of-lifey'. If only the actual arcs were as enjoyable as those episodes... Anyways, after twenty five episodes, the anime reaches its final episode, which I got to see just a few hours ago. How was that? Dangit, that last episode left me with little but deep dudgeon. The series had spent several episodes building up a subplot I'll dub 'the secret of the world subplot', and then the penultimate episode strongly tinctured that something was fishy about Kyousuke, one of the main characters. I was really excited to see the final episode bear fruit to all this buildup, but nope. It was just Riki and friends giving an adumbrate of all the previous episodes, followed up with a montage of their baseball match (not to mention a sudden and unexplained 180 degree flip of Kengo's personality). Looking back, I can't say I really enjoyed a whole lot of this show. Several standalone episodes (in particular the aforementioned penultimate episode) were very enjoyable, but the actual arcs were not. They were too forced, just trying to be too dolor. In past Key animations (specifically Clannad AS), often if a character would start crying, I would find myself crying with them. The pathos the writers were trying to convey to me successfully connected, and I could truly empathize with those characters. Most of the time with Little Busters, I felt immured from the situations at hand. Most of the time I simply could not understand the struggles the characters were experiencing. Sometimes it was because my suspense of disbelief was absent due to strange and unbelievable scenes, but most of the time it was simply from poor pacing and writing. With the announcement of a second season, I don't really see why the decision was made for these arcs to have such a rushed pace. I have heard that some of these arcs omitted a lot of important scenes from the VN, hindering the overall quality. That just seems silly to me. They should have just followed the base source more closely and pushed an arc or two into the second season. Little Busters has a huge fan base, they really shouldn't have had any fear of it not being popular enough to get a continuation, especially if given the detail and care it deserves. But whatever, I'm done speculating. Overall, the art is nice, no real complaints. The sound is good, though I really wish they made a new opening and ending halfway through, particularly one that didn't use a song I'd heard long ago in a nico nico douga. The characters were good, but I wish more growth was given to the male characters. Kengo suddenly completely changes character in the last episode, Kyousuke stays cool yet phlegmatic from start to finish, and Masato never becomes anything more than comic relief. Riki grows plenty, but he's the main character, so it's to be expected. The story left a lot unanswered, but with the promise of a second season, it is my hope that those questions will be solved, and solved well. This adaptation wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't trash. It had plenty of good parts, but in the end it leaves me wondering how it would have turned out if KyoAni had adapted it instead. Oh well, I guess we'll never know.;Recommended
15;Little Busters!;Micsupreeme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Micsupreeme;8;"Let's talk Little Busters, shall we? As always, i'm basing my review on the animated production alone, no bias ;)  Onto the matter at had, what struck me at first when i watched the show was just a simple Slice of Lice/School/Comedy vibe, which - as a fan of Slice of Life anime seemed pleasant to me, but as i watched, i came to feel the emotional power that the show bears, and rather than being taken on a physical journey. it started to set me up on an emotional one - not an easy task either.  There are a lot of requirements that this show fulfills to be able to convey emotions the way it does. Clearly, the vibrant art and the superb character designs help, but the tactic of the show is ultimately to get you into truly understanding each of the troubled characters in depth, and so it substitutes an intricate plot, for the establishment of powerful bonds between the viewer and the characters. Now this isn't on par with everyone's tastes, but it's a well known set up for real life themed anime.  The back stories, or the ""context"" of the characters if you will - make up the most part of the show, and i for one couldn't be happier that this is the case. In terms of content, the stories and setups behind the characters, and the characters themselves come off as well thought out, and genuinely interesting - though often very tragic.  During the show, the main character (Riki) - with help from the rest of the team is able to connect with the stars of the show, getting to know them on a very personal note, so as you watch you'll keep reconsidering how you feel about each character, personally i found it hard to pick a favorite!  Drama! Drama! Drama! Is a big theme in the show, it goes hand in hand in this case with the emotional troubles of the characters, and the friction involved in dealing with them.  But this isn't just some sort of sob story show - the main theme constantly referred to is friendship, and being there for one another, ultimately it is the viewers duty to root for the little busters to get through everything with the help of each other, and so it's not going to get you down or anything (for long)... It is a great balance of putting you on the edge, and allowing you to enjoy, not too this, not too that! :)  As if i hadn't already sold this to you, i did come to find some cryptic and supernatural elements to the show, adding to the show's ability to take you by surprise, because often the goings on can't be anticipated.  I DO have criticisms though... I've got to admit, i found the ""one after the other"", order to going into each characters' past to be frustrating, it definitely detracted from the spontaneity of the production, some more transitional content would have helped. My other concern: the lack of character development (to the degree provided for some of the others) for the male characters, but you could argue that it's just my curiosity to find out more kicking in now xD  I'd like to point out that this has been the first show i've found to have a true emotive power, so pardon me if my etiquette for dealing with this style isn't perfect.  Ultimately, i definitely recommend this to you - particularly if you're ok with slice of life. The show has a little bit of everything it seems, and i found it really enjoyable, i hope you do too.";Recommended
16;Little Busters!;GreyKnightz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GreyKnightz;9;~Wafuu!~  Little Busters likes to throw random feels at you when you did not expect it. The story with Nishizono was really sad and touching, in fact most of the characters developed had a very sad background.  One of the funniest series I've ever been through too. Some really interesting points in Little Busters is when Rin gets agitated and grows a temporary pair of neko mimi XD  Kud have a really self developing meaning behind her life story. Morality in kud's story is really damn high. It even involve war!  Ost from Little Busters are really charming and sad both at the same time. OST-Two Sugars, is one good example of sadness and happiness SHIAWASE in one simple tune.  The series is produced by Key's, so you can expect the same art and same uniform over and over again. Much like Kyoani.;Recommended
17;Little Busters!;mardhionne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mardhionne;7;I see that a lot of reviews are calling the first season of LB mediocre, but I don't think that is the point, if anything, I think this season did a decent job as a prequel to the LB~refrain~.  The story was mediocre, I agree, there was not really a climax and there was so much hole in the plot, the ending was not at all satisfying. But to remind, this is a prequel. I've watched LB with the knowledge that it has season 2 so that all the lacking elements I noticed was bearable, it means I have to expect an answer to its subsequent season. What this antecedent show did was introduce the characters.  What makes a story more relatable to the audience is the indepth look at the personal lives of the characters, that way we can grow more understanding and attached to their circumstance. Though there was much more that should be recognized, the story was able to show what makes our character cry, regret, sad, weak... etc. Those traumas that makes these lives drawn together are well illustrated in the different arches. If it weren't for these sketches I don't think Refrain would be as much given credit. This season should be given acknowledgement for its wonderful job of giving profound construction into leading us to its sequel.  The art was good. No complaints there. The sound was too. The tracks did their job into setting the mood, it actually reminded me of Clannad and the OP and ED is more enjoyable listening too than in the second season to be honest.  If you're finding a story here, don't. As I've explained earlier the story is not really the highlight of this season, it is character introduction. It is unfair to compare it to Clannad, because when you do it would lose the more meaningful and emotional story it should exude, it is too much of a comparison. If it becomes too mediocre do not worry, the elements will come together with the second season. The more you get serious into watching this prequel the more it would be personal for you when you watch the sequel.;Recommended
18;Little Busters!;jchang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jchang;8;"As a disclaimer i have played some of the VN although i'm reviewing this based on the anime itself taking into consideration the existence of a sequel.  Little Busters! is a very special anime one that could have been a master piece but unfortunately was not executed perfectly in my opinion. Still the efforts show a solid show at the end which makes for a great show following similar vibes to other Key series with a twist.  The beauty of Little Busters! lies in the fact that is fundamentally different than other anime out there. While other shows rely on complex character relations for romance and ecchi for comedy, Little Busters! relies on character development and a scent of nostalgia for our childhood days. (There is still ecchi but definitely less than anything out there nowadays)  For me, Little Busters! strikes right in my teen days. Days with not much responsibility other than studying. I deeply cherish those days of careless and idiotic fun and Little Busters! bright them back alive. It's innocent and naive; it might have some execution mistakes but you can't help but to fall for it's charm. I guess it's like watching little kids, they might be clumsy and sometimes you might not understand them but at the end it's a lot of fun and you can't help but to relate to them.  The most serious parts comes in the sequel which i'm also going to review but this part does feature around 4 arcs which would last about 3 episodes each and will have a good degree of impact and will serve to increase curiosity in the more important arcs on the sequel. (don't expect things to make sense here the sequel will tie everything up).  On a more technical side Little Busters! tries to be too much like a visual novel in some parts and not enough in some. adapting all the arcs in one timeline makes for a rushed sensation whereas some of the clear VN elements don't need to be there. the Art needs a little bit to get used to since it's different from other Key series (this was not made by KyoAni) and the ost although great to set up the mood can be repetitive.  Overall I still greatly recommend this series is a refreshing series that focuses on friendship and really brings the characters together and develops them. I enjoyed this a lot and wish that times like those could really last forever.  Thanks for reading! :)";Recommended
19;Little Busters!;KyubeyDesu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KyubeyDesu;7;"You're about to grow up into the real world, what's the logical thing to do? Play baseball with friends, of course!  The story seemed fun at first glance, just some friends setting up a baseball team and it seemed to deliver pretty well... Until you realize that this was made by Key. Don't get me wrong, this anime had some heartfelt moments, just not up to the typical Key caliber. The anime ended itself pretty well and could have easily ended here, but I'm glad it didn't.  In my opinion, this anime felt quite a bit like a dating sim, as Riki is the only one getting members for the Little Busters, hence him being the hero. He spends his time developing relationships and learning about the girls as it goes, triggering ""event flags"" as they have heart-to-heart moments.  The art was very pretty, as some of the scenes made me just go ""wow"", such as the meteor shower and the sunsets. The character designs were unique in their own ways, though some were similar for various reasons, such as Kyousuke's and Rin's.  The opening and ending songs were very nice, as I have put the opening on repeat many times and they add to the upbeat feel that is this anime. However, there are slower and sadder songs for the more important and serious moments in this anime, and trust me, there are a few. The voice actors did great with their roles, and gave each character a voice that worked with their personality and looks.  I believe the characters were one of the best parts of this anime. Most of the characters were developed except for the main four excluding Riki. They did the developments well, giving each character a unique background and a special presence. The characters you were supposed to dislike were developed and made into something that you came to not hate so much. (Except for Sasami. She didn't get squat.)  I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Even though it didn't have the energetic feeling that most comedy anime seem to have, but I liked this mood better as it made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. There were some hilarious moments along with fun characters that seemed to have their own quirks, like Mio's ability to have a camera whenever needed and quick to take pictures or Yuiko's possible homo/bisexuality. Or just love of cute things (Think this as you will.)  So what are you waiting for? It's on Crunchyroll now!";Recommended
0;Little Busters!;Historia-Li;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Historia-Li;5;"Little Busters!  If you're like me and you're thinking about watching this because the visual novel was made by Key, don't. Watch it with an independent mindset, free of Clannad, Kanon, etc. If you don't you're just gonna find disappointment.  Story: 6/10  The story was definitely not as good as Key's previous works. Yes, it followed the general plot of a high school boy helping multiple girls cope and effectively saving their lives in one way or the other, but it simply was not as engaging. There were many story elements that could have been left out. For example, Riki's narcolepsy. So what? It did not influence the progression of the story whatsoever. There was also no romantic interest, but the friendships gained throughout the series filled in the hole nicely for those who don't mind the absence of romance.  Art: 10/10  As expected, it was beautifully animated. No complaints.  Sound: 5/10  The music lacked variety. There was probably one tune that played in every emotional scene throughout the show. Variety is always good when the anime is only about friendship and nothing else is going on. Otherwise the show becomes drab very quickly. Also, the female voices were THE MOST annoying I have ever heard. I was relieved when Kurugaya would speak as she was the only normal sounding female voice in the series. This anime is not for people who detest whimpering, crybaby voice work that sounds like Asian porn.  Character: 7/10  The characters were good with each having his/her own unique personalities. Each fought their own battles, emerging as victorious, developed characters. They were funny when they were supposed to be, and emotional when it was expected. However, I could not get around how they acted like 5 year olds throughout the whole show. If the producers were aiming for a moe approach, they definitely failed. I saw nothing cute in these characters at all. Maybe it's because i'm not into that stuff. But panty shots of bears and ducks on teenage girls aren't really my thing. I found it awkward and completely unnecessary to the story.  Enjoyment/Overall 5/10  It was definitely not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. Towards the middle of the season, I was struggling to keep watching. I have a policy to watch an anime all the way through once I reach a certain point, so there was no going back. The story was boring and the characters were annoying. As usual, Key was aiming for an emotional tale that would grip our hearts and make us feel the pain the characters felt but this simply was not the case this time. It was just, meh. I would recommend this like I would recommend SAO: I wouldn't. Unless you like mediocre anime that relies solely on fan service to get viewers.  So if you just finished Clannad and want to watch another one of Key's visual novels animated, do yourself a favor and skip this one and watch Angel Beats or something instead.  There is a second season titled ""Little Busters: Refrain"" and i'm going to be watching it when it airs toward the end of 2013. Who knows? Maybe it will pull an ""Afterstory"" on us and crush our hearts to bits before an amazing ending. Hopefully it isn't as painful to watch as Season 1 was.";Mixed Feelings
1;Little Busters!;Aphyxia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aphyxia;5;"At first I thought this show was about baseball and let it slip by fast. Then I found out it was not and decided to give it a try. I regret it.  After having watched the first 6 episodes the anime was seriously below my expectations. Alas I read on the forums here that it gets better after about the 7th episode or so. So I pressed on. A waste of time, I tell you, I should've just dropped it right there and moved on to something that I could actually enjoy.  The anime suffers from bad story setup and lots of filler moments. What I mean by the latter is moments that really had no reason to be in the anime except to prolong it. Little Busters could be told in 12 episodes in a way that it would be actually interesting to watch.  In it's current state, however, it was boring. It was so boring that I sometimes just left it playing in the background in small screen with ""always on top turned"" on and turned my attention elsewhere or even played music to make the experience at least a little bit bearable. I wanted to watch it all to give an accurate review.  Regarding the story, sure, there were some good moments or ideas but I've watched even worse anime that had those. Most of it was the usual stuff you could see coming from a mile away and when things actually got interesting for a moment, it was all ruined with a bad conclusion which either was very simple (but somehow still needed Riki's help) or it was solved with magic (as in - that's the way thing are, don't ask questions). Especially horrid was the 23rd episode. Just goes to show that no it doesn't get better after the 7th episode, it's just as bad till the end. However, it does make you think that it'll get better.  Soundwise, the BGM was forgettable, the OP and ED poor, or not my style, whichever you prefer.  Characters were interesting (generally) for a brief moment when it was their time to shine (their arc) but after that they became generic and dull characters yet again. The two huge guy friends were at times especially painful to watch.  The art being good is the only thing that saves this anime from an even worse score. That and cute voice acting. This anime might have the cutest ""moe noises"" ever. The most interesting part was actually the ending but with the disappointment that is Little Busters, I doubt I'm going to want to watch the second season. Wafuu~ and skip this anime.";Mixed Feelings
2;Little Busters!;ezaya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ezaya;6;"If you are expecting another heart warming tearjerker series from Jun Maeda-sensei who created the trilogy which is Air Kanon and Clannad, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but you won't find it here.  Little busters was produced by Key and J.C. Staff. Yes you are right! Kyoto Animation didn't participate in this show.  Story: 7 Riki is a member of Little Busters together with Kyousuke, Rin, Masato and Kengo. In highschool they decided to recruit female members so that they can play and form a baseball team. Somewhere in the middle of the story Rin and Riki are receiving those letters from the cats which are saying the existence of a ""secret world"" and assigning them tasks they have to complete.  Art: 7 The art is fine. J.C. Staff did a fine job here. The characters are drawn smoothly.  Sound: 6 The Opening and Ending song by Rita is forgettable. Unlike the other previous Opening songs for Key which is dramatic that gives you the feels when listening to it.  Character: 7 The characters are good. They have different stories in this show. The only problem is that they only have 2-3 episodes for each arc of them. Not enough for a character development. Some are annoying with those ""wafuu"" lines.  Enjoyment: 5 Honestly I want to drop this show. But when I heard that there is a sequel which is Refrain I tried my best to finish the show even though it's super boring and cliche.  Overall: 6 I recommend you to watch this first if you are planning to watch the sequel. This may help for understanding the background stories and character development. Wasted potential. ""IF"" only KyoAni adapted this, it will be a another masterpiece in my list. If you enjoyed this show, then this show is for you. :) Thanks for the feedback! >.";Mixed Feelings
3;Little Busters!;animenium;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animenium;5;"Little Busters, like its predecessors (Clannad, Kanon, Air), is a comedy-romance based in school life. The story revolves around a teenage boy (who is a somewhat chick-magnet) Riki Naoe who suffers from a sleep disorder, Nyarukolepsy. What generally happens throughout this series is solving problems for each female character (as seen in Clannad as well).  ""A lot of people seem to blatantly hate it for the fact that it doesn't follow the original source material or won't even try watch it based on other people's hate towards it or because it's adapted by J.C. Staff and not traditionally KyoAni."" - Veniamin  Indeed, I agree with Veniamin. Unlike its predecessors (which were animated by KyotoAnimation), Little Busters were animated by J.C Staff. Personally, I don't see why people actually hate it because of that, J.C Staff has adapted a lot of the best anime out there, for example Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, Hidan no Aria, Shakugan no Shana, Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, and as well as Toradora. Its not really the studio that adapts the anime that matters, more like how the anime is produced as the result. J.C Staff has done a great job with the animation of Little Busters, producing work of high quality.  Not only did the anime excel in the animation, but the music too. The opening theme (composed by Jun Maeda, who also contributed in other anime which has the best songs, such as Angel Beats!), is reused in the anime as it was in the visual novel. The choreography in the opening theme demonstrates a breezy, happy atmosphere which carries the message of 'hope' and 'Keep looking forward!"" in it. Also, the opening has some introductory features to the characters as each character turn around to 'greet' the audience with such pleasure. Other than that, the soundtracks used during the course which undertook during intense scenarios are what I call, 'top-notch'. It is because of heart-aching soundtracks like ""Lamplight"" and ""Town of Incessant Rain"" I am constantly depressed. Anyway, the soundtracks and the opening theme deserve a big score, achieving a 9/10 from me.  However, even when the animation and sound quality has given a lot of potential to the anime, it all came crashing down for the storyline (atleast in my opinion). The storyline wasn't as captivating as it should've been, as well as it's inconsistency in keeping me engaged. It was a bit too slow in terms of reaching the rising action and the climax, spending its sweet time on character introduction, BASEBALL and a wee bit of fanservice. That being said, the anime DOES know how to make an audience cry, after all it is a Key Visual Novel. Unfortuantely, storyline (structure) is a no-go for me.  Although, I'll admit that spending alot of time on character development was worth it. Each character was well introduced, and each had their own personality and history. Voice actors and actresses had contributed the most in this department, this can be seen with the level of 'kawaii-ness' with Noumi Kudryavka and Natsume Rin. And so, character development is basically the highlight of the anime, along with sound quality and animation.  Overall, this anime was definitely worth watching, it was enjoyable yet intense at the same time. I recommend this anime for people who love the school-romance genre, or people who just want to kill some time or even for lolicons. Another thing, I personally think that the anime isn't something people would want to 'anime-marathon' on.";Mixed Feelings

This show also starts like a ""normal story"" with no supernatural involve, but suddenly Riki teleport a piece of metal to the other side of the world just because he can (I will not say why, it would be spoiler), it does not give us a reason why he can do this.

5;Little Busters!;cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;5;"Quick Thoughts: Little Busters! was an occasionally funny SoL comedy with some confusing melodrama stitched in.  Story: The majority of the story is about the main character, Riki, going around the school recruiting members for the baseball team he and his friends formed, the Little Busters. A lot of these recruits are misfits/outcasts at school; oftentimes Riki helps them with the issues and/or traumas afflicting them. I found a couple of these kind of compelling, which dealt with issues like loss or overwhelming expectations. However, I felt the other backstories ranged from overdramatic to ridiculous. This is in large part due to the supernatural aspects of this show, which seemed to pop up at random. The pacing was pretty solid though. The characters were introduced and developed at fairly steady pace.  Art/Sound: There's a bit of same-face syndrome with several characters, but I found the character designs appealing overall. The animation was fine; some movement could've been more dynamic but it nothing too distracting. Voice acting was hit-or-miss. There were some characters (ex: Komari) whose voices I found grating after a while. The OST didn't really stand out, and I ended skipping the OPs and EDs.  Characters: I think there was an issue with the large amount of characters. There's 10+ that play a prominent role, and with only 26 episodes, there's no way to give develop them with spending the whole season on development. The majority ended up feeling one-dimensional as a result. This also made it harder to empathize with their issues.  Enjoyment: I got some enjoyment out its SoL elements, but the emotionally heavy, melodramatic parts were pretty annoying to go through. It's seemed like much needed context from the source material was missing.";Mixed Feelings

7;Little Busters!;JessysAnime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JessysAnime;6;"This is my first attempt at a review. I've decided to try it with the series I most recently finished, Little Busters!.  First of all, I've watched Clannad, Angel Beats! and Charlotte before Little Busters!, and so the Key formula was very familiar to me. I expected this to be similar to Clannad, given it is about the same number of episodes and is considered just something to watch before the ""superior"" sequel, the same as Clannad with Clannad: Afterstory, and I was pretty much right. I haven't seen Little Busters!: Refrain yet, though, so can't say anything about if it's better than this first season or not.  Getting to the review...  Story: 6/10 It took place at school, like most anime. Very rarely were we shown other settings, as everyone stayed in dorms at the school and so had no reason to leave for the most part. The main story line was about Rin finding notes with tasks to do attached to one of her cats every now and then, with the promise that at the end she'd be told a secret to the world. Riki is always there right when she finds one, and sometimes helps. Usually, though, he's busy recruiting different girls with problems that get more and more serious as the series goes along to join the main cast's baseball club. I hated the arc part of Clannad, and didn't like it here either. Many of the characters' arcs were really stupid, and there were supernatural elements that seemed to only apply to the given situations and not be questioned or mentioned again. I've been spoiled a bit regarding the next season from Riki's character page, so I think maybe some of the logic behind the arcs' progressions might be explained in Refrain. Not sure.  Art: 8/10 The characters were nicely designed. Riki's face is the only thing that bothered me, with how unnatural and off it looked. The backgrounds were great. The baseball field, trees in courtyard, classrooms, ext, were quite good. Animation-wise, there was a bit of movement. Not much, though. A lot of just mouth changing. In the fight segments, where two characters fought using whatever they caught from what the other classmates threw at them, I'd always be disappointed since I'd expect some elaborate animation showing them using the different objects and yet it usually just cuts to the result.  Sound: 6/10 The opening song and ending song both sound nice. They remind me of Angel Beats!. The videos accompanying them are quite interesting as well, though after seeing the opening a few times I skipped it after the clip showing each character one by one, and the ending after seeing it once I avoided since it was seen already and doesn't feel new or fun afterwards. I downloaded it in dual audio, and switched between the Japanese and English versions a lot. Kud's Russian accent in the English dub was cringey, and made her serious scenes seem less serious with how ridiculous it was. Riki's voice sounded like a woman's in both versions. A lot of the girls had squeaky high pitched voices in the Japanese version, which was difficult to endure.  Character: 7/10 I really liked Riki's character. I watched the first episode expecting him to be the typical weak guy who feels horrible about it and doesn't do much right, but that wasn't the case. Riki kind of accepts it and it's not a big deal, while he does what he can to help the others, his biggest problems being Kyousuke leaving by the end of the year and his narcolepsy, both not being major in comparison to what else goes on. The other characters have a main personality trait and a few quirks, based on their arcs, and that's it. At some point the female characters blended together in my head and I had trouble remembering who each were based on what their backstory was. Some development occurs with the characters, such as Rin being less shy and Mio feeling more comfortable around others.  Enjoyment: 5/10 I was disappointed at the start, and kept taking long breaks between each set of episodes. The middle just made me want to quit, not finding the series worth the effort. In the end, though, I felt kind of happy. It was a feel-good ending of sorts, making my opinion of the series as a whole a bit better. Still, it was a chore to go through all 26 episodes, despite some being better than others.  Review Overall: 6.4/10 I added up the scores and divided by 50 to get the final score's percentage. This might be different from what I have on my anime list, as it's more of an assessed mark than the score I give on my list after finishing the show based on how I felt about it at that point.";Mixed Feelings

9;Little Busters!;cringeylazy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cringeylazy;5;"Some stuff right a lot of things wrong.  This is a spoiler free review from the perspective of a fan of the visual novel that rewatched the anime a year later.  Positives: -I'll start off by saying I like the choice of voice actor/actress change for Riki as I find that Yui Horie fits the role a lot better than the original casting in the VN. -The main cast (Riki, Rin, Kyousuke, Masato, and Kengo) share the same chemistry as the VN, which is very well adapted. -Mio: Mio's route is adapted fairly well as they give it enough time. It's missing some key scenes, but overall, it's a good enough adaptation. -The slice of life sequences, especially the episode where Riki visits the girls dorm, are very well adapted and fun to see animated. -The opening and ending music from the VN is still present, as is the brilliant soundtrack (albeit used oddly at times). -Extra insight into Rin and Komari becoming friends is a nice touch for fans.  Negatives: -Haruka: One of the worst adaptations I've ever seen. Now, I don't think Haruka's route is any masterpiece, but the adaptation is absolutely awful. It makes Haruka and Kanata look like complete nutjobs because of the weird focus on the wrong scenes and the fast pacing because of the time constraints. -Komari: Her ending completely ruined, the original story of overcoming internal trauma by looking at it from a different angle. -Animation is only serviceable, lacks detail, and clearly isn't made with much passion. -Art style change is very odd, looks a bit generic, and loses a lot of the charm of the VN.  To conclude, the anime is an ok adaptation... I originally liked the anime when I watched it; I still thought Kud and Haruka's arcs sucked, but I enjoyed the rest of the story and liked the characters. But upon rewatching, it's an extremely mediocre, barely serviceable adaptation of the visual novel. I think if you're never going to read the visual novel, it does something at least, but it's most definitely a worse experience. I've seen a lot worse adaptations before, so I don't want to be too critical, but it's a very flawed show on its own, and now that I know how mediocre its adaptation is, it makes it a lot worse.  My Anime vs VN ratings for each arc: Komari - anime: 4/10 VN: 8/10 Haruka - anime: 1/10 VN: 8/10 Mio - anime: 7/10 VN: 8/10 Kud - anime: 3.5/10 VN: 3.5/10  Overall rating: 5.5/10 (If you would like to see my short review of the VN check out my backloggd or vndb)";Mixed Feelings

I didn't really care about Key's works before, but this time I had to react. Let's start with the characters: they're all a bunch of stereotypes patchworks from the previous Key's works. I didn't find any girls interesting except for Mio and Rin. Mio's arc from the season 1 was the best one in my opinion, Kud's arc was the worst piece of shit ever.  The music was inspired by Wii Sports it seems, it didn't really bring me any sadness or whatever, and the comedy-performance was really poor. I swear, I've never seen worse except for Clannad. And the story in general was very poorly written, this is really a generic harem except for some artificial extensions like baseball which brings this to a sport anime.  Let's talk about the few arcs, the first one was about Komari. I really find the concept interesting, but in the end you get the loli's artificial crying and it made me fucking angry. I remember the pink haired twins being probably the worst after Kud. And the pseudo-vice-president or whatever was playing tsundere so bad that it makes Haruhi Susumiya looks like a god. Mio's arc was really a piece of art, this character was credible because she reminded me of myself, the stuff about the self-preservation, the cultivation books and of course the yaoi was the best part.  Something really sucks about this show and would be the main-protagonist Riki: he's supposed to build a harem, but in your mind you'll think he's a girl (his voice is the most girly compared to the others girls); this is truly laughable. Of course the others guys are the essential factors for developing his ""virility"". Good luck in whatever they are doing!";Not Recommended

It sort of felt like I had stumbled upon an inside joke, that while it was fun to watch as an outsider, I knew I was missing a lot of in jokes. After watching the 8 three minute long videos I did some googling and found the manga and sat down for a read. And then I read the prequel. And then I watched the band ""Litchi Hikari Club"" music videos. And then I watched the anime again. Basically it sucked me in.  What I've found is the deeper you get into the Litchi Hikari Club, the better it gets. I really enjoyed both of the mangas and would recommend those to the not so faint of heart before you go for the anime. Once you've read the manga the anime's humor seems much more unsettling and creepy than it had before.

0;Litchi DE Hikari Club;Total_Saikou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Total_Saikou;8;It's difficult to recommend this spoof because it's so far off from what the source material is. While fans who enjoy both graphic Eroguro works and irreverent Japanese comedies exist (das me), it's very unorthodox to create a work that shifts from one into the other and tries to appeal to both crowds at once. Obviously, I had an inkling that adapting LHC into an anime would be difficult, given its graphic content. However, I never expected it to be turned into a mini-episode comedy sketch series that centers on inside jokes from LHC. Anyways, I did find it pretty funny and I absolutely lost my shit when Hakuei showed up out of nowhere (ngl Litchi Hikari Club is one of my fav VK alter-ego bands, it's up there with My Dragon for sure). I only recommend this series to those who like comedy sketch shows and have already read Litchi Hikari Club, otherwise, you'll be very much lost and won't get the jokes at all.;Mixed Feelings
0;Litchi DE Hikari Club;recidivante;https://myanimelist.net/profile/recidivante;2;"The anime adaptation of ""Litchi DE Hikari Club"" is, regrettably, a pale and distorted representation of its manga namesake. Any hope of seeing even the slightest complexity and dark atmosphere the original manga tried to deliver is swiftly dashed. The decision to present the narrative in three-minute episodes, aimed at humor, seems a glaring misjudgment. Instead of delving into the intricate layers of the source material, we are subjected to superficial attempts at humor that disrespect rather than pay homage to the original work.  The animation, in turn, leaves much to be desired. What should have been an opportunity to highlight and enrich the manga's unique aesthetics manifests as something awkward and devoid of finesse. There's a tangible sense that corners were cut, resulting in a product that feels not only rushed but also disinterested in its own narrative. Especially when the aesthetics of the original manga already represent the best of the manga.  The outcome is a series that, instead of complementing and expanding the appreciation of the original work, runs the risk of alienating its fans and confusing new viewers with its disjointed approach.  In summary, ""Litchi DE Hikari Club"" as an anime is a missed opportunity, failing to capture the essence, tone, and depth of its manga counterpart.";Not Recommended
0;Listeners;robert788;https://myanimelist.net/profile/robert788;7;Listeners (2020)  First off this is a show that will be slated and in some cases for good reason but at the same time, it is a bit harsh. I think this would have benefited having more than 12 episodes but not as many as 24. Perhaps the ending should have been an OVA immediately released to allow it to spread more of the story.  The show itself does contain a pretty basic plot and it is also one that does a full 360. In this I mean we have an event that causes a war-like scenario which is then repeated to have a different ending. The ending is more representative of the 1960-1970 era of the hippies and love.  The show started off really strong and it was building itself to be a real show breaker coming out of the generic storyline to actually build. Problem is that it faltered about 6 episodes in. Personally, I believe this was due to it being only 12 episodes. If it had a few more it would have been able to portray itself much better.  The art of the show is actually pretty brilliant. It is a high standard throughout and really shows the symbolism that it wants to give. The CGI used on the mechs is also of a great standard.  Sound in the show is good, not quite as I would have hoped since the music it was based off is so iconic. I guess there must have been some legal reasons that dulled the authentic feel down.  Characters mainly Mu and Echo the protagonists are really good. To begin with, you believe Echo to be the soul main with Mu then coming to take over and then it is shared.  A few other characters of note make for an interest situation. Nir is very interesting since she actually gets an episode purely for her which was so unusual.  We must remember most characters are based off someone generally.  Best girl tournament in this for me:  1. Nir 2. Sally 3. Roz 4. Mu 5. Janis  Mu is a great girl but she develops in a different way and her Tsundere personality is handled a bit weirdly.  Remember in episode 12 you see 'track 13' so it sort of has a short ending episode with a short OVA you could say.  In the end, I would say honestly the show is good. Nothing more and nothing less than good. It would have been a solid 9 had the show not been rushed to cram in content and possibly a 10 if the music was that little bit better and more authentic.  The show is an enjoyable ride as something casual to watch. I would recommend it since the ending is pretty nice and a cliff hanger. Saying that I don't expect to see it renewed, I actually don't think it needs to be as it left on a nice note.;Recommended

This may be based in the influence of music from the 70's till the late 90's but its not for older people as some mention, this is the message of music, how music brings everyone together in a peaceful way, no matter the style. Jimmy can be a personification of jimmy Hendrix, and following the hippy concept, a mix of our reality, but that it, now a day there is much more options and that gives you more choice, but music is music, we may not feel attached to cert cultural music or style, but everyone likes something in this world.";Recommended

Even the love element between the two characters is nothing more than blushing and vague hints by other characters. It's like watching a flower half blossom and then stay that way. Don't get me wrong. I love the premise, the idea and the music history that's tied in. I'm a dork in that aspect, but when it comes to anything beyond those elements, it's lacking. The twist is okay and caught me a bit off guard, but ultimately, I should've seen it coming.  The art is not good for a modern anime. I try to judge art based on it's ""era."" In other words, if this was an anime from the early 2000s, I'd take that into consideration. But it isn't and visually, there are many more stunning shows out there.  Sound was outstanding in my opinion. It was well acted (english dub) and the music constantly felt appropriate and well written. I tapped my foot along to the opening each time and felt most of the ending songs were at least good. If there was anything missing, it's that each character was inspired by a rock-n-roll legend and yet seemed to have a lack of musical styling to back that up. I consider that a flaw under character though.  Much like the story, the characters were half-baked. Echo Rec and Mu were the two best, but their relationship never blossoms properly. The other players are nothing but noise and the earless never feel like a properly developed ""bad guy."" Even with the overall point of the story line, the earless should have started out this way. Truthfully, I'm not even sure that we ever find out what the earless are or where they come from. They just appeared, I guess.  All of this said, I actually enjoyed the show. I was hoping for another season despite one of the lower ratings on my list, but I do not foresee us getting that. If we were given another season, they need to fix a lot to turn this anime into something great.  Do I recommend? Yeah, it's not terrible, but don't expect a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo.";Recommended
7;Listeners;toomuchanimeokay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/toomuchanimeokay;7;- [ ] If you watch this thinking it’s going to poke at your love for music, or if you hope it’s going to have a wonderful message as the undertone throughout the whole season, you will finish it with a bad taste in your mouth. Keep an open mind with this anime, and don’t cling yourself to the lame references it makes.   The anime has an iffy slow start, but does a good job at keeping a steady pace from start to finish. To really enjoy this anime, you need to ignore its many references to generic artists and understand that it’s just one of the many elements comprising the anime. It’s a story about a world and its people after a near cataclysmic event took place. You meet many interesting characters while watching this anime, and see how they live in the after math.  I won’t pretend I though about quitting this anime after the first episode, but I’m glad I stuck it through. You need to watch it with an open mind, and do not give it strict expectations. Make sure you stick around after the credits on each episode as well, or the story will seem like it has holes that aren’t really there. All that being said, this is just my strong opinion. If you choose to let the bad reviews keep this off your watch list, or if you let them give you a negative and closed mindset when watching, that’s up to you. Solid anime, decent story, no annoying catch phrases or signature laughs, I’d watch it again.;Recommended

I guess it couldn't have been that interesting.  TL;DR Buy the soundtrack, especially if you like Rie Takahashi's singing. Otherwise, don't bother watching, they really try, animation is decent, sound is amazing, but the narrative is needlessly confusing, and not in the way the Kagerou Project was.";Mixed Feelings
1;Listeners;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;5;Listeners is a show that wanted to be something, but ultimately failed to ever materialise. An interesting/fun concept with poor execution.  The show started off pretty well with a first episode that did manage to catch my attention and get me interested in the world. I got pretty heavy FLCL vibes from it given the focus on adolescence, the sexual undertones and innuendos, etc. However, whereas FLCL had a legitimate plot and was enjoyable to watch, I found many episodes of Listeners downright disorienting and difficult to sit through.  The pacing and narrative are really all over the place with characters coming in and out of the story at random, overt rock and roll/drug references that are beat over your head every damn episode and an extremely confusing overarching story. After watching the entire series, I probably know as much about the series as someone who’s only read the MAL synopsis.  Despite the awful pacing, storytelling and overdone pop culture references, Listeners is rather impressive technically. Some decent CGI scenes, cool character designs, beautiful art and a pretty cool soundtrack. Unfortunately the consistency of its art was not shared by its story. As a result, for only the 6th time in my life, I would have to advise against watching this one.  Despite an interesting concept and world, listeners falls flat on its face. While I appreciate the effort by the studio, it could have been much better with better direction. Listeners gets 5 earless out of 10.  Note: Listeners is one of only 5 shows that I have ever rated below 7.;Mixed Feelings

At first, the show has a very promising premise about these kinds of people that can control amp-like robots and defeat monsters known as ""Earless"" ((Although to me they totally looked to have ears due to their horns)) but then all of that is kinda thrown out the window once we ""get"" to hear about Jimi ((people who've seen it know where I'm coming from)).  It never really gave any major information on any of the supporting characters, like what is the relationship between Bilin and Kevin ((and if someone is about to say ""erm...they are married?"" then where in what episode is the proof because I can't find any info on that)). Heck if the show can give more flesh on characters like Lyde, Ritchie, Nir, and the old lady (an old lady Lyde and Ritchie lives with) then where is that for the supposed main characters that are Echo and Myuu.  Also, the relationship between Echo and Myuu seems really forced and I don't like it. Like the only characters that I liked were Lyde and Ritchie, as well as Denka.  To me, a show like this deserves a 6 out of 10, it's worth your time if you got nothing to do and want to spend about 5 hours of your life on something, then be my guest to watch Listeners.  I due hope that I kept it a spoiler-free review and to a point (somewhat). Talk to you guys later Sayonara Bye Bye~ ^w^";Mixed Feelings
3;Listeners;y8man;https://myanimelist.net/profile/y8man;5;"If there is a way for you to experience Listeners in an audio-only medium like an audiobook or a musical album, that would be a much better alternative to what this eccentric mess has been. I'm probably a weird case here, where I was immediately hooked upon seeing JIN'S INVOLVEMENT in the anime. For those who don't know, Jin is particularly known for his Kagerou Project, which anime adaptation's quality is debatable. I am a huge fan of Jin's approach to storytelling, but Listeners just didn't cut it.  For all its eccentric aspects, Listeners wound up being quite underwhelming. It could have been so much more amazing, yet it ended up feeling like it only tiptoed from one theme to another. With an interesting premise and an intriguing world and cast (supposedly), it just failed to deliver the any punches.  However, I do like it, but more as a weird MECHA ANIME with quirks quite unique to its genre. A large number of mecha animes I've watched, I only watched for a simple and carefree non-serious viewing. I acknowledged their flaws but enjoyed them nevertheless for embracing the fanservice tropes of what makes a mecha anime. However, Listeners clearly wanted to be more. With the themes of music, love, partnership and a strange sort of individuality involved, the anime supposedly was meant to be packed, but the rough episodic arcs seemed to serve it for the worse.  The investment for each mini-arc felt unworthy. Maybe it would have been much better with 24 episodes, especially with the flamboyant narrative that it so wished to incorporate. And please don't get me started with the large amounts of ENGRISH in this anime!   Characters 3/10: The set of characters partnered with a strange narrative left me with a weird feeling of disconnect instead. Meanwhile, side characters are severely forgettable. The episodic pacing of the anime for its characterization did not serve justice to a lot of these characters. They're mostly bland or would easily fit in a trope, making developments not really that interesting or outright predictable. The characters felt like mere plot devices rather than people you would get affection for or investment with. I don't want to drop names, but I really wanted one eccentric character to have more screen time.   Sound Design 10/10: Then there is this. Huge fan. I will probably only suggest ""watching"" this anime to experience the amazing OST. A strong mark of distinction that fit well with the anime's intended atmosphere. I could even go so far as to tell new viewers to just listen to each song that the anime has and leave it that way. It's fun. It's immersive, way more immersive than what the anime itself delivered. And it's powerful.   Art Style 4/10: I feel the art style suffered from the vibrant sound design. It actually ended up feeling bland in comparison. Since I can't give an image example in a review, take the image of a scrap heap like that of Astro Boy's but make it look muddled in its colors. I feel that the anime wanted to give off a dystopian feel to it, but it just felt lackluster or even lazy. Also with the premise of sound, the delivery of the ""impact"" of sound in this anime is very unfulfilling. It is seriously way more fun to just listen to the OST and just be carried away by that.   Plot 5/10: One boy meets a mysterious girl with amnesia. Starts off with a trope, pushes through with a criminally underdeveloped world, ends with bland predictability. They set on a journey to search for information, and also fight in a weird and undefined robot system that's not really worth a second thought. It was fine. It's personally interesting enough to just follow along and let things happen. I'm pretty sure others will see this anime as a waste of time, and I have no problem with that.   Final Note 5/10: I will NOT suggest watching this anime, but I kinda liked watching it.";Mixed Feelings
4;Listeners;Wallanimx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wallanimx;5;"The first 2 episodes tricked me. ""Oh, this has a slight FLCL vibe! The story seems pretty interesting! I bet the main characters will be fun!""  And then, as fast as a heartbeat, the series just went right downhill. The story went everywhere and no where.  ""The Earless are bad! They hurt people? But nevermind they're good? Its all just a misscommunication problem? WHAT?!?!?!""  ""Let's travel to a bunch of places to get clues on this one heroic dude and lose track of the story by us forgetting what our purpose was for being their in the first place until it becomes relevant to the story again!""  The characters became incredibly bland and it felt like all the side characters added nothing to spice up the dreadfulness of it all. Despite their interesting designs, their personalities were just flat and one note.  The soundtrack was medicore in the end. Which for an anime like this is just disappointing at best.  I wanted to enjoy this anime. I really thought it had a good start...but they lost control of everything with the story, character development (laughable), and characters themselves that...I just can't make this a recommendation for anyone.

5;Listeners;Benx2019;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Benx2019;5;"The story is kind of interesting, but a little too ""Go to this place, now go to other place"" for me. There are also elements of the plot that are part of one episode and then never really capitalized/built on, but perhaps that's in hopes for a second season? There were some good moments, but it was just kind of eh. 6/10  The art wasn't very good. I strongly dislike the overuse of cg, especially when it's bad. So when I see cg mech with the MCs lifeless unmoving cg models riding it, I want to die. There really isn't any excuse for such poor cg. Some positives can be found in the aesthetic design of the mechs, but the chubby cheeked heroine is kind of an eyesore. Another bad thing is that the animation colors are wrong in a couple scenes... I think? I'm not sure, but it seemed to me that a effect was green when the context and previous scene would lead you to believe it should be purple. The outros are actually a lot more to my liking in terms of art style, but have some of the same issues. Next time instead of animating a new outro with a new song every episode, spend that time and money on the MC cg character model instead. It looks terrible and creepy, case in point 20:35 of episode 2. This isn't the only time it happens, and it's unacceptable. 4/10  In terms of voice acting, I watched the dub, the range was awkward to just eh. The voices themselves aren't great, but not necessarily bad. However there were just to many cringe lines that were awkwardly said by the heroine. Also the sound effects are sometimes kind of weird and not what anyone would logically expect, like when a screw is turned in an episode is an example. That being said the music is actually pretty good, the intro is decent, and there is a new outro every episode(or most, not sure). All the outros are pretty good too. The ost is also pretty well done, I enjoyed listening to the music in the background more than I enjoyed the show as a whole. The music would easily be a 9 or 10, but the voice acting and sound effects are not great and that's something I just can't ignore. 6/10  Some of the characters are interesting, but the interesting elements aren't capitalized on much. The MCs are just kind of eh, and the heroine has some interesting character development, but it kind of fell flatter than it should have for me. The side characters were at times more interesting than the man characters, but not enough of time was spent on them. 6/10  I enjoyed the music, and the interesting design mech designs. However, the poor animation, and only kind of alright characters/story caused me to lose interest. Truth be told I started playing Minecraft while watching halfway through. There were parts that held my attention, but overall it was mediocre at best. 5/10  Overall the terrible cg made a 6 or 7 into a 5 out of ten. You might like this if your into mechs and like the mech design style, but I'd imagine there are better things to watch. 5/10";Mixed Feelings
0;Listeners;Goober-fish;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Goober-fish;2;HEY! Listen!  “Listeners” is fucking garbage, and in most cases, I’d say you’d have to see it to believe it but I pray no one besides myself has to lay themselves bare to this level of unfiltered drek.  If the litmus test for a half-decent anime screen-writer is having listened to the musical stylings of Jimi Hendrix, Prince, and Pink Floyd (among many...many others), then you can consider most dads in the continental United States accomplished enough to pen something equal to or better than Listeners. This isn’t a show for music nerds or people who can appreciate the hallowed halls of surface-level dad-rock, no, no, Listeners is a bit more sinister than that. Listeners is 12 straight episodes of some smug prick patting himself on the back for having listened to the most bare-essential “classics” in the history of popular music. You like Nirvana? So does the rest of the world, dude.  Besides its flashy concept and presentation, Listeners is one giant nothingburger of an anime. Its intentions are pretty damn transparent, to the point where its disjointed narrative throws caution to the wind in order to fulfill the fucking reference quota in any given episode. The dialogue in this script simply acts as a placeholder for more fucking references. I shit you not, entire sequences of conversation in this show can be boiled down to two Talking Heads (see, I can make references too) reciting famous song lyrics to each other in place of substantive discourse, exposition, or character interaction. I’ve seen some call this “impressive” for sheer virtue of the fact that you have to frame this in a manner that both visually and narratively fits the story… PUHLEASE!  Mu, of course, the mascot character and strong female deuteragonist. Another mysterious Mary McGuffin who lacks social graces, sports a bitchy attitude, and is generally unlikable by most standards. Complete with a nebulous past that is somehow directly involved in the plot, lovely, haven’t had enough of those. But she wouldn’t be complete without “Echo”, what a lovely character. An intrepid young lad with an appetite for (reconstruction?). These two may as well just be Kamijou Touma and Index but even they had better chemistry than these two buffoons. Your average character interaction between them will generally involve Echo regurgitating essential world-building and Mu calling Echo a weirdo for doing so, brilliant.  I get that this show is supposed to be some kind of kitschy tribute to artists of old but there’s little to no consistency in terms to what it chooses to riff that the references at best come off like a Spotify playlist of rock essentials. The world of Listeners suggests a reverence for rockstars, but the references wouldn’t lead you to believe so. This makes me question references to MBV and Robert Johnson, I mean does the type of music Kevin Shields produces exactly scream “rock star?” People under the supposition that this show has consistency in terms of what music it chooses to pay tribute to are gravely mistaken. Additionally, artists like Kurt Cobain who famously repudiated this degree of blind idolatry have flagrant references strewn about like kitschy decor, which is stunningly ironic.  It would be one thing if all these on the nose winks and nods to popular music acts from back in the day were for the sake of aesthetic (take Jojo’s for example), but it couldn’t be that simple, this shit is intrinsically tied to the narrative. Everything from “Teen Spirit” to “The Wall” has some form of off-the-cuff functionality in the world-building that lives and dies with whatever episode it was mentioned in. Also, I have to question the rationale behind making the Jimi Hendrix (widely recognized as one of if not THE single most important black musician in the history of music) stand-in, a generic pasty-skinned rock god catch-all. What kind of optics are these? Who the fuck co-signed this shit? The same dude who tried to cast Julia Roberts as Harriet Tubman?  The CG models for the mechs are chunky and distractingly out of place which makes for some of the most awkward action sequences I’ve seen come out of an anime in this year. Give this concept to Trigger or David Productions and I’m sure they’d at least be able to cobble something together with the visual panache to distract from its cliched sensibilities.  Yeah...so...Listeners, that was a thing, I guess? Alright, listen (okay...I’ll stop), perhaps this show wasn’t made for someone like me who is cognizant of most if not all of the musicians it proudly flaunts, but I have to question if this show even really has a target audience I could recommend it to. If you’re someone who is completely oblivious to all or most of the references, what leg would this anime have to stand on? There isn’t a compelling story, not a single noteworthy character, or even just a brief cut of decent visuals that isn’t just lazily aping the music it pays tribute to. It’s just utter nonsense and sci-fi gobbledygook.  Needless to say, this anime made me foam at the mouth, and not in a good way. This show is so eye-roll inducing that my sockets have ballooned by at least a centimeter over the course of its 12 episodes. Fuck you Jin.;Not Recommended
1;Listeners;SanaeK10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SanaeK10;3;Listeners shows you can't rely on good voice talent alone to prop up your show. When it was first announced, the list of A-list seiyuu being cast as virtually everyone had piqued my interest disregarding the actual content of the show. Talents and performances from people you don't really hear from that often nowadays with the influx of newer cheaper talent. So I vowed to myself to sit through this to the end at the very least, I mean, if they could spend enough money to get good talent, surely the actual show would be at least somewhat decent wouldn't it?  Turns out I was deluding myself to the highest degree. If I had wanted to listen to these performances, what I should have been doing instead is watching older anime. But enough about me, more on the actual show. That money had to have come from somewhere, and what remains is a lousy mess of animation that is neither inspiring nor is it interesting. Listeners is nothing but dad rock references propping up the main plot and narrative without having them make any much sense in the greater context of the overall story. At its core its a very simple boy meets girl kind of story yet executed in the dullest possible manner. The situations and setpieces Echo and Mu end up in just end up being music references to whatever the episode decides to be about, being references for the sake of references without providing any nuance or even humor to them. Like, the closest thing this reminds me of is Brutal Legend. But (for all its flaws) Brutal Legend at least managed to satisfactorily tie in its isekai rock world theme with its music references, Listeners on the other hand feels completely lost with its referential material not knowing what it actually wants to accomplish.  It's hard to believe this was done by Mappa. Animation quality is generally stiff, the mecha designs are awful, and don't get me started on the Earless. The music in this is incredibly bland, with a lot of the tracks being lawyer-friendly copycats of the dad rock stuff they love referencing. Really, nothing in this show works at all. There is some irony when that QUALITY baseball show ended up having better music than a show about music.  All in all, I made a new rule to myself in order to justify why I ended up completing a show I ended up disliking in the end. In this case it was probably some naive thinking that the show would come to its senses and deliver some spectacle that never happened. Or perhaps I wanted to listen to Kugimiya Rie's voice more.

2;Listeners;curvedtree;https://myanimelist.net/profile/curvedtree;2;"Let's start with the good things about Listeners: it has a great OST, its opening and ending are awesome; the art is good, sure sometimes like any anime in the last 10 years have those weird looking moments, but overall good; the animation is alright and sometimes good, when they are not relying in CGI. That's it.  The idea behind the story is good, but its execution is a mess, it is pointless and with no closure, there are loose ends and they try to sound deeper than it actually is. One of the things they tried to gather fans was relying on good music and IRL references to great Rock musicians, you can't hold viewers for long if you are relying just on that. Then we get the characters, Echo is the same coward shounen hero you have seen a thousand times, a forgettable character even, Mu on the other hand felt more unique, however don't let this fool you, she is just the brave shounen hero, but as a cute girl - and, yes, I did eat the bait for her.  I usually like to praise or criticise the voice acting, but I was quite indifferent on that matter.  There is no sense of accomplishment in those episodes, they don't achieve nothing, it is a cat and mouse sorta. They tried introducing some deeper elements, but probably due to its age-rating they couldn't fully explore them - which could make the show a bit better -, so some of them felt rushed or one of those moments when we are lead to believe that ""remember that thing happened a few episodes? Let's forget that happened, okay?""  Listeners brought a new idea, I can't help but think about the Silmarillion's creation of the Middle-Earth world through music, but this concept was terrible adapted in Listeners. I hope that the public repercussion doesn't affect the future release of original animes, I just think they need to put some more work behind it and not release a good idea with a poor story.";Not Recommended
3;Listeners;VivavideoUser2x;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VivavideoUser2x;2;"Listeners will change your life on how bad it is, it's one of those anime that if you binged like i have, its like being frozen in time for 5 hours , and coming out of it only remembering how much time that you have wasted,NO actually, its not like that, it IS that.  Listeners feels like its plot was made by a generated AI, it ignores the steps of making a story: exposition, rising action, conflict, falling action, and conclusion. Shit just happens every single episode. Its formula is trying to explain stuff to you ,since the show does an awful job of it in the very beginning, but as a result, all of the rising action and conflict is trimmed and/or watered down to the point where its boring.And that ending is crap as well, the conclusion doesn't make much sense, people who die come back to life just because, and like rotten food, i projectile vomited just about all the mental things that i have seen from episode 1. I'm not kidding at all when i said this is the most boring anime i have seen. 95% of it is talking, and the rest are just very poorly presented fight scenes.  Actually this a great time to tell you how presentation plays such an important role in storytelling. You can have the greatest story of all time, but if it is presented in a sloppy manner, where the audience doesn't understand or becomes bored, you might as well not even make a story,you have to grab the audience's attention by showing and not telling.Boring an audience is a cardinal sin when it comes to anything.And in this case, listeners should be damned to hell when it comes to visuals.The animation is so low quality, movements are stiff, and since characters talk all the time, movements aren't even apparent that much. The designs are okay, but are just so poorly animated, And the fucking meccha designs are ass, like the assiest of the ass.They are absolute trash, which is not an overstatement since the mecchas fight in a dump most of the time.  Now i know what you're probably not thinking, ""where did the animation budget go"", well about 60% of it probably was put into the opening sequence,  Listeners OP the listeners op is too good for this world, i even considered it the best anime op of spring 2020. Animation wise, it everything you want to see in this show, but some of the things that happen in the OP don't happen in the show.And at this point, I don't even want to consider the op as something that determines my overall score on the show,because not only is it exponentially better than the actual show,the song done by accamer puts the actual music in the show to shame, it was all animated by one person as well: Shinpei Kamada,and you can just watch the op, come up with a story, and it would still be better than the actual story.   The characters are -i dont even know,i cant talk about any single character because they all are interchangeable, the two main characters have no chemistry, Mu is always the sassy girl, and Echo is the quirky kid who gets walked all over, and that's it, Mu always worries about where she came from, where did she go where did she come from cotton eye joe, and its annoying that while acting as such, she becomes stupid out of nowhere and ends up sparking the sudden,large ""conflict"" of the anime. And the only thing i can say about Echo is how the hell is he able to talk to people when he has those big ass headphones on the whole time?   For an anime about music, this anime has some pretty low-grade music, all of it is loud rock music that is so unfitting that i will never complain about the music in FLCL ever again, and every single insert song was done by Rie Takahashi of all things and its the most subpar j rock music ever.   lets just say that ""into the blues"" and the remix of it in the final episodes are only reasons i gave the sound a 4 instead of a 3     This is probably a weird place to mention the EDs but i had to because of how weird they are, the ending animations are all different but they just use animated parts of the episode but edited them in weird ways,its like those youtube videos where people professionally edit in anime clips into other anime (like saitama getting punched by tohru from dragon maid)but when its in listeners its awkward.  i think the best way to wrap up my review is just quote the first lines of the show, which basically sums up the whole show. TRASH ,Even the marketing for the show was poor, Funimation kept shilling the show hard before it came out with interviews and the like, yet literally the only selling gimmicks the show has is that the dude who made that Vocaloid show is behind it and another shmuck who worked on Eureka seven wrote the script.Like wow.To be honest, this shouldve been a series of music videos instead of a show.Animated by mappa and such.Because the shit plot thats elongated into 12 episoddes is just overkill, i just cant deal with this one,its a waste of time money, and or energy and the fact that mappa can just let this happen, is just disappointing to be honest.

4;Listeners;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;4;"Music as the main theme including mecha action and implied cyber or steampunk elements. That sounds like a pretty cool and extravagant mixture. Unfortunately, despite good ambitions and ideas, the series cannot deliver what it promises. Even though there are many allusions to music and stars of the last decades, but that alone does not make wine out of water. Music means a lot to me, the anime is dedicated to it and that's why it's hard for me to write this, but the anime as a whole is just not good.  Story: At first glance, simple & predictable, so the great thing about it is unfortunately only explored by music enthusiasts (4/10) It's such a shame that the script is so banal and far too short for the story. The really cool and well thought-out references to music and contemporary history are unfortunately mostly hidden from viewers who are not so keen about music, a real pity! The story begins in a world where there is no music. No music can be taken literally, and I personally think that's the main reason the anime can never be a success. If there had been a couple of weird and cool guys in the series who just made music that matched the allusions, you'd kill two birds with one stone that way. On the one hand, this would add delightful comedy to the story, and on the other hand, it would give some cool examples of the allusions to the music that might spark some interest in the audience to look up what the music is about. But in the absence of clues or music samples, most viewers see just a simple story about a boy who meets a mysterious girl with amnesia and goes on an adventure with her because of a small mishap.  Characters: Like the story, the main cast is not well staged and therefore not really likeable (4/10) The MCs are extremely stereotypical, perhaps this was intended so that the allusions to the history of music and the plot are not superimposed. If this is the case, then I just can't understand why the supporting characters were made so much more eye-catching and interesting. However, it is irrelevant, because the more interesting and engaging characters disappear as quickly as they appeared. Rec, Echo: A teenager with a shy nature. His hobby is electronic equipment, he wears an orange work suit and of course boys like to tinker with devices. The name ""Echo Rec"" is an allusion to an effect device by Binson. The ""Echo Rec"" is a delayed playback of the original sound, so that an echo is created. Myū (μ): She is a so-called player, easily recognizable by the cable connection in her body. The players fight against mysterious beings known as earless. Players use large robots that transform themselves from the so-called equipment. Even though Echo is a big fan of the players, they are generally not very popular, because 10 years ago a tragedy happened during a big event of the players. Suffering from amnesia and not knowing her real name, ""Echo"" gave her the name "" Myū (μ)"". In my opinion this is a really successful allusion to ""Planet Mu (Planet µ)"". The label is known as the home of Grime, Dubstep, Breakcore, Acid, Glitchy Shoegaze and Footwork. Even Breakcore and the revival of acid and electronic pop of the 80s were celebrated under the µ-symbol. Label founders Mike Paradinas and Planet Mu have created some hypes and revolutions in music, and I think Myū should embody that.  Let's have a look at the supporting characters. Nir: She's also a player and a student at the Freak Scene Academy. She is shunned by her classmates, there is a rumor that she would attract the earless. Her character is pretty cool, it's definitely a reference to Kurt Cobain, the songwriter and founding member of the American rock band ""Nirvana"" from Aberdeen. The look fits pretty well, Kurt Cobain was a man, but with Nir nobody notices that she is a girl. Anyway, pretty good innuendo with a supporting role and if you don't know the band, I recommend you to listen to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Denka: He is the leader of the purple kingdom and at the latest with the allusion to the color ""purple"" it is clear who was the model here. Denka's attitude and appearance as well as the scene in the bathtub can only be dedicated to Prince Rogers Nelson or simply Prince. An exceptional artist who wrote his own texts, composed and arranged the music. His musical spectrum ranged from R&B to funk, soul to jazz. Here, too, the portrayal of a supporting character is extremely well done. If you don't know Prince, I would like to recommend the track ""Purple Rain"" or if you want to see the original to the bath scene, ""When Doves Cry"". Neubauten “Sisters”: These three antagonists are a slightly more difficult allusion. It is actually a play on words. You have to put the first names of the three in the right order, then you get ""EinStürZende Neubauten” and that is the name of a German experimental band that is active in the genres Industrial, Dark Ambience and Noise. This isn't quite my cup of tea, so I don't really have a recommendation here. Ritchie & Lyde: These two perform as a duo, and I liked them immediately. They are residents of Londinium (= Latin for London), the city is a bit on the brink of collapse, it certainly has nothing to do with Brexit, but it hits the nail on the head. Anyway, the two are close friends, even if it doesn't look like that at first glance. Maybe they seem so normal to me, and that's why I like them. Nevertheless, there is also a clear allusion in the two of them. Here again it's the looks and the names. It's about the British band ""Sex Pistols"". It concerns the members of the punk rock band, John Joseph Lydon (stage name Johnny Rotten) and John Simon Ritchie (stage name Sid Vicious). So Ritchie and Lyde, I really would have liked to see more about them. There are still many references to the music scene, such as Janis (= Janis Lyn Joplin), an American songwriter and singer known in the rock, soul and blues genres, whose most famous song is ""Mercedes Benz"". Another reference is the name ""Leo Marshall"", the name is combined from ""Leo"" Fender and Jim ""Marshall"". These two names adorn musical instruments and amplifiers, without them the music world is unimaginable. Jimi Stonefree: It is rather a simple allusion to the virtuoso guitarist Jimi Hendrix. This allusion is so clear because there are several references in the series. The name ""Stonefree"" is a title from the album ""Are You Experienced"", which was released in 1967. The play in the anime, also has the title of a Hendrix song: ""All along the Watchtower"" which is from the 1968 album ""Electric Ladyland"". I'm very excited about this reference because I'm a huge Jimi Hendrix fan, although I don't quite understand why Hendrix was used in the first place. One might ask now, why is my rating for the characters so low, when there are actually good thoughts in it and the allusions are easily recognizable? The answer is the same as for the story (see above). Great ideas are of little use if the meaning is not perceptible. A lot of work has been put into the characters - except for the main characters - but the meaning, why these, why Jimi Hendrix, why Sex Pistols, and so on, remains unclear. The series is too short to convey the premise correctly to the viewer. Let's leave it at that, I got a little carried away already, and there is still so much that could be described. For example, the record that Janis pulls out of the pile in the basement is ""King of the Delta Blues Singers"", a scrapbook released by Columbia Records in 1961, which contains songs by US blues musician Robert Johnson. No, no... Here I go again... xD, I'll let myself be carried away again...  Visuals: Overall not well implemented and therefore below average (4/10) The visual appearance has attractive aspects every now and then, but the shortcomings outweigh the advantages. I enjoyed the world building, the background art. The character design wasn't really my cup of tea, however. The design of the characters corresponds very well to their real-life role models, I have to admit. But I am simply not a fan of the short, thick eyebrows. That's just a small thing, one could object now, but the face is a very important detail and especially the eye area. The character sketches are varied, but that's already results from the real-life models. The design is not great but the characters do not have a generic look either. The colour palette is adjusted to the tonality of the anime, which I think is a plus. Unfortunately, light and shadow effects as well as shading are less well done. The art seems to be a bit blurred overall and therefore details often vanish in the haze of the unrecognized. The topic details builds a bridge to animation and, my transition here is literally more fluid than the animation in the anime. A lot of CG is used, which would not be unusual for a Mecha as it creates clean contours and allows for a detailed and appealing design. Well, let's briefly ignore the fact that it is not quite clear why Mechas are used in this anime in the first place. The idea from above, a few cool and weird guys with instruments, even if it were only the voices of the singers, would have been more than enough. For example, it would have suited the anime to give the ""Rat Pack"" (Sinatra, Davis Jr., Martin, Bishop, etc.) a revival or, on the other hand, a vocal battle, just think of the movie ""8 Mile"". Regardless of the criticism of the meaning of using Mechas, the CG elements are sloppy and therefore shadows and shades are incorrect or rather irritating. The CG technique seems often choppy and the robot fights look more like a failed Idol concert, with no music and singing, but dance instead.  Music: All right, but too weak to raise the score for the anime (6/10) Some details about the music have been mentioned, but this was more about the visual appearance of the characters. In the field of music there is a little more to say. It is known that the episodes are music titles. ""Live Forever"" is a title by Oasis from the 1994 album Definitely Maybe. ""Teen Spirit"" Ep. 4, is a reference to Nirvana ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" from the 1991 album Nevermind. In the 10th episode the title is ""Cross Road Blues"" and refers to the musician Robert Johnson. This works with all titles in the series, just try the others. What is not immediately noticeable is that an attempt was made to represent a certain musical development. This goes well with ""Grunge"" by Nirvana, with Prince as a bridge over alternative rock to British pop from Oasis. Somewhat anachronistic in this series, however, is the blues in episode 10. The OP of the series is ""Into the blue's"" by ACCAMER. The artist also makes her debut in ""Listeners"". The powerful voice and the rocking guitar sound are a successful start to the series. Unfortunately, the animation promises more than the series as a whole can deliver. The idea of giving each episode a different ED is cool. I don't like all the titles, but for example ""Slip out!"" was really cool. I also really enjoyed ""Top of Ocean"". I'm sure that with twelve titles, everyone will find something to like. By the way, the fact that the titles all sound so different, even though it's always the same singer, is due to the fact that very different musical styles were used to match the episodes. My favourite title, however, is the Love song - side Hello. With the voice actors I noticed more the supporting roles again. As for the female voices, I especially liked Kugimiya, Rie. She embodied the role of Nir very well. Her interpretation of the emotions and the way of expression struck me positively. I also liked Hanazawa, Kana in the role of Roz. Among the male voices, Suwabe, Jun'ichi as the voice of Denka should definitely be mentioned. The extravagant and shrillness could be heard clearly in the voice and was interpreted very well. I also found the voice of Yamadera, Kouichi as Kevin Valentine very good. A very beautiful voice and pleasant to hear. Overall the sound section is the best part of the anime, but too weak to raise the score as a whole.  To be honest, I am very disappointed. It almost hurts to think that a lot of effort and work was put into the series, and in the end all that effort was unfortunately for nothing. The plot fails to convey to the viewer what is really cool about the story. The MCs are unlikable, and cool supporting characters disappear in the blink of an eye. The mecha action is few and not well done. And since there's no music either, the anime just doesn't have anything compelling to offer its genre fans. Some would call this effort ""wasted"" or simply ""wasted"", so would I!  As always, thanks for reading, but the anime is not worth the time.";Not Recommended

When I heard it was about 70s rockstars, you had me interested, when you brought in Mecha, you had me slightly disappointed, when I watched it, you had me appalled.    Spoiler warning, but here's a small spoiler, just don't fucking watch it it's terrible.    Wow... WOW... This show's bad, like bad. Horrible. Where do I even start, man I had a bit of hype for this as it had music inspired theme which I so dig. I love those classic, influential rock bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd and hearing that these are in the show got me interest. Straight from the first episode, I was let down in an instant and the rest was just an eyesore to watch. This even got to a point of me thinking, 'Why am I watching this???'  Character issues are everywhere, from the top to the bottom, left to right and even diagonally can you believe that? We have this pathetic virgin of the main character Echo which we have to stick with for the whole show. That alone is already no good. Even fucking Mu, I don't find her anything appealing or interesting about her. So from the get-go, we have 2 utterly shit main characters that we have to stick with. What comes after that is their intentions that form the main story. What the fuck am I watching, literally Mu was like 'Let's do this' and it just goes, like from nothing just appeared a story out of nowhere. So fine they wanted to find where's Jimi and they two alone made like so much progress despite them both being kids, like what.  Speaking of Jimi and all the inspired characters, why is Jimi white? Like fine if they just wanted to use his name at least make him look or act like Jimi, they got Prince right why can't they just get it on Jimi? That boggles my mind. Oh and don't get me started on the script inspired or name inspired moves that characters say. Like they literally use famous song sentences and incorporate it into their lines, the result is pure cringe and a failed JoJo inspired wannabe. Like who thought that those lines were good? Who in the fuck thought any of this is good, ""Oh let's just cut up some lines and just make the characters say them, that be cool right???"".  Now the story, I won't say there's no story cause there clearly is. So the goal was to find Jimi and bring him back, getting there is another problem altogether. The story alone is bad, but it's not disappointing bad or like, angry bad. It's laughably bad. I laugh at how poorly written this story of theirs is. It's so childish, it's so boring and it's so uncreative. Like there's nothing to the story that is interesting or at least worth something. It's just dog shit all the way.  Production-wise, what happened MAPPA? Did they use up all their budget for Dorohedoro or their upcoming The God of High School, which to be honest looks quite good. If so then why proceed with this shitty show, they even got sponsors for this show, did they like get the money and just made this low-produced show to get the cash only? So many questions, so little answers. I'll admit, the reason I'm not giving this a straight-up 1 is that they did put in some effort. Like every outro has a different animated ending or that they try to sync up the music with scenes and stuff. Honestly, it's more miss than hits.  Art-wise it's like line art with the bucket tool to fill in the colour, that's all. No interesting design and even the Mecha all looks garbage. Plus the fucking 3D doesn't even match the 2D.  -SCORES-  Character- 1/10: Fuck all of them, at least they had Prince which I like for it's... Prince. And err... anything else erm... nope, just Prince.  Art- 2/10: It's so bad that it's laughable.  Writing- 1/10: Hahhahhaa...  Sound- 6/10: While I compliment them for using rock music to fit the theme and having a different outro every episode. I must say, compared to the show's inspired songs like Jimi Hendrix and Sex Pistols, the songs they give are not even close to those.  Overall, this show tricked me into thinking this is a rock-inspired anime, I feel cheated. GIVE ME MY TIME BACK.   Light to Decent 2";Not Recommended
6;Listeners;Mike-Honcho;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mike-Honcho;4;"Bad but not horrible, I think that's the best way to describe this show.  For a while now i have been itching to watch a good ol' mecha series in the charts, so when I'd read the synopsis of this one i thought: why not give it a shot?  The concept really is interesting, at least to me sounds that way. Not just music powered mechas but a world with references to rock and pop culture, characters based on musicians and the ""equipments"": amps that when connected to the performers or ""players"" turn into mechas they then pilot. All this, I think, had potential for a rich and interesting world-building, like technical differences in the robots, diverse and characterized fighting styles between the players and stuff to name a few. Instead we got clunky and generic CGI mecha action, really bad CGI monsters that looked like a fog biker mice (?) and characters that resembles iconic rock/pop figures only on a superficial level. The may look like them and even throw a line or two out of their songs (which by the way it's done in a really awkward way) but there's not much more to them, no character development or thought in the relation between them or the main characters. Anyway, with a messy story, bad character writing and not too sharp animation it has details about it that makes me believe that there was love or passion put into it, like the detail of different endings for all the chapters with cinematic sequences from the chapter but rearranged to a more symbolic retelling of the episode. So even if the final product has it's flaws i think it's good that some studios keep staking with original projects.";Not Recommended
7;Listeners;chipi1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chipi1016;4;"I wish I could tell you this is an amazing anime.  It's obvious this is a passion project, that this was an idea that was held dearly by those who worked on it, unfortunately passion and good ideas are not enough. Execution is the lion's share of why anything is good, and the execution of this anime is... honestly laughably bad.  Because it is an anime let's start by talking about the animation. I'm of the (perhaps controversial) belief that good animation can save an otherwise mediocre story. The reason's why are for another time, but suffice it to say that when I saw a preview for this anime I had high hopes because I already saw really interesting character designs and a unique art esthetic that pleased me. The character designs are still unique, I'll give this anime that, but the art is washed over by a haze that makes everything ten times less brilliant and takes the art from unique to drab in an instant. Don't believe me? Compare the art in the episodes to the outro visuals that are pulled from the episode itself (this started in later episodes) and you'll wish you had seen the anime that's been shown in the outro.  Ok, let's talk story. I needed to brace myself because this is just a mess. And it saddens me because I always try to root for anime originals. I wanted this to be indie, and grungy and tell a interesting story. I do feel it was trying to do all those things. It didn't succeed. The storytelling is so garbled that the viewer is left honestly confused for most of the runtime and this confusion is not the good ""oooh I wonder if I'm going to get my questions answered"" type of confusion, it's the ""I honestly have no questions because I don't know what the f**k is going on!"" type of confusion. One of many problems with this type of confusion (and the most prevalent in this anime) is that if the viewer is not really understanding what is happening and what is the stakes... then climaxes fail to impact, emotional moments have no payoff, and the story as a whole suffers.  The last episode is especially egregious. Without spoiling for anyone that still wants to see this dumpster fire, it manages to simultaneously have too little time and too much time! Yes that's right, the conflict gets resolved so fast and so easily you might blink and miss it, but you get like three different ending none of which feel like you needed or wanted. Also, anything that might have had a lasting impact gets rolled back so nothing mattered in the first place.  I'm not going to touch on music because it's honestly a shtick. It's not worth talking about.";Not Recommended
8;Listeners;Andre_Alexander;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Andre_Alexander;3;"Spoiler free article: A short description that's just a bit longer than normal synopsis to give you rough idea what to expect from this anime. Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.  Reading time: 3 minutes read  Review: Facepalm. This is what I got from this anime multiple times, at first I'm intrigued with the promising premises, but after watching 2-3 episodes, I facepalmed, for the first time, because somehow, they successfully turned the interesting premise to some generic story, they didn't expand the amazing worlds, I don't know why they didn't tapped into this potential, but I still didn't gave up hope, I kept watching, to be facepalmed again, this time with a chair...This anime didn't improve, it regress, they introduced a problems, that everyone who have watched a couple anime already know not only how will it ends, but also how they get to that ends, so it's predictable, but it should be somewhat interesting right? Nope, because along the way the also succeeded in introducing unrealistic plot holes, and they thing I dread the most, the blatant usage of plot armor. I mean, at least, if you want to use plot armor, make up some reason to back it up, even though it's unrealistic, but this anime is too lazy for it, that they didn't even give any reason to the viewers. They paced it weirdly too, they time skipped on the moment you least expected, the back and forth are also confusing.  The visuals albeit have a few charming points, it have an even more flaws. The world building are interesting, that I must admit, along with the interesting character designs, it's not a really outstanding one, but it's definitely not a generic looking characters. But that's it, that's all I can praise in this department, the other are way below average compared to other anime. First of all, I didn't dread the usage of CGI, especially in action genre like this, but use it only if you've mastered the technology, this one clearly haven't and showed that they used this just to save budget by applying it on literally (almost) everything. The weird things is that, despite the heavy usage of CG technology, the anime still fall in the choppy anime category, why the animation aren't smooth for most of the casees? I don't know either... Also one of the goal of using CGI is that to save time, so that animator didn't need to draw a highly detailed item many times, but only one time, so I expected a highly detailed model, but no, not even the models are highly detailed, the building, the robots, the environments, nothing... Not to mention the battles, is that even a battles? It's more like a staring contest with minimum movements...  The theme songs are okay, they're not bad, but it's just too underwhelming for an anime with musical theme to have this ""bland"" OSTs, that even get overshadowed with a couple of the featured songs in between. The surprising part is the seiyuu, looking at the cast, it should be a great one, but it isn't... they're just like a beginner who don't know the rope, because no matter what the scenes are, they have a relatively same tones, there isn't any sense of grievance, fear, and so on when there should've been one. The sound effects also a big no no, it might be fine if it's something from the 80s or 90s, but definitely not in 2020. Overall I think they just throw money to the biggest seiyuu they can get and skimped on everything else, heck even those seiyuu turned to be underutilized due to the lack of direction here, a perfect example that you can't just throw money to solve everything.  Conclusion: Reasons to watch: -You're looking for some rock songs to add to your playlist...  Reasons NOT to watch: -A bland story with an even worse execution -Usage of immature CGI all over the place that didn't improve the animation quality one bit -A very underwhelming theme songs for an anime based around music";Not Recommended
9;Listeners;BiobulletM;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BiobulletM;5;".::The premise::. The set up is actually pretty neat. A world under the threat of some monsters called earless fought back by some famous dudes called players based on actual musicians fighting on their mechas which are actually their amps. Episode 1 starts with the Echo finding a mysterious girl (Myuu or µ) which is an unknown player and also she doesn't have any memory. Now Echo has to travel the world trying to know who she really else all while they meet up with other players.  Sadly, it just doesn't deliver what you might expect as the music undertone is severely missing almost in every aspect.  .::Characters::. Echo is most of time an interesting character and Myuu is pretty likable girl; their development as a couple is heavily hinted from the start and their dynamic feels great in episode 1 and 2... but then every episode insist in splits them in different ways, to the point where they spent entire episodes on their own. In the end, you feel like you didn't spend enough time with them (together) to be impactful for the obvious climax Players just share some little homage to their counterparts in their name or design. Most of their designs are pretty unique, but most of them are just bland in personality or just appear as part of the next stepping stone in pointing the MC into the right direction. Jimi which is main figure in the series is the one who suffers the most from this by not living to be the legend the series makes him to be.  .::Sound::. The soundtrack is just OK which is sad for a music based series, there seems to be a main music theme for the series but it's very underused. The neat part is that every ending video has a new song with an unique video featuring scenes from the same episode in a net way. I saw every ending, but not a single song stuck with me or felt particularly good aside from the opening song and video which is great.  .::Story::. The story is pretty linear and most episodes have a self-concluding sub-arcs, but only some arcs rise above average. Since the world building is pretty bad, is hard to care, and most of things resolve by shouting harder, by having random stuff happen or just cause. In a nutshell, the story doesn't feel like it has something to tell, nor it makes use of the music thematic.  .::Animation::. Most of time is above average, the opening and endings animations are a banger, the CG is ok.  .::CONCLUSION::. Episodes 1 - 8 were pretty serviceable for me, it entertained just enough to keep watching, but episodes 9 to 12 it takes a nosedive with nonsense, focusing on less interesting characters and by doing random BS to keep the story going, making me reflect on why did I even spent time watching this.  It might not be awful, but it'ss not a good mecha series, it's not a good music anime, it's doesn't feel like good shonen material and doesn't deliver a compelling couple dynamic.";Not Recommended

A difference with this title is the fact that it managed to keep my interest during all 3 parts. It turns out to be a rather good drama and has a decent story to it. I would suggest that you watch it with the original Japanese audio and the English subs. The English voices I found to be annoying, just like most other H.

2;Lingeries;KimiNoNameWa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KimiNoNameWa;10;Ok, I would say it clearly now if you still haven't watch this Hanime or you still wonder whether this Hanime worth to watch or not, THEN YOU SHOULD GO AND WATCH NOW!! To be honest, I watched a lot of hentai anime before but never tought such a wonderful Hanime even exist. This series so underrated and the main reason that cause this series not popular should probably be one word 'OLD'. Yup, this Hanime is really 'old' and it was actually released in Year 2003. Most of the time, the viewer(just like me) might think the older the Hanime it is, the lower the quality of the animation BUT this statement really can't apply to this Hanime series. Although this Hanime is really old but the quality of this series is still one of the best and it might even better than the current Hanime. Let's start with few main essential aspects which actually make this Hanime to be MASTERPIECE:  1. The animation & artworks aspects - My first thing to look into Hanime will be always go to the animation and artworks. Animation and artworks are the BASICs especially come to Hentai anime, they are the primary core that you can't ignore. Lower quality of animation as well as artworks will really make your mood or enjoyment feel down and left unsatisfied(Just think back what is your main purpose when you watch Hentai, isn't that you watch it for your enjoyment and want to release something😏 ya I mean release STRESS). Hence, I will rate each Hentai series mostly and mainly based on their animation & artworks QUALITY LEVEL. Ok, now some of you might wonder why you just ignore the story plotting, isn't the story plotting also important? Now, I must mention it clearly that I'm not thinking that story plotting is not important, the story plotting itelf also significant BUT not as significantly as the animation and artworks themselves when it's come to Hentai anime, the stoty plotting will always be my second review in Hanime and I will talk about that in the 'story plotting aspect' part. Now, back to this Hanime series, the animation of this series itself is really one of the best in my top tier Hanimation list(my other fav Hanimation would mostly from the Bunny walker, T-Rex as well as MS Picture studios). The animation itself was so unique, smooth and rhythmical, it's highly follow the flow of story plotting and BGM as well as each characters' erotic development. I'm sure you would come to know what I said when you watch and experience this entire series yourself. Next, about artworks stuff, the artworks looks more into late 90s artworks quality. What I mean here is the artworks not really look that old, the quality of artworks it's something similar like Bible Black first season Hanime series. And yup one of the most important thing for this series artworks is the UNCENSORED PARTS. The uncensored parts of this series is really well drawn and this also my main reason to rate this hentai anime to MASTERPIECE. I'm not gonna lie about the uncensored parts, the uncensored parts is really attracted my view and I'm really like it😘 As you all know there are many hentai anime really have a high quality level in animation BUT gross in uncensored parts drawing😥(mainly because they thought they can use pixelation to hide it) But this Hanime series is totally another level, they really make everything looks perfect including this uncensored parts, it's really looking so damn nice and real😎  2. The story plotting aspect - Without any spoilers, I would like to say the story plotting of this Hanime series is pretty INTERESTING, SIMPLE & DIRECT as well as some unexpected TWISTING plotting BUT most importantly the ENDING IS HAPPY. To be concluded, it's about the story based Hanime and it's also pretty 'LOGIC'. Now here's the interesting point related to story plotting of hentai(Hanime/Hmanga), most of the time, I noticed the comments or reviews from those Hentai sections are mainly about how the story plotting of Hanime/Hmanga is 'MAKE NO SENSE' or to be said 'NO LOGIC'. Ok, I mean they are actually saying something right YET not completely right. So what I mean here is 'LOGIC' of story. Many viewers like to use their strictly & serious common sense when it's come to hentai, yup this is absolutely right, they did nothing wrong BUT I think they miss the most important concept of Hentai that is 'Enjoyment'. The concept of Hentai itself is just something like when you watching AV or Porn, it's mainly made or target for audience's enjoyment. Just one simple question, did you even consider the story plotting of AV or Porn when you watch them? No right, isn't it? Most of the AV or Porn also not focus too much on story, same here when it's come to Hentai. This is why I'm always reviewing the animation first then only I review to the story plotting when it's come to Hentai. To me in hentai perspective: NO QUALITY NO TALK!! The quality I mentioned here is of course the animation and artworks, and I also make my own discussion on that in the previous section there. Ok let's get back to story plotting aspects of Hentai, just like I said before, hentai is mainly made for 'Enjoyment' for each audience's fetish and this why 'TAGS' existed in hentai(not only in hentai, it also existed in AV as well as Porn). The tags can easily let the audience to choose what they want to see(exp: Vanilla, MILF, Harem and etc). Through the tags, you can immediately know or expect what is the outcome of the particular hentai about, for example, in vanilla tag, you can always expect the story plotting is something good, very basic with nothing special happen and it is basically the SAFE tag. So, in my point of perspective, TAGS itself can be divided into two main groups which are 'ACCEPTABLE' and 'UNACCEPTABLE'. What I mean for 'ACCEPTABLE' TAGS is something that most probably can be accepted or liked by majority and in the other hand, 'UNACCEPTABLE' TAGS is clearly meaning that something that majority can't be accepted or hate as well as rejected by majority. For example, the tags such as R, UB, Cheating, NTR, Interracial are the tags that commonly rejected by the viewer and it's also aka 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags. Most of the hentai viewer will first come into mind to think that ALL 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags = Nonsense/Non logic tags BUT here I want to make the clear clarification that NOT ALL 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags = Nonsense/Non logic tags. What I mean here is some of the 'UNACCEPTABLE' related tags might be non logic BUT this DOES NOT MEAN ALL 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags are nonsense. In my opinion, most of the 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags are seem to be 'REALISTICS' & it might/actually happen in our real life. I'm making such statement not because I like those creepy 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags but in the other hand I'm actually same like most of you who really hate those disgusting tags. I admit that I really hate those disgusting tags before and I actually stop reading/watching hentai for a long time because of this disgusting tags. But then, maybe because of my age progression, I'm started to think more objectively and GRADUALLY ACCEPT those disgusting tags. I accept those tags not mean that I agree those negative values/actions of such tags. I'm actually still hate those disgusting tags but I know those disgusting tags are now happening anytime/anywhere in real life and I can't just deny/ignore those 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags just because I hate those tags and now what come in to mind is that the 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags are really DISGUSTING BUT REALISTICS. Thus, this is the reason why I said now I'm prone to/ more accepting to those 'UNACCEPTABLE' tags.;Recommended
0;Lingerie Senshi Papillon Rose;KanakoMimura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KanakoMimura;7;"First time reviewer, please be gentle. Cannot believe it's for something like this, but...Oh well.  Despite what others may say, I genuinely liked Papillon Rose. It's a tough pill to swallow if you don't know what exactly you're going into, but as a big fan of the magical girl genre I was ultimately pretty glad that I sat down and spent 25 minutes out of my life on this OVA.  I'll be blunt: Lingerie Senshi Papillon Rose is...well, bad. However, its terribleness is intentional. It is a walking parody meant to be making fun of itself and the rest of the magical girl genre with every word. Do not expect a creative or imaginative story, cast, or anything - Papillon Rose draws upon Sailor Moon and Cutey Honey and regurgitates both (with a wide array of crude humor added into the mix) for a cheap laugh.  As I said above, nothing at all in this is unique or original - it isn't intended to be. The opening and ending songs are pretty and the art is rather nice to look at. The plot itself and the characters are ripped right from other magical girl anime, just...lewder. The real draw on this OVA is not the music, art, or story - it is the humor and the ""take that"" attitude towards other anime of the same genre.  My final verdict: If you're looking for something hilariously bad and full of ecchi-esque humor and lewdness, give Papillon Rose a watch. Just don't go into this taking it seriously or expecting the next big thing (or a full blown hentai) - you'll be disappointed.";Recommended

If you are disappointed I'd love to hear why!  Art is good, story is to die for! It's a wonderful comedy ~ not a very good Hentai though!

I cannot for the life of me decide whether it was the best, worst thing I've ever seen, or the worst, best thing.  If I had to describe this using words, I would call it ""Butt Attack Punisher Girl meets Sailor Moon parody with a touch of hentai""  If I actually had to describe it, it would be ""wuhhh uhhh huh? what? aeeehhhehhh the FUDGE?! Σ(O_O；) uhhhhhhhhh   Case for ""Worst, Best Thing I've Ever Seen"": Rating: 1 penis shaped whip out of 10  I love magical girl parody anime. There's actually enough of these out there now for it to be basically an entire genre of its own, with classics like Excel Saga, and some lesser known ones like the aforementioned Butt Attack Punisher Girl, or Punie. They work because it's funny. Everyone likes watching ruined, gross, vulgar, or perverted versions of shows they liked as kids- it's a proven fact, what with all these abridged series going around nowadays.  It's just good fun to turn something that you've grown out of (sometimes) into a newly relevant and entertaining thing.  I didn't watch Sailor Moon... but somehow I don't think this was the case. I don't know that Sailor Moon fans >ever> needed to see a sex crazed replacement for their heroine fight against a BDSM lady and her leather clad cat army with a large vibrator.  At the same time, the WTF factor is strong with this one. Flaming breast milk? Boob bombs? a whip that attaches to penises and sucks the life out of the guy? Yeah, I saw some new things in this one, myself.   Case for ""Best Worst Thing I've Ever Seen"": Rating: 10 pairs of exploding boob bombs  Like I said above, when magical girl parodies are good, they're great. If a sleazy knockoff of a much beloved chinese cartoon with some nudity and a LOT of everything sex related appeals to you, this is riotous. If not, then it's kinda gross, like a 12 year old's edgy wet dream version of Sailor Moon. A girl who works at a strip club bangs a dude with magical semen and then gets the power to transform into an even more scantily clad heroine to fight some sex reference villains. I didn't think it was possible to make it sound even more stupid. I amaze myself sometimes.  I'm honestly surprised that studio Arms didn't make this. It looks just like their flavor of edgy hentai action schlock made for kids that think boobs and sex toys are the height of comedy.   With all that said, I'm just going to give this a 5. It's both terrible AND amazing-ly weird. If I find myself saying ""WTF"" more than three times in the span of 20 minutes, I think it's got something going here. Whatever that is, though, I don't really know.";Mixed Feelings
1;Lingerie Senshi Papillon Rose;Kalendraf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kalendraf;5;"This is a review of the DVD version of the “Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose” OVA (Lingerie Senshi Papillon Rose) released by Maiden Japan in 2010. It was viewed with English subtitles. Note that the same DVD also includes the 6 episodes from the TV Series “Papillon Rose”. I will provide a separate review for those. This review is just for the single episode OVA.  ""Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose"" is a comedic parody of magical girl series such as “Sailor Moon” and “Cutie Honey” with more ecchi content. The show includes some sci-fi and magic elements.  Parental Advisory: The age rating on the DVD packaging is listed as MA (so 17 and up). The show includes some scenes with female topless nudity. There is an implied sex scene, but the characters are covered by a large bed sheet. Other scenes include some very suggestive adult-oriented behavior. The outfit worn by the main character is very skimpy. There is some profanity. Some combat situations occur, but they are mostly cartoon-style violence where no real harm seems to occur to anyone involved.  Brief history of Papillon Rose: When watching or reviewing this title, it is important realize that the idea for “Papillon Rose” originated as a joke on a website. Growing fan interest in the title eventually led to the creation of the OVA in 2003, and then a TV series in 2006. There are no official novels or manga. A set of PVC figures were released by Milestone in 2007. The two versions correspond to the OVA and TV series  Story: 3/10 There is only 1 episode of the OVA and it’s only about 25 minutes long. The main character, Tsubomi is introduced along with her friend Anne, both of whom work at a Lingerie Club. Their age is not revealed, but it appears they are probably in their late teens. The manager of the club is shown briefly, and the girls’ interactions with him show that they have the upper hand. Tsubomi and Anne threaten him jokingly, and he seems to have little option but to accept their requests.  A mysterious figure, known only as “Dandy Lion”, encounters Tsubomi, and it is revealed that he has a special power to awaken the powers of the lingerie fighters…through sex. This seems like a setup for a hentai title, but the OVA refrains from showing much of their sexual encounter.  The show also introduces a set of enemies, including a female ruler, her 4 generals and some lackeys that cater to her every whim. One of the generals is sent to harvest human lifeforces, and she begins her attack near the club. Her orally powered, crotch-attacking weapon has obvious sexual connotations. Meanwhile, a talking cat named Rama finds Tsubomi, and after confirming her power by scent, he helps her activate her power to turn into Papillon Rose. The transformation scene is a parody of magical girl transformations. She even says “Cutie Honey” first before using the correct phrase. In combat, she ends up using a weapon that is basically a huge vibrator. Papillon Rose struggles in combat before Dandy Lion comes to the rescue.  Most of the ecchi content is intended for laughs, but much of it seems overly juvenile. The show ends rather abruptly before Dandy Lion has encountered any of the other lingerie fighters. The OVA seems like it was intended as the first of several episodes that would later feature the other generals before a final showdown with their leader. Unfortunately, that content doesn’t appear to have ever been completed. The 6 episodes from the TV series occur later with only a short attempt at bridging the gap in between.  Characters: 4/10 The relatively short duration leaves little time to explore characters. Most of the focus is on Tsubomi / Papillon Rose. Anne has very little screen time, though it is likely she would have been given more focus in subsequent OVA episodes if they had been produced. Both seem like very likable young women. Unfortunately, we don’t learn any background for either of them, their reasons for working at the club or their motivations.  Similarly, very little information is provided for Dandy Lion or Rama, other than the fact they are very close. The enemies seem paper thin with no reasons provided for their actions.  Art / Animation: 6/10 Considering that this title was produced in 2003, the art and animation looks even more dated than that, and seems to be more like styles from the mid-90s. Some of the sequences with Tsubomi / Papillon Rose such as her transformation scene or some with the rose motif seem better. Overall, the art isn’t bad, but it could have been much better.  Sound / Voice: 6/10 The intro song is ok. There is no option for English voice over, so I can’t rate that, or the Japanese voice acting. The remaining background music and sound effects were fine.  Enjoyment: 6/10 Overall, I find the OVA mildly entertaining yet disappointing. I would have liked to have seen further episodes of the OVA that introduced the other Lingerie fighters and to help explain things more. The juvenile humor is weak, but the crazy setup almost seems to work in a few spots.  Final verdict: 5/10 I re-watched it for this review, and I ended up lowering my original score by 1 (was 6, now 5). The art and animation seems even worse by today’s standards, and the limited story and short duration end up hurting the show significantly. If you want to see an ecchi parody of the magical girl style, it might be worth checking out, but other shows like “Shin Cutie Honey” OVAs do that better.";Mixed Feelings

The story is horrible, supposed to be ecchi but it's almost a very bad, and cheap, hentai.

The animation was rough on the movements of the characters, and the character designs didn't make sense. I excepted that a little more money should have been spend on a OVA.

2;Lingerie Senshi Papillon Rose;Semiotec1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Semiotec1;3;So this is a softcore porn parody of Sailor Moon. If you're expecting high art I suggest you look elsewhere. That said, its a complete laugh riot. Its one of those things that is so strange that you don't want to watch it, but you also don't want to look away.  We have an analogue of sailor moon who also works at a club, oh and she's still in highschool. She also randomly hooks up with tuxedo mask halfway through. Nothing explicit(thank god) but they for sure have sex. WARNING: IF YOU WATCHED SAILOR MOON DURING YOUR CHILDHOOD THEN AVOID THIS ANIME. It will ruin a part of your childhood.  If you find the thought of a a cat giving tuxedo mask a blowjob hilarious then I suggest you watch this, you'll likely find it as funny as I did.

This was borderline hentai (I think the writers couldn't decide between keeping it as an ecchi or a hentai, and didn't want to make too many H scenes, so it was really either a very erotic ecchi or a very mild hentai). Literally, the only reason why I watched this is because I LOVE Koyasu and I'm going through all his anime.

0;Ling Yu;mohammedpatla;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mohammedpatla;10;So my Review is overrated 10/10 . I will mention some flaws but i have taken it out of the scores. My genuine score is a 7.5/10.  This is like a gem of an anime hiding here . I don't really do anime reviews but since this one lacks it i am gonna write a brief review for new comers to know if this worth a watch.  Just to begin with this is a anime about cultivation yes and romance although i am not sure if they will make it harem or just leave it at multiple love interest. i hope its the latter. The light novel was a full on Harem with multiple marriages (not a fan of this genre personally).  It does skip a lot from the web novel but i think thats really good , cause the novel is just to long to make an anime off with every detail. This comes from a person who has completely finished reading the light novel so you will have to trust me on that. To point out the novels story begins from even a different point of time and the anime begins from somewhere entirely different. Novel Spoiler**** And according to novel Qin Lie and Ling Yu Shi are married at the beginning but separated. Spoiler End***  The things i like include that i like the the modified story (at least into 3rd season). I really like the music and sounds. Chinese voice are not bad and effort has been put into it.  I think the most it lacks is length of an episode is to short to begin with out 15 min(length of the ep is like 10 min). It makes sense because longer animations take far too much money and time to make.  A lot of people complained that the story is to hard to follow if you dont know the web novel. Its hard for me to write from that prospective but i feel the authors are trying to build the world. And actually am glad they have not really build the world just yet , as the web novel consist of a lot of worlds and they can only pick one of the worlds and make an anime out of it. Which perhaps is leading to a flaw of plot holes.  I love the fact that they make the story fast and a lot of action is included with that romance obv. I hope they do go just as equally fast that they did this whole season.  Yes i dont mind that the side characters dont get any character development but that is obv a downpoint  This should honestly be far higher rated despite its lack of a lot of elements and plot holes.  Story :- 8/10 Animation : 9/10 Sound 10/10 Character development : 7/10 Overall 7.5  But i am still giving it a 10 :P;Recommended

1;Ling Yu;ngoomie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ngoomie;3;Before I go onto the actual review, I'd like to quickly mention that this is probably not something that you should be watching if you have photosensitive epilepsy. There's lots of instances of high-speed flashing visual effects in this anime that I found extremely irritating, with the worst instance being in the intro where there is red and white flashing.  Ling Yu's story is very hard to follow as it doesn't give much of any background as to what's happening, to the point where it almost feels you're watching the 2nd season of this show while skipping the first. Everything also moves way too fast (likely due to the episodes being so short) and this also makes things more confusing. This show really felt like it could've used one or two extra episodes to set everything up.  There also doesn't feel like there's much if any character development, again probably the fault of the short episode length and total episode count. Maybe the only character who I'd say changes at all over the duration of the show is Tang Siqi, but even then she barely changes at all.  Then there's the visual effects, which I've already talked about at the very start of this review. The lightning in the show flashes in a way that frankly sometimes hurts to look at. Instead of doing something that could be tolerable, like having the lightning be full opacity one frame and then slightly transparent the next or something similar to that, you have brightly coloured lightning that's at full opacity one frame, and gone the next.  All in all, Ling Yu was frankly kind of disappointing. I was originally excited to watch this because the synopsis made it sound interesting, but I mostly just found it boring and confusing.;Not Recommended
2;Ling Yu;nomanali;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nomanali;6;What a disappointment! I was expecting a lot more from this anime. I mean, MC has an OP power hidden within him, but his character is horrible.  There was no growth with the passage of time, just chance encounters, which his grandfather left him. He always gets beat up due to his rashness and not taking into account the opponent's level. There was not a single fight where he could outwit or overpower his enemy.  I mean, what's his role as an MC with OP powers?  His sealed self is a hell of a better character, fitting for the image of an MC. Truly OP. But I am watching season 4 now, and it's still sealed.  What a waste of time, hoping for MC to develop into an OP character, but he is just a piece of shit, a true fool, and naïve crap.  It's a lack of judgment from the author's end as well, where doesn't know the direction, in which his MC should be developed.;Not Recommended

I dropped season 1 of this series after watching the first episode (which wasn't great), and ended up taking it up again out of boredom. While the first season got better and was actually pretty good in the end, season 2 just completely exceeded my expectations. If you like drama and supernatural genres in your bl, chances are you will enjoy this show. The plot is unique, the characters have good chemistry with each other, and the story actually goes somewhere. It is full of juicy drama and written well.  People complain that the story moves slowly, and this is because proper time was allotted for character backstory, which was a major part of this season. That being said, the pacing feels just right throughout the show.  This series may not be the most amazing bl you will ever see, nor is it without flaw, but it's pretty dang good, and especially considering constraints involved in making it, since China has strict laws against homosexual depiction within productions.  This series sits very well with me for many reasons. They took good care in making it, and it shows. I highly recommend for shounen-ai consumers!;Recommended
1;Ling Qi 2;hellenicbitch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hellenicbitch;7;A BL with actual plot and fantasy! This season was way better than the first and there was actually an arc. I just wish they had more character development for Jing hua/ You Keika however we got to find out about Duanmu Xi/ Tanmoku Ki and that was quiteeee good. I wish there was a season 3 however doesn't seem like it. Overall I quite enjoyed it though it has some shortcomings!  So pros: - their relationship - exploration of Duanmu Xi's character - the overall pacing was much better except for the flashbacks  Also I would recommend chinese dub over the japanese because Jing Hua's character is so much better in the chinese dub and of course we get the meaning that the creators wanted to convey.  Cons - I really thought that if the soundtrack was used better then it would add more tension and gravitas to a situation but they played a lot of melodramatic background music which definitely killed the vibe for me - not enough Jing Hua focus later on. Disappointing because it was hinted that we would find out more about him but !;Recommended
2;Ling Qi 2;chi4you;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chi4you;9;"What an IMPROVEMENT from season 1. It was almost like a completely different series. We still have the comedy, but now with longer episodes to truly flesh out the ideas and execution of the story. It's kind of danmei/BL, but I don't think that's really the important part.  STORY - 9/10 - Hello? The plot came back and said it's flashback time. We have some cute moments between Jinghua and Duanmu Xi, but the focus is mainly surrounding Duanmu Xi's character and his past. And boy, is it traumatizing. I asked for fluff, not angst like this. Why did they do this to me? I want off on this roller coaster ride right now. Regardless, I was glued to my seat and further blown away as the drama unraveled every new episode. Real talk though, when are we gonna circle back to LuoYue? Can we please get a season 3 even though it will be censored like no tomorrow? Please come back to the negotiation table, donghua team and Pingzi!  SOUND - 8/10 - Ehhhhhhhh the Chinese OP is nice. I never skip it. It fits the vibe of the story. Sad. Angst. Longing. The visuals are also very beautiful underwater. Most of the show soundtracks are the same as last season. Battle theme 2 is always a bop given how the rapping makes it so lit. I don't really have an opinion on the JP opening though.  CHARACTER - 9/10 - Jinghua has a minor role this season. That's ok. I still enjoy the development between him and Duanmu Xi as they get closer together. Their intentions towards each other is very pure and heartwarming. You can feel the genuine concern that they have for each other and I breathe every single one of those heartfelt moments. It is selfless. It is not asking for anything of the other in return. It is just wanting to make the other person happy. I think that's what really resonates with me, because that is what love is, whether platonic or romantic. Their relationship is always joked about as a married couple, but the subtext is overtly there. Also pretty sure the author can't straight up state it officially given the censorship issues in CN right now.  Zhangxuan also grew on me as a character as well. He appears in Duanmu Xi's life as a mentor, a meaningful force that developed Xi into the person that he is today. I found his motivation and story to be an intriguing part of the season. He was not ""competing"" for screentime with Jinghua, but rather, he had an important role throughout the season that enriched every thing else coming down the pipeline.  ENJOYMENT - 9/10 - This did me in. I'm ready for more angst. I can no longer get off this ride. I am reading the manhua now. The English version only has 160 / 500+ chapters translated. Oh boy.  OVERALL - 9/10 - If you've already made it through the hot mess that is Season 1, you might as well start Season 2. It is SO much better.";Recommended
3;Ling Qi 2;Ismata-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ismata-chan;9;This show really exceeded my expectations! With beautiful animation and entrancing opening music (I really like the Chinese one), I knew I was in for a good time, but wow! It really built off the previous season and took it over the moon!  The plot built up more naturally than the previous season. Not as fast paced and really focused on the characters in a way that I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. The characters also felt more developed and flushed out than they were before. I found myself caring about characters I didn't really have an opinion on in the first season and started caring more about the leads than I did before. Speaking of the leads, their relationship is built up nicely over the season and didn't feel forced. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoilers, but I really like how they grow together!  The only qualm I have is that some sections are flashback heavy. Though it's done tastefully, it goes on for a bit and I found myself skipping forward at parts. Additionally, there's a bit of a cliffhanger at the end that had me really disappointed when I found that the plans for a following season was canceled. I hope it gets picked up again because I want to see if Duanmu Xi (Tanmoku Ki) can complete his goal.  Though I prefer the Chinese dub with how the voices fit the characters better in my opinion, the Japanese dub is still good and it doesn't shy away from as many scenes as the Chinese dub does. I'd try both, but if you're looking for the more BL scenes, go with the Japanese dub.  Again, this was a really good show! I'd highly encourage giving it a watch!;Recommended

I am so sad about the fact there won't be a third season. As amazing as this show was, the cliffhanger is the worst!! I suggest you don't watch the post-credits scene of the last episode of this season; if you don't do that, you will be super happy. Just skip the post-credits!  Otherwise, the cliffhanger will hurt your soul.  Seriously, this second season is even better than the first season which is rare in anime! The characters are just as amazing and the BL is swoon-worthy!!!";Recommended

6;Ling Qi 2;lucland2020;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lucland2020;10;I have to disagree with many of the other reviewers of this work. First, it is a complete misnomer to label this as shouen-ai. The male characters are under 18. This is a stupid reason to dismiss this anime. So, that label is false. Secondly, for me this work is all 10's. The story is quite good - derivative, I suppose, but show me any anime, any show, any story that can't be traced to some source. Derivative? That is not enough to dismiss Spirit Pact. Further, where are your examples people?  The characterization is quite rich. We are shown the ties that can influence and sometimes bind us. Spirit Pact is very relatable. We go about doing what we must and others have ulterior motives to further themselves.  The philosophical perspective is worth watching the show again and again. The music is catchy and soothing. The art is beautiful. Great Show. Top of the list. 10's, 10's, 10s;Recommended
0;Ling Qi 2;kurosmile;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kurosmile;6;Plot: 6/10  There's a bit improvement from the first season plot. I can see the goal in the second season. It's not face paced unlike the first season, which is good. Plus point for that. It's a solid plot but is it extraordinary, definitely not. I especially do not like the few last episodes because I feel like it drags the story.  Characters: 6/10  I still have problems with the characters. I couldn't love the characters back in season one and I still couldn't love them till now. If I still have to choose a significant character in this anime, for season one I would choose Ki in a heartbeat but for season two, it will definitely go to Jiun, the minor character.  You Keika- still the same as ever though a bit stronger than the previous season.  Ki- Definitely the problematic character in this season. First of all, his character in the past is definitely out of character. If I correctly recall, when we dived into Ki's fiance's past in the first season, we could definitely see a cold Ki when he was a child. However, in this season, suddenly Ki is portrayed as someone extremely kind and carefree back when he was still a child. Somehow I felt uncomfortable watching how his character is drastically changed. Not a fan of that so a huge minus point for Ki. Plus, he is supposed to be the most powerful Youmenshi in the world but in season 2, he seems weak. And please, can someone count how many times Ki coughs out blood for me throughout the episodes?  Shouken- He gives me the same vibe as Suzaku from Hangyaku no Lelouch and I don't like this either.   Comments: There's definitely something wrong with the tomanku family. It's clearly wrong for what they did to Shouken. Binding his soul and used him as a blood bank for Ki are definitely inhumane acts yet this family did not pay the price for their wrong doings which bothers me a lot.  Overall: 6/10  This anime has a solid plot, a good foundation yet missing the important pieces which halts it from being one of the best anime. The fighting scenes aren't that great, the mystery is predictable, the struggles Ki and Keika have to go through is too long which makes the audience (me) bored halfway throughout the story.  And please, Shouken, for the love of God and for the sake's of Keika and Ki's happiness, please do not return to the world.;Mixed Feelings
1;Ling Qi 2;harapeko1179;https://myanimelist.net/profile/harapeko1179;6;it's good but.... i'm a bit disappointed. First of all, half of the episodes are just flashbacks. i get that it's important to the story but from what i see on the season 1 flashbacks, none of these flashbacks look like they're connected. on season 1, it looked like tanmoku ki's personality was already like this and didn't care about anything. For the story itself, is quite difficult to watch. I myself even started to doubt who was actually the main couple. There are also unanswered questions like how his hair turned white or what happened to the ancestor and why they aren't metioned at all in the new season but even so, it's quite interesting to watch how things will go in the new season. it's still a good watch (except the end... that cliffhanger is gonna haunt me). Feel free to watch it if you want, but i actually kind of regret watching it so.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ling Qi 2;Ironoverloaded;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ironoverloaded;4;"""Master, a relationship with a person is like a kite. It won't fly high if you hold it too tightly. Loosen your grip too much and it falls, and when you pull strongly on a kite flying high in the sky, the string will snap and it will never come back.""  I wish I could like this anime. I wish I could write nothing but good things about it, especially since it seems to have a cult following with fans. But I can't.  I'll start with the most glaring issue - This doesn't feel like Shounen Ai. This feels like queer baiting and people clutching at straws. This was produced in China, which you probably know has a strict censorship law over gay relationships being shown in the media. I believe this show only got away with what it did show because its producers were Tencent - a very well-known Chinese conglomerate. But even they had their limits.  Let me start by saying every kiss in this has a purpose. Much like Mahou Sensei Negima!? and Yamada-kun and the seven witches. Each kiss is an ""exchange of energy"" or forming a contract between the two characters. There is never any mention of love and each kiss has a clear purpose to it.  Which is fine. We're watching Shounen Ai, not smut, right? But that's where it falls apart. The characters are unlikeable and never really develop from their initial introductions in season 1, and therefore their emotions never really develop. They're never shown to love each other beyond this sould connection, and it's never even explained why Ki makes the connection with Keika in the first place. ~Sure~, we're given backstory and how they're fated, but Ki doesn't know this at the time he makes the pact and he never shares this information with Keika.  And sadly, there is no season 3, so we can expect to never know past the webtoon as this anime has been cancelled. If there was a season 3 - I might've spared this anime such a harsh review, but the entire plot was just all over the place. There was no pacing, scenes felt awkward, places that were supposed to make you cry just left me sighing and wishing I could fast forward to the resolutions. I couldn't connect with these characters or their emotions, and the emotions felt by most of them seemed flimsy at best - or had overarching, massive conversations and conflicts between them go unspoken or even straight up forgotten about and ignored.  So I couldn't even go ""at least this is a good anime, even if there's not any real romance."" Because there wasn't any real plot, and any plot was quickly abandoned for the new, shiny plot line they decided was better the next episode. In fact, 5 episodes in the second series were dedicated purely to a flashback between a character introduced 4 episodes into the season within these flashbacks. And the 5 episodes weren't even needed - it was two perspectives of the same events, and by the second run-through, I really didn't care anymore.  I think a portion of this criticism can also be attributed to the Japanese dub. They tried to match the lip animation to what the original Chinese dub said, but Chinese is incredibly fast compared to English and Japanese, and I feel like a lot of what was ~supposed~ to be said was lost in translation and lost it's impact. Instead, scenes flew by unnecessarily fast, littered with sentences and statements that made me go, ""uhh, and?"" where I'm sure they were supposed to shock you and add tension.  I was going to let this all slide, because ""at least the art is good"" but it's very sloppy in some frames and scenes, and for some reason, Keika's eyes are retconned and made purple in the second series instead of yellow. Which really doesn't help when Ki and Shouken also both have purple eyes, so every important character just looked the same in the flashback scenes. I wouldn't have cared if they'd even explained it. But there's zero explanation, and Keika's eyes are purple in flashback scenes, so the fan theory that they ""changed when he got closer to his ancestor's power level"" is redundant because he has them as a child.  I feel like this entire show was trying to do too many things at once, and spread itself too thin as a result. It prolongued the scenes it should've shortened and missed the big picture involving the things it should've prolongued instead.  I can't hate it. It has guys kissing in a CHINESE piece of media. That's nigh impossible to achieve ordinarily and I'm certain Tencent's production was the only reason this was given a second series. It's paving the way for more acceptance in a culture that desperately needs it. And it wasn't a horrific anime. There was semblance of a plot here, and it tried. It just didn't try very hard.";Not Recommended
0;Ling Qi;Kadrian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kadrian;7;This is based on a chinese Manga(Manhwa). It is actually really good(THe manga) but the anime adaptation kind of is not really good because of the voice actors and the weird art and the change in the original plot. this anime can be qualified as Shounen-Ai but it is more on the relationship of a master and his servant though they do have to kiss sometimes for the special skill to work on the servant(Can't say it or I will spoil it). But if you are interested in this, I advise you to read the manga because Chinese manhwa are colored and it is really awesome. (But it is kind of hard to find it, since not much of it has been completely translated.)  But of course, this is a Chinese version of the now Japanese version of Spiritpact. The animation is still the same except the voice actors are Japanese. If you want to give it a try, you should go ahead. The anime did kind of cut out a few important parts of the manhua, especially some parts where they honestly should not have....;Recommended
1;Ling Qi;Enjyu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Enjyu;8;Beware: This is a shounen-ai! And a good one on top of that!  I thought I'd start with that as the genre is not listed on MAL.  As probably most of you have figured out by the name, this is a Chinese animation, the second in my life, but I have to say definitely not the last one!  Overall Ling Qi is a beautifully drawn anime with a deeper story from what you'd expect of 20 short episodes. It engages the viewer straight from episode 1 with its perfectly proportioned combination of sweet humour, action, art, BGM, few parodies of other anime and unexpected development.  While the story left many things unexplained(which probably the manga will explain), this did not really ruin the pleasure of watching Ling Qi, I did not feel it left me hanging and questioning plot-holes or scratching the back of my head wondering what it tried to convey.  The Chinese setting/language was a very refreshing break from the good ol' Japanese anime and the characters' behaviour or way of speaking is something I enjoyed immensely as it (especially the voices) felt much less forced than most Japanese animes. I do pay a lot of attention to voice actors, way of talking etc and I can't hide how much I hate forced voices like in many animes (no normal Japanese person talks like that) and speech in Ling Qi did not strike me as forced or overreacting (I did live with and communicate with a group of Chinese for a whole year)  Overall, 8 from me, very pleasant animation, beautiful artwork, nice BGM, engaging story, and most of all a Chinese shounen-ai.;Recommended
2;Ling Qi;ShadowJackal35;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShadowJackal35;7;"Because I'm Chinese-American, I've always had a connection to Chinese culture however, never have I really been interested in the Chinese ""anime."" I started reading Chinese light novels such as Quan Zhi Gao Shou (waiting for the anime this month!) but other than that, not much else. Recently however, I was impressed by Shuangsheng Lingtan and decided that I wanted to see what Chinese anime is like. So, I picked Ling Qi by random (I think it's recommended if you like Shuangsheng Lingtan) and started watching. I was not disappointed at all.  Story (7/10) - Good: The story is not particularly fascinating or unique, however the way the characters are portrayed made it worth following. I liked seeing some of the Chinese traditions and customs to honor the dead/death. There were some points where I felt like I'd missed something though. A character would mention something and events would take a direction that seemed like it came from nowhere even though I'd given it my full attention. Whether this is me just being stupid or the story actually missing pieces is something you can decide for yourself.  Art (8/10) - Very Good: The colors are nice and vibrant and the shading seems more in depth than in most anime. I was impressed by the detail that was put into it and the special effects were great. Every so often though there were some minor problems with continuity; sometimes certain details would be omitted but then reappear later. Overall though the coloring felt more sophisticated than typical anime.  Sound (8/10) - Very Good: Since this is technically the first Chinese anime I've watched (completed) then I don't have much experience with judging Chinese voice acting, but basing it off what I hear in Japanese voice acting then I'd say they're pretty consistent. I didn't hear anything I thought was particularly awful to say in the least. The soundtrack was cool for sure though. If there is one thing that can surpass language and culture barriers, it's music and I really enjoyed Ling Qi's soundtrack.  Character (8/10): Honestly, I liked all the characters and how they were portrayed. There were a lot of silly moments that were just kind of nice to see and it didn't ruin the story or break the pace. It felt natural and seemed fitting for the show. If I could see this same cast in another season, I don't think I'd mind.  Enjoyment (9/10) - Great: For my first completed Chinese anime, I had a lot of fun watching and comparing it to Japanese anime and it's fun to see and compare the cultural differences. I've been trying to branch out into other anime media such as manwha (the Korean webcomics) and manhua (Chinese manga) and I plan on continuing and learning more about Northeastern Asian culture from every point. Even though a lot of it may be romanticized.  Overall (7/10) - Good: Ling Qi isn't the best show I've ever seen and I wouldn't say it particularly stands out from anything I've ever watched but it's still enjoyable. I wouldn't call the series ""deep"" or poignant in any way, but there were moments that were very touching and I recommend watching it for a quick source of fun. Even though I give it an average score (to me- 7=70%/C/Good), I actually do think very highly of it.  As a quick side note though, it is worth knowing that Ling Qi is considered a shounen ai (homosexual romance). There is nothing ""heavy"" or explicit, but it is apparent that the main characters have romantic feelings for each other and is implied and shown in a few ways. I, myself, actually did not find out about this fact until after I'd already started the series. I'm not against shounen ai at all, but it isn't exactly a genre that I pursue or have at the top of my priority list. There's nothing too explicit like in Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi or Junjou Romantica, but if the topic makes you you uncomfortable even in the slightest, then it might not be the show for you. (You're missing out though.)  Bonus: Oh yeah, there is one Attack on Titan (ep 7) reference and one Sailor Moon (16 ep) reference so if you find sightings/references of other shows funny, you'd most likely be amused by it.";Recommended
3;Ling Qi;shadowfireflame;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shadowfireflame;7;This 10-episode shounen-ai anime is the Japanese edit and dub of the Chinese anime Ling Qi (Soul Contract).  In it, a young You Keika is living in poverty as a fortune-teller when he is hit by a bus and killed. In death, he chooses to become contracted to the human demon-hunter Tanmoku Ki as his spirit shadow, a partner to protect Tanmoku and give him strength. Unbeknownst to both of them, they are connected more deeply than they realized. Along with Tanmoku’s ignored fiancée Shin Shiyou, the three team up to uncover the sinister plot going on at Tanmoku’s family home.  The anime packs a lot into its 10 episodes with lots of supernatural hurt/comfort elements and a gentle shounen-ai between You and Tanmoku, with some humor and very pretty art and character designs as well.  While the supernatural elements are a bit stereotypical and aren’t explained well, and the characterizations are a bit one-note, it’s interesting to see the different motivations of the characters, particularly the “evil” ones who are all vying for power behind the scenes and constantly testing Tanmoku and You’s relationship.  Tanmoku is difficult to read as a typical tsundere, but You makes for an appealing lead with his innocence and occasional frustration with his situation. I felt really bad for Tanmoku’s fiancée, Shiyou. Her character is actually fleshed out but it’s still hard to determine her reasons for sticking around when Tanmoku overlooks her constantly. She seems to have more meaningful interactions with You than with her fiancée.  Where the anime really shines, though, is in the evolving relationship and powerplays between Tanmoku and You. The two have great chemistry, the light fan-service moments are fun, and it’s wonderful to see how they slowly get to know one another and how they react to seeing each other in danger. I loved seeing how they were evolving into a team.  Unfortunately, after just 10 episodes it feels like it’s just getting into the good content when it ends. Would love to see more!;Recommended
4;Ling Qi;AkiraShinren;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AkiraShinren;8;This series is all over the place.  My first thought after finishing this Anime was exactly that. Don't guess though, I love this Anime despite all the chaotic flaws it presented me.  Ling Qi began fairly simple: Two interesting characters have an encounter and thus their story begins. One of them dies in an accident and thus becomes the other one's Soul Contract / Partner. These are supposed to aid their contractor in their battles against evil spirits. Up to this point everything seemed fairly okay. However, following 20 Episodes (China dub) (10 on Jap Dub), this anime goes all over the place, really. It jumps from one setup to another and confuses you in it's purpose. From the get go, you might think it's purpose is for the two of them to fight together against evil Spirits.. But that's not really what they do. You might get confused and lost because you don't know where this anime is going, what it is trying to show or tell. It has no absolute and clear aim.  It is confusing, and to my end it was even a bit frustrating and annoying.. But, nonetheless, it's positive traits kept me captivated, so let's get to them.  Their characters are simply charming, both have faults and virtues and their development is actually nice to look at, considering the small amount of time this anime covered. You will find yourself charmed and mesmerized by their strange bond and loyalty. This series is strongly focused on the two maincharacters and their unique... bond. However, any other character merely serves it's purpose to help develop that bond/give backstory or whatever you need to make an anime interesting at all.  The atmosphere is.. fresh. I like the art style, as it is both soft and comfortable to look at, yet typical anime. You have the cool guy, the cute guy. They complement each other and both benefit nicely from this artstyle. It's not unique, not too much, and fitting it's supernatural theme. Although Evil Spirits seem a bit lackluster. The whole appereance of the anime, the whole setting and picture of the anime is underlined an emphasized by fitting soundtracks. They provide another layer of immersion and do their job properly. It's nothing outrageous, but it's neatly done nonetheless.  I recommend watching this anime if you are a fan of shounen ai/yaoi, as you are the most likely to love this anime. Anyone looking for something with good fights or awesome characters will have their fair share... but it's not what makes this anime fun to watch. I did not think this anime was mainly focused on Shounen Ai, but reversely it's most fitting for those who like to watch this genre.  Thank you for reading, have fun watching. :);Recommended
5;Ling Qi;rainhat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rainhat;7;"I am still new to reviews, but I thought I had to do give my take on the show while it is still fresh in my mind, y'know?  The story, is in a sense, a mix of Ao Haru Ride and Tokyo Ghoul; that being, the not-quite lovers trying to open up, and our primary suspect has his fate stolen from him at a young age, eventually accepting the path they now traverse. I enjoyed it. It moved me in a way not many have. I have never felt such bliss from anything this precious, nor been swayed to tears so easily. However, I also was confused as to who was involved with who, and what schemes had been set, for the first eight episodes I mean. The last couple cleared everything up. If queerbaiting is an issue to you, so be it. I like the mystery. All in all, story gets a 7/10.  Okay. I have never seen a Chinese anime before, so the scenery was a nice change of pace. The attention to detail, both in the architecture, and flashbacks, is phenomenal. Each character (excluding Jiun and the Shito lady) each had a unique appearance that set them apart from everyone else on the show. While not every character is wholly original in the looks department, it still helps the anime to be more rounded with the cast, and I 100% would love to cosplay as Huayu Yin/ Kau(the leaf girl) if given the chance! The rain always gives it a nice touch (sorry, biased?) and the props had some time to detail as well. Shading, top notch in most scenes as well. Art gets an 8/10.  Sound sets the tone, and Ling Qi's soundtrack spares no one. Episode 5 in particular was the high for me, what with the soul contract, and episode 6 showing a moment of weakness. Or maybe I am talking about the 10 episode TV show where it patches two episodes into one? Probably that. Action scenes with intense music, touching scenes with more delicate ambiance, and the voice actors almost take the cake. Maybe it's the Japanese dub to blame, but from the tone of voice, I didn't hear such raw emotion that I expected the scene to bring to the table. This was especially apparent in the scenes Ki's fiancee was furious with Keika, as I thought she sounded mildly perturbed, rather than seething with rage at the fact he chose Keika over her. Sound gets a 7/10 from me.  Character... Keika is the one I see the most growth from, but that is understandable considering he can't take his money with him to the afterlife. He starts off as materialistic as a human could be, maybe even more. Over time, he starts to lose the sentiment he once held for such things, and eventually, choosing Ki over all else. I wouldn't say he is completely changed, but I see a new passion inside him he never quite had before. I can relate to Shiyou way better though, but I have my anger under control, I promise. :) While she is definitely jealous of Keika, she learns to care for his safety despite Ki's favoritism towards him. She eventually accepts the anger she is ashamed of, and shows initiative in troubling times. I feel like Ki has more time to grow in the following season, and I might review that too (but no promises). I was unclear of Yinzhe/Intetsu's intentions for the longest time, but in the end, he is just a strict teacher after all. I kind of wish I didn't hate him so much before. I also desire to learn of the others in time. I guess I just was not satisfied. For season 1, I give Character a 6/10.  Now, watching this was the best Sunday afternoon I've had in awhile. It may even rival Gunslinger Girl's enjoyment level (unbeknownst to you as of yet). There was never a dull moment for me. I said before that episode 5 was a high for me, but I feel that episode 9 is to be my favorite. Enjoyment is a 9/10 for me.  The characters are enjoyable, the story is wholesome and somewhat original, the setting was a nice change from the modern school anime, a memorable ending theme, and an enjoyable tale that touched my heart on more than one occasion. Overall, I total my score at a little over 7/10.";Recommended
6;Ling Qi;Stormy_77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stormy_77;7;"This showed up in several ""Best Of"" lists for Donghua and I had already seen a lot of shounen so I though I'd try something in a different vein.  Story 7/10, Character 7/10  Went into this expecting the usual Exorcist bonds a special pet but it turned out to be so much more. Initially I thought it was going to be a friendship tale, but then * the characters started to get to know each other and bicker, always a first sign * ye olde obligatory love triangle springs into being * family politics and rivals show up to complicate things * they got caught in *GASP* Compromising Positions. LITERALLY * there was a magical guy transformation sequence with some flashes of nude body parts! * Swords! Blood! Talismans! Flying! Ghosts!! More blood! * Super Saiyan sequences I could not stop watching and was mentally putting spirit popcorn into my mouth.  Art 6/10.  Sadly this series was let down by the very average at best animation from Haoliners.  Sound and Enjoyment 8/10.  The OP is great, and the ED sounds like some trance spa song for sweet, slow, love making. Why did the ED put me in this mood? I don't know. Listen to it. It's basically music for the above but without using the f word we all know and love.  Overall 7/10  Opposites attract, this turned out to be a delicious scandal guilty pleasure any fan of BL can enjoy. Not for the salacious nature of the content (which is not really in your face) but the fact that there is a true emotional connection between the characters. And some yet to be revealed secrets and mysteries after. It was like the best evening drama with all tropes in full force for the audience to gasp at and enjoy. The scandal, the delicious scandal of it all!! I can't wait for season 2.";Recommended
7;Ling Qi;chi4you;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chi4you;7;"This review is based off the Chinese version, because the Japanese version of the show combines 2 episodes into 1 episode, making it very rushed and cutting scenes out. I tried to watch the JP version, but it doesn't really feel the same as all of the cultural references made in the OG Chinese version. The plot has potential to be good, but the execution of it really fell flat with me. Not sure if it's because each episode was only 15 mins long, but it really deserved more time on screen. Although I suppose that may be an issue with budgeting.  STORY: 6/10 - Could be better execution from the directing side, but again, budgeting issue I guess because season 2 is LOADS better in terms of storytelling and art even though it's the same guy directing the show. Most dialogues and events felt rushed and I got confused with how fast paced it was going.  ART: 7/10 - I love chibis. They're cute, but the art isn't anything that's too consistent with frames missing.  SOUND: 9/10 - THE CHINESE OPENING IS A BANGER SOUNDTRACK. I LOVE IT. I HAVE IT ON REPEAT. IT IS POPPIN. IT IS SO CATCHY. You'll come to understand that it describes Jinghua and Duanmu Xi's relationship quite well. On another note, the ending theme is nice and soothing, also another one of my favourites from this show. Battle theme 2 is also very hype with the rapping in the background.  CHARACTER: 7/10 - Bruh everything was so rushed that it felt forced in the show. Couldn't find an attachment to the characters until ~season 2~, but that's excluded from this review. Jinghua is a bundle of joy and makes so many cultural references. I love his energy. Can't say much for Duanmu Xi though, since he's your typical stoic, mysterious MC (TBC in Season 2 hahaha). The side characters are shallow at most without much screen time, and Qin Siyao is just cast aside as a third wheeler for the majority of the show. With that said, I couldn't feel much of Jinghua and Duanmu Xi's bond. Their motivations are skimmed over real quick. Heck, I have more interest in Luoyue and YangNing's past instead. So. Many. Unanswered. Questions.  ENJOYMENT: 8/10 - Despite all the issues with animation, quality, storytelling, this was honestly so FUNNY. The comedy is great. Random insertion of various languages in Korean, Japanese, English, LOL references, Song Joong Ki, crossovers from other donghua like Fox Spirit Matchmaker, and our favourite quote ""YOU CAN YOU UP. NO BB"". Serious. This gets better. The minor fanservice we get is nice too. Like, literally this series has KISS scenes! It's a donghua too! Absolutely wild to see how loose the censorship laws back then when it came to media. RIP. Maybe that's also why season 3 is bust.  OVERALL: 7/10. I would just watch the show if you enjoy the comedy aspect. I recommend the Chinese version if you can still find it, despite how obscure it is. The drama gets touched upon briefly and continues in season 2. Or if you enjoy BL/Danmei, you may or may not like it. They kinda remind me of Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji with their own twist. Their love for each other is not overtly stated, but they truly do care for one another.";Recommended

After looking this up and was meet with some good reviews but also some really really bad ones that put me off.  You defiantly need to get past the first episode. I didn't hate it but it felt very rushed and I think they gives off a bad feeling to this anime from the start.  However the characters quickly become likeable and I really enjoyed the relationships that were build between the characters. It is a bit cheesy at times but did make me laugh quite a few times.  Although there is a serious story there it also has a lot of lighthearted comedy moments which I really enjoyed.  The overall story was a little rushed and the art felt a bit dated but it looks like that might be improved in the next season.  Overall the story was enjoyable and the characters were fun and likeable.

9;Ling Qi;Sakura_megami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sakura_megami;7;Ok, So I actually do not think this anime is as bad as people are saying it is. I mean yeah, the first episode was on the bad side but if you continue watching it, it is actually pretty good. I was satisfied after watching it. I judge anime and shows based on genre and whether or not it was enjoyable. First of all, this anime is shounen ai and the main characters do kiss throughout the anime. So stay away if you can't handle two dudes kissing. This anime also has a lot of light-hearted comedy which will have you laughing. The fight scenes keep you entertained all throughout. There is also unexpected plot turns in this anime. Overall this was a really good experience and I recommend it;Recommended
10;Ling Qi;Alina_Aniki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alina_Aniki;8;If it were not for the poor animation quality and voice acting, I would be far more impressed with this anime. Now, I've never read the source material and I've heard this adaptation isn't very faithful to it, but even so, I found the story and the characters to be very compelling, to the point where I consumed all of it in a day without intending to. Needless to say, despite the poor quality of the animation and sounds themselves (all of the sound effects didn't sound right, a lot of movements were clunky or had no transition and I could sometimes spot unfinished frames in the animation, not to mention the art was inconsistent and the colors don't mesh nor blend), I found myself invested in the lives of the two main characters, as well as two characters whom we meet later on. The character designs are also beautiful, and I feel like they put a lot of effort into making specifically three characters especially beautiful in almost every frame. This is a Chinese anime by Tencent though, they're not a big experienced company in animation, so I'll cut them some slack for that. I wouldn't be surprised if this was their second, third, or even first project. (And from the glimpse I caught, the animation and art improves in season two anyway.);Recommended
11;Ling Qi;cocolita22;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cocolita22;10;This show is so cute!!! I loved the main couple so much and literally wanted to binge this entire show in one sitting!!  The plot is incredible and exciting, but the character dynamics are what keep you watching. I literally love this show and wish there was a third season, but sadly there will not be one. However, don't let that stop you!!! This show is so funny, heart-warming, and bittersweet without a third season.  The music is gorgeous. I loved the opening theme so much, and whenever certain characters grace the scene, the sound gets much more beautiful.  The characters are all interesting and I can't find a single flaw. The main couple are one of the best developed I've ever seen.  As a BL lover, I was fan-girling very much. You will be very pleased if you like BL.;Recommended
0;Ling Qi;Kurapimpa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kurapimpa;5;"Okay, this is my first review, but this show leaves many things to be said. I have always been a fan of LGBT+ works, and I have enjoyed many Shounen-Ai, Yuri, and Yaoi anime. This one, however, was just bad. There were too many problems with it that even if I tried to shut my brain off, I just couldn't overlook it. I haven't read the web manga, and if it's better, props to it.  Beware, there might be ""spoilers"" in this review, but it's not all that important. Most of what I talk about happens in the first episode, and the rest of the ""spoilers"" are so easy to guess because of the show's predictable nature. Anyways, without further ado, let's get on with this.  Story- 5  Okay, this is where almost all of the major problems are. The show starts off with You Keika (Yang Jinghua) living his life as a savage fortune teller. His life has pretty much hit rock bottom and then he suddenly dies by good old truck-san. When he wakes up, he meets the oh-so-cool and good-looking Tanmoku Ki (Duanmu Xi) and is informed that he is dead. For some reason, Tanmoku Ki wants to hire him to be his ""Spirit Shadow"" which is a fancy word for a supernatural bodyguard.  You Keika rejects his request, but after a cliche run in with a darkened spirit or whatever, he decides to take the rings (yes, rings) and become his Spirit Shadow.  Pretty typical plot, right? One could easily overlook this as just an average show, and it is. However, unlike other average shows, I literally felt insulted as a member of the audience. The story continues with giving fangirls bits and pieces of the good gay stuff, while also making Tanmoku Ki have a fiancee. My biggest gripe with the show is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It goes far enough with the yaoi to leave fujoshi's squealing, but not far enough to make the character's relationships feel natural. The tone is constantly shifting from edgy, to ""funny"", to romance, to edgy and funny again. I am aware these tone shifts are natural for any story, but the pacing in this show is so bad it makes it feel awkward and cringe-worthy.  The pacing is really awful and it's a major gripe I had while watching this. There are these awkward pauses in animation, the dialogue feels like a 13 year old wrote it, and the relationships are so forced for the sake of the plot. Keep in mind 90% of the show takes place in a week. A WEEK. And you know what happened in like the 4-5th episode? A montage.  A f**king montage of all the time the two mains spent together, when at the time, they had only known each other for FOUR DAYS.  The story is constantly trying to make it seem deeper than it is and make their ""bond"" known to the viewers, but it just doesn't work. You can't throw montages in our faces or little cute moments here and there and expect us to go along with their relationship. Why they're even so close in a week is beyond me, and it's one of the biggest turn off points in the show. How am I supposed to get invested when the two main characters have such a forced bond? If you start off trying to instantly make them close after an episode or two, you lose the aspect of them growing to like each other. You lose their development, how they change their view of each other, and why they become close. If you slap it together with force at the beginning, you get a relationship that's completely empty.  Also, the show does the cliche tie ins to past lives and reincarnations and all that other stuff you've seen a million times. The sudden relevance to that in the show is so cheap it's almost laughable. Literally, everything about the story has been done before, but better. Much better.  In conclusion, the story has choppy pacing, weak characters, and cliches all around. There is literally nothing special about the story. If it weren't for the fujoshi bait, I don't think anyone would've continued watching this. And trust me, the creators know that. That's why they barely tried to produce something decent. It's an insult to the audience's intelligence.  Art- 7  I mean, the art wasn't anything great, but it was passable. I can't be too hard on it; it served its purpose. As I mentioned earlier though, there were parts with choppy animation or where they looped it. You could sometimes see through the cracks of where they made budget cuts, and it would only increase the awkward feeling of the show. The awkward pauses with the dialogue following a tad behind happened way too often to be an accident. I did like the opening, but I felt it could've either calmed down some, or been more action packed. The sound didn't fit the animation at all sometimes, which brings us to our next category.  Sound- 6  Okay, I actually like both the opening and ending. I even like some of the piano tracks in it. The soundtrack on its own is pretty decent. However, the creators have no clue where to place their tracks in the show. It ended up having the weirdest background music for some scenes that either required softer or heavier tones. Sometimes there would be random songs with a vocalist just thrown in there for the hell of it. This is the first show I've seen where I've actually noticed that the sound doesn't fit. And it wasn't just once, it was throughout all 10 episodes. Sometimes they'd get it right, but most of the time it was just weird.  Character- 3  This is the worst part guys. I already mentioned that the two mains had such a forced relationship, and it really shows. The main guy can be pretty obnoxious. The creators think having him ramble off random sh*t is comedy gold, so he does it every. Single. Episode. He's a weak attempt at a comedic character. Not to mention they try so hard just from the beginning to make us feel bad for him.  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, time to pull out your anime tropes checklist! What do we have for You Keika?  Dead parents! Check!  No relatives! Check!  Living poor and on his own! Check!  Ties to a supernatural past! Check!  Gets hit by a truck! Check!  5 in a row makes a winner! Stand up and claim your prize you sack of sh-  So anyways, I didn't enjoy his character. I tried to, but the writing didn't make that possible. I remember in like the 3rd episode or so he got in a fight with this flame lord and umbrella loli, and his special move was calling for help. Then immediately after that, with no explanation, he was suddenly like ""I can't rely on others and cry for help anymore! I have to fight for myself!"" He gets that weird determination out of nowhere and decided to be a badass at random moments for the hell of the story. Sometimes he powers up because of his past life or whatever and becomes a boss that can defeat this blind master, then other times when he's in his power up mode he's completely useless. There's no consistency with his strength or character whatsoever. Speaking of that, there is literally a magical girl transformation of him changing into that form. I'm not kidding. I'm really not. It happens. A f**king magical girl transformation. It's not funny. Nothing in this show is funny. It's just a bad attempt at reference humor. It's so bad. IT'S SO-  ~We'll be right back after these messages!~  Okay, I'm back. I'm not sure if this review is coherent or not, but I hope that you see what I'm getting at. Before I get any more triggered, let's move on to the next main character. Tanmoku Ki, is the cold, calm, and collected stereotype.  Pull out that checklist again, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for round two!  Cool, handsome, and rich! Check!  Supernatural powers that are super special! Check!  Head of some family of exorcists or whatever! Check!  Dead parents and possible illegitimacy! Check!  Cold to everyone except the main character cause plot! Check!  There's not much I can say about his character, because he really doesn't have one. He gets randomly worried and worked up over You Keika's safety for reasons that aren't explained until the last episode. Even when they are explained, it doesn't make it any better. He's a walking trope of every cool rich guy that came before him. His character is so bland that if it weren't for his powers and social placing, there would be nothing special about him. So yeah, not much I can say.  Enjoyment- 4  Not gonna lie, I had a few laughs while watching this insanity. The montage part and the magical girl transformation both made me lose it because of how bad it was. Even with some of the stuff being so bad it's funny, most of it was just bad. I cringed more times than i can count.  Overall- 5  It's average. Average and insulting. Don't waste your time on this. If you want to see boys in love, go watch Doukyuusei. They actually, you know, TRY.  If you just want some ancient supernatural stuff with good action, go watch Moribito. Good characters, interesting plot, and plenty of action to keep you entertained.  So yeah, pass this show if you value your integrity. There are better things out there to watch. Don't waste your time here.";Mixed Feelings
1;Ling Qi;kurosmile;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kurosmile;5;At first I'm just going to give this show a standard 7 but after considering other important aspects and comparing it to other good anime, I decided to lower the score to 5.  Plot: 4/10  I like the spirit-master relationship. The power portrays at the beginning of the story got me excited and anticipated for more. However, as I watched episode by episode, it did not meet my expectation. There are parts of the plot that are predictable. The flow of the story for the first few chapters are too fast paced, deducting the realistic point of this story. The way the characters respond to certain situation seems unnatural. There are plot holes especially regarding the first line of Tomanku and his spirit servant. I wish to know about them better. The last few episodes of this anime are very slow paced to the point I think it was a waste of episodes.  Characters: 4/10  You Keika- I'm just gonna say that I am flat out disappointed with this character. I'm expecting his powers to be much more impressive that what was portrayed in the last few episodes. He was supposed to be a powerful spirit, matching his master's, Ki, powerful spiritual energy. However, in most of the episodes, it was him being protected by Ki when in reality it was You Keika's job to protect his master. He is funny, that's the only positive point I see in this character.  Tanmoku Ki- This character is your typically cold but kind hearted, powerful and respected by all character. He's nothing special really.  Over all: 5/10  This anime is definitely not the best anime I have ever watched. It's mediocre, fits your typical anime mold. The only wow element of this anime is the hint of Shonen-Ai in this anime which I definitely enjoy. Perhaps, those who are new to anime would enjoy and appreciate this anime better than I do.;Mixed Feelings
2;Ling Qi;CallMeAi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CallMeAi;6;This show is far from being flawless. But I still liked it. It's not the best but not the worst either. And yet it still really hit me. At times it was so very emotional and sad and I just kept wanting more.  Story - 5/10. I feel like the plot was really rushed which is a shame because it does have an interesting story. I love the master-spirit relationship and how they learn to cope with each other. But I'm not a fan of how the story was portrayed thus giving it a 5/10 stars.  Art - 7/10. Darn is the animation beautiful. But I had some problems with it at times and so it gets a 7/10.  Sound - 7/10. I mean it's beautiful, sometimes playful, Chinese music. No more needs to be said.  Character - 6/10. I was more interested in the relationships between the characters, especially the relationship between our main protagonists, rather than the characters themselves. There was a lack of character development which I hope to see in the next season. But I can't deny that despite all this I still really liked some of the characters. Even though they were your stereotypical, cliché type of characters.  Enjoyment - 7/10. Overall I enjoyed it and am looking forward to watching season 2. It was neither good neither bad though as a fujoshi myself I must say that some scenes were awesome *blushing*.;Mixed Feelings
3;Ling Qi;kloekalle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kloekalle;6;Honestly, it's pretty bad. There is barely any depth to the characters, there's no real story, and it doesn't have any other redeeming qualities. The art isn't horrible, but it's definitely not above average. The opening as well isn't that good. It's boring, I watched it recently yet I can barely remember what happened. And if you were going to watch it for the shounen ai tag, then you'll be disappointed to know that there's little to no romance.  However, I would say it's worth watching only because I really like season 2. The characters are developed a lot and there's an actual story with pretty decent conflict.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ling Qi;KitsunehimeMilhi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KitsunehimeMilhi;4;"Before I get started I want to say that this review is for the Japanese dubbed version. I do not know why myanimelist deleted the separate entry when they already had it set up on their site, but whatever.  Honestly, Spiritpact was kind of annoying, but it's not the worst I've seen. The main story is basically that Tanmoki makes You Keika his spirit shadow after You dies. You is the person who now will fight along side Tanmoki as he faces evil spirits and other people that come after him. There's more detail that you can learn about the plot, but I'd be spoiling a bit of the anime if I included that information. Overall, the plot was a mess though.  I guess the art and animation were kind of average. Nothing really bugged me about either aspect, but at the same time, neither one was necessarily good either.  The opening, ending and background music were kind of bad. I personally don't like the opening and ending themes. The background music didn't do it's job of getting me, the viewer, more excited about what was happening. Most of the music scores are kind of just there.  The characters are really bad too. None of them really have a special personality trait and a lot of them can get on your nerves really easily, especially You at the beginning. 2 or 3 of the main characters, like You and Tanmoki got some development, but no one else really did. Most characters were just present with no real purpose for being there and they didn't add much if anything to the plot.  Like many others, I didn't really enjoy this. Some episodes were ok, but more were boring and seemed pointless to even include. There's some ok action and other things from time to time so it's not the worst I've seen; I'd still rank this above many other anime I've watched, but I definitely wouldn't say this quit lived up to being average either. I don't recommend Spiritact, but some people reading this may decide to check it and like it.";Not Recommended
1;Ling Qi;Ironoverloaded;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ironoverloaded;4;"~Review copy-pasted from Season 2 review~  ""Master, a relationship with a person is like a kite. It won't fly high if you hold it too tightly. Loosen your grip too much and it falls, and when you pull strongly on a kite flying high in the sky, the string will snap and it will never come back.""  I wish I could like this anime. I wish I could write nothing but good things about it, especially since it seems to have a cult following with fans. But I can't.  I'll start with the most glaring issue - This doesn't feel like Shounen Ai. This feels like queer baiting and people clutching at straws. This was produced in China, which you probably know has a strict censorship law over gay relationships being shown in the media. I believe this show only got away with what it did show because its producers were Tencent - a very well-known Chinese conglomerate. But even they had their limits.  Let me start by saying every kiss in this has a purpose. Much like Mahou Sensei Negima!? and Yamada-kun and the seven witches. Each kiss is an ""exchange of energy"" or forming a contract between the two characters. There is never any mention of love and each kiss has a clear purpose to it.  Which is fine. We're watching Shounen Ai, not smut, right? But that's where it falls apart. The characters are unlikeable and never really develop from their initial introductions in season 1, and therefore their emotions never really develop. They're never shown to love each other beyond this sould connection, and it's never even explained why Ki makes the connection with Keika in the first place. ~Sure~, we're given backstory and how they're fated, but Ki doesn't know this at the time he makes the pact and he never shares this information with Keika.  And sadly, there is no season 3, so we can expect to never know past the webtoon as this anime has been cancelled. If there was a season 3 - I might've spared this anime such a harsh review, but the entire plot was just all over the place. There was no pacing, scenes felt awkward, places that were supposed to make you cry just left me sighing and wishing I could fast forward to the resolutions. I couldn't connect with these characters or their emotions, and the emotions felt by most of them seemed flimsy at best - or had overarching, massive conversations and conflicts between them go unspoken or even straight up forgotten about and ignored.  So I couldn't even go ""at least this is a good anime, even if there's not any real romance."" Because there wasn't any real plot, and any plot was quickly abandoned for the new, shiny plot line they decided was better the next episode. In fact, 5 episodes in the second series were dedicated purely to a flashback between a character introduced 4 episodes into the season within these flashbacks. And the 5 episodes weren't even needed - it was two perspectives of the same events, and by the second run-through, I really didn't care anymore.  I think a portion of this criticism can also be attributed to the Japanese dub. They tried to match the lip animation to what the original Chinese dub said, but Chinese is incredibly fast compared to English and Japanese, and I feel like a lot of what was ~supposed~ to be said was lost in translation and lost it's impact. Instead, scenes flew by unnecessarily fast, littered with sentences and statements that made me go, ""uhh, and?"" where I'm sure they were supposed to shock you and add tension.  I was going to let this all slide, because ""at least the art is good"" but it's very sloppy in some frames and scenes, and for some reason, Keika's eyes are retconned and made purple in the second series instead of yellow. Which really doesn't help when Ki and Shouken also both have purple eyes, so every important character just looked the same in the flashback scenes. I wouldn't have cared if they'd even explained it. But there's zero explanation, and Keika's eyes are purple in flashback scenes, so the fan theory that they ""changed when he got closer to his ancestor's power level"" is redundant because he has them as a child.  I feel like this entire show was trying to do too many things at once, and spread itself too thin as a result. It prolongued the scenes it should've shortened and missed the big picture involving the things it should've prolongued instead.  I can't hate it. It has guys kissing in a CHINESE piece of media. That's nigh impossible to achieve ordinarily and I'm certain Tencent's production was the only reason this was given a second series. It's paving the way for more acceptance in a culture that desperately needs it. And it wasn't a horrific anime. There was semblance of a plot here, and it tried. It just didn't try very hard.";Not Recommended

While he seeks death as a form of escape, the leader of the survivors on the surface tell him of the experiences those on the surface endured: cannibalism, tragedy, backstabbings, and many other atrocities. A new path is opened up to Marc, as a mutant who retains a human conciousness, he can be the key to destroy the mutant hivemind and reopen the surface to the humans.  This Special clearly expands on the situation and civilization of those who survived on the surface. While this has been hinted at during the previous parts, we now see in detail what they have developed during their survival and what their goals and ambitions are. Even the MC, Marc, is clearly shown to have made his decision on how to proceed, which will be the premise behind Season 2.  Final Season 1 Review: The story to Ling Long or Spirit Cage Incarnation is very good. I highly suggest this series to anyone who likes post-apocolyptic setting stories. The world, characters, and plot are all well-developed. The characters motivations, actions, etc are all portrayed well. Nothing feels out of place.  9/10 for the whole season.";Recommended
0;Ling Long: Incarnation Part 2;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;8;Spirit Cage S1 Middle Part & Part 2 & FInal Part Review  Spirit Cage Incarnation S1 Middle & P2 finally dives deeper into the rabbit hole uncovering censored information about the old world. The main premise of this part begins with Captain Marc disobeying the rules of survival on the Lighthouse and being outcasted by the leaders of the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse Master falls severely ill requiring medicine from a medical facility in the dead zone - a place crawling with unknown extremezoans. Captain Marc and his loyal comrades join on the mission to find the medicine and save the Lighthouse Master from losing his position of power risking corruption in leadership. During the mission, Captain Marc has his throat slit and is on his deathbed being rushed onto the Lighthouse to discover a terrifying secret. This 'new' Marc is outcasted by the members of the Lighthouse except for his loyal comrades and is sent to falling to the ground. He discovers an important eco system among the mana eco (the hierarchal system extremezoans follow) and is saved by 'humans' on the ground.  Story: 8/10 The story delves deeper into the intricate details of the world lore slowly but it adds heavy doubt on my chest as the details are released. Marc has a simple mindset, he is bred specifically to fight extremezoans as hinted several sources in the story. He is a victim to the political manipulation of the chairman of Light and Shadow cult-worship religion and other humans saved by Marc are manipulated to serve as political tools to outcast him. The story is still full of detail and suspense as we learn the true nature that led up to the Lighthouse's existence and mana eco on the ground. It honestly makes me not want to watch the series because of how unpredictable it can be at points which is very scary.  Art & Sound:8/10 Spirit Cage still manages to have unique visuals. Where other series can't render more than 15 people to a screen, Spirit Cage somehow manages to have dense populations of Lighthouse be on screen at the same time which amazes me considering the processing and rendering power required to render mass amounts of moving humans at a single time. The scenes where Marc gets outcast to the ground and when he is surrounded by extremezoans are examples of having dense populations with great quality. It seems the studio CHKT Entertainment and BiliBili spared no effort to make this series artistically complex.  Sound, I think is still comparable to part 1. The mixture of sound effects and suspenseful music keep the scenes under pressure on what will happen next.   Character: 8/10 Character development is conflicting. At this stage of the series, sadly a lot of Marcs loyal comrades die and many Lighthouse members turn against him thanks to the political manipulation of the chairman of Light and Shadow. Many characters are still shrouded in mystery like the humans on the ground and the Lighthouse Master and his Master. The final part of Season 1 adds even more mystery when Marc discovers the eco system of mana eco.  Overall: 8/10 Development overall slows down in part 2 and Final part but we still get important details that hint to mysteries mentioned in the 1st part and middle part of Spirit Cage. Overall, still intense and fearful atmosphere watching this series because of its unpredictability.;Recommended

This infuriates the current leader causing a relapse in his heart condition. Now the Marc, the leader of the hunters, is sent to retrieve medicine to save him (this of course goes against the doctrine of the Lighthouse). In exchange, he would be given the opportunity to leave, but the disatisfied ""political rival"" is clearly plotting something to get rid of Marc.

Unlike the first part which primarily deals with life on the Lighthouse, this part shows the creatures and dangers that currently exist on the planet surface.

1;Ling Long: Incarnation;HenriqueNeves;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HenriqueNeves;8;"The greatest potential of Chinese anime (donghua) recently released - mainly by the producers Bilibili and Tencent Penguin Pictures - comes from a great expressive use and enabling its 3D.  While many are still prejudiced against this language - relatively recent considering that it is less than 50 years since its emergence - which is still undergoing great development, it seems to me that it has reached maturity at Pixar. But that does not prevent that animes like ""Douluo Dalu, 2018"" and ""Ling Long: Incarnation, 2019"" have been able to use this resource in a very evident, expressive and enabling way.   It is interesting to note how Ling Long: Incarnation has a very strong relationship with video games. Both visually and narratively, anime has a very unique principle in being able to link such choices to convey a feeling that we are enjoying daily gambling. The first scene of the anime conveys this idea very well.  The characters start in a kind of cave where they need to take resources and go back to their base. As soon as they get what they want, they are attacked by a type of mutant insect that baffles the minds of some, and also by a giant lizard.  The characters have a mission, after achieving their objective, they need to escape to survive. This idea is not only in the narrative structure of the anime, but also in the visual, which are very characteristic of shooting games, and in the way the anime is staged.  In addition to the expressive use of 3D, which always seeks to travel through spaces, which always leaves the viewer in a great perspective of the action, it also has some frameworks that complement a lot of shooting games. In the action scenes, the characters get to be in first and third person.  If Douluo Dalu is an anime that takes advantage of this resource in a very ""poetic"" way trying to express a more contemplative and enchanting beauty, here the scenarios have a presence that seeks more dynamism in the scenes. The camera at various times even floats through the action. The anime makes great sequences without losing perspective on what is happening in each sequence. Something that is not impossible to do in conventional 2D animation, but that requires much more effort and technique from those who are doing it. It turns out that anime isn't just about that. The plot also explores a certain social and religious context and hierarchy that guides the events of history.   One of my “disappointments” was to think that the anime was going to take this idea - of a game narrative - way ahead. It turns out that most of the anime sequences take place only on the floating base of the characters and in some flashbacks.  But in no way would I say that such a development of social classes was bad. In fact, anime spends a lot of time contextualizing everything it can from that universe. Even though it was not what I wanted to see, consequently, I ended up being very interested in everything that was presented to me. The direction also managed to express a dramatic possibility of this 3D very well. Not to the point of making you cry, but rather to interest and instigate.   If I could make a general summary, I would say that Ling Long: Incarnation tries in every way to play the viewer in the whole context of that universe. It seems to me that there is an almost perfect balance between these ideas.";Recommended
2;Ling Long: Incarnation;Srodiam;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Srodiam;10;"Looking at the tags and poster, i thought that this was going to be a cliche serie of monster killing, not entirely different from those series that attempt to ride on Attack on Titan's popularity. To my surprise, Incarnation gives almost no importance to the monsters, instead focusing on the human interactions and struggles in the society that formed on this new world. After a global earthquake unleashes a myriad of underground monsters on the surface, collective known as Extremozoan, humanity is almost entirely wiped out. The last remains lives aboard the Lighthouse, a flying fortress. In order to maintain the civilization, all interpessoal relationships have been abolished. All individuals live only in function to their role on the Lighthouse hierarchy, being divided in 2 segments: Superiors, those who were born with desirable genetic traits, and who are given the most important jobs and best living conditions; and Inferiors, those who were born just as regular people, delegated to the worst living conditions and, ""less important"" jobs. Only Superiors are given names, while Inferiors are reduced to just to ""Worker N° ####"". This is a refreshing change from the usual ""medieval magic fantasy"" that 95% of Donghua are composed of. Another welcomed change is the animation quality: while most CGI shows have frame drops issues and kinda ugly graphics, Incarnation is really fluid and good looking, some scenes are actually beautiful. This was a really pleasant surprise of a show and i can't recommend it enough.";Recommended

The animation is so beautiful and detailed, and I can't get enough of it. The level animation is on par with video game trailers, and honestly, I just can't think of anything bad to say about it. The soundtrack is very addicting, and the opening and ending songs are amazing. The characters are greatly portrayed as well. Even better, the episodes are posted on youtube, which makes it extremely easy to access and watch. I enjoyed this animation a lot, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested.;Recommended
4;Ling Long: Incarnation;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;9;"General Plot: A disaster and mutant beings feasting on souls has caused humanity to retreat to the ""Lighthouse"" a floating fortress and final refuge for humaninty. Because of it's limited living space and resources, the ""Lighthouse"" has become a centrally-planned, ultra-utilitarian, military state. In order to faciliate the most efficient use of resources and preserve the human race, every person is expected to become a cog in the system that runs the ""Lighthouse"". Familial relationships have been abolished, reproduction is centrally planned, humans are seperated into classes to dictate resource investments, and religion is established to reinforce the caste system and encourage the self-sacrifices needed to sustain this society. Despite these restrictions, resources must be gathered periodically from the planet's surface. While the ""Lighthouse"" has been relatively stable, recent revelations about possible life on the ground and transferrance of leadership (and political ambitions) causes tensions to build and plotting to begin. Once the MC, Marc, gets personally affected, the idealogical battle between self-sacrfices for survival vs freedom erupt.  This Season 1 Part 1 is the build up to everything that will happen in this full season. The characters are introduced well, the political climate, living environment and situation are all shown in detail. It is all done beautifully, every aspect of life in the ""last bastion of humanity"" is clearly shown, from the current living situation, control through relgion, caste system, etc. This season does well in building up the conflict that will very obviously erupt, when someone in power and leadership disrupts the system set in place.  The character models and animations are smooth and well done. Even if you don't quite understand the story, the animation quality and action makes this a enjoyable watch. The world building and set up is done extraordinarily well.";Recommended
5;Ling Long: Incarnation;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;9;"TL;DR: This series is heavily symbolic and shares many plot points with the novel Handmaid's Tale. It is very distressing yet suspenseful it kept me at the edge of my seat beaming on what will happen in the next episode.  Ling Long Incarnation is a Chinese donghua set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian, barren world where humanity tries to solve the problem of interplanetary migration but fails due to natural destruction. Extremezoans, a mutated living organism capable of interpersonal communication and coordination dwell in colonies on the ground. It appears that they are scavenger organisms that feed on other living organisms as well as breed fast and regenerate faster. Mutants such as the Extremezoans are the main reason why humanity is on the brink of extinction.  The Lighthouse is a city in the sky that houses humanity's last hope of survival. The Lighthouse has 3 codes of survival which are rules that can never be crossed: Abolishment of Family, Social Hierarchy and Gene Optimization.  Abolishment of Family on the Lighthouse is a rule that forbids intimacy or familial relations. The introduction of this rule lays the foundation that humans must be controlled in order preserve function in the Lighthouse. An example of this are hunters who are bred and trained specifically for combat ability and awareness - Their purpose is the reason they are alive - not to find mating partners - which is heavily enforced by the Light and Shadow Religion on the Lighthouse.  Humans on the Lighthouse are segregated into social hierarchy groups called Superior and Inferior. Inferior humans have health defects which deem them unworthy of a high standard of living like Superiors and are often subject to prejudice and maltreatment. Inferiors get pesky jobs like manual labor and they also accompany the Hunters on missions. Some Hunters treat Inferiors as expendable fodder on missions which is a main reason why Inferiors don't have a long life expectancy. When humans on the Lighthouse reach an age where they cannot contribute more than they consume (in food, health expenses etc.) they are sent on a Long Journey on the ground which basically sacrifices them to reduce resource consumption.  Gene Optimization on the Lighthouse is a rule that prioritizes Superior human matching. It is pretty much selective breeding where Superior humans with outstanding features like intellect are bred with humans with outstanding physical capabilities. If a Superior child is birthed, both parties will be rewarded heavily by the Lighthouse but if an Inferior child is birthed the child is sent to the slums where the Inferior humans live. It is against this rule for Inferior humans to breed because the worm cakes ration supplied to the Inferior humans is limited.  Religion and culture are forbidden on the Lighthouse, there is only one religion that the Lighthouse acknowledges which is the Light and Shadow Religion. This religion is a controlled cult-worship religion that works in strict affiliation with the Lighthouse leaders. It seems the main idea behind this religion was to brainwash and control Superior humans to keep them contributing to the Lighthouse. In one of the earlier scenes, we can see the Chairman of the Light and Shadow Religion (Son of the master of the Lighthouse) praising Superior humans for obeying the codes of survival, one lady was praised for following the gene optimization rule and one man was praised for denying familial relations with his 'father'.  All of these aspects work together to form a series of life rules that control and oppress humans on the Lighthouse. This forces everyone to be complacent with the rules and in the chance someone disobeys they are publicly executed to set an example.  STORY: 9/10 The story is very descriptive and expansive. Without going into too much detail, we see many perspective and living situations of human life on the Lighthouse. The rules of survival is a genius way that many dystopian survival dramas use to restrict and control the characters and story progression. It also creates the sense of entrapment fearing that the characters will revolt and disobey the rules ultimately facing their demise. Thematically, the story is very aspiring and significant.  ART & SOUND: 8/10 The CGI animation isn't as flashy as some high budget series like Mortal's Journey or Perfect World but it is very visually detailed. The characters aren't all that detailed but they have realistic fluidity in their movements. The fight scene between Captain Marc and his trainer is a testament to how fluid their movements are which was a surprise. The angles are also have variation and add suspense in some senses on the ground.  Sound design is very good, during the first mission there was a lot of background music and sound effects that added suspense and evoked fear. The scene where the inferiors first encounter the spinal organism is an example of good sound effects and suspenseful music to evoke fear and suspense.  CHARACTER: 8/10 I liked how we weren't spoon fed the story in chronological order. In Episode 1 to 3 we follow the first mission but it plays backwards as a storytelling mechanism when Captain Marc explains it to the Lighthouse Master. Furthermore, The conversation between the Lighthouse Master and Captain Marc about Marc's sister left me questioning for a while until it was brought up in a flash back much later in the series. The story flows but the dead characters still have influence on the storytelling mechanism. The same can be said about the blonde girl that died in the first mission - her unrequited love picked up by the silver haired girl from Marc's squad. And the sudden news of the silver haired girl's match added the icing on the cake. The only thing that I didn't really enjoy was how the character names were hard to remember - There's about 10-15 characters of importance in this season alone and knowing every character is very tricky because the series is so short it is difficult to remember the characters that way.  OVERALL: 9/10 Although this series feels like a 7 or 8/10 it had very good world building and character establishment in 6 episodes. The animation and sound added more depth into the viewing experience and character conflicts gave the series a personality. Overall, very satisfied viewing - I hope Season 1 Part 2 holds true to these aspects.";Recommended

7;Ling Long: Incarnation;Zaxton;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zaxton;7;So I do really enjoy this show, gives an energy similar to dead space. And I'm a fan of shows that aren't afraid to kill some of their characters. the art feels like its a full story of something that could be on love death and robots so that's a big +. the characters are all honestly pretty good up until they aren't (like do something really stupid you would never expect them to do) to fuel a plot point or advance the story. Still a cool show though.  this next thing is the only thing you could maybe consider slightly spoilerish but its important to the review. it feels like whenever a character dies, almost no matter how insignificant of a background character they are, they HAVE to have a 2 minute -tension breaking sad final words while other characters call out their name- cliché moment, it happens with characters you wont even recognize. and this almost always is in the middle of combat. This gets more annoying in part 2.  oh also the monsters in this show are pretty damn cool.  I'd give it a 7.5 if I could.;Recommended
0;Ling Jian Zun 2nd Season;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;You can fix trash cultivation level but you can't fix stupid. I've read the manhua and it is much more entertaining and tolerable than the adapted Donghua, Spirit Sword Sovereign 2nd season is garbage it's no wonder why it's hard to find online.  Story In the second season, the tournament arc that displays ones martial strength and ability to join one of the 4/5 major Martial halls. Chu Xing Yun shows exceptional talent by winning this tournament and joining Yu Yun's masters Martial Hall as an inner disciple in order to learn about methods to save his beloved from her life threatening ice-blood condition.  This donghua has been very vague in the details since the beginning, the pacing is very fast which leads to a lossy way of plot development and as a result many plot holes.  Characters I get the feeling the characters exist in this Donghua to serve as a stepping stone for Chu Xing Yun because in the Manhua, he treats everyone with respect if they treat him with resect like Poisonous Yan. When Poisonous Yan agrees to follow Chu Xing Yun as a slave, he gets better treatment but throughout this season I haven't seen this treatment and Poisonous Yan's following is one sided. Furthermore,  Chu Xing Yun is such a tryhard in the Donghua, he is arrogant and can't back it up with his reincarnated powers. He has the wind attribute which allows him to seemingly teleport but for some reason in his battles this season he decides it's a good idea to use his sword to outwit his opponent head-on which is stupid. Then at the end he magically uses the spirit power absorption and never uses it again it feels like his powers are just used once and never mentioned but replaced with new techniques. He literally owns martial arts techniques and he has trouble fighting people at the same age as him that didn't reincarnate, that's just embarrassing.  Art & Sound Bad art and bad sound. I could barely find this series online and it had terrible subtitle translations. If it wasn't for the Manhua, I wouldn't be persisting but this is a hit or miss watch.;Not Recommended

1;Ling Jian Zun;abhiadi10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abhiadi10;7;This Series gets better in the later seasons. The protagonist shows a lot of character growth. So, this series is based on the common Reincarnation/Isekai/Cultivation tropes. The story has a lot of depth. Diverse characters. The wars have a lot of strategy behind them. There is an element of romance which is quite well executed (he finds a wife in the first episode itself, but the road to love is not easy). The MC (Main Character) is very powerful at the beginning due to past life experience. However, he is also quite arrogant, due to which he makes mistakes, knowingly walks into obvious traps, ending up defeated. In the later seasons however, the MC almost loses his life in a near fatal encounter, due to his own negligence. After this incident, we see a lot of character growth in him. He becomes very wise, has various strategies, takes down enemies with a lot of precautions. Overall, it's worth a watch. The animation quality is okayish. Available sub translations are good, but could've been better(which remains an issue for most chinese anime). What I find missing is the element of comedy. There are not many characters who bring a comic relief, and the MC himself is of a serious nature. P.S.: Don't stop watching it if you find the MC annoying in the beginning. He will grow a lot later on.;Recommended

0;Ling Feng Zhe;Kiwi_Cookie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kiwi_Cookie;9;"The Leader is a work with the ability to set any revolutionary's heart alight with pride. It is not often that these kinds of cartoons carry with them such weight, but this is no ordinary cartoon. It is a work designed to inspire a new generation of Marxists to carry forth the torch of Communism to a brighter tomorrow.  I was deeply impressed by the characterization of Marx and his comrades. This show is not just a picture of Marx, it is a mirror in which the audience can see themselves reflected in the actions of Marx and the revolutionaries of the past. The Leader makes Marx more than just a face in a textbook, it makes him human.  Technically, the show is lacking in many aspects. The art is sub-par, with the transition between 2d and 3d being quite jarring at times. The sound design also leaves much to be desired. However, it would be improper to place as much weight on these aspects as the true meat of the story. This show needs neither impressive visuals nor immersive sound to draw the viewer in with its powerful message of revolution.  Overall, I was astounded by the degree to which this show moved me. As a show produced under the direction of the Communist Party of China, I was suspicious that it would dilute Marx's revolutionary character, but it seems even the revisionist CPC recognizes his great contributions to the world.  I understand that to one ideologically opposed to Marx, this show might be rejected on its basic premise. However, I believe that even a reactionary can be moved by this humanization of Marx. Too many people understand Marx only by ""Marxism."" They understand him only by the number of deaths that are falsely attributed to him.

1;Ling Feng Zhe;Feetuska;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Feetuska;10;The leader is a masterpiece. It tells the life story of the great philosopher Karl Marx in painstakingly personal detail. It tells how the immortal science of Marxism got its roots, and how the life around Marx impacted his conclusions and decisions in the making of mankind’s greatest scientific work, Das Kapital.  Besides the pursuit of knowledge and answers to stop the bourgeoisie exploitation, The Leader also tells the personal life of Karl Marx in detail. We have deeply emotional situations and humane relationships. If this piece of art doesn’t make you cry your heart out at least once, you have no soul. Even if you are deeply indoctrinated into an imperialist capitalist system, if you still feel no remorse towards these characters, Marx, Engels and Jenny among them after what they’ve gone through and what situations hit them, then you truly are a lost cause.  One could however critique the art direction that has been going here. If you are a 2D purist the 3D is going to put you off. Did it put me off though? No. It blended in seamlessly, and besides, I would not have cared if this was fully 3D either. It’s the end result and the story that matters the most. The cause and the beautiful art in general. Not the amount of dimensions it’s in.  This piece of art was funded by the Chinese government. Because let’s be honest, an imperialist company would never fund or publish something like this. Though one can have doubts about the Chinese government, surprisingly enough, this series doesn’t push down Chinese market socialism or any such ideologies for that matter. Which is a relief. Instead we got a majestic piece of art that holds very truthful to the historic source material through an objective lens.  Happy late 200th birthday Karl Marx!;Recommended
2;Ling Feng Zhe;Mic7ch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mic7ch;6;I’ve never thought that the first Chinese anime I watch would be a two hours worth of CCP funded biography of Karl Marx. I’ve also never thought that I would ever reccomend any communist propaganda before but in the end, here I am.  If you're history guy (or paid the slightest attention in history classes) you would’ve probably known Karl Marx and his ideals already, but this seven-episode series covers the chapters of his life, which are unsurprisingly quite augmented (especially the narrator, who often praises excessively), we all know that Marx is a famous leftist philosopher but I'm certain that some events in his life didn't resolve the same way it did in the show. But afterall, this is obvious communist propaganda and they had to squeeze in lots of communist aspects into a couple minutes of Marx’s speech, in terms of that and dialogue writing, they just did a fair job. (I swear Jenny’s lines are very much contradictory from what a mother would say when loosing her son , It seemed unnatural)  Storyline and political drama aside, the voice acting is well done, it's not the best but it conveys the message. Though the official dub is Chinese, you can easily find English or other languages dub on YouTube.  The animations isn't the best, but it's far better than the other people might have reviewed. The problem is that aside from the main characters, everyone else looks plain and copy pasted, sometimes even Marx himself speaks without moving his lips, explosions and gunshots are quite terrible but personally, the worse part is the ending’s Chinese propaganda part, Mao Zedong’s face is plain and low res and the Chinese flag on the forbidden palace is but a red gif banner (Though the real ones at the palace are also red banners, the ones in the anime kinda fly unnaturally). The good things though are that there are often 3D aspects in play and the graphics are quite stunning actually, overall I think they did a job well done.  While others would refused or hesitate to recommend this anime due to it being a communist propaganda, while I’m not claiming it isn't, in fact I'm claiming it is. I’d still recommend this to everyone, especially history lovers who wishes to hear about Karl Marx’s life from the perspective of the Chinese. Just keep yourself aware and fact-check often, believe in the facts and kindly ignore the propaganda part.

Then I watched it, and the fact that it was Chinese made sense. It made me a little upset - after all, it was a kind of propaganda. Also, as seen in the anime, Marx-kun didn't like many compliments, and you know what? This anime is basically it!  With my first comment said - this ""piece of art"" is 147 hours of praises and compliments, telling us that Marx-kun was the BEST PHILOSOPHER EVER and stuff (honestly I disagree with that but it's a Chinese anime btw, probably the budget was all covered by the Communist Party), I'll tell you guys the truth about ""The Leader"".  The animation is poor sometimes. Yeah, only sometimes. Actually, many times. When it's not focused on Marx-kun or Engels-kun, it is CG-based and pretty weird. I mean, Jenny's hair didn't move naturally most part of the anime. There were scenes that really made me think I was watching some MMD animation. For real. Unfocused people at the background sometimes were just weird, with a real bad animation, even for normal anime standards. Let me give you an example: in Kill la Kill, people at the background often were just copies of the same individual, right? In The Leader, they aren't. That sounds good, right? Yeah, but actually some of them - a policeman, a chief, a NORMAL PERSON, their faces were just... wrong.  My ears couldn't believe what they were listening sometimes. The voice acting is horrible, emotionless at core moments. I mean, some emotions were just forced. Unnatural. Guess the budget was pretty low and the studio must have hired bad or novice actors, I dunno.  This is the time where you ask me, ""but Sputnik, if this anime is so awful, why did you rate it with a 6?"" Well, it's probably because the story is pretty good. Maybe. Okay, it's not so good. But there was something in it that made me cry when some characters die or just let me go on and finish the anime in some hours. If it were so horrible, sure I would have dropped it. It's not the kind of anime you watch for fun, actually. It's not entertaining at all, no drama involved - only a few, and well, those scenes aren't worth watching - and surely it will make you question why did you ever thought about watching it. Before you do, listen to me: only do if you are truly interested in Karl Marx or Communism. Many philosophical quotes are poorly explained - Bakunin-kun and Proudhon-kun are an example.

1;Ling Feng Zhe;mrbryce;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mrbryce;5;State capitalism in china is very successful. so successful that the government is facing a paradox: how can it keep calling itself the communist party when the youth is so focused on making money and showing their elevated consumer status ?  This anime is the answer: 1. make the leader a cool and trendy philosopher (clothing, music), keep the grit, drop the science. 2. draw the leader as an exotic individual, attractive but not chinese: the chinese cannot be universal, they shall be specific 3. don't dive into the study, do not explain. criticism shall stay manageable by emerging only from the gifted few 3. insist on social status, virtue and membership 4. kowtow to the new leaders who ditch the internationale and administer special treatment to the special people  a recipe to raise communism from the dead: all fashionable and brainless  this thematic was mostly treated with CGI and a few scenes were hand drawn. the animation is cheap, the colors are good. knowing the science of the capital, i could appreciate that anime as a refresher on the chronology.  episode 3 features aerith's theme from final fantasy VII, so there's that.;Mixed Feelings
2;Ling Feng Zhe;bigmonky69;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bigmonky69;6;"I enjoyed this show but I could not honestly recommend it to anyone, even as a fan of Karl Marx and his ideas, this show was disappointing, firstly, it is unavoidable how technically poor this show looks, the 2d and 3d art clashing an unbelievable amount, with every scene seeming to have at least one switch between the two, and the animation in the latter is stiff and robotic, meaning you have a lot of trouble seeing any of these characters as people, especially in the first four episodes.  For me episodes 1-4 were somewhat bland and uninspired, but inoffensive, some of the discussion of philosophy was so poorly placed that it was embarrassing to watch, and the pacing was noticeably pretty bad, alongside the fact that Marx himself didn't change visually at all for the three episodes, over what was something like 20? years in real life, it just felt lazy and cheap showing an adult man with two children as looking identical to his teenage self graduating from high school.  Episode 5 is the only part of this show I feel I could call wholly good, not fantastic by any means, the pacing and animation issues are still there, but it felt more human than the previous episodes, and the framing device of Marx explaining worker exploitation to a child was a good way to bring in some of the more dramatized elements of Marxism, such as the comparison between Vampires and Capitalists that Marx was so fond of, as well as the episode actually containing one or two emotional scenes that hit quite well, and I liked the motif of Marx reading a story to people, but it seemed to only look good in comparison to the other episodes, there was still a lot of awkwardness in the writing and execution.  Episode 6 was pretty bad, I was kind of taken aback by how much the creators showed their hand here, there seems to be much less of an effort to hide the propagandistic nature of the show in this episode, with Marx's disagreement with anarchists being used as a way to justify the current dictatorship in china, which many Marxist academics thoroughly disagree with, such as Richard Wolff, who describes China as state capitalist, not socialist, and the subplot of Tom at the Paris commune are in somewhat poor taste, the show seems to be trying to say that the pairs commune being massacred was a good thing because it gave people the chance to fight and die for socialism, and not a bad thing because it was an example of an oppressive state destroying a society largely made up of civilians.  Episode 7 was better than 6 but not as good as 5, the focus was mostly on Marx's relationship with his wife, Jenny, and it felt sincere and honest, but still somewhat stiff, but the section at the end where the narrator describes how good and call china is was just, ugh.  Overall, this show is fine, it has bad parts and some good parts, but those parts would ultimately be better appreciated in a better show. Marx is made into a sort of superhero, or even a sort of messiah, something Marx himself made very clear he would have hated, even in a work as shallow as the communist manifesto, he made sure to emphasize that movements should not idolize their leaders and the presentation of Marx as a pure, handsome superman just felt kind of shit, the man was a drunk journalist who slept until noon and got all of his money from his factory owning sugar daddy, I would have loved to see the sides of Marx that were less ""Perfect genius"" and more ""Lovable Bastard"", and the influence of the Chinese government really shows in this text. I expected better from the show in and of itself, but I'm not sure why.  If you want to understand Marx or see something about his life, I'd give this show a pass and recommend Marx for beginners by Ruis, the play ""Young Marx"", and the film ""The Young Karl Marx"", not only are these works better in a technical capacity, they are also not associated with any governments, so show an ideologically driven picture of the man, but still something coming from the heart. More generally if you want to see the man's ideas outside of the context of 19th century England then I'd recommend ""Sorry to bother you"", ""Billy Elliot the musical"" and ""Night In the Woods"", works that, to varying extents, explore these ideas without the handicap of being state-produced propaganda or pinned down to the life of one well read but drunk German Man who died nearly 150 years ago.";Mixed Feelings
0;Ling Feng Zhe;Aisukurimu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aisukurimu;4;Welcome to Karl Marx the animation: The Daddy of Communism.  The premise of the show stated that the anime is made to commemorate Marx 200th anniversary with a serious tone, while most of us (in the west) is taking the piss out of it. I can’t unseen that joke someone made on tumblr calling this as Xi Jinping’s way of making communism appealing to the younger generation, as hilarious and meme like that text post was, some truth lies underneath it. One simple click on Google will tell you that the anime is in fact funded by multiple government authorities, ie. The Government’s Marxism Office. It’s definitely propaganda alright. After more clicks around the internet and watching the anime myself, I don’t really understand who the target audience is.  Responses from the public:  Since I never read any of his work, I can’t confirm how accurate the dialogues are. But I don’t feel like I’ve learnt much from the anime. One of the criticisms I’ve seen Chinese people commenting is that the content doesn’t appeal to a specific audience, it’s too simplistic for those who knows about Marxism, but too complicated for those who know nothing.  There’re not many negative comments of the show under the episodes, the review function for the anime is blocked on the Bilibili platform where the show is streamed (I wonder why). I had to look else where for reviews. On the site Douban, out of the 1527 reviews, 50.3% are 1 star and the anime have a rating of 4/10 (as of today 07/03), if that doesn’t tell you something about how bad the show is, I don’t know what will. People don’t seem to have a problem making sarcastic comments and rating the show 1 star due to the quality of it. What’s bloody hilarious is that people are commenting on how Marx will be disappointed if he knew that Bilibili is charging people to watch the latest episodes, capitalism at its finest, yeah baby.  The ONLY reason I can write this review a week early is because I have a paid membership with Bilibili and I have access to the show. I guess it sucks to be you if you can’t afford one, huh.  The animation, music, writing:  The first thing you will notice is that the animation is damn awful, it’s so inconsistent, it switches from 3d to 2d and back to 3d then 2d and 3d and 2d every 6 frames, it’s really annoying and harsh to the eyes, as soon as you get used to the style it changes. Episode five was just a train wreck, the faces looked funny, there was illustrations inserted that was just in a completely different art style and appeared out of place.  The choice of depicting Marx and Engels as hot bishonens is also a mystery to me, I’m not saying they weren’t hot when they were young, I don’t know I can’t find any photo evidence of it (huh I wonder why), but this is what I mean when I say who is the anime for? It’s supposed to be serious toned propaganda for the communist party, yet they adopted a Japanese bishie otome game style. In episode 3, there’s also a weird ass aura between Marx and Engels, the whole show seems like a doujin to me. The ED is also one hell of a meme, the lyrics is all glory and communism with a comical rap section.  It really feels like it’s very low budgeted, neither the animation or writing is great, disappointing considering the government funded this. The pacing of the story is too fast, many characters are introduced but never gets another mention, the concepts are glanced over and never discussed in depth. In episode five, Marx literally aged 20 years and they skipped over probably the most important parts of his life. Engels on the other hand has about couple minutes of screen time the entire show, considering he is equally as important as Marx, he did co-write the The Communist Manifesto for god sake, oops, sorry my bad, god doesn’t exist in communism.  If the purpose of the anime were to educate, I don’t think they should chicken out on the details. Literally everything that was said in the show have gone over my head.  Would I recommend this? It’s up to you and what you want out of this, watch it for a good laugh but don’t expect anything out of it, if you are even remotely interested in Marx, I presume you are intellectually enough to read some books and journal articles.  Enough shit from me, I will now educate myself by reading a free copy of The Communist Manifesto. Ride on my comrades, peace and out.;Not Recommended
1;Ling Feng Zhe;Z0l0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Z0l0;4;"This January there was some strange news from China, the airing of a Karl Marx animated series usually called Karl Marx the anime, but actually titled The Leader. There was quite a bit of fuss on news sites and social media, but oddly once episodes started floating around the net it quickly disappeared. It doesn't seem to have gained much traction even in the circles that make image reactions and jokes.  I found a youtube channel that not only uploaded all seven episodes but had also fansubbed the Chinese dialogue into English and Russian. I watched the whole show, and I think I see why it didn't last. Using the channel statistics as a guide, episode one has 100,000+ views, episode 2 though plummeted to 15,000 and the drop continued with the last episode getting around 7,000. There's a lot to untangle so I'm going to break it down a bit.  **Expectations**  I wasn't expecting much going in, its a biopic of Karl Marx that's seven episodes long. Each episode is around 24 minutes long, but at least four of those minutes are dedicated to credit sequences and a preview of the next episode. I was expecting more of a brief timeline and introduction to his ideas and inspirations. This seems to be what they were aiming for and some episodes mostly live up to this but the rest fall quite short. The Look  Bluntly the show is very incompetent, both in animation and story structure, it seems to have deliberately gone out of its way to show off how poorly made much of it is. There's no consistency, it switches between 3D and 2D animation styles arbitrarily, the models are extremely janky in movement and stick out from the backgrounds. They often look creepy especially when laughing.  The models are also recycled heavily, Marx doesn't appear to age or change his clothes much from age 17 until the 1850's when he starts to show the beginnings of a beard. His wife Jenny is usually seen wearing her wealthy noblewoman dress and her maid is wearing a sexy formal French maids outfit. The crowds are some of the laziest I've ever seen, a good chunk of multiple episodes are dedicated to Marx giving a speech, and we get reaction shots from the audience, but what's weird is that these audiences usually stay motionless until the speech is finished, and then they applaud robotically. Most do not even emote during, and many not in the front row despite being clearly visible often do not have faces.   This is not the worst example of lifeless crowds, this is only the first example. From the first episode, about two minutes in  It looks cheap and it's very jarring. Even the show opener highlights many of the worst features of the animation. But what's really strange is that the first episode is the cheapest looking one, every other episode while not perfect is an improvement. Now animations having spikes and drops in quality is nothing unusual, budgets of both time and money can affect production, but I've never known the opening episode to be the one that's the cheapest looking. I honestly had to pause the episode multiple times to process what I was looking at, it's not just that it looks bad, it often actively confuses.  I think the last episode looks the best, and it's much easier to follow, but that's mainly because aside from an epilogue it focusses mostly on Marx coming to terms with his age and ill health. The section with him and his wife Jenny was surprisingly quite emotional.   **The Education**   I was expecting this to be a brief introduction friendly to people who knew nothing of Karl Marx, and I think that was the intent, but it often falls short. I personally think it might be better to skip episodes 1 and 2 and start with 3, not only do the production values increase but not much is lost. Though later episodes do still have some pretty serious issues.  It presents the information in small chunks, but sometimes it does so in a way that only makes sense if you were already familiar with the topic at hand. The bits on Hegel and Kant are pretty blatant examples. Episode 2 covers the deep impression Hegel made on Marx, particularly the ""Dialectic"" but it doesn't explain what that is, and both philosophers and many others that pop up in the show are reduced to some very quick summaries that rely on terms that aren't in common usage.  Another time Marx is outlining his ideas on Historical Materialism, and his brief explanation is overlaid random scenes on a street in Brussels, but the connection between what he's saying and the imagery is not made clear.  Episode 5 the highpoint for me, is the best at this, it takes its time explaining some of the passages from Capital, and its framing works in the episode. It also has effective use of colorful imagery, the Vampire like a capitalist relationship. Other than that its main problem is its brief run time, big and important ideas and lessons are briefly mentioned and then everything has moved on.   **The Revisionism**   This overlaps a lot with both education and looks, but I wanted to make this its own section for clarity sake. While focussed almost exclusively on Marx, -with one exception to be dealt with later- it does reference and introduces, often for less than a minute some of the other political radicals that Marx rubbed shoulders with. Including his criticism of them. with the exception of Ruge whose briefly mentioned before he appears everyone else Marx interacts with just turns up is introduced by a brief nameplate, cross swords with Marx and either immediately leaves to be banished forever, or like Engels sticks around to become his admirer.  Episode 4 takes this to the extreme. Wietling walks into the Marx home, is briefly introduced for his accomplishments, he then talks and moves incredibly smugly, talks about Christian communism for a bit and toasts himself before Marx speaks up. Every part of this scene, the dialogue, the character movements, facial emotions, etc. Is telling the audience to dislike him, but the argument between him and Marx is so quick and surface level its mostly just angry words. The only part of the disagreement that's clear between the two if you don't already know all about their ideas is that Wietling thinks workers allying with the bourgeoisie is a mistake because they are enemies, and Marx disagrees because of his views on history.  Who was right? Well, we're supposed to sympathize with Marx and Wietling literally storms out of his house never to be seen again so I guess that's a win for Marx*. The International Working Men's Association is depicted as being the soul fruit of the labor of Marx, and it largely accords with his views. The reality was that it was a diverse body full of people he couldn't stand and didn't fall under his direct control until 1872 when it promptly hemorrhaged members and collapsed.  In episode 6 there is a Marx/Bakunin standoff at the Hague Congress, Marx ridicules Bakunin as a conspirator, Bakunin has no allies, and he and his group are expelled. In reality Bakunin was never at the Hague Congress, Marx's motion to expel Bakunin failed, he was later expelled for questioning the new General Council, and when he left the majority of the membership also left, either to join him or like the other non-Marx non-Bakunin aligned groups like Blanqui's supporters simply to get away from the direction Marx was driving. The narration and the final episode don't acknowledge this at all, they give the impression that Marx's decision to prevent a split of the international, by well splitting the international was roaring success.  This episode (heh) demonstrates a key failing in The Leader. It's supposed to be biographical, but it won't tolerate even mild and universally accepted criticism of Marx as a political advocate or as a human being. Marx is apparently faultless when I saw they were including Helene Demuth the maid I wondered if they'd dare depict him getting her pregnant. They didn't, it'd probably get in the way of depicting his relationship with Jenny as a fairy tale romance. His well-known binge drinking is also absent, at one point he even criticizes other revolutionaries for drinking too much. His behavior with his enemies real and imagined is always depicted as noble and correct, but it can't go into detail about their opposing views and criticisms even to set up their defeat, so it all comes across as extremely shallow, which also makes Marx the character seem shallow and clueless. Marx never really convinces by the power of his argument, he just registers his dislike and the reactions of the characters do the hard work of presenting this as a victory to the audience.   **Self Sabotage**   Again this is tied in with all the other examples. A bizarre fault with the show is that it kept undermining what it was trying to achieve. An early scene in episode one that seems based on that famous scene from Good Will Hunting with the Bully is supposed to establish Karl Marx as a genius but it totally undermines itself. Marx does this by reciting a very simplified explanation of Kant's views on dogmatism and skepticism, which shouldn't be a problem, but this is shown to stump all the other students, and more importantly, the scene immediately before that was Karl Marx in a classroom listening to his teacher tell him this. So we're supposed to be impressed by his ability to remember basic information told to him three hours earlier.  Another example in episode 3 and 4 they address the poverty of the Marx family, but each time this done while the maid and his wife are onscreen in there expensive clothing, because they were too cheap to update their models. Shortly after criticizing Wietling, Marx starts ripping into Kriege's ideas on universal love, specifically the absurd notion that capitalists and lenders can be reached by appeals to their better nature. He's saying all of this to his good friend and dependable comrade Friedrich Engels, whom the show has established is a factory manager and was moved to become a Communist because witnessing the plight of the working poor appealed to his better nature.  Lest you feel I'm being a bit hard, I personally agree with the criticism of Kriege, it's just that The Leader is just giving out mixed signals in its incompetence.  Last but not least, there's the case of Pierre Proudhon. Engels gives Marx a copy of his Proudhon's new book Philosophy of Poverty. While Marx is holding the book unopened, two random people start throwing out snippets of Proudhon's beliefs. At which point Marx still holding the unopened book starts ranting about Proudhon's ""Petits-bourgeois"" socialism and declares he will write a criticism called Poverty of Philosophy. It was at this point that I wasn't sure whether some of the instances of self-sabotage were deliberate or not, Marx did write Poverty of Philosophy as an attack on Proudhon, and for many years it was considered a masterpiece in Marxist criticism.  Until people started reading Proudhon's book, where it was discovered that many of Marx's criticisms were incredibly inaccurate if not made up.   **Propaganda**   AKA, the reason this was really made. The Leader isn't really supposed to be an educational text, its made to capitalize on Karl Marx and use his legacy to legitimize the Chinese Communist Party. The CPC fully supported the creation of The Leader, particularly the Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League and the Central Office for the Research and Construction of Marxist Theory were involved.  It was made and released just before the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx's death, and the first speech Karl Marx gives on the show “Reflections of a Young Man on the Choice of a Profession” was also chosen as an extract for Xi Jinping's speech commemorating the 200th anniversary.  “If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually be at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.”   Even the titles for the episodes sound like they were taken from propaganda posters  1. Different Youth 2. Defending the Rights of the People 3. New World View 4. Scientific Socialism Shines Brightly 5. Great Work Das Kapital 6. First International 7. Marx Forever  The name of the series The Leader isn't exactly subtle. But in case you didn't get it the last part of the final episode really drives it home. The ending credits are a timeline of key events in Marx's life, except for episode seven. In that episode, the timeline is replaced with a history of Marxism-Leninism, through to the present day in the People's Republic. Complete with a narrator praising Mao Zedong, then Deng Xiaoping then the Three Represents and then finally Xi Jinping.  Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese Characteristics together will bring the people forward into a new era for China   The intention is, of course, is crystal clear, Karl Marx is the indisputable leader of Communism, and the CPC is the heir to Communism, and so it is the heir to Karl Marx.  There is some attempt to justify this posture though, in an early episode Marx is absolutely indignant at the oppression of peasantry by the landlord class, and the Paris Commune is criticized for not having strong central leadership. Also, Marx did briefly talk about the importance of theory adapting it to historical conditions and reality. Which the narrator echoes at the end by claiming that Maoism through to Xi is just the Sinification of Marxism.  I also think though this is speculation that the propaganda potential of the series is the explanation for its poor production values, especially in earlier episodes. The series premiered on the 28th of January, with an episode a week, meaning it ended roughly around the anniversary date. If the decision to make the series had come late, with the anniversary being the hard deadline it must reach, then that would explain why the earlier episodes are the worst with the most obvious time and cost-cutting. The later episodes which look much better would have had more time available to work on. But even in the last episodes, there are obvious signs of short cuts in some sequences.  **Conclusion**   I think The Leader is doomed to be a curiosity unless the CPC believes it was successful at propagandizing to the youth of China I can't see this experiment being repeated. Its a shame but I don't recommend it, it's not without its charms, but the combination of animation issues, shallow information, and propaganda distortions -and there were many more examples I could have listed- leave this as something best avoided.  Which is a shame, as I don't believe the idea of an animated series is without merit, the Manga adaptation of Capital was largely a success, the films Young Karl Marx and the West German film about Rosa Luxemburg were very informative and interesting to watch, and historical drama is becoming increasingly common and more refined. If the CPC didn't cobble this together to meet its targets and it was allowed artistic freedom it could've been something great. For all its faults the final episode was quite good so the people doing the actual work of making the production seem to have been capable of doing good work.  * Incidentally this same episode covers the revolutions of 1848, during which time many of Europe's bourgeoisie eventually allied with their despotic aristocracy to destroy the more radical workers and student revolutionaries. So it seems like Wietling was largely correct on that point but this is never addressed.";Not Recommended
0;Line Offline: Salaryman;DanVS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DanVS;9;"Hello, peoples of the anime forum, I am Hedo and this is my very first review on the site.  Story:  If you're a fan of the long drawn out stories with back stories, adventure and romance. Then this probably isn't the anime for you. If you're like me, a simple otaku with simple tastes for nice slice of life anime where the plots are simple and easy to follow, then you have certainly come the the right place.  each episode is maybe a four to five-minute short about the office life of Moon and his friends. Office humour for everyone! I was pretty taken with it I must say, since this is the kind of thing I tend to go for.  Though I did feel a somewhat longing for more. I feel I would have been happier with a proper twenty-something minute long episodes. But that's not how it rolled and because of that I'm only going to give story an 8. That sounds fair. I think. Hope..  Art: This is where some people might be put off of this anime. The art is rather simplistic. But I don't know, it seems like recently a lot of the slice of life anime I watch seem to be using the same art style, almost like they could all take place in the same world.  I've kinda been feeling like I've fallen into a rut and it's gotten to the point where I'm starting to check out anime simply because they got an interesting looking art style, and that may or may not be the reason behind checking out this anime.  I did love the art style, it felt like a breath of fresh air for me.  though that being said, it might be a deal breaker for many. I'm gonna go ahead and give art a ten (*ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ Don't hurt me.   Sound:  That opening. Song. Was. Amazing. Not even kidding here. I could listen to it over and over. I've already downloaded it for my cell phone.  As for the sound of the overall show, I had no complaints with the voice acting, Though I guess when I first heard Connie's voice, the first thing I thought was, ""Well her voice sounds kind of generic.""  You know that female voice you hear sometimes at the end or start of an anime that's like introducing the sponsors or what not? Or the voices in some Japanese TV ads? It kinda reminded me of that voice. But that had only been my first impression of the voice. It was fine.  I'm going to give sound a 9. I really did love that OP. Like oh mah gawd. On repeat for hours. You know, even if you don't check out the anime you should most certainly go for that OP. Like seriously.  Character: I wouldn't say any of these characters were properly developed. Though at the same time we do get to know them and they are interesting characters.  But that being said, none of these characters seem to grow or change through the series all that much. They pretty much are who they are.  Rating 4  Enjoyment: I think it's clear at this point that I seriously loved this anime, I was watching the episodes up one after another I liked it so much. So I'm giving enjoyment a 10.  Overall; Sure is had its flaws, but it really wasn't going out there to be this big epic anime. It was clearly meant to be a fun little thing to watch while you kill some time. And it managed that very well.  I'll give it a 9.";Recommended
0;Lime-iro Senkitan;skyrender;https://myanimelist.net/profile/skyrender;3;"Lime Colored War Tales is what you would end up with if Strike Witches was made by a group of teenaged boys. It is the embodiment of a pure harem ecchi anime, but not in a good way.  Though this is a horrible show, I will admit that I found the characters to be endearing and interesting and that I enjoyed their interactions (at least, in the comedy scenes) and the histories given for each of the characters. With such a terrible plot, it's a good thing that much of the show focuses on the characters and their pasts, because I found each of the girls in the LIME unit to be likable by the end. So if I like the characters, why would I hate the show so much?  The first thing to point out is political but I still find it uncomfortable. The story of LCWT takes place during the Russian-Japanese war that started shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Of course, the events that take place in LCWT have nothing to do with reality, but I still find it unsettling that the heroines are fighting in a war that Japan initiated (in real life) with a _sneak attack_ against a Russian harbor city. (That is, launching an attack days before a formal declaration of war.) And the LIME unit in LCWT is taking ""the fight"" to a Russian fortress. I'm not suggesting this show is politically motivated; the commander of the LIME unit is fighting to end the war and for peace, but it's still about invading Russia.  Okay, most of you probably don't care about stuff like that. What else makes this show bad? This is a harem show that has a male protagonist, who is unlikeable at best, who becomes the target of the affection of every girl around him. This is par for the course for harem shows, but the girls don't just have crushes on him-- no, _every single person on the ship with two X chromosomes_ inexplicably and desperately wants his man meat, from nearly the moment they meet him. His students, the female doctor, the female demon, even the triplets who are too young to ride the spinning cups at Disney World. I enjoy ecchi romantic comedies, but there's no _romance_ in this show. It's only romantic if you have the same sense of romance as an unfixed dog.  Perhaps it's plot holes or unexplained circumstances that do it for you? Well, this is a show about going to war, so of course there are battles. The battles are performed using spiritual warriors summoned by the girls, on both the Japanese side and the Russian side. Yes, the Russians have their own spiritual beings, and their female soldiers all dress like they work the red light district. And for some reason, they can _fly_. Yes, all of the Russian soldiers in this show can _fly_. How?  Magnets.      (Not really.)   Additionally, the Russians can use magic. This isn't too odd since the shinto girl, Kinu, can cast curses and often uses Japanese voodoo dolls throughout the show for various things. But here's what they don't explain. On the Japanese ship, there is a demon in the form of a young girl who protects the ship and enables it to fly. Okay, fair enough, it's Japan. But the Russian commander is able to use magic _that the demon can't discern_. She's a a supernatural being, but convienently useless most of the time. And yes, she wants the protagonist's man meat too.  The crime in this show is that it does have some good points. As I said, I enjoyed the character development and felt that was better than average for a half-season harem ecchi comedy. But it also has some decent, emotional, well-conceived (if not well-written) dramatic scenes. The comedy scenes are also quite funny and the interactions between the girls are great. But I don't think it's worth sitting through the rest of the show to see.  Oh, the protagonist does have one special power. If he sleeps together with a girl, she'll feel better. ... ... ...";Not Recommended

Here's my scoring + related comments for this masterpiece:  Story - 4  Ok so uh... I think i already covered this part, cheesy plot is cheesy. Most of the time what you see makes no sense unless its story covering the background of a character. Which might make some sense, the afterwards effect of the background story will leave you a ""lolwut"" taste in your mouth. Because it is that cheesy, really.  Art - 5  I highly dislike the artwork from these old animes, i guess mostly because they are outdated, reminds me of trigun, except trigun was awesome.  Sound - 4  Sound effects, like... honestly. What the hell. Overused sound effects for everything, some sound effects aren't even related to what is currently happening like the sound of steel hitting the floor when throw and the sea, then all of a sudden you hear a splash sound like as if it was thrown at the sea, which is confusing.  Character - 4  I think this is the only (somehow) positive side from this anime, they aren't entirelly bad but neither are they entirelly good.  Enjoyment - 2  The only enjoyment i had throughout this anime where the many random ""lolwut"" moments, and the fact that once i finished all 13 episodes, there was a small clip confirming the continuation of the anime. Which then i googled to make sure if there was a 2nd season, to which i found out to be the truth, i started laughing alot for a good 2-3 minutes. Which is the reason why i'm even writting this review  Anyways, time to watch season 2 (LOLQUE?) of this wonderful one of a kind master piece. I hope i can last another 13 episodes of this insanity.  I'll write another review for the 2nd season in its proper page, lets see if i can make it there today(03/03/2016). If you see no reviews from me there, i must likely went insane on my way there.

0;Lime-iro Ryuukitan X;Bluemilk92;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bluemilk92;6;"After noticing that this show had no reviews, I felt weirdly obligated to watch it and take notes and write one. I've always tried to keep these short, so I'll do my best to give you the info you need to make a decision.  First, this show is, to 90% of the Anime community, a total dumpster fire. This is something that is only going to hold appeal to true Harem-disciples like me. Even then, this is where you turn after you've seen all the good stuff. If you're desperate for a new Harem show (""Oh how could you run out, aren't there a billion?"") Bitch, I ran out, some of us do suck enough to pull it off. Those like me are going to be the only people with a reason to watch the show.  It really is as basic as it gets. Half of the first episode has the MC run from the left screen to the right, while screaming his head off. The introduction of our female characters, is essentially them professing love to our hero one by one while alone in empty rooms. The women then fail to repel a threat until our hero shows up and instantly saves them all, and single-handedly drives away the enemy. Awesome.  Here's the thing, it does actually follow through with what you expect from a Harem tag, which isn't always the case. Still, because it also tries to be an action show at the same time, it doesn't really pull off either. It's not until about 7 episodes in that we get actual conflict between the girls, over our MC.  It does spend some time developing our female characters, but it really is bare bones. They do just enough so that you can tell the difference, and maybe even pick a favorite.  As far as funny moments, there are only two that I can think of as genuinely funny. The action is passable, but it's often ruined by sub-par sound design. The hits and explosions kind of fall flat, you don't really feel any impact.  So, should you watch this show? Well, it's as cookie-cutter as a show can get, and I'm talking plain sugar cookies. Still, I like cookies, and if you've eaten everything else on the table, this show is at least edible.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lime-iro Ryuukitan X;carnage_panda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/carnage_panda;3;"As a true ecchi fan I didn't really bat an eyelash when this came up on my random spins for the week of anime I was watching.  While it does earn it's rating as the girls do expose their breasts in the earlier episodes it quickly moves away from that into a show about combat.  The premise of this show is sort of what if the cast of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure were all women and were a harem that fawned over a male protagonist. Said male protagonist doesn't have much dialogue, instead electing to scream at the top of his lungs most of the time. When he does speak, the words usually involve a variant of ""I'm a man."" This truly groundbreaking commentary is usually followed by some Tom & Jerry antics.  I had to turn my brain off during the first episode as the male protagonist, Inukai spends the great majority of it screaming while a super repetitive piece of music plays, which I believe to be his theme. There's not many tracks at all for this show either. Maybe two or three. And the sound design is awful. I was about to drop it after the first episode, but what really sold me on watching this show was that the guy transformed into a mech and shot laser beams out of his nipples while screaming MANLY ATTACK. I knew at that moment that this show was going to be so bad it would be good, and it did not disappoint.  I would encourage anyone that watches this show to pay top dollar for it.

0;Lily C.A.T.;Colonelfancy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Colonelfancy;7;"Lily C.A.T. is a pretty cool slice of classic sci fi/horror from the 80's, and not just in anime, but directors that want to dabble in the horror genre can learn some small, yet vital points from this; the less your audience can understand from your monster, the scarier the creature is. And by that I mean, this blood-thirsty creature can't be reasoned with. It's out to kill you, and that's final. This is one of the essences of true horror. Granted, there are better offers in this genre in terms of quality and production value like Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku, Lily CATs appeal is that it's closer to a desperate struggle of survival from civilians as opposed to battling the supernatural on questionably equal grounds. It's like an anime incarnation of John Carpenter's The Thing right down to the monster's method of stalking prey. All it was missing was Kurt Russell pooring beer into a computer game and calling it a ""cheatin bitch"". The set up for all of this makes it a hybrid of Alien and the aforementioned film; a select group of humans have been incubated for 20 years (with a halted metabolism) while the ships computer indicates a rouge bacteria has made it's way in. This sets up for the slow build towards the monsters apperance. The cast of characters is pretty darn good, even if some of them are certified monster chow, and even if they come off a little under-utilized, I don't think it matters much as far as the conflict goes. They're pretty likable and work when neccesary and personalities aren't forced down your throat. In fact, I was rooting for as many as possible to make it out of there. Now, back to the monster: If there is one thing that the mid to late 80's era of anime can do well, I mean REALLY well, is monsters, aliens, and demons. The indeterminate mass of the beast kept in the shadows, the tenticles, the rows of sharp, serated teeth, those 80's creepy crawling sound effects. The anime monsters of the 80's were some of the most horrifying, vicious, freakish hellspawns I've ever seen with nothing but rows of teeth and a bad attitude, and this monster didn't disappoint. IN CLOSING: Lily CAT is actually pretty good and holds it's own well against some of the big budget heavy hitters of it's time. It was released in a time when sci fi and horror were at their zenith, and if you're a fan of classic anime or survival horror, this won't disappoint. Don't let it's age or obscurity fool you; Lily CAT is a buried treasure that any fan could appreciate.  STORY: 7 ART:7 SOUND: 7 CHARACTERS: 8 ENJOYMENT: 8 OVERALL SCORE: 7 out of 10  PROS: Very well written, Visuals are pretty great, decent cast CONS: English voices are kinda cheesy, deus ex machina near the end there";Recommended
1;Lily C.A.T.;CinemaBulb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CinemaBulb;8;"Once you start up Lily C.A.T. it is immediate what this film is paying homage too. Or, rather, ripping off? I don't want to be that cruel, but it is pretty obvious this is taking straight from the 1979 sic/fi classic, ALIEN. However, if you are a fan of science fiction all together Lily C.A.T. is worth a watch mostly for its aesthetics. It is a cool looking movie, not just because it look like all those 80's cartoons I use to watch (I was getting X-Men The Animated Series vibes hardcore from the look and designs of the characters) but also the way the ship looks and sounds.  The plot of the film is very basic. A group of space goers who are looking to mine off shore planets for possible habitation are put into a frozen cryogenic sleep. When they awake it is soon realized that something is loose in the ship. An alien disease that infects the hosts and completely melts them away. It moves fast and it doesn't stop until all life forms are consumed and soon, one by one the passengers look for a way to get off the ship and away from the parasite once and for all.  So yeah a basic plot, but I enjoyed it very much and with a running time of 1 hour and 20 minutes it does;t take up too much of your time. The characters are all stereotypes for the kind of story and thus don;t have much to contribute in terms of full development, but are more just pawns for the narrative. The dub is also pretty hysterical and cringe at times. But for a rainy day time killer it's worth it.";Recommended
2;Lily C.A.T.;stmwg01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stmwg01;8;You'll find a classic science fiction mystery in this anime wrapped by poor art, great characters and an overall enjoyable movie. Recommended for anyone who likes classic science fiction and space mysteries.  Lily C.A.T. is a great example of a classic science fiction and horror crossover. The story line is pretty simple but keeps you wondering throughout the entire movie. It's definitely a story I've seen played out in other similar works, but my no means does it feel boring.  The art is it's weakest point, being decent at most points throughout the film, but at times being downright dreadful.  Sound is dated, but doesn't feel out of place for a film form the 1980's. It has that classic 80's sci-fi audio that can be campy now, but is found in many films of the same genre in that era. English voice acting was good.  I think the characters were well developed and all felt unique. The mystery that plays out between them felt appropriate for a sci-fi thriller.  Overall, I enjoyed Lily C.A.T. a lot despite it's bad art and animation. The story is not necessarily groundbreaking, but a great example of classic science fiction. I recommend to anyone who likes science fiction and space mysteries.;Recommended
0;Lily C.A.T.;ArkonBlade;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArkonBlade;5;Good premise but not well executed  This anime was heavily inspired by The 70s movie Alien and The 1982 version of the Thing. Which should make it an awesome anime as those movies are really great. Sadly It misses the mark. While it borrows those cool ideas and even art style. Its heavily lacking in what makes those movies good.  The anime does well in its pacing and quickly sets things up and gets going. Its only a little over an hour long so it moves pretty swiftly. To swiftly in fact. We dont get much for alien interaction or even much horror or much action.  The show spends a lot of time on a boring subplot of 2 people on the ship who aren't suppose to be there which might have been interesting if it effected the plot in any way but it doesn't and its just a useless add on .  We get very brief moments with the creatures and quickly move on. The story is pretty basic and much like I said is pretty much Alien in Anime form.  Music is ok and the VA is actually not to bad considering how bad it usually is from anime from the 80s and 90s.  The art style is pretty good but its borrowing its style from another movie.  Characters are ok i guess.  Overall not really worth your time. Its basically some one in Japan Loved Alien and The Thing and wanted to make an anime inspired by the two but really didn't know about how to go about doing it very well.;Mixed Feelings
0;Lily C.A.T.;Paraturtle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Paraturtle;2;Story: It's Alien in anime form, but it tries to set itself apart by having more character backstories and a weak moral theme in the second half. It's nothing special, and not nearly as intriguing as it could have been. It's also really predictable, as the title and early sequences essentially strip away part of the mystery.  When it comes to story telling, we don't even get five minutes into the film before it's telling us things out right through forced dialogue. A real shame.  The Captain was the only interesting character and the rest are potential canon fodder for the alien creature to munch on, which we never see. We also don't see very much of it either because we're constantly shown boring sub-plots that don't matter because we're expecting everyone to die anyway, so it's not even a good horror film where we get to watch the creature kill things. That is not to say horror films should just be glorified snuff, but if a movie fails to have any compelling characters or themes, then it sure as hell be fun to watch - which this wasn't.   Audio and Soundtrack: I enjoy an orchestrated soundtrack in horror films. It was neat to hear piano, and an absolutely beautiful and compelling track during the opening credits. What I don't like is different genres jumping around on me. Orchestration to some electronic to rock and roll. It's overbearing and pulls you out of the immersion. Songs are cut short at awkward moments as well, which pulls you out again.  The audio is nothing special. It works. It's got a retro feel to it.   Animation: Not very good. There are better animated films that were released in the 80's. None of the perspective shots are scary, and most of the time I wondered why I was being shown hallway after hallway with a different color pallet. I understand it's on a ship, but a ship has different locals. Maybe a hall with windows? Perhaps the sleeping quarters, kitchen, entertainment room, bathroom??  The creatures animation was pretty neat. I wish more scenes were shown with it. If so, the film would have been much more enjoyable.   Final Thoughts: I said I'd watch it last October but forgot. That's the only reason I picked this up. From what I've come to learn, most horror anime aren't very interesting and fail to be scary. I don't think I can even say that I enjoyed myself while watching this. I've kicked the habit of looking at my phone when watching films/shows, but this one had me pull it out once or twice because I was so bored.  However, the film isn't offensively bad, it's just boring. I can't say I'd go so far as to NOT recommend it to people, but I won't say anyone should watch it, either.

1;Lily C.A.T.;Creator_Kun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Creator_Kun;4;"Lovers of all things anime will appreciate everything the art form has to offer and will not only rejoice when a series is absolutely stunning, but will also prepare themselves to derail and destroy the series that are absolutely dreadful. Of course, I'm being subjective, because whether you've seen every anime ever or maybe one type of anime, you are an anime lover. If you've seen this anime, you are a disappointed anime lover...  *SIGH* Enough brooding. One of the worst anime original home videos that exists in my opinion is Lily C.A.T.  Lily C.A.T. is a science fiction/horror anime OVA from the ripe age of horrible anime like this one. The film follows the spaceship on a 40-year mission. Under the instructions of an unknown force (that remains unknown and is never address again throughput the entire anime) the ship's A.I. computer system accidentally introduces an alien bacterium into the ship while its human crew is in cryostasis. Naturally, both the ship and the unknown force want to eradicate the bacterium from the ship but also to cover up for this blunder. And that's what sets the plot into disarray.  You have a misfit crew that doesn't get along at all and only wants to look out for their own selfish goals and they are attacked by man-killing bacteria that took over a cat. You can already see it coming. The story is typical horror; the mysterious, scary, evil pursuer picks off the crew one by one. The alien wants the humans dead. But that's not too bad, it's mundane, but typical horror, but so can still keep watching.  But when you look at the characters, things start to get much, much worse. My main gripe with the characters is that not one of them, except the obvious couple, Hiro and Nancy, get along. Not one of these idiots. It's as if the writers made them forget that a dangerous, life-erasing bacterium is gunning for them, and they need to work together to survive. Then there's Hamilton, who defines the meaning of determination so hard, it has to be seen to be believed. It's very... BAD! None of the characters were in their right mind. In my eyes, characters as simple-minded as the ones in Lily C.A.T. deserve to be food for bacteria. Hamilton chases Hiro for pride, Hiro comes out of the blue as a murderer without any evidence that he was beforehand, and a complete lack of any backstory to boot, Nancy acts like a schoolgirl for almost the entire anime, Hiro comes off as a bad stereotypical stoic, Carolyn is awful, and for one member of the crew, it's so obvious he's not gonna make it, you consider him dead meat right after his first speaking line. It's all pathetic. One more thing, Guy is the only black male in this crew. His position like other characters that weren’t the cop, the heroine or the lead males Hamilton and Hiro was debatable, and that says enough on its own.  The sound is of a typical, outdated film type. The 80's muddled, low sound effects, the cheesy 80's music, even the characters wear clothes from the 80's IN A STORY SET 40 YEARS IN THE 23RD CENTURY. Damn. The dub is awful as well.  If it isn't a secret by now, Lily C.A.T. delivers a crushing, gut-wrenching, horrible experience for the viewer. It contains your fan service-like but action girl and the blood and guts that defined those ovas of the time, complete with a sub-par, but passable plot that is ruined by unsettled characters and holes that pop up in pivotal scenes (Pay attention to the background check interviews and Hamilton himself-- Believe me). To top it off, in order to screw with the viewer more there are two things from an actually good horror movie, Alien, that Lily C.A.T. adapts. Not going to spoil it or the ""ending"" as some might call it, but these elements that Lily C.A.T. graciously and proudly copies only complicate the story even more. It's almost a guaranteed re-watch to understand what is what and which is which, but this anime is not even worth the first time you see it-- it's a mediocre, gory, bloody, confusing mess. Its enjoyment factor is destroyed by its horridness and I'm dead serious. When Lily C.A.T. isn’t boring me in the opening, or disgusting me through the “jump scares” (they suck, really), it’s killing me throughout because it’s a painful, confusing and pointless mess. The characters even lampshade how pointless it is in the anime. I apologize for this drawn out review, but it’s better than wasting an hour watching the anime itself. Friends of mine have praised this series and call it a great horror anime. Some even claim it is an obscure buried treasure. The only place I want Lily C.A.T. buried is in the bottom of my crappy anime basket pile, never to see the light of day again.  Creator_Kun's Score Story: The beef of my review; The story is typical and even disoriented and confusing (3) Art: Nothing bad, nothing to get an eye-gasm over. Gore-galore. (6) Sound: Bad, but it was the late 1980's. This is the one area I can't rip Lily C.A.T. because it's not its fault. The English dub is god-awful and poorly acted. (6) Characters: Gosh... (4) Enjoyment: I shake my head when I try to think of enjoyment an d Lily C.A.T. going together. (2) OVERALL: 4- Bad. I grace Lily C.A.T. with a blissful “4” rating. I recommend you stay away from this anime. If you really liked ""Alien"", give it a 6. Otherwise, don't bother.";Not Recommended
2;Lily C.A.T.;Rain_Feather;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rain_Feather;1;You remember the late 80s-early 90s era of anime- it was first catching hold over here in the States, and they were putting everything they could get the rights to on tape and sold for $30 a shot. This, well... is one of those titles that should have been skipped.  It's just... terrible bad. You can tell it's early anime- the voicework is crap, the animation isn't really worth anything, and the music just seems to fade in and out.  It's pretty much just your bog-standard space-monster story- alien bacteria infiltrate a colony ship and end up eating 90% of the crew, starting with a pet cat that was brought onboard. In a fairly cringeworthy moment, you get to see the cat ripped apart and dragged through a hole in the wall while its owner watches and shrieks.  I'm not going to lie-after this crapfest was over, I spent some good quality time with my cat- and lamented the hour I just spent watching this horrible piece of trash and cleansed my palate with loads of funny cat videos to get the thought of this movie out of my head.  Lots of your characters are national stereotypes- the obviously American member of the crew is a musclebound jerk who carries a gun everywhere, for example.  If you absolutely have to watch this, at least it's only an hour, and then you can move on with your life and watch something else more worth your time.;Not Recommended
0;Lie Huo Jiao Chou;banichan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/banichan;9;Story: This story was a classic Priest novel type, but with an interesting modern twist. I'm invested! I want to know what happens next and get more into the details of the past of the two main characters and how they're connected.   Art: The animation is quite nice for CG, and the faces are stylized in a unique way. The backgrounds are beautiful.   Sound: Good! Well fit, nice OP/ED.   Character: I saw another review describe it as classic red/blue characters, but I don't /entirely/ agree. It definitely has some vibes in that direction, but red ends up being smarter than your average red, and blue ends up being, uh, pointier than your average blue. There is also a distinct vibe of there being more and more to uncover about both of them, each time we learn something new.  Also...I kind of love the various random side characters, particularly the boss and the various team members. Even the villain characters were pretty interesting, and often didn't go the way I expected.   Enjoyment: Honestly, my recommendation is not to get too deep into danmei novels if you want to enjoy the anime adaptation. I keep seeing people complain about adaptations being not faithful enough, or rushing the pacing when compared to the book. The thing is, if you haven't read the book or don't have a deep attachment to exactly how things are there, then the series tend to be quite enjoyable.  While there's not much by way of outright romance, this was likely never intended to be romance-focused anyway. Priest tends to write more story-focused novels, rather than specifically romances. The important thing here is that the two main characters have a lot of interesting tension and history and interactions, which is imo is better for establishing a pairing people will enjoy than any hand-holding/kissing scenes. I was actually pretty invested in these two by the end of S1, but then again my romantic sensibilities are a bit skewed away from typical romance elements.    Overall, I really liked this show, and my wife liked it even more! Hoping to see a season 2 announced at some point.;Recommended
0;Lie Huo Jiao Chou;b3an0d1ng;https://myanimelist.net/profile/b3an0d1ng;5;SPOILER FREE! Drowning Sorrows in Raging Fire, one of the latest Chinese anime licensed in the West by Funimation, is a mixed bag of a show. A very mixed bag.  Firstly the story. I'm not gonna summarise it here, you can read the synopsis yourself. What I would say, is that the first two or so episodes are superb as far as story goes. It's thrilling, engaging and very interesting and novel. Characterisation is good and the scene is set very well. Then, it goes meh. Very meh. It turns into a standard generational revenge story and the characterisation stops there. Not much can be said otherwise. It follows a rather boring habit of donghua of relying entirely on very long flashbacks, which I was not necessarily a fan of.  Art! This show really excels here. As far as CGI donghua go, this one decided to follow a style mimicking standard 2D animation. However, it didn't make the mistake of trying too hard to look like normal anime, as is the case often with Japanese CGI anime. Because of this, it allowed itself to be more fluid, use more CG elements, and really create an intense atmosphere through use of lighting and colour palate, and therefore stand out as a distinct yet well executed work.  Sound! Y'know what? This wasn't actually that bad. Not much to comment on aside from the fact that the OP and ED are way too loud compared to the average volume of the actual show. Just a little thing that can be fixed any time they want.  Characters. Ooh boy. This one's gonna be a hot take. First the two main characters. They follow the bog standard dynamic found often in donghua of silly, joking, and hot-headed guy bromancing with the cool, dynamic, and intelligent guy. Nothing at all stands out there. And now the side characters. What side characters? They exist, but they're not necessarily stand-out in the slightest. Many are simply introduced and ignored directly after for the rest of the show's runtime. There is however one character who I won't name nor specify due to risk of spoilers, who becomes a main character by the end. This guy (You'll know him once you see him) is entirely built on the flashbacks so it's very hard to feel that he is distinct in any way. He admittedly has properly developed motivation, sure, but he *is* his motivation. That's all he surmounts to.  Conclusion! My overall score is a five. Despite my complaints, it's not that bad. But it's not that good either. I'd argue the first two episodes are definitely worth watching, and maybe you're find more enjoyment than I did, for the remaining ten.  Thanks for reading!;Mixed Feelings

0;Liang Bu Yi;SnackO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SnackO;9;"This is easily my top favourite Chinese anime/donghua ever! I wish for more recognition!  My synopsis: A Chinese historical anime focusing on two people. One is the Empress and the other is the Emperor. Our Empress is a peculiar individual (hence why I absolutely love her!). Strong, passionate and kind of a dumb being. Our Emperor is quite cold yet intelligent and handsome who holds no other physical specialities unlike our Empress. She is the brawns whilst he is the brains. They switch souls/bodies and now are forced to live with each other's foreign lives.  What I absolutely adore about this anime/donghua: First I want to touch on the fact that I have read the manhua and goodness gracious it was amazing! Was so happy that this anime was announced and got released! My expectations was met both ways and it is truly enthralling! So now onto my explanation as to why I ""adore"" this series so far. The main concept of having both our Empress and Emperor switch souls is truly a fascinating subject. Ancient China was very hierarchical and even when you watch those dramas with the historical tag, you can clearly see how the hierarchy works. Our Emperor who has zero idea that his harem are having daily wars, witnesses and experiences the amount of suffering our Empress goes through. The lies and betrayal opens his eyes and slowly makes him appreciate his Empress a lot more, especially how she truly loves him. There is not much to say about our strong girl, other than the fact that she is only brawny and adds comedy to the series (particularly now that she is in a male's body!). So an Emperor who experiences the astonishing truth behind being a female in the harem really makes me go ""heck yeah! SUFFER and then love our girl"".  Note that the manhua and anime in my opinion are quite focused on the plot itself with a good amount of drama - your typical historical genre. Yes, there is romance but it is not a lot. I would say it is mostly comedy and drama. Do cherish the small scenes of our cute Empress and Emperor exchanging small gestures of ""romance.""  If you choose to read the manhua it is definitely worth it! The anime picks outs scenes that are most important so I can positively say you are not missing out too much if you decide to only watch the anime. Waiting for the second season and looking forward to how the rest of the story will play out! Much love to the creator of Liang Bu Yi! Truly a unique story that I will forever remember, re-watch/re-read and love!";Recommended
1;Liang Bu Yi;Bakkupakkun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bakkupakkun;7;If you're thinking of dropping it because of the animation, DON'T!  I'm usually a stickler for animation quality and have been unusually unhappy with these low frames per second donghua adaptations that have been saturating the market BUT this one is actually surprisingly good. Unlike most short duration episode donghua in which NOTHING happens in the majority of episodes, this one has great pacing and plot advancement episode-to-episode which makes this 24-episode adaptation feel like it was over too quickly and having you desperate for more. The relationship between the two protagonists is similar to Meng Qi Shi Shen (Cinderella Chef) and Tong Ling Fei (Psychic Princess) where the male protagonist of the tsundere archetype but they open up to the energetic, charming, and free spirited female protagonist. Although the plot elements may be predictable, the ride is still entertaining and fun especially during the comedy scenes where the animators swap to a more chibi-like art styles to drive the point across.  This adaptation has changed my mind on low frames per second adaptations. I'll probably stop brushing them off so easily and give more of them a chance.;Recommended
2;Liang Bu Yi;Mury0kush0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mury0kush0;8;No doubt in us is surprisingly heartwarmingly good!! First of all the artstyle and animation is so crisp and clear and secondly the voice actors were phenomenal. I was pleasantly surprised. As someone who isn’t very accustomed to donghua’s yet I felt very intrigued by it from the first episode. And it’s easy to watch as it’s just 10 mins per episode.  If gender bender is your thing then definitely check it out and if it isn’t then too check it out. An emperor and empress swap their body due to some spell cast upon them and it results in a hilarious mess. That’s not it as apart from comedic relief, there’s a serious story in the backdrop and the amazing thing is that they pull it off in just 10 mins per episode. The empress is so much stronger than the emperor and it was an eye candy to see her adept in martial arts and such. The romance element was fantastic too, made we wish for more moments between them..  Do watch it if you’re looking for a light hearted and chill historical anime. I hope the second season will be as good as this was!;Recommended
3;Liang Bu Yi;Byc33;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Byc33;9;This series surprised me in more ways than one. It's easy to assume the nature of this series based on the Comedy and Romance tags, but it really should have the Fantasy, Military, Action and Supernatural tags as well. All these aspects are quite well represented throughout the series, and it quickly became one of my favorite chinese anime to date, up there with the likes of King's Avatar.  The synopsis gives a pretty accurate description of the premise, so I don't feel the need to elaborate much more and risk spoiling anything. Instead, I'll just address the 3 main points that I think might prematurely turn some away.  1) Body Swap / Gender Bender This aspect of the series is extremely tastefully handled, with little to no cringe or weirdness whatsoever. The 2 main characters have complete opposite personalities and physical abilities, the guy is serious but has no combat ability while the girl is much more jovial but is an absolute boss on the battlefield. This lends itself very well to the concept of a body swap. The dynamic is so well portrayed that it becomes very endearing, and I found myself rooting for both their characters regardless of whose body they were in. The difference in gender roles is also explored quite extensively and is done so in interesting and meaningful ways.  2) Animation Quality This is not the typical bad quality animation that some chinese anime are known for. It is certainly different and may even feel somewhat choppy at first glance. But unlike most low quality, low fps anime I've watched, this one is very much done intentionally as a stylistic choice with no sacrifice to the actual fidelity of the animation. My eyes got used to it within minutes and I quickly started appreciating the beautiful art style and especially the cheeky style switching during comedic moments.  3) Short Episodes It does not feel short at all from a story density standpoint. You get all the plot you could ask for and more from each episode and there is plenty of great character development for both the main and supporting characters. With both seasons out, this makes for one heck of a bingeworthy series that leaves you feeling very satisfied when it concludes.  Overall this is a heartwarming tale of how 2 characters come together and fall in love, with a healthy dose of comedy and great action/fight scenes. Definitely recommend checking it out!;Recommended

The characters have great comedic timing. Also, the characters are diverse with different personalities & they carry them beautifully. The drama/storyline is also very interesting & doesn't bore you at all. The chemistry between the characters build slowly & steadily & flowers into a beautiful romantic climax.

0;Lian Qi Lianle 3000 Nian;ArkanoiD5786;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArkanoiD5786;9;The story starts strong with the protagonist being ultra powerful but being at a bottleneck with his cultivation. The story mainly revolves around this as his main goal is to get promoted to the next level. The comedy is pretty okay if you like silliness during fights. It is in 2D which is pretty rare for Donghuas but it is not really that great.  The anime is worth watching if u like goofy strong protagonists and comedy. There is a slight serious tone towards the end but it stays pretty comedic. The opening and ending songs are also really nice;Recommended

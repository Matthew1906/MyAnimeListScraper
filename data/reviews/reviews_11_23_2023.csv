This amazing one minute of my life was the birth of perfect harmony between music and art.  So simple, no real deeper meaning, yet so beautiful. The dramatic piano music was basically directing the simplistic art that just seemed to morph into interesting tiny stories.  One can't go wrong with watching this. You either hate it or love it but in the end the ONA is 1 minute long! So you'll either forget about the minute and move on or you'll treasure this one minute. I loved it. As soon as it finished I gave my laptop a round of applause - one (wo)man party here haha.  Anyways, just watch it - nobody really seems to know this ONA ut everybody knows trash like Utsu Musume Sayuri although I kind of liked that too. All I can say about it is - WATCH IT- it is a beautiful piece of art. I can't promise you that you will love it though but just try it out.;Recommended
1;◯;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;8;"Kabuki Sawako is a very strange person... quite the mad one if I happen to say so myself. This piece. ""◯"". Is just another one of her works that make you ask ""why?"". Your answer is, well, how would I know what goes on in her mind?  It's funny. A circle; the perfect shape, yet it has been used in such a vulgar manner. A juxtaposition? Perhaps. A realisation that one of the most common shapes can be simplified to the likes of the ludicrous sides of man? Probably. Just some fun with a shape? Most likely. Whatever the cause for this work was, we are welcomed with a ton of sexual imagery, some drug use and some normal symbols that all come down to the same thing, the circle.  It's a strange piece, that's a given, but it also opens up the many ideas that are within the endless line… what more can you get in this neverending sequence?";Recommended

So I guess that's why it's called ◯ (Do not mistake with The Big O, which is another anime)  It will take you just one minute, if you're bored and you like watching random animations on YouTube, you might like this.  The short was really unusual, probably made by someone high on a certain substance, but it is well animated nonetheless, although it's really difficult, if not impossible to make any sense of it; anyway, this won't matter much, you might as well appreciate the awesome piano piece in the background that synchronizes with the animation.";Mixed Feelings
0;◯;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate 3 No vocals art piece  story unclear if there is a story hidden or if this just to fuck with you (hahaha, inside joke). You have what appears to be random black and white clearly drawn events. I am guessing it is a take on the idea of a cycle. We eat, sleep, have fun, Fu*$ and repeat. Which would make sense with the symbol/second name circle.  Art Not as impressed. With art many things are happening. Humans have limited lines of focus. With color it stress what should be focused vs not. A pure black and white film loses that advantage. Also, the drawing could without a doubt been more detailed. Depending on a kid's ability in art they could drawn most of these pieces. I am talking about 6-10 year old.  Sound I loved the music choice. It really blended nicely with the fast paced art. From start to end.  character- not relevant  ending remark: this is a show with no clear direction. It forces the viewer to determine which direction it goes and why. If you like filling in the blanks for plots you will like this.;Not Recommended
0;ēlDLIVE;henkuku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/henkuku;7;"Seeing how its rating isn't exactly high, I thought I needed to justify just how good (or bad) this series actually is.  As most of you reading this might already know, this series was written by the very same author who brought us Katekyo Hitman Reborn. However, going into this series thinking and expecting it to match the quality of Reborn isn't the way to go.  elDLIVE is really just a simple, shounen series with not much complications regarding the plot or characters. Almost everything about it is as straightforward as it can get or, as some people would call it, predictable. But this doesn't necessarily mean it's not worth a watch, though. Despite the simple plot line, the episodes have a good flow to them and usually have a sense of continuity between them. This gives you the feeling on wanting/needing to watch on to find out what happens next, which I thought they pulled off decently well. Overall the series didn't feel that rushed, although I thought the ending did fall victim to that a bit. That said, the series ended on a decent note and was quite open, although I highly doubt a second season would come but it definitely has made room for a possibility.  The art isn't exactly extravagant, but it's appealing enough to make watching it comfortable. Simple art for a simple story. Because this series featured aliens and similar life-forms, character designs were rather interesting for this one. When I first saw him I seriously thought Chips looked an awful lot like Manaphy (Yes, the Pokemon). There's also a cat girl, a talking muscular crescent moon... It was just fascinating to see really weird characters all around. And also, not to mention the main girls (Misuzu, Veronica, Nina) actually looked pretty cute too.  If anything, the soundtrack of this series has to be one of its highlights for me. The OST composer is none other than Yasuharu Takanashi, who is the same guy who brought to you the soundtracks of Fairy Tail and Naruto Shippuden. So yes, great and familiar shounen music to accompany this series really worked well for me. Battle themes during the action, and slow emotional pieces during supposedly sad moments; it all fit well. They also had, in my opinion, one of the best EDs of the season. Not just in terms of music, but the animation during the ED was simply beautiful. Even if you don't plan to watch this series, I'd recommend you to just watch that ED.  If you had watched the PV, you'd have known that our protagonist Chuta had a terrible incident happen to him when he was young, and had been traumatized by it ever since. And then you'd think, a coward like him... becomes a space police officer?! Indeed, most of the series focuses on the growth of Chuta as a person. How he attempts to overcome his past fears, how he convinces himself that he is not actually a useless dimwit who always runs away in the face of adversity... through these 12 episodes you will see him change his perceptions. There are hardly any characters in this show who are worthy of being disliked (even the villains, because they hardly did anything horrible). Even though the focus is mainly on Chuta, Dolugh and Misuzu, over this series we are also wll introduced to the side characters like Veronica, Nina and Dr. Love. I particularly like Dr. Love's character, but that's just how I feel of course. Maybe you'll think differently of him... Seriously, though, which a rather huge cast it was always going to be hard to give every single character decent development, and I thought what they pulled off in 12 episodes was adequate for one to enjoy the show.  I actually really enjoyed this show over the course of the last 12 weeks. This was something I looked forward to at the start of every week. Right from the start, this series was never meant to be a super serious one. There was never going to be brutalities or cruelties. It's simply a light-hearted shounen series. If what you're looking for is a simple series which doesn't have a complicated plot, features decent action sequences and has a great soundtrack, then elDLIVE could be one for you.

1;ēlDLIVE;Shingster;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shingster;10;elDLIVE is based off the popular manga of the same name and is an action/ science fiction genre based anime. I have yet to read the source material that the anime is based on but after seeing how enjoyable this anime was I might consider reading it.  Story and setting The story of elDLIVE revolves around the life of Chuuta Kokonose a fourteen-year-old middle school boy that one day was found himself face to face with an alien and is recruited into an intergalactic police force called elDLIVE.  The story of elDLIVE revolves around Chuuta’s life as a middle school student as well as his career as an officer of the intergalactic force elDLIVE as he and his fellow officers work tirelessly to protect the planet from all sorts of aliens and invasions. For the most part the anime is largely set on the planet Earth to which Chuuta and his friends and fellow officers reside however the series does also take place on the large mobile HQ that is used as a command ship by the solar system bureau that Chuuta belongs to. In terms of story the idea of the main character being chosen to join a mysterious intergalactic police force that was unknown to them by the merit of the abilities that they never know that they had certainly was intriguing. The fact this force’s HQ was a mobile command ship that was located just over Earth was also another surprise. Arguably one of the more interesting aspects of the story was that Chuuta gets the chance to not just meet many different alien species but also to work with many of them as part of his career in elDLIVE. The fact that many of these aliens look like normal human beings was even more surprising.  Chuuta  Chuuta voiced by veteran voice actor Ayumu Murase is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 14-year-old second year middle school student Chuuta is an honest, hardworking and diligent person that tries to do his best in everything that he does. A firm believer in justice and second chances Chuuta prefers to use diplomacy to deal with cases rather than physical force. Since he was little Chuuta has been hearing voices in his head which eventually culminated in a rather tragic accident that had a long-lasting effect on his personality. However, this voice eventually become something that Chuuta never expected it to be and become one of the primary reasons as to why Chuuta was chosen by join the intergalactic police force elDLIVE. Personality wise Chuuta’s personality changes as the series progresses and his character is developed and improved upon after overcoming challenges both in life and with powerful adversaries. In the beginning Chuuta was an average teenager that got scared easily and was reluctant to be part of something that they did not understand or believe.  However, as the series progressed and Chuuta and his partner drew got more involved with elDLIVE and solved more cases Chuuta become braver, smarter and more willing to stand up to adversaries no matter how powerful in order to protect his friends and innocents that may have been caught in the crossfire. Chuuta also become rather good at performing investigations on his own being able to talk to potential witnesses calmly and kindly and trying to sympathize with them for the effects that the crime has had on them rather than asking them straight out. One notable trait of Chuuta is that he cares a great deal about the people around him whether they are friends or just people that he had just met and as a result Chuuta will always try his utmost to protect them even if it meant sacrificing himself for them.  All in all, I felt that Chuuta was a pretty good character as despite the weird situation that he found himself in he was able to adapt to the situation relatively quickly and from there slowly become both a better person and a capable officer within elDLIVE. Character development for Chuuta I felt was done reasonably well and it was nice to see him slowly get braver and become a better person as he gains experience from getting involved in cases. I felt that Ayumu Murase did a pretty good job portraying Chuuta.  Misuzu  Misuzu voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and the irregular at magic high school fame is one of the main characters of the series and the main heroine of the series. A fellow classmate of Chuuta’s and a fellow officer of Chuuta within elDLIVE Misuzu was sent to Chuuta’s school to observe him and judge whether he is appropriate for service in elDLIVE. Misuzu is a pretty, intelligent and hard working person and takes her job as a elDLIVE officer seriously. Personality wise Misuzu undergoes many changes as the series progresses though unlike Chuuta her personality can be considered to be the opposite. In the beginning Misuzu’s personality is cold, aloof and distant only interacting with those that she considers friends and viewing others with contempt. Her relationship with Chuuta at first was not the best first impression as she did not think that he was suitable for being an officer as she felt that he did not take the matter seriously and that he was rather childish in his personality. However, as the series goes on and after seeing how much that Chuuta has changed both in terms of personality and in nature Misuzu’s opinion of him started to change.  It’s not until one of the later story arcs that Misuzu’s opinion of him progressed to a point when she was finally able to place her full trust in him and accept him as a fellow officer of elDLIVE. The interactions between Misuzu and Chuuta I felt was well done as because they are both within the same division they more often than not are assigned cases in which they must work together to solve. In these interactions, we get to see not just how she investigates and deal with cases but also how she learns from Chuuta that she doesn’t hold in high esteem at first. More importantly we also get to see how Misuzu’s opinions of Chuuta change as she sees how much he has matured both in personality and in attitude. As with all members of elDLIVE Misuzu has powers of her own that are derived from the power of SPH which in Misuzu’s case takes the form of an angel like figure complete with wings. This form is only used when a peaceful arrest is no longer possible and really is a sight to see when she uses it. Overall I felt that Misuzu was a well-designed character and I liked how her opinion of Chuuta that she dismissed and loathed at first managed to change so much over the series in reflection of Chuuta’s own advancement and it was nice to finally see and hear Misuzu say to Chuuta that she now accepts him as a fellow officer. I felt that Saori Hayami did a excellent job portraying Misuzu.  Veronica Veronica voiced by veteran seiyuu and actress Riho Iida is one of the main support characters of the show. A fellow elDLIVE officer and a friend to both Misuzu and Chuuta Veronica is an criminal investigation assistant inspector and is the head of her own division within elDLIVE’s CID division. Personality wise Veronica is a hot headed, blunt and rather competitive with fellow officers especially to Misuzu. However, while certainly aggressive at times Veronica takes her duties as an officer of elDLIVE seriously and in a way, she is similar to Misuzu in terms of attitude. Despite being aggressive Veronica as bereft of her rank and also as the commander of her division is not an idiot as people might assume from her personality and can be surprisingly inquisitive and fast thinking able to quickly ascertain what had happened at a scene or get to the heart of the matter without having to muddle through useless chatter. As can be expected from a division commander Veronica is one of the show’s most capable combatants with her combat style emphasizing her long legs which means that her kicks are relatively powerful. Her style especially makes use of a number of acrobatic moves that considering her normal clothing that consists of a miniskirt does tend to make male combatants get distracted which is probably why Veronica uses it in the first place. Like Misuzu Veronica’s attitude and opinion of Chuuta changes as the series goes on with her being curious about Chuuta when they first met but later accepting him as a result of a rather large operation/battle in which he managed to get both her and Nina out and solving the case more or less by himself. I felt Veronica was a pretty well designed character and I liked the interactions that she has with Misuzu.   Nina  Nina voiced by veteran seiyuu Lynn of High school fleet and Fuuka fame is one of the main support characters of the show and is a fellow elDLIVE officer that assist Misuzu and Chuuta. A member of Nina’s Division 5 of elDLIVE’s CID division Nina also serves as Veronica’s partner after they were assigned to the solar system bureau. Unlike Veronica who has a rather aggressive and blunt attitude towards investigations and to others Nina is the opposite in that she is kind, soft spoken and has a caring personality. Nina, Veronica and Misuzu are old friends having all joined elDLIVE around the same time and as a result she is well aware that the two often clash on a number of things when they encounter each other. As a result, Nina often finds herself pressed into the role of a peacekeeper as she tries to stop these arguments. Of the pair between Veronica and herself Nina can be best described as the intelligent and rational one and she often admonishes Veronica when she gets too hot headed and aggressive during operations. Like all members of elDLIVE Nina also has her own abilities that she derives from her SPH which in her case takes the form of wind funnels that she can use to attack enemies with. Although not one to attack first in a combat situation Nina is no less a capable combatant than Veronica is and is capable of holding her own in a fight.  As a side result of her SPH powers Nina’s outfit that she changes into when she uses her powers changes into a rather revealing outfit which is a contrast to her personality. This usually causes Nina to become embarrassed when others especially Chuuta sees it which I found to be rather amusing. Like Veronica Nina did not bear any special feelings towards Chuuta at first as she like her boss was curious of the special rookie that was in the bureau that they had heard about even outside of the system. Like Veronica Nina’s attitude towards Chuuta changes and she eventually treats him like a fellow officer. I felt that Lynn did a pretty good job voicing Nina.  Dolough Dolough voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Kugimiya of Nabari no Ou and Full metal alchemist brotherhood fame is one of the main characters of the show. An alien of the rare Monitalien race Dolough serves as Chuuta’s SPH organ and thus forms a symbiosis relationship with Chuuta as they both need to exist for the other to live. Having grown up alongside Chuuta Dolough is perhaps Chuuta’s oldest friend and understands the pain and hardship that he has gone through in life which actually is a side effect of having Dolough living inside him. The relationship between Dolough and Chuuta is one of the main parts of the show and arguably the most important relationship that he has. As a result of their rather unique relationship Dolough relies on the good feelings and emotions that Chuuta feels and experiences in order to maintain his form and be able to use his SPH powers to help Chuuta. As a result, if Chuuta for whatever reason begins to feel negative feelings like anger, regret and others then Dolough would start to lose his form. While the bond between the two did not start off under the best of circumstances the bond that they forged soon began to improve as their relationship improved as the series went on improving not just Chuuta’s personality but also Dolough’s as well. Personality wise Dolough is a curious and inquisitive creature that can be described as being similar to someone of Chuuta’s age group. Dolough can also be surprisingly insightful being able to offer some valuable advice to Chuuta when needed. The bond and relationship that Chuuta establishes with Dolough I felt was done pretty well with both characters being developed as their bond improves.  One aspect of their relationship that I felt was funny was how Dolough and Chuuta make use of each other in attacks. In this case Chuuta actually visualizes the attack that he will use and passes this to Dolough through the link and allowing him to launch that attack. This I felt was a great use of the symbiosis relationship that the two have. Overall I felt that Rie Kugimiya did a pretty good job voicing the character of Dolough.   Laine  Laine voiced by veteran voice actor Tatsuhisa Suzuki of Owari no seraph fame is one of the main support characters of the show. The commander of the solar system bureau of elDLIVE and Chuuta, Misuzu and Veronica and Nina’s commanding officer Laine is a laid back, carefree and friendly person that nonetheless has great faith in his subordinates and allows them to pursue their investigations if they can be proven to be important. At first glance Laine may appear to be a lazy and carefree person that doesn’t take his role as branch commander seriously however beneath this exterior self-Laine is actually a smart, quick thinking person that can be quite scheming but not quite manipulative. He’s also shown to have a good grasp of both military tactics and space warfare tactics which is surprising from him. Despite his laid-back nature, Laine is not one that will give up easily and even when confronted by the most powerful of enemies or the most hopeless of situations Laine will always try the best way to get through it with the end result always surprising to both allies and enemies alike. I felt that Laine was a pretty well designed character that both cared about his subordinates and also considers the larger picture and his keen strategic mind was really a surprise to me. I felt that Tatsuhisa Suzuki did a pretty good job voicing the character of Laine.   Arts and animation In terms of art I felt that the environments that were shown in the series was well designed and colored and that there was a good variety of environments that the cast were featured in. The design for the bureau’s flagship and headquarters I though was pretty well done as the ship while not appearing to look like a warship had the firepower of a cruiser which I felt was important given that their role was to arrest criminals and enforce the law and not destroy them. The designs for the various alien species that were present in the show I felt was also another point that deserved praise as there was a large variety of aliens that were both beautifully designed and unique enough to stand out from among the others. In terms of character design, I felt that the series did a reasonable job as each character was alike in terms of uniform but at the same subtlety different in their own ways. One aspect of character design that I liked was the design of the uniforms that the members of elDLIVE wore for their day to day duties. In terms of animation I felt that it was crisp and clear and that the fight scenes both in terms of personal combat between the elDLIVE members and aliens and combat between spaceships was pretty well done. In particular, I liked the transformation scenes that happen as elDLIVE members activate their SPH abilities.  Music  The music for the series I felt was particularly strong with both the opening and the ending themes being especially good. Scene music also felt appropriate as well.  Voice acting  The voice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with Saori Hayami and Ayumu Murase who voiced the characters of Misuzu and Chuuta deserving some praise as I felt that they were able to portray their respective characters pretty well. I also felt that Rie Kugimiya, Lynn and Riho Iida who voiced the characters of Dolough, Nina and Veronica also did a great job portraying their respective characters.  Overall conclusion  Overall I felt that elDLIVE was a pretty well done and designed anime that had a great story, an interesting setting, well designed characters and solid voice acting. The premise that a middle school boy that had an alien inside of him being given the chance to join an intergalactic police force was certainly interesting. The subject area which in this case is to become a part of the intergalactic police force as an officer and from there protect the lives of not just normal human beings but also the lives of the aliens that have also made a home for themselves on earth was also interesting. In terms of story I liked how at first it made use of the normal villain of the week formula that is common to most animes and manga before slowly getting more serious as the villains become more apparent and powerful eventually culminating in their appearance near the mid part of the series. This type of slowly feeding in the main villains into the main plot was well designed move as introducing them too quickly would make the anime sound rushed and lower the dread that the characters would feel when they are confronted with them.  Character design and character development for the series I felt was pretty well done with the best examples of the former being the Chuuta, Misuzu and Nina and the latter being the personalities of both Chuuta and Misuzu and the emerging bond that the two forge as they began to accept each other. Voice acting as noted was particularly strong in this series with the seiyuu’s of Misuzu and Chuuta deserving some praise for being able to make their characters stand out.;Recommended
2;ēlDLIVE;jsmrcrzgrdl_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jsmrcrzgrdl_;7;elDLIVE ANIME REVIEW  elDLIVE revolves around Chuta Kokonose, our main protagonist, on his adventures of being an elDLIVE Space Patrol.  Honestly, I am saddened of its rating here in MAL. I am huge fan of Akira Amano since I finished watching/reading the Katekyo Hitman Reborn. And I was very hyped when this came out last January.  Like Katekyo Hitman Reborn, this series started very slow. I think this whole first season is all about character development, since it's only a 12-episode anime. I honestly want more seasons though that may be unlikely since only a few appreciated the anime.  The story started slow in the first few episodes but it delivered in the latter part.  The art is mediocre and it's unusual to see that type of animation. Though the soundtrack is very good especially that ending theme.  The characters look similar to Katekyo Hitman Reborn though some of the characters are aliens since it's an anime about space protection.  Overall, it's a fair anime to me. If you've endured the first 15-20 episodes of Katekyo Hitman Reborn, then you might as well give this a try. It's a slow starter but it will give you something to look forward for until the very end. And hoping for more seasons to make Chuta Kokonose more like Tsunayoshi Sawada.;Recommended
3;ēlDLIVE;shikiddo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shikiddo;8;"This is my first review ever so I'm just going to go with what the numbers say. Also, I am a huge Katekyo Hitman Reborn fan so this will be little you know...  Story = 8 - Very Good I watched a few shounen anime so this feels like the other shounen animes except that it has a Space Theme so that gives it something. Also, since this is just Season 1 and they didn't follow the manga on the last two episodes (They followed the manga from EP 1- 10), I'd say the characters are well introduced. As for further/deeper character backgrounds, I'm afraid I have to say this but read the manga if you wish. As for the story, they didn't reveal much but the whole ""We are space police, we protect the galaxy"" thing sooo... go read the manga if you wish, the plot thickens! Also even though they didn't follow through at the last two EPs, it's still well executed but it felt like the other shounen anime endings so there's that.  Art = 8 - Very Good As long as the art is pleasing to me it automatically gets a ""Very Good"" response to me. Though they have different art styles in the manga and in the anime, it still strikes a ""Very Good"" to me  Sound = 8 - Very Good I love both the OP and ED chosen for this anime, it's so fitting. As for the sound themes for every situation, fits fine for me. As for the voice acting, I'm not one to judge who gets to voice who but to me they sounded like what I imagined them to sound like when I was reading the manga (except for Dolugh, I imagined him sounding like a werewolf for some reason).  Character = 7 - Good Like I said, nothing much going on in the characters yet except for getting introduced. At least they showed Chuuta's little character improvement as the episodes pass. As for in the manga, character developments are great if you ask me. I like how they all improved there.  Enjoyment = 9 - Great One of your favorite manga gets an anime adaptation? Very Good! They followed the manga? Great! Woops, they didn't follow through in the end... Stay at ""Great!"" Seriously I think IMO, they should have followed through! The ending-cut in the last EP if executed well, will show the viewers that the plot thickens and they will want Season 2! Oh well! Also just in case, they have reached ALMOST the current chapter in the manga except for the last few chapters which where the plot thickens and will be (hopefully) Season 2. So if there's gonna be Season 2, it will take a while.  Overall = 8 - Very Good They should have followed through!!! Anyways, it's just Season 1. Like most animes, Season 1 is like the introduction of everything and the following seasons, if executed well, are the great ones!";Recommended
0;ēlDLIVE;Leegf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Leegf;4;How I made it to the end... I wonder... Okay, I'll tell you. Why I even begin to watch it? I've watched Reborn series in the past. I didn't like it. Once again, why I even begin to watch ēlDLIVE? Ah, yes, I know. That's because I'm very kind soul who's inclined to give people second chances so they can show they've became better. Yup. I gave such chance to the author. (Hope you would believe)  The story is so unique! It doesn't resemble Reborn's story in any possible way. Small chibi creature that helps main hero? No way you would find something so overused here! Non-confident main character who's the most kind and caring character ever? Nope, nope, wrong call! Some big organisations brawling with each other? Not here, nope! Bishie characters popping up here and there? Not happening again!  Art and sound are pretty mediocre. Nothing special save my admiration for the author's infinite capabilites at creating so various bishie characters which you wouldn't confuse with anyone else(you would, believe me)  Characters are outstanding, as you could already figured out from everything written above. Tsun... oh, sorry, I meant Chuuta is the great example to follow. Just do nothing, be no one, and then and only then some day would come for you to shine! Haven't you understood the deep idea of monitalien? Everyone has infinite powers within! You just have to believe in yourself! Oh, and I haven't seen such cute girl as Sonokata for a long while. She's the one of the main characters. Prepare for a surprise. Know what? She's... is... tsundere. Unbelievable, right?!  Had a lot enjoyment. Plot twists are unpredictable, characters are unique, everything's brilliant to keep it short. And I ain't sarcastic right now. (I am, okay)  Recommended to everyone who liked Reborn and seeks for something similar.  All right, that's how you should not make shonens.;Not Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;game8910;https://myanimelist.net/profile/game8910;9;"***I have decided to change the format of my reviews to provide more to-the-point ups and downs of the subject in review. I hope people like this new style since the old essay style reviews are tl;dr and just take too long to write. Anyways here is the first anime I'll review under this new format***  xxxHOLiC - Kei is the sequel to the first xxxHOLiC anime which is an adaptation of the CLAMP manga of the same name.  Story: + A great plot that leaves you wanting to know what happens next + Very deep symbolisms and philosophy are presented + A bigger focus on character development + An actual sense of continuity unlike the first season's more episodic format + Great mix of supernatural elements into a slice of life anime  - Fans who prefered the episodic format might be let down - Less freakish supernatural situations (in comparison) to the first season - Fans of the manga might be let down at the lack of references to Tsubasa Chronicles this far into the story.  Art: + Flawless animation + No quiality fluctuations throughout the series, solid and stable all the way + CLAMP art (for those who love it)  - CLAMP art (for those who hate it) - A little spoilerish but I wish they had kept ""a certain person'"" eye colours like they should have been  Sound + Very awesome soundtrack that fits the atmospheres perfectly + Very good use of the soundtrack making scenes more powerful + Great performance by all the seiyuu's they did an awesome job  - Watanuki's voice can get irritaring sometimes (but thats me)  Character + Yuuko is amazing....very deep and mysterious character that just makes you wanna know more about her + Watanuki, despite being annoying sometimes, is a great and likeable character + The rest of the cast both main and supporting are very likeable + Great character development that actually makes you care for them  - Watanuki's short temper irritates me sometimes (but thats me) - Mokona is also annoying  Enjoyment: xxxHOLiC - Kei was really an incredibly fun anime to watch, I just didn't feel like stopping, mainly because I loved the characters and the plot.  Overall: xxxHOLiC Kei is a great sequel to a great anime that is adapted from a great manga. But even as great as the anime is I highly recommend you read the manga since there is a lot of IMPORTANT material that was left out of both anime adaptations. If you like slice of life and supernatural animes, then by all means watch xxxHOLiC, its one of the best at doing both at once.";Recommended
1;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;doge_senpai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/doge_senpai;8;"Still creepy, still mysterious, still fascinating, and still cryptic, xxxHOLiC Kei is the follow up to the first Holic, bringing along with it a new raft of ideas.  The new season does many of the same things as the previous. There's more of the supernatural, more cultural insights, and more social commentary. Ghosts, spirits, and psychics all return en masse, escorted by Mahjong lessons and the depravity of internet media.  Kei almost did everything the first Holic did brilliantly. &quot;Almost&quot; because there was just one element I found lacking compared to the original. There was decidedly less of the extremely creepy vibes that resonated from the first Holic. I wanted Kei to have its scary moments just like its predecessor, but alas, there were none. (Of course this is also the most subjective opinion I have up here, so don't take it for granted.)  However, Kei did well in respect to bringing up some more social concerns just like the first season. One small example being the introduction of Watanuki's newest friend, Kohane. Through her, Kei gives another candid view of society and how the problem of prejudice affects people. Of course, this wouldn't be xxxHOLiC without more mind-boggling questions about fate, destiny, and choices. They're another integral part of the anime, helping to make the story even more compelling.  With respect to the plot, Kei started off on the wrong foot for me. The very first story arc seemed rushed, with too little preamble to make the flow natural. Yet in the overall scheme of things, it became clear that the individual episodes were once again the agents of character development. This realization made me appreciate how the plot was truly structured, and to other viewers, the slightly rickety pace will become clearer as the series progresses.  Hence, moving on into character development, it has to be said that there was remarkably more in Kei as opposed to the first Holic. True, Watanuki still performs his insane stunts of protest against Doumeki's stoic nature, and Himawari still comments that they're the best of friends. However, Watanuki does develop, changing the group's dynamic considerably throughout the course of the series. As for Yuuko... well, she's still a combination of a serious all-knowing psychic goddess and frivolous alcoholic, but that's just another one of the reasons I can't stop watching.  In the fields of art and sound, much of Kei is similar to its predecessor. People still have arms and legs that are a little too long, but the artwork still retains its great quality. Heck, even the food looks appetizing. It turns out that there were some differences in sound, but only with the opening song. It was a little more upbeat than the old one, and definitely retracted from the ominous ambiance. Other than that, I still considered it quite catchy.  Regardless of all of the above, I was glued to this show and couldn't let it go. I laughed at the comedy, shivered at the creepy parts, and felt sad whenever misfortune fell upon the characters (well, not really). Anyone who loved the first Holic absolutely must get their hands on Kei. And while they're at that, let's all keep an eye out for a third season.";Recommended
2;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;WanderAgain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WanderAgain;7;"XXXHOLIC KEI (XXXHOLIC Season 2) Rating: C+ (7.6/10) Episodes - 13 Worth Watching?: Watch season 1, then decide. Directed by Tsutomu Mizushima (of CLAMP) _ Aired in 2008  Welcome to WanderAgain's very biased review!  Story 2.2/2.5: Season 1 drew me in with it's entrancing portrayal of folklore and mysticism. This season did very little of that. Perhaps, it wasn't a mistake. Although the many magical layers of season one were one of xxxHolic's strongest points. Somehow, in some way, CLAMP managed to pull it away from that focal point and still do a great job. Kei was a more character-centric season, with minor magical elements mixed in. Much of it, interestingly, reminded me heavily of episodes from Jigoku Shoujo (Hell Girl). These episodes were surprisingly enjoyable, and even made me feel what little feelings I have left. What didn't amuse me, was the filler episode in the middle of the season. Who, other than xxxHolic, can get away with basing an entire episode on the game Mahjong? Literally, there is a Mahjong episode. Hardly any actual plot was completed in this episode. For a 13 episode series, I'm a little confused as to why they'd dedicate their resources to characters playing Mahjong. If it weren't for how enjoyable the main cast was, I'd probably be a lot more upset. But still, there's a Mahjong episode.  Art 1.6/2.5: In the case of xxxHolic, I both really love CLAMP and really hate CLAMP. For season 2 of xxxHolic, the art was terribly inconsistent. Most of the time, you were greeted by horribly drab backdrops that really didn't seem to fit with the rather unique character designs. However, on specific scenes, where some sort of important story element is brought to attention, the art is just phenomenal. Vibrant and magical, they highlight the true potential of CLAMP working with Production IG. This pains me, really; I would've like to see further effort into the everday scenes, rather than just a few poorly colored Japanese city houses.  Audio 1.4/2.0: I really enjoy the themes Suga Shikao has put out for xxxHolic. Perhaps it's personal preference, but I feel that the jazzy pop-ish techy groove style really fits the air of xxxHolic (specifically Yuuko). As for the audio in the show, it really didn't surprise me that they'd stick to the very friendly music from season one. Although I would've loved to hear some new content. It gets a bit repetitive at times.  Characters 1.9/2.5: Welcome back the screamy headed nerd, Watanuki. Thankfully CLAMP's efforts this time around seemed to focus on the relationships between each character, and their subsequent development. Watanuki's growth has been a slow burn that finally fizzles out in Kei. He and Doumeki undergo a time of change, and it's splendid. As for new characters introduced... Fantastic! A certain young female character blew my little mind in many different directions. She was wonderfully crafted, and well portrayed. There is however a flaw, too major to ignore. Himawari. Oh Himawari. You beautiful bastress, how they changed you so. Himawari's characterization in Kei was ridiculously poor. It was laid out so strangely and suddenly that I even question calling it characterization. Aside from this major disappointment, I also really miss the Warashi. Just a warning, our enticing duo get very little screen time. They were quite dynamic (or at least interesting) characters that were not fully explored in Season 1.  Bias 0.4/0.5: I love Yuuko. I really really do. Her outfits alone makes me love the show so much more. I can't get enough of that woman. I tell you what.";Recommended
3;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;johnbradshaw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/johnbradshaw;9;Xxxholic: kei is everything that its first season tried to do and failed miserably. Therefore, combining with the whole, it gave a huge step-up to xxxHolic series, made the ride of watching the anime is somewhat memorable.  By getting rid of its episodic nature, both the story and the characters got well-developed over a short period of time. The pacing is faster and the overall tone of the series is more serious than ever I would say. That's a great thing cause I was very annoyed at how comedy was played out in this anime, they're just too much and not even funny. I blame CLAMP for that.  And again, by developing the story, it cleared lots of mysteries that was presented in the first season. I also loved how the characters became more mature and honest along the way. It made me investigated in them and therefore raised the quality of following their stories.  The soundtrack is a plus. Fitting the moments with melancholic and dark songs. While I don't like how the characters in xxxHolic are designed, the animation gets a bit better than the first season.  XxxHolic is an anime of wasted potentials. Even though the second season fixed many of its problems, it couldn't reach the high of its successors in the same themes like Natsume Yuujinchou or Mushishi. Still a good anime though.;Recommended
4;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;Reviewholic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Reviewholic;7;xxxHOLiC started off as with an episodic formula. Although it showed almost no exposition to the mystery behind the core premise, it managed to introduce most of the important characters and established strong emotional bonds between them. xxxHOLiC Kei, is where the wheels start rolling. Instead of the previous relaxed episodic format, this sequel drastically transforms itself with a deadlier, serious tone and arc format. The main characters finally face true danger, despair and challenges that were subtly warned from the prequel. There were a lot of stakes and sacrifices, nailing a good depth in the characters' development. There are still some comedic and relaxing breathers in between to lighten up depressing mood. The pacing is perfect. Overall, it's a solid anime.  HOWEVER, there's still almost zero exposition on the main background. Along the series, it is obvious that the authors/writers are unwilling to reveal the core mystery and background of some characters, not exactly because it's too early (30+ episodes in), but because they haven't written or determined it yet. It's also closely connected to Tsubasa Chronicles which is shown in the later parts of manga and OVA, yet never really explained how they are connected. Plot holes are left unfilled for too long, and a decent completion would require unimaginable progress writing.  What a shame. xxxHOLiC has uniquely sharp character designs, elegant feminine traits and experienced drama writing. The anime also has amazing control of sound effect and music. But its overambitious crossover might be holding back the story too much. I enjoyed the anime so far, but I'm afraid its failure is inevitable.;Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;5;Quick Thoughts: The less episodic format led to improvements in some areas, but ultimately this season still suffers from many of the issues I had with the first season, like character designs and the repetitive interactions between characters.  Story: Instead of being mostly episodic like its first season, xxxHOLiC Kei is presented in loosely connected arcs 2-4 episodes. This should've helped by allowing more time for developing more in-depth stories and settings, but outside of one arc towards the end the arcs felt mediocre. The couple plot twists they attempted were too predictable, and most the new characters introduced weren't interesting enough to carry the story.  Character: I think they dropped the ball in their attempts to develop Watanuki's friend group. In the first few episodes it seemed like the relationship between Doumeki and Watanuki would develop past the very stale, one-dimensional interactions they would have in the first season, but their dynamic hardly changed. The end result is basically an ability that's used sparingly throughout the season. Himawari's development was strange and almost nonsensical, that's all I can say without spoiling. Even with these developments though, nothing really changed with their interactions. Watanuki's still unreasonably antagonistic towards Doumeki, and swoons over Himawari any times she's mentioned.  Enjoyment: I enjoyed just one arc, which was about 4 episodes. Everything else mildly enjoyable at best and boring/repetitive at worst.;Mixed Feelings
1;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;Animelover875;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animelover875;6;"Ahh, xxxHolic: Kei. A fitting sequel of the series introducing consistent plots, like ones about Watanuki's eye, Doumeki's grandfather, Himawari's true self, and more. What could possibly go wrong? Well, let's consider to start with that the season only has 13 episodes; this somewhat puts it on a timer to wrap up old plot threads, something that it honestly...doesn't really take the time or care to do properly. Most of the characters are still the same as they were, with Doumeki making Watanuki freak out and him gushing over Himawari still being consistent elements. Despite a hope that you know, some people may have hoped to actually develop their friendship. Some other storylines weren't really fully explained or seemed forgotten, like what exactly happened with Haruka. And other times, the story felt that somehow it was able to squeeze filler into it. Case in point: An episode that expects one to learn the moderately complex game of Japanese mahjong. Not something universally relatable in a story about spirits, nor even appropriately fitting into the theme. There were some good episodes, but it felt like some of this was old hat. The revelations surrounding certain characters led to some interesting results, and Kohane's storyline was gripping, if troublesome and full of unfortunate implications that weren't really resolved. If given more episodes to develop, I believe this could've made a great series, given a little more care put into the writing. 6/10.";Mixed Feelings
0;xxxHOLiC◆Kei;chinaboat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chinaboat;4;"First let me say I truly enjoyed the first season and the art is just as striking but Kei is a total waste of characters with tremendous potential. - Try this out: the rain sprite, the Ame-warashi, standard mood is bad but she always sees the good in people; the vestal sprite, the Zashiki-warashi, is innocent and virginal she lives on pure, as in virginal, energy and is very susceptible to evil energy; the beautiful human spider, Jorougumo thrives on that evil energy; almost all the other secondary characters are just as vivid and unique - and CLAMP doesn't do a damn thing with them. To top it off the lead female, Yuuko, could have been one of the great females in anime but they turn her from the super dominant, supernatural witch of the first season into an insipid drunk whose only purpose is exposition.  Almost every episode had the making of two or three story arcs. The writers of &quot;xxxholic kei&quot; seem to be the type who when asked, &quot;How did you like that elephant that just walked by?&quot; reply, &quot;What elephant?&quot;  To someone who watched all the first season episodes at least twice the second season is an insult.";Not Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC Shunmuki;Principal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Principal;8;"The xxxHolic Series is an excellent series about modern folklore, discussing a wide range of thought-provoking topics. The OVA does not disappoint either.  Story: Watanuki and Dōmeki enjoy meal and drinks with the fortune teller, where Kohane is staying. There, it's explained that everyone changes with every meeting they experience with others, and that all four there, and even Yūko, have changed from meeting Watanuki. Later on, Haruka and Watanuki meet in a dream, in which Haruka asks Watanuki to look for something in the temple's storeroom. However, as they look around, they might step into the realm within the books by accident... Also, Watanuki acts like he appreciates Dōmeki for once. In the 2nd part Watanuki and Dōmeki continue to search for the four items that Haruka requested. Watanuki unlocks a fifth item that leads to an encounter with someone close to him. Later, Watanuki vows to grant Yūko her wish  Art: Everything you could expect from the xxxHolic series is here and thank goodness there was still lots of WatanukixDomekixHimawari.  Sound: The Score is very important for a filim in the super natural realm and captures the reflective mood of the protagonists amicably.  Character: Yuko was the central character and with Watanuki his ""rival"" Domeki and his love interest Himawari the movie represents a glimpse at their life.  Enjoyment: The OVA although short at only 2 eps leads us to the dream of sorts but is the weakest part of xxxHolic to be honest, but that’s mostly because the others were simply that good. Mostly building up for future OVAs.  All in all it is still an awesome mystery-drama that even though it has nothing to do with the continuity, stands out with really imaginative visuals and very naturally evolves and lets the viewer guess what the heck is going on.";Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC Rou;8thSin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/8thSin;8;"OVA ""xxxHOLiC Rou"" is set 10 years after Watanuki's part-timer years in the anime series.  The story begins with Ghibli-evil-assimilation-like disappearance of Yuuko, whether a dream or reminiscence, we are not certain. Watanuki makes a promise that he will wait for her return, and that he believes dream will come true as long as he believes in it. Watanuki was the new master at the 'shop' when he opens his eyes. No longer a jumpy and clumsy high school kid, Watanuki has an air of authority and confidence. However, there's the same care-free atmosphere in the 'shop' with Maru, Moro, and Mokona running around the house, and his role as the cook has not changed. Doumeki is now an assistant professor at nearby university, but runs errands and goes on missions on behalf of the 'shop' (like Watanuki in his high school days), but still shows Watanuki no respect. From what I've read in Japanese blogs, the setting is similar to manga, except more time has passed. The story in ""xxxHOLiC Rou"" is about a request for a mission brought by Doumeki to find a hidden relic in an old mansion.  Animation has not improved much from the previous OVA, but character proportions are much more realistic compared to ""Kei"", and much easier on my eyes. Music was very nice, and effectively used to create the eerie and suspenseful mood in certain scenes. Voice acting, once again, is very well done. Although the technical aspects of this OVA definitely lacked the wow-factor, it was incredibly well-directed. The pace and the setting was clearly established in about 10 minutes, and the plot flowed wonderfully to the very end. A number of poignant moments between Watanuki and Doumeki are abruptly interrupted by Mokona or Maru/Moko, which carries the thought to the ending, which was an 'interpret-by-yourself' conclusion. The OVA had a true Japanese cinema feel with excellent use of silence and pauses, as well as effective utilization of camera footage taken by Doumeki and viewing by Watanuki to advance the story.  I have not been following the manga series, but the setting of ""xxxHOLiC Rou"" was very easy to follow (although it raises a lot of questions to Yuuko's disappearance and what happened in the last 10 years). The mission this time is an unremarkable one, but it's themed around Yuuko's return, and a showcase of 'how the ship is ran' by Watanuki's as the 'shop' master. Once again, there is a lot of Japanese mythical references that were very interesting if you're into that stuff. The characters weren't given much space for development in the actual show, but it is rather a display of how the characters had developed in the 10 years without Yuuko. Character depiction was done exceptionally well as a half-feature-length-OVA.  Unlike the previous disappointing OVA ""Shunmuki"", ""xxxHOLiC Rou"" is nearly a flawless episode that uses the 40-minute run time very efficiently and a story well told. It doesn't necessarily bring a closure to the ""xxxHOLiC"" series or the ""Rou"" story arc, but I personally think it would serve as an excellent precursor and intro for another season of ""xxxHOLiC"" series since it really stirred my curiosity to events transpired in 10 years, and made me crave for more. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The second OVA episode is titled 'Adayume' (Empty Dream). This time, the mission is brought in Watanuki's dream by Doumeki's grandfather Haruka, who appeared in 'xxxHOLiC Shunmuki' OVA. The premise is still the same as the previous episode, most of the play duration takes place in the dream that Haruka wants Watanuki to change, and follows a series of past events from Doumeki's perspective. Once again, it's pretty heavy on folklore with references to Baku, the dream eater, and Houjou Masako, who is said to have purchased her sister's dream to become the shogun's wife (her sister could not interpret the dream).  The second episode felt a bit lacking, both in length and depth to the story, but it has some nostalgia value in revisiting past events. There is also an upcoming conflict foreshadowed by Yuuko, so perhaps there will be more episodes. 'Adayume' have only added more questions what happened in 10 years' time. It'll be interesting to see how everything will be summed up.";Recommended
1;xxxHOLiC Rou;kingdomclow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kingdomclow;8;"So my format I set this out in is that if I skip a line, that means its a new paragraph. If I have a new line, its the same topic; just a different point.  and.....I might include spoilers without me knowing it so.....As a precaution, I'll apologise now.  So the story takes place 10 years after yuko's 'death' or 'disappearance' and it show how much the characters have changed. Hiwamari is married, doumeki is a professor and kohane is a student in the same university.This setting is the same as the manga yet the story is well, a side story since there isn't anything like this in the manga.  So a brief summary of the plot would be doumeki and another professor going to a mansion-like house to check out some artifacs and charms.etc. And when doumeki was there, he meets a girl, who is unnamed, an rather mysterious too. And then the next time they went, they were going through a crate and inside that crate was a bell. and once the bell was rung, the bashes open a door and starts acting all berserk and bites the professor and causes havoc. doumeki and watanaki investigate further to find shes some izura tamer or something like that.  The storyline confused me. So a girls gets possesed, and then destroys everything and then a pipe fox comes to the rescue, and they find a box and then she turns into a fox?! It was just too much to keep up with. And I'm the person, whho judges alot of anime and manga by endings. A bad and incomplete or rushed ending ruins the anime no matter how good the storyline was. xxxHolic rou's ending was confusing as well. What happened to an equal payment? How could a few words be enough for a girl to turn into a fox? What happened to yuko? The ending wasn't rushed, I was just incomplete. I felt like it needed more episodes. The storyline was the only thing that ruined it for me. And it was such a shame because this could've turned out really good. But thats just me. Maybe your not as absent minded as me and you might understand the storyline.  The art was the usual xxxholic style art, the simple eyes, and matte colours. Kohane grew taller and looks a lot more mature, yet doumeki hasn't changed, nor has watanuki since those ten years. Apart from that, the art was brilliant.  The music, was outstanding. It created the right atmosphere and setting. If your were to watch this anime on mute, you might not even realise that this anime is horror.  The character development was probably the things that stand out the most. Kohane is a (half) carefree girl and she is no longer the insecure child she was before. Although doumeki......hasn't changed at all. He's still the demanding, emotionless type of guy. But on the other hand, watanaki has changed dramatically. He's become alot like the serious yuko. (and when I said serious yuko I mean when she's around her customers and has that eerie demeanour not the playful sake ridden one) He no longer spazzes and no longer does those overly dramatic reactions that I love. Instead, he smokes a pipe and takes in a very serene tone and formal yet demanding manner.  This anime or ova was different, from all the other xxxholic ovas out there because it has a different setting to it. I enjoyed it,even though i didn't get it, and that's pretty impressive.  I'm gonna end this awfully long review with this oh-so spoilerish line.  ""Welcome back, Yuko.""";Recommended

I like how the horror and comedy was balanced. It was even exciting in some parts, especially the scene with Yuuko, Watanuki and Doumeki near the end.  It still scared me though. That little girl is the spawn of evil and I wish I never have to see her in a CLAMP crossover series. Speaking of crossover, I got a laugh out of the shameless plug at the end. I don&rsquo;t wanna give out any spoilers, so I&rsquo;ll just say it has something to do with a CLAMP crossover movie.  The animation really improved for this one with regards to details. The backgrounds were more intricate, the color palette had more variety and the characters were given more realistic bodies. Their heads were notably smaller though.  The music was really great too. There was an assortment of tracks that were nicely made and perfect for the theme of the movie. I also like the ending theme by Suga Shikao.  It really was a good decision to watch the movie as a supplement to the series. I strongly recommend watching this movie to other xxxHOLic fans &ndash; you will not be disappointed.";Recommended
1;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;Free;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Free;9;xxxHOLIC - Manatsu no Yoru no Yume is mystery, horror, fantasy movie of the series xxxHOLIC. This movie does not follow the storyline of the series, which is to say it also does not have ties to the story in the manga. I would suggest watching the first season of xxxHOLIC before watching this.  It starts with Yuko receiving an invitation stating that her 'collection' is incomplete and is inviting her to an auction at his house. This story is something we've all probably seen before. Main character gets invited to creepy old house, weird things happen, they solve a mystery, the end. Even with a common plot, it's still a good story. They keep a fair amount of mystery and there are scenes that make your heart skip a beat.  The characters aren't something new. We have the same main characters, Yuko, Doumeki and Watanuki. One thing worth mentioning is the crossover scene at the end. This movie crosses over with Tsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no Himegimi.  The sound is something I would expect out of a Final Fantasy game. It has that mysterious tune that helps build up the climax and is perfect for this movie's theme. Once again, Shikao Suga does a great job with the ending song.  The animation is, as expected of Production I.G., superb. The animation is smooth, their movements precise and has great quality. The details were really improved. I liked the art in the xxxHOLIC series, but this is a step up from that. You will also notice that Watanuki is also more flexible, thus being able to perform more of his weird movements, which we all enjoy.;Recommended
2;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;Aeterna;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aeterna;9;"xxxHOLiC is one of my favourite series (though, I only read the manga) so when I heard that there was a movie for it, I immediately jumped and went to find it. I was not disappointed!  Story -- If anything made me hesitate about seeing this movie, it was the story. For most movies based off of an anime series, their plots generally leave something to be desired. For the most part, they tend to feel like one long episode rather than an actual movie. However, xxxHOLiC's movie actually felt like a movie. I can't quite put my finger on it, but regardless, this movie delivers on plot. The mystery and intrigue build and build, occasionally relieved by humour (mostly on Watanuki's part) or heightened by some frightening scenes. Near the end, the story got a little confusing, but that's quite typical of xxxHOLiC and CLAMP in general, so it wasn't all that unexpected.  What was interesting, though, was that this movie explains the meaning of the series' title. This hasn't even been done in the manga to my knowledge, so I do wonder if this is something CLAMP has confirmed themselves or if it was made specifically by the movie's director. Still, when it was revealed, it made sense and sheds more light on the manga's themes, which I really enjoyed.  Art -- If you know CLAMP's latest art style, you'll know that they're in a tall and lanky character phase. This movie carries over that style into its art and it takes a bit to get used to - all too often, the heads seem to small, the limbs too long and rubbery, etc. But putting that aside, the art is fabulous. The colours and rich and vibrant, and the scenery in the house is especially something to be marvelled at. On my DVD, I even took a few minutes to go over the slides of the background art so I could get a closer look at them (because you only get a few seconds to see them in the actual movie!)  Sound -- As usual, the seiyuu did excellent jobs. Even the English voice actors didn't do too badly (the only exception, for me, was Mokona's English voice but Mokona has such a small role in this movie that it wasn't too detracting). The music was wonderfully done, as well, thanks to the work of Saitou Tsuneyoshi. There are some very good tracks on the OST, and they really contribute to the atmosphere and feeling of the movie - everything from building mystery and wonder to Yuuko's jazzy, fun theme at the end. And maybe just as importantly, silence is used effectively to build suspense at the freakiest of moments.  Character -- I really suggest knowing what xxxHOLiC is about before going into this movie because you really need to understand who the characters are. I showed this movie to my non-otaku friends and I had to explain who everyone was and what they did before they could understand it. And because this is a movie and not the actual series, there isn't too much character development here (since most of that seems to be reserved for the actual anime and manga), which is where it may fall short. This movie is more plot-driven than character-driven, after all. The original characters for this movie were average - not particularly memorable but not bad, either.  Enjoyment &amp; Overall -- Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it multiple times and intend to watch it more in the future. If you're familiar with xxxHOLiC, it stands on its own well enough, but you might also want to check out the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles movie, too (if you buy the DVD, they come as a set), since like the original series, they intertwine and events that occur in one movie affect what happens in the other. Still, I thought the xxxHOLiC movie did a much better job in terms of presentation and plot, but that'll lead us into a completely different review. In any case, I'd definitely recommend this movie to any xxxHOLiC fan.";Recommended
3;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;9;"Addictions… they are something that you can put your whole life and wellbeing into, not caring who you harm and sometimes even forgetting why you started it to begin with. No, this is not a two step ‘drug addiction’ seminar; it’s the start of a strange twist of fate for Watanuki and his friends. The movie starts out like any other episode of the anime really, with Watanuki being loaded down with a mass of spirits who all seem to want his attention up till he finally reaches the place that he works at, Yuuko’s wish granting house where he works like a slave for her. I can understand why they started it out with this as there is a need to explain who the characters are within the movie, but for people like me who know the story from both the anime and manga, it feels like a cop out. The reason why Watanuki is working at Yuuko’s place is so he would not have this trouble with spirits hanging on him all the time, but here we see that even though he has been working there a little while, the spirits do bother him. I can feel a little bit of annoyance when Yuuko talks about how he doesn’t see them that much but that’s because he is working at her place. Outside of that, nothing has changed at all (At least that’s how it feels).  Surprisingly, most of my problems with this Movie were only in the first few minutes of it, up till we have them going to a mansion that a woman had asked Yuuko to help get into (besides some animation hiccups I guess). The storyline was very well thought out and the characters were as loveable and funny as in the anime. Some minor problems of the show were pushed off to the side because of the rest of it being rather good. I felt like I was watching part of the anime without the cuts from it having to go into the next episode. I know some people get mad when a movie doesn’t feel like a movie but to me, I was happy to see this. Since I loved the anime already so it was nice seeing they had not changed anything.  The mansion was pretty creepy and was a lot like the Winchester mansion with doors and staircases leading no where and the ‘room within a room’ aspect but I had to wonder slightly why it was like that. I felt like we were going threw a ton of dimensions, rooms that felt like the outside, rooms so small you could hardly walk into, and even a really strange tiny tunnel that Watanuki had to crawl through to get to the restroom (and make himself look like a walking stick the whole way with his strange limbs). Then we have a strange feeling of a murder mystery where everyone was given an invitation to be there and then people start disappearing starting with one person and then going on to more. All of them had a common intrest; all of them collected things like an addiction. Now you can understand why I brought up the addiction part in the beginning of this review. And even in the end of the movie, I felt that I had still questions that were left unanswered and no closer to them. I’m not against not having all the answers, but there was one that bothered me and sadly, I can’t say it or it will be a large spoiler.  The artwork is really strange, and sometimes goes overboard compared to the anime. We do have the long limbs and over exaggerated faces that Watanuki is known for, the overly Slenderman look-a-likes of all the characters and the sometimes overly barbaric proportions of head to body ratios everybody whines about. But then we have some creepier looking things in the movie then just how the characters look. There are times when we are given CG rendered rooms that look almost perfect to the cartoon aspects and then they are placed next to rather low detailed objects like the characters for example. Sometimes it didn’t work but I found that most of the time it did as it would give you a very chilling feeling and add to what I believe the creators wanted.  I was not disappointed in the slightest of the movie and that’s surprising as my expectations were pretty high seeing as I liked the anime and manga both. If you are in the same book as me, I think you would really enjoy it as well.";Recommended
4;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;Were_Vampire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Were_Vampire;8;"xxxHolic is probably my favorite manga and one of my favorite animes. My experience with anime movies has never been too promising; for example, I've seen and hated 5 of the Naruto movies, the Tsubasa movie was dreadful and so the Fairy Tail one, some Digimon movies were also quite bad (though there are some that deserves to be recognized as very good). So I avoided the xxxHolic movie for quite a while, and when I finally made up my mind into watching it I decided not to expect that much from it. However, I'm glad I did, because I had a great time. It's not perfect, but it's pretty great mixing good comedy with some very disturbing (and quite effective) thriller moments.  Story: It's quite simple, there's a request from a woman because her key won't unlock her mansion, and Yuuko sends (as per usual) Watanuki to handle the job. Now, while the premise is pretty much the case of the week format of the manga and anime, the development is quite clever and has distinctive elements that make us feel that we are watching a movie and not just an extended episode, which is quite important; many anime based movies feel just like an extended episode, but here the storytelling takes different paces. While usual episodes tend to move a bit slowly to introduces us to the problem before speeding up in the end, here the pace is way more regular, speeding just a bit in the end, little by little, until it creates a perfectly balanced climax. Now, there are some flaws here and there: mostly the villain at the end is not very compelling, but the way Yuuko and company takes care of him is quite brilliant. Mostly, it's very cleverly handled, but the ending could have been better handled; it's not that it's bad (not at all!), it is that you feel like ""ok, this was a good film, but that's it"", it doesn't feel transcendent. Still, you are up for bid enjoyment if you like xxxHolic.  Character: xxxHolic strongest point has always been character; we get to explore them in depth, we get to know what is right and wrong with them, what are their strengths and their weaknesses and the movie is live ups to the anime/manga character treatment, with the sole expectation that the villain (as mentioned before) is a bit rushed, but that's a minor flaw to an otherwise greatly developed cast of characters, including Watanuki; I mention him because it's not rare for main characters to actually go out of character in movies, but he still feels the same and he reacts as we could expect, and for me that's a winner.  Sound: Marvelous, xxxHolic has always had a great track (and so its sister series, Tsubasa) and the movie doesn't fall behind. Not just the music, background sounds are in complete sync; there's a moment when a ghost appears out of nowhere at Watanuki's back and the track there just lands perfectly. When scenes must be bizarre, the track is right, when there's need for comedy, drama or thriller, the track is still right.  Enjoyment: I had a great time! It's the best anime based movie I watched thus far, and this actually encourages me to see some others out there that I haven't checked out because of my bad luck with anime based movies. Though it's certainly not the best I've seen, it's still pretty damn good. If you are a fan of xxxHolic, I'm quite sure you'll like it.";Recommended
5;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;kaworude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kaworude;8;This movie was an excellent side story to Holic: creepy yet comedic, structured yet whimsical. If you haven't seen it you should, and of course, this movie is recommended only for those who already know the characters of the series.  The story moves quickly and I enjoyed the vivid depictions of the collector's 'meeting' place. The art was pretty well done. If you're not a fan of CLAMPs 'noodle people' (quoted from TVTropes), then you shouldn't watch this since the anatomical correctness of Holic is questionable at best (especially Yuuko's plunging neckline). But why would you see this is if you weren't a CLAMP fan anyway? ... *ahem* ... Going back to the storyline, it isn't super predictable but it is interesting and original. I enjoyed the structured mystery-novella plotline and the interesting subject which points back to a larger theme, so if you're looking for something typical yet different (opposites, I know) then Midsummer Night's dream'll cover you.  I have to say the music didn't particularly move me although I DO remember it, which is a rare occurrence for most movies. Memorable music for me is a must! To be honest, the only thing that stayed in my mind was the instrumentals from all the more demure creepy moments of the film.  So if you're questioning why you should buy this movie, think of all the Holic goodness and the high rewatchability factor! I've seen this movie 3 times and I'll definitely watch it again! ^_^;Recommended
6;xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no Yume;Animelover875;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animelover875;9;"I find that this movie is highly skilled in not only telling an appealing story, but also simultaneously proves that a unique and clearly defined premise is not always necessary to draw viewers in. While the main concept is relatively tame, the story truly comes together thanks to its artistic appeal; much of the movie is eye candy with wonderfully creepy and deceptively abstract and surrealist imagery designed to play with perspective (among other factors), which adds a highly admirable amount of stylistic and aesthetic appeal. The characters all appear in the same vein as they do in the original, though truthfully the series has always been more focused on spirits and contemplation and questioning of humanity, life, morals, and other factors than specific character development. Even the collectors are overexaggerated, shown to their most extreme extent to care about pride and conceit only artificially, finding themselves unique because they believe they have a collection rarer than others. While it may be interesting to have a rare collection, the item being rare in itself is not what should be praised; rather, what should is the dedication to keep collecting and bettering one’s collection, disregarding to a respectable degree the actual gross value. It’s fittingly contradictory of the homeowner then, who collects other collectors and even seemed to wish to “collect” Yuko, who seems immune to him. I believe that Yuko is immune to his efforts primarily because most of the collectors seem to be lacking an implied sense of fulfilment, needing to fill this with material objects. However, Yuko lacks this as she gives others what they desire most. I highly recommend watching this movie if following the series and even if not for this reason, if anything for the aesthetic and stylistic value as well as warped view on perception of humanity and pride, among countless others, that the movie showcases. 9/10.";Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;8;"Funny, creepy, dark, interesting and clever. Those would be the words that could describe this anime.  It&rsquo;s funny &ndash; thanks to Watanuki&rsquo;s wild antics as well as Mokona&rsquo;s drunkenness. Creepy &ndash; mostly because it scared the heck out of me sometimes (especially episode 10, 12 and 24). Dark, because it presents the world in a way that people rarely see. It&rsquo;s interesting &ndash; you get hooked into it and you actually become an xxxHOLIC-holic. Finally, it&rsquo;s clever because it doesn&rsquo;t take the viewers for fools.  The characters are just great. Doumeki and Watanuki are yin and yang. They always seem to have this love-hate comedy routine wherein Doumeki says one thing then it annoys Watanuki right off the bat, then Himawari comments on how close they are. I also like Yuuko. I am always amazed by her wisdom and how she takes on her job. I think the concept of just compensation in something other than money is very clever. I like her here more, instead of the Yuuko from TRC. The black Mokona cracks me up as well even though I&rsquo;m a tad bothered that he&rsquo;s not as well mannered as the white Mokona.  Production IG&rsquo;s work was a bit interesting. The visuals seemed off to me sometimes, but there&rsquo;s something about it that keeps me watching. I didn&rsquo;t like the colors though, since most of it was concentrated on the main characters/elements. The background elements seemed a bit dull sometimes. I did like the demon parade episode, because the scenes were more vivid than usual. As expected of CLAMP, the characters have slightly deformed body types and tall and stringy characters. I guess it&rsquo;s what separates them from others.  I&rsquo;m not familiar too with the three main seiyuu, but I think they did a splendid job. Jun Fukuyama was very entertaining as Watanuki. Sayaka Ohara&rsquo;s mature, sultry and womanly voice fit Yuuko&rsquo;s personality really well and Kazuya Nakai&rsquo;s voice was also well suited to Doumeki&rsquo;s character. Of course, Mika Kikuchi was very entertaining as Mokona as well.  The music was very much like the plot &ndash; a bit dark, but contemporary. I like the catchy opening theme (19sai), the cutesy first ending theme (Reason), and the j-rock second ending theme (Kagerou). The BGM really helped in making things a lot more creepier too.  I&rsquo;m really glad that I found the time to watch the series. I have to say that this is my favorite CLAMP series by far &ndash; mostly because the CLAMP series I&rsquo;ve seen haven&rsquo;t impressed me as much as xxxHOLIC. I&rsquo;ll end this review with Yuuko&rsquo;s words that resonated throughout the series &ndash; There is no such thing as coincidence in this world. There is only the inevitable.";Recommended
1;xxxHOLiC;doge_senpai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/doge_senpai;8;"Prepare to be taken on a tour de force through the world of the supernatural. Or maybe just a regular tour. I wouldn't know. Having only recently experienced the genre of &quot;supernatural&quot; anime, xxxHOLiC (hereby referred to as simply &quot;Holic&quot;) was a breath of fresh air from my usual action/fantasy fare.  The story behind Holic is intriguing and interesting, revolving around spirits, ghosts, and the very strange. Geared towards an older and more sophisticated audience, there's little action, but loads of thought-provoking and amazingly insightful dialogue. Holic is the kind of anime that gets your mind pumping about topics such as fate, destiny, and one's purpose in life. Plus, there's a side to it that makes statements about how people live and society in general. Not to mention that it's educational as well. Holic offers an insight into a part of Japanese culture that most people rarely see.  Concerning the plot, however, Holic is another anime that is driven by episodic events. There seems to be no real overall direction for the story. Normally, this would leave me feeling slightly cheated and unsatisfied, but after surviving through the likes of Ouran and the Wallflower, I've come to accept that the episodic plot system is a genre on its own and it's here to stay.  Unfortunately, a plot that doesn't know where it's going hurts any character development. The characters are well made, with their own distinct personalities, but stay relatively the same throughout the course of the plot. No one shows very much significant growth. Granted, everyone is wiser and better, having learned the lessons distributed throughout 24 episodes of madness. Perhaps that's the elusive character growth that I've been looking for?  In terms of artwork, the artistic foundations were laid down in the manga by the increasingly popular mangaka group CLAMP. And they've done a very good job. Yuuko's wardrobe is definitely something to pay attention to (ahem), and though everyone has ridiculously long arms, legs, and necks, it actually provides a sense of levity in a serious setting (that, and the alcoholism). Alas, there's a slight issue with the fact that only the characters important to the plot are actually drawn in. Any bodies that are only required to be &quot;fillers&quot; (like a bunch of random people at a supermarket) are not colored and lack faces. In my opinion, it has symbolic meaning, but it could also be attributed to pure laziness. Dunno which to choose.  Oh, and speaking of laziness, the sound was great. Loved the opening theme, but didn't really pay attention to the background music. Voice-acting was top notch, especially with all the high pitched and slightly unique voices coming from characters like Mokona, Maru, and Moro. That is all.  In the enjoyment section: I finished Holic in the space of a week, and indeed, I was completely hooked. I savored every bit of supernatural strangeness, and I'll be looking for more with the second season.  Finally, Holic certainly isn't unique, for there seems to be an ever-growing list of anime that deal with the supernatural, the occult, and just really weird stuff in general. But as a starter series for the newly-converted, it's definitely worth watching.";Recommended
2;xxxHOLiC;galluvton;https://myanimelist.net/profile/galluvton;10;Its possibly the BEST anime i'v ever seen.

I never saw an anime that had a better script than this one, and there wasen't even a second that I thought of anything else while watching this anime.  The art isen't the level you would expect for an anime of this rank to be, but even though it lookes kind of chieldish, I would like to see you find an anime that can give such a story with such an atmosphere with this art.

3;xxxHOLiC;13lueH0ur;https://myanimelist.net/profile/13lueH0ur;8;"“Mokona is a Mokona.” - Mokona  There are many things we don’t understand about the world. But as much as we are stupefied by the unknown, we often take everyday human behavior for granted. And with a show centered on the supernatural, we’d think that the supernatural are the enigma, when in reality, humanity and society are the real mystery.  Enter xxxHOLiC, a show that explores the irrationality of human behavior in a supernatural context. I admit, this show wasn’t too high on my priority list. Though after my cousin watched and expressed his love for it, I decided to give it a shot and boy, was I in for an unexpected treat; a treat that spawned a second season, four OVAs, and a movie. Note that this review will only be about the first season, but rest assured that I will get to the other installments.  STORY - 7  xxxHOLiC is the story of a high school boy’s encounters with the supernatural after being taken in as an apprentice by a rather odd employer who claims to grant wishes. That pretty much sums it up. Nothing more, nothing less.  Pacing-wise, this is where xxxHOLiC shines.  Episodic shows are a double-edged blade. On one hand, they excel stylistically by putting the characters in various scenarios of differing themes, thus granting an expansion of premise and necessary character development. On the other, each episode has an individual story which allows little room to move the overarching plot along. It isn’t one unified narrative, but a collection of short stories; each with their own style, conflict, and lesson. For the first season at least, xxxHOLiC may not have a sense of plot direction yet but it takes full advantage of its pacing in displaying its brand of weird charm, unsettling atmosphere, and surprising insight. You get goosebumps on one episode, ponder on another, and smile after the next. The episodic pacing in this show makes it seem like a slice-of-life show more than anything, incorporating elements of supernatural, horror, suspense, comedy, and romance along the way.  ART - 8  Two words: Character design.  When you have characters that have the average height of a professional basketball player, hands as big as their head, arms as long as their legs, and virtually no muscle, you know people will love it or hate it. Fortunately, I belong to the former.  I commend Clamp for a job well done on the zany, slenderman-like character designs. Though anatomically incorrect and disproportionate, it intensifies both wacky and tense scenes by emphasizing body movement, and exudes an exotic vibe that complements the show’s eerie and mystical setting. Seeing the fleshed-out stick figure look is also reminiscent to the flat, gritty, and edgy cartoon style of the 90’s which are a refreshing departure from today’s smooth, vibrant, and meaty designs.  The animation, provided by Production I.G., is standard for a show aired on 2006. Colors are dull and faded, supernatural set pieces are smoky and oriental, lighting is dim and claustrophobic, and cinematography is still and calm. In general, the animation is… subtly off, and it works in the show’s favor surprisingly well.  SOUND - 9  For xxxHOLiC’s sound, I’ve taken into account the OP/EDs, BGM, ambient sounds, and voice acting, because all of these are worth the mention.  For your information, I have never skipped this show’s openings and two ending songs. Not even once. I might even go as far as to say that this show’s OP and first ED are one of the best I’ve heard in a while. Each episode starts with an infectious funk song of quirky synthesizers, hypnotic guitars, and groovy basslines riddled with dissonant angst and regret. “19sai” (19 Years Old) by Shikao Suga perfectly encapsulates what xxxHOLiC is all about: an otherworldly coming-of-age story in a strange and wonderful world full of temptation and misunderstanding where everyone just wants to break free and find peace of mind. All of that is neatly wrapped in a nice little bow by the end of each episode with Fonogenico’s “Reason,” a cute and light piece of keyboard and guitar pop which resonates with the show’s motif of inevitabilities; in that everything happens for a reason and embracing what has happened and what will happen is the only way to go. By the second half of the show, the show ends with Buck-Tick’s “Kagerou” (Shimmering Air), a straightforward rock song of wailing guitars and yearning vocals dominated with themes of dire escapism and obsessive attachment which fits the more serious tone of the latter half of the series.  The BGM did an exemplary job in covering a wide array of moods while being consistent with the show’s supernatural backdrop due to the songs’ dreamlike quality. The instrumentation ranged from hair-raising ambient scores of distant howls, sinister chords, and violent percussions to playfully halloweenish or heartfelt synthesizer, string, and piano pieces. It became integral in defining xxxHOLiC’s hauntingly eccentric yet down-to-earth nature.  It’s common sense that ambient sounds are supposed to match a given atmosphere. So in this case, there will be two instances when I mention ambient sound engineering; either when it stands out in a bad or good way. In xxxHOLiC, ambient sounds surprisingly affect a scene’s inflection in such a way that it disconcerts the viewer even in the most mundane of scenes. The ambience rides along with the show’s animation by exhibiting a nuance that there’s always something wrong, despite a given context being normal and safe. xxxHOLiC gains this added horror/suspense edge even if that isn’t necessarily what the show is all about. But like the BGM, it immensely aids in immersion and made the setting darker without feeling unnatural to the show’s premise. Because let’s face it, what you don’t understand scares you. And the sound department did a great job of capturing the fear and awe of the supernatural experience. xxxHOLiC knows when to use silence, cut off sound, modulate voices, and mix in subtle noises, whispers, and sounds to enhance the profound yet dubious undertone lying beneath the show’s innocent exterior.  The voice acting expressed each character’s key trait very well. The lovably annoying Watanuki gets an incessant high-pitched voice that hushes down on the show’s more solemn moments. Deadpan Doumeki remains a deep and monotone pitch all throughout but can give off a softer vibe while still keeping his cool. Yuuko’s voice completely captivates the ears; shifting from immature exuberance to alluring sultriness while maintaining a neutral and elusive stance. Maru, Moro, and Mokona keep up with the playful high-pitched voice to even out the show’s somber tendencies. Himawari’s typical schoolgirl voice is cute and unassuming. Let’s just leave it at that. The characters often change in every episode with these being the main recurring characters with ample screen time.  P.S. The dub wasn’t really my cup of tea. Todd Haberkorn’s Watanuki turned the lovably annoying character into a whining wuss.  CHARACTERS - 7  The characters in xxxHOLiC are similar to that of a fairy tale. They are very distinct from one another and portray a striking personality all throughout the series to fulfill each of their respective roles.  Watanuki is the ceaselessly complaining and hardworking nice guy we all know and love. Doumeki is the dull and straightforward jock as well as Watanuki’s polar opposite and comic foil. Together, they banter their way into their own supernatural misadventures under the watchful eye of Yuuko. Occasionally joining them in their struggle to address Yuuko’s customers (if they aren’t doing various odd jobs), we have:  Maru and Moro, a jolly pair of kids serving Yuuko. Mokona, Clamp’s bunny-like mascot that serves as Yuuko’s mischievous friend and drinking buddy. And Himawari, Watanuki’s ditzy and innocent love interest.  The rest are either the shop’s customers or supernatural entities involved.  Interactions between the main cast can get formulaic and most of the character development can only be credited to Watanuki. His character development was more personal than substantial. It wasn’t a noticeable growth spurt nor a radical shift in ideals. It was more of a hushed voice within the character telling him that he learned something that he still can’t fully comprehend. Though lacking well-roundedness and middle ground, the characters were all lovable and relatable, with both the humans and the supernatural having independent and realistic ideals. The huge cast of episode-specific characters also left a memorable impact which made up for their static personality.  ENJOYMENT - 9  As you can already tell, I love this show. It was like watching a more light-hearted yet more sinister version of The Addams Family with all the grim and whimsical energy evident in the show’s production. With constant references to superstition and common social stigma, it provided enough realism to make it accessible and understandable compared to most supernatural lore. What it lacked in plot direction, it made up for in style, immersion, and groundedness. But what really left a lasting impression on me was the insight.  xxxHOLiC tells us how little we understand life, society, and ourselves. How learning, growing and transforming into something better means going outside our comfort zone and exploring the world. How meeting different people with various problems helps us understand that there is nothing good or evil. How inherently selfish and fickle we are.  Ultimately, how strange it is to be human.  We are riddled with inconsistencies and flaws which drive us to suffering and bitter realization. And in those moments when we are most vulnerable, we understand how beautiful it is to feel pain and embrace reality. We bask in our imperfection and eccentricity because it is what defines us.  OVERALL - 8  xxxHOLiC is a wondrous, uncanny, frisky, and sentimental ride through the life and times of Watanuki, a highschool boy blessed and cursed with the blood that attracts spirits. It deserves praise, not for overwhelming the viewer with something revolutionary, but for telling a story that says something about ourselves. Maybe I’m just putting too much thought into this. Overall, the show was simple, yet clever in its execution to deliver the full force of its content. As for where that content is going, I’m eager to find out in the next season.";Recommended
4;xxxHOLiC;cafekun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cafekun;8;"xxxHOLiC, is a project of the famed group CLAMP. Let's begin the reviews ne  Story - xxxHOLiC is about the daily lives of Watanuki and Yuuko. Two characters whos fate has intertwined. xxxHOLiC is a collection of different strange yet interesting stories which happens to produce a happy ending on every episode. One particular viewer would learn something from the episodes of xxxHOLiC. It's about the mistake of humans and the solution to them were given by the main character &quot;Yuuko&quot;. I'd say that some episodes were mediocre but interesting enough.  Art - Production IG was involved, judging the fact that this anime were made in the year 2006, I'd say that the animation is somewhat outdated. I'm not saying that it is that bad, it's just that there's nothing special about the animation. The characters stays on their intentionally deformed shape. It's not that bad really.  Sound - I like the BGM used in this anime. It is ingeniously used in every episode and fits the whole episode inside out. The group behind the BGM is SENS project and they're really good. They really did portray the word &quot;Mysterious&quot; in their works and it is really notable. Some scores were relaxing, one track I liked is shizuka na hibi. The OP is good and the ED &quot;Reason&quot; is love XDD. Everyone would enjoy listening to the music used in xxxHOLiC.  Character -There are different characters with different situations. Most of the characters bears different sins and after they consult Yuuko, they seem to vanish for Yuuko grants their wish to cleanse their sins and live normally. One would relate to one or two characters or even more in xxxHOLiC. In short, xxxHOLiC portrays the problems of today and how to solve them, this is one factor that I've noticed and cherished most. That's why I gave it this score.  Enjoyment -It's enjoyable and relaxing. Although there are some scary episodes, it's not like you'll brood and will never sleep about it, the scare factor here is mild don't worry. This anime will relax you and you'll learn different lessons about life, sins and the pain they bring.  Overall -The second season is coming out, what are you waiting for? grab xxxHOLiC. It's worth your time and I hope you will enjoy this anime just like I did.";Recommended
5;xxxHOLiC;Belinda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Belinda;8;"Oh CLAMP! I&rsquo;ve always loved their works; there is (albeit, sometimes misguided) sincerity in their stories that many other anime/manga can&rsquo;t quite manage. An example of this is in the second episode that revolved around a girl with a pinky problem. It is revealed that it&rsquo;s not mere limb stiffness, because to Yuuko and Watanuki, they see that she has a trail of black smoke coming out from her finger. The episode goes to reveal what the black smoke is about and the type of life this girl leads. There is obvious social commentary going on, and in a very CLAMP-esque way, rather than any form of judgement, it is simply an observation into human behaviour and how people cope with living.  The art style was something I had to get used to. Everyone in xxxHOLiC has tremendously long limbs, which makes them really tall. I guess it makes it stand out compared to other more glossy, better-proportioned anime series out there. It&rsquo;s pretty amusing how bosomy Yuuko is and how some of her many costumes shows it off off quite unabashedly. :P  As for characters, I really don&rsquo;t care for Watanuki too much. He&rsquo;s always so neurotic and prone to making a ruckus over the smallest things. However, as the main character, he gets the most character development, so that does make him difficult to hate. The other characters are prone to be kind of one-dimensional and can be summed up with a sentence. Watanuki&rsquo;s love interest is cute, pretty and sweet and his rival/friend is stoic, dependable and more silent than not. I guess my favourite character is definitely Yuuko. While she doesn&rsquo;t vary much from polarising from being mysterious and thoughtful, to being a spontaneous drunk, the former quality makes her very interesting. Character exploration is not too big in xxxHOLiC, but if you don&rsquo;t mind the existing, albeit archetypal, character types, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.  CLAMP&rsquo;s attempt at humour works at times but it&rsquo;s not a consistent thing. I personally don&rsquo;t find it very funny whenever Watanuki gets all slapstickishly angry about something, but at times it does surprise me with how funny and adorable some of the characters are at times. But if you&rsquo;re looking for consistent humour, this anime probably would not fit the bill.  xxxHOLiC is great if you want a well-paced, episodic anime that has somewhat of a focus on exploring social phenomena and human behaviour through a fate/destiny, supernatural light. Sometimes touching, often spooky, kooky and clever. Each episode, while it may not be gripping plot-wise, is one that leaves you wondering what the next episode would be about.";Recommended
6;xxxHOLiC;unclesnapple;https://myanimelist.net/profile/unclesnapple;8;There are no coincidences in this world. There is only inevitability. If you find Yuko's shop, then that too was fate. It means you have a wish that can be granted. For a price of course. This is the simple premise for xxxHolic, a stylish and magical anime and manga series by CLAMP.  xxxHolic is a show that tries to stimulate the viewer in many different ways. There's adventure, philosophy, plenty of comedy, and sometimes action, all with a distinctly CLAMPy flair. The routine nature of Watanuki's life between school and the shop allows for episodes to be largely interchangeable with no heavy storyline that covers all or even most of the season. Truth be told, Watanuki's wish to stop seeing spirits is rarely mentioned after the first episode, and it's basically just an excuse to have him start working at the shop. That's not necessarily a complaint though, because the individual stories or mini-arcs that make up the show are wholly fulfilling on their own.  Although Watanuki is the protagonist, Yuko is the real star of the series and undeniably magnetic. Although her origins remain a mystery, she has enough charm and personality to keep one watching in any situation. On the surface, she playfully teases and bosses Watanuki around but seems to genuinely care about him even though she never explicitly states her feelings about... well, anything. Because Yuko is so attuned to the absolution of fate, she never gets emotional. Because Yuko is a wish granter, she doesn't help other people until they ask for and purchase her help. Even if she wanted to do otherwise, it would create an imbalance. Yet she never comes across as cold. She can be playful, aloof, serious, motherly, childish, sexy, and spontaneous.  The strength of xxxHolic is the way it uses colorful and whimsical events to illustrate the hidden side of human nature. Everyone who comes into the shop has a wish. It's never a shallow wish, and it's often something that is unusual or shameful. Watanuki is often confused by the problem or the solution, but Yuko explains to him many truths to life. The unspoken plot of xxxHolic is Yuko's role as a teacher to Watanuki, in result making him more of an adult. Aside from the philosophy, just being able to witness the wonderful mystical scenes of the spirit world for the first time with Watanuki is a treat.  If there's a downside to xxxHolic, it is probably the comedy, which comes across as cliched. Plus, they run the same gags into the ground again and again. One can't help but notice how Watanuki happily spazzes out every time the girl he has a crush on, Himawari, smiles at him. Then, his rival/friend Doumeki shows up, says one or two words, and Watanuki spazzes angrily with cartoonish exuberance. This is a scene you'll find in almost every episode of xxxHolic through both seasons. It's unfortunate that such a large amount of the show is comedy, because those parts are very run-of-the-mill.  The artwork is largely what you might expect from CLAMP, which is good to me, but everyone has REALLY long and skinny arms, legs, and torsos, to the point where Watanuki looks like a spider when he bends his legs. So while I wouldn't call most of the characters attractive, the style fits the show. The animation is minimized in a lot of scenes and episodes, and it's easy to see that when you contrast the first season to the second season which has improved production values. But it absolutely doesn't hurt the show very much.  For me, the complete attraction to xxxHolic is hard to summarize. It's a stylish feel, a mood, a charisma that the entire show gives off that kept me watching from beginning to end. It's the tension when Yuko shares a cup of tea with her new client. It's the relaxed feeling when Doumeki and Watanuki participate in the annual monster procession. It's the creeping madness of the owner of a monkey's paw. While not a perfect show by any means, it's a worthy addition to any library.;Recommended
7;xxxHOLiC;lastmann;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lastmann;9;(Spoiler Free) A misleading title is one of my only qualms with this series. Far from being some sort of ecchi comedy, xxxHolic was one of the most thought provoking, moving, and beautiful animes I've had the pleasure of viewing.  The roots of the show are set deep in the grounds of Japanese folklore. Fans of the animated movie Spirited Away or of animes like Natsume Yuujinchou are sure to love the world of spirits and mysteries crafted in xxxHolic.  The story is mostly episodic with numerous different stories taking palce over 1 or 2 episodes each. While I usually prefer serial animes with longer arcs, xxxHolic succeeds in connecting many of its episodes together. Instead of 20+ independant, stand-alone stories, we instead get what are more like snapshots of the characters life. Each 'picture' is different, yet all are connected and make up a larger story. Not only is this an excellent way to present a series, but each of the 20+ stories are masterpieces in and of themselves. Story earns a 9/10  The art in xxxHolic is, in my experience, unique. I personally found the original style to be completely beautiful, but not all will agree. Many find the slightly off human proprtions to be odd, and some find fault with over the top character movements. However most can agree that many of the backrounds, stories, and characters in xxxHolic are simply breathtaking. Scenic landscapes, a lantern parade of 1000 spirits, and an ever mysterious fortune teller's shop are just a handful of the many original and gorgeous scenes crafted by the show's masterful artwork. A deserved 10/10 for art in my most humble opinion.  Sound was also impressive. I, like most, don't often notice a soundtrack unless I'm listening for it. Yet the oftentimes powerful, and beautiful music of xxxHolic perfectly meshed with the art and story to create some truely moving moments. Character voicing was superb, from the exasperated voice of the protagonist to the lofty, confident tone of a fortune teller, the actors of the show did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. And lastly, a catchy opener, and two decent endings left me smiling. Sound earns a 9/10  Many characters in xxxHolic are familiar arcetypes. Yet even though I'd seen every character's personality and mannerisms before, I hadn't always seen depth in those characters. Specifically the protagonist who, albeit slowly and more towards the end of the series, reveals himself as a person. Meanwhile a relationship forms seamlessly with his mysterious employer, a relationship that by the end of the series becomes a real, and believable bond between the two. Characters are by no means perfect however. A few cross the line from being 'familiar' to full blown cliche, and at times, the main character can be somewhat of a brat. Overall however the cast in xxxHolic carry the story well. An 8/10 for character.  I loved the series from start to finish. The beautiful stories, the sporadic, but no less enjoyable humor, and the overall depth of the show were simply incredible, and a joy to watch. Enjoyment earns a solid 10/10  Overall xxxHolic earns a 9/10 and my eager reccomendation. Beautiful art and stories that range from scary, to hilarious, to proverbial combined with solid characters and sound make this an anime well worth looking into.;Recommended
8;xxxHOLiC;thatleftnut;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thatleftnut;10;Where do I begin with this amazing anime? I suppose I'll start with the lowest rated category: Story. The reason this is so low, is well, bluntly, there isn't much of a story. The first episode segways into the rest of the show, and is more of an excuse than anything to at least make sense of the series. There's very little persistence throughout the story, other than tiny character progression. Each episode is typically unrelated to the previous one. Now, although there isn't plot, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each episode is unique from one another, aside from the typical antics of Watanuki and Domoki. Seemingly, in every episode, there's a philosophical idea behind it. I feel like, with each episode, a life lesson is taught. The dialogue is superb, and it feels like each word spoken actually means something. Many of Yuukos teachings to Watanuki are applicable to real life, and if you truly think about them, can change your life. The final episode might leave you wanting more, but you have to realize what this anime is. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and what you've taken away from it. Sure, you could watch this anime for pure entertainment purposes, Watanuki, Mocona, Domoki, all the characters are hilarious! But, the mature themes this anime addresses in such a light hearted tone is truly a work of art.  Speaking of art, there's not much to talk about. The character's extremities are blown way out of proportion. It is what it is, I suppose it adds a unique spin on the quite regular locations where the anime takes place. The one really interesting thing about the artwork though, is that any non-essential character to the episode isn't colored, and isn't detailed. They have no face, no distinguishable clothes from each other(as in variety) , or any vibrance to them whatsoever. Now, this may be seen from a lack of funding/laziness perspective, but to me it really adds to the whole feel of the philosophical side. They don't change the anime in any way, so it doesn't matter what they look like, or what they wear. Very much so like in real life. There is really only one complaint you can have about this series, and that would be the actual animation. It can be choppy at times, but truly doesn't count as a negative in my opinion. It's not a fast paced anime, there's practically never any action, so higher framerate animations wouldn't add much to the series. Just my 2 cents.  Onto the sound, fantastic. Numerous times throughout the anime characters will be walking around in a crowded area, like a mall or courtyard. The ambient chatter and conversations are always present when you'd expect them. Footsteps aplenty, making the environment always feel real. I guess voice acting would fall under this category, so I must say, it was superb. Honestly, top notch voice acting on Watanuki. The first episode had me crying from laughter at the sincerity with which the voice actor portrayed in his voice. You can tell the emotion is there, from Himawari's schoolgirl innocent-esque, to Yuuko's deep, sophisticated delivery. These voice actors absolutely nailed their parts, and made the characters extremely life like, and made the world entirely believable.  The characters themselves are well thought out, though interaction between them can be muddy at times (Watanuki's seemingly irrational hate for Domoki). This can easily be forgotten though, as it is hyperbole for the sake of comedy. Each individual character though, is different from the others, and contrast with the others very well. Each one of them has a distinct characteristic that makes them unique, Domoki's indifference, Watanuki's passion, Yuuko's intelligence, and Himowari's innocence. I suppose each one represent's an element of human behavior, and the relations between them show how we have conflicting emotions within us at all times. I'm no philosopher, so enough about that.  My overall enjoyment of xxxHOLiC was through the roof. I honestly was ecstatic when I found out xxxHOLic Kei was the sequel, because I can't get enough of this series. From Watanuki's always present sarcastic remarks, to the intelligent philosophical intrigues from Yuuko, this whole series amazed me. I honestly don't understand how you can pack so much into just one anime. It has the perfect blend of comedy, and brilliance, which don't typically go hand in hand, at least not very well. I felt like each episode taught me something new about myself, and left me pondering life with the questions Yuuko arose many times throughout the series.  Overall, if you're looking for a clever plot with thought-out character progression, look elsewhere, because there's little to none in xxxHOLiC. But, if you are looking for a mature anime, that's extremely entertaining, look no further.;Recommended
9;xxxHOLiC;turquoise_neko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/turquoise_neko;10;"""There is no such thing as a coincidence in this world, there is only the inevitable"" (as miss Yuuko Ichihara would say, this containing the essence of the anime and personally my favourite quote)  If you are into supernatural and think that there is more to the world that meets the eye and are looking for interesting characters than definetely this is you kind of anime. I first found out about this amazing work through manga and then started watching the series but it also works the other way around- you can start watching the anime and then continue with the manga- which is actually better.  Story - Shortly said, you can say that the anime revolves around a shop that grants wishes, or better said around it's ""owner"" miss Yuuko Ichihara and the ""trials"" that Watanuki must go through in order to grant his wish and the wishes of others. The story isn't continuous as it is formed from other smaller stories each of them very interesting to watch because in the end you realize that the vast majority of supernatural problems (unexplained accidents, ghosts, spirits) are caused from the inside out (strong feelings that ar not shared, deep sadness, etc). Captivating and with unexpected rezolve, the most interesting thing being the fact that if you wish to grant your wish you must give something of equal value (and I'm not talking about money). Not very much action, but still a pretty nice complex story.  Artwork - The artwork at first seems simple, but as you continue to watch you get the feeling that it's like an ukyo-e (art of the fleeting world) especialy when inside the spirit world or the shop (the way the smoke is drawn, the symbol of the moon, yuuko's clothes (which I absolutely adore) (although not all of them, some being vicotian, modern, a lot of styles(you can see it better in the manga) I also enjoyed the butterfly symbol how it was drawn and its segnificance.  Sound- openings definetely loved them, endings not so much and also ""Lost memory""(very sand and beautiful from the ost)  Character- At first you think that the characters aren't so complex, but as the story goes on and you discover more about each of them, you begin to realise that each of them were created with a purpose. My favourite character would definetely be miss Yuuko Ichihara because of her dual personality, or maybe she has that misterious, serious and all knowing gaze all the time and the fooling around laughing and getting drunk part is only for show. Who knows? But she is definetely very interesting and would never get you bored.  Overall, this show is definetelly worth watching, as it opens up your mind, makes you thing about life and everything that surrounds you and also teaches about some of the japanese folklore. It's an anime you won't forget!";Recommended
10;xxxHOLiC;Akuma-Shitsuji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Akuma-Shitsuji;10;Ok,so,the story is about a high school student called Watanuki,and the mysterious facts that happen to him every day,such as being able to see spirits.Everything gets even more fun and complicated when he inevitably stops by a shop that is owned by Yuko,a jack-of-all-trades shop owner.From that day on,Watanuki starts changing his attitude towards people and changes little by little while meeting the strangest creatures and philosophies...The series is very funny,but at some points scary,and it is definitely worth watching!!!The animation and music are very interesting too,making it one of the most awesome series out there right now :);Recommended
11;xxxHOLiC;TornRamos;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TornRamos;10;"Masterpiece, fucking masterpiece. Just beautiful. Let me tell you something, this is honestly the most unique series I have ever seen. Every part of this series is amazing in it's own way and I honestly won't understand how this animu is underrated. It makes me way too upset.  So the whole animu was based off Watanuki's life seeing spirits and how he meets Yuuko to grant his wish of getting rid of the spirits. I'm glad this animu didn't turn out to be one of those where something life changing happens at the beginning and the whole story is him living his new life. No, not at all. He spends the whole series up until Rou working for Yuuko and changing his life bit by bit throughout the story, and his progression and the story let alone was pure enjoyment.  I'm telling you, this animu will change some of your point of views in ways. I for one after finishing the whole series (Holic, Holic Kei, Holic Shunmuki, Holic Rou, TV series, excluding the movie which was the prequel to Holic) I learned a few such as how, basically a famous line thanks to animu, --""There is no such thing as coincidence, there is only inevitable"" or ""It was destined to be"". Cliche, rite????? But either way, how it's used in the animu is completely outstanding.  There's always been complaints about how the characters are drawn and look like walking stick figures, honestly who the hell cares? Remember how in video games, the N64 is probably still one of the biggest consoles in history, hell not even speaking of the parent SNES, for the games? How the games had crappy 3D graphics compared to nowadays and even with that, people probably play N64 games more than the current consoles? It's because THERE'S A POINT IN THE STORYLINE, SOUND AND ENJOYMENT. I agree the animation stands out from the rest, but honestly isn't seeing something different good most of the time? Not only that, it's what made the animu even more unique so it probably doesn't even matter.  Now, here's another thing. The soundtrack for this is fascinating, Rou had my favorite soundtrack out of the TV/OVA series. Honestly, I'm sure some people can agree? I wasn't a fan of the Holic Kei OP/ED, aiming more towards the ED so I'm glad Rou was there in terms of the sound. I really did love the whole soundtrack of the anime however, most animus have similar tastes and relations in their music. Sort of like how Deadman Wonderland and Mirai Nikki share similar soundtrack and such. Holic's soundtrack is completely unique and amazing which was one of my favorable parts of the animu. I'm going to download the whole original soundtrack soon because it really is worth it. Huge 10/10 here.  So for the characters, despite the animu not having a lot of characters, the characters were also really nice and shared their own personalities. Watanuki being the protagonist shares comedic personalities, Yuuko shares the wise personalities, Himawari shares that happy/cute personality, Zashiki shares that really shy personality towards Watanuki for liking him, Ame shares the rude personality, Doumeki shares the brave personality and so forth. It's really nice seeing how all of the characters in this didn't share each others personalities but their own. Cheers for this, this isn't something you see a lot.  Overall, I enjoyed watching the whole series. I learned a lot of things from this and my love for this grew so and so much throughout me watching. It is simply outstanding, unique and perfect. I wish to not change a single part of this.";Recommended
12;xxxHOLiC;Xzhieaenne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Xzhieaenne;9;"To begin with, xxxHolic is what you could call ""once in a lifetime ANIME"".... Everything about it, the story, the art, sound, characters, even the enjoyment were simply SPECTACULAR... I might be exaggerating, but really, its 'that' amazing! Though I haven't finished reading the manga, i swear the anime was good enough that i almost cried the hell out after I finished watching it. Yuuko Ichihara really has her own way to touch my soul,, everything she says, every deliberate acts she do, it is as if she knew everything since the very beginning. (Indeed, she do!) What she says, it seems she feels the same way... it seems she could actually read one's soul. She sees right through you, she feels right through you... and every time i watched it, it makes me think, do such person exist? I mean, she's way beyond an existence, and for the first time in my life, after i learned about her, i realize how ignorant i am in this damn cruel world. I hate to admit this, but she sure was the one who enlightens me. She was the one that makes me see the world otherwise. Even with Watanuki Kimihiro, though he is clumsy in some way (every way), he has this certain 'charisma' that makes me love him. He's one hell of a friend, a perfect friend you would want to have in your locker. (Though he didn't notice it himself). The 'bad' part about him was he was willing to sacrifice even his own self for the sake of others... but i still like him anyway... Oh great... to put it simply, xxxHolic is GREAT!";Recommended
13;xxxHOLiC;NinjaKirby1322;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NinjaKirby1322;8;Ak: Hey! Wait, issat xxxHolic? I thought you already watched it? NK: Yep. We're watching it in anime club now.  Ak: Is it good? NK: I enjoyed it the first time around. Now that I'm rewatching it, I'm noticing some parts are still pretty funny, and others aren't as funny as I remember them.  Ak: But, this is in Japanese, right? NK: Yeah. The first time I watched it in English, so it's interesting to compare the two.  Ak: Whaddya think of the voices so far? NK: Hmm...I liked a lot of the English voices better because they brought out more of the character. Yuuko's especially. The lines in the Japanese version seem to be a bit funnier, though.  Ak: Did that change your favorite character? NK: Nope. I never really had a single favorite character to begin with. The interactions between the characters is better than each character individually. Mokona and Yuuko especially.  Ak: You like the art? NK: I'm not especially fond of the art. The characters look...strange, to say the least. Even Mokona looks weird when it opens its eyes. Kinda creepy, actually.  Ak: What about the music? NK: Never really paid attention to the music the first time. It's actually pretty good. I like the theme now that I've listened to it a few times.  Ak: You think I would like it? NK: Not sure. It has a lot of dark moments amongst the funny ones, being a story about the supernatural and all. Plus, it explains a lot of things in a very strange way that just leaves more questions unanswered. It's still a good series, and even if you watch it for the funny moments, there's enough there to keep you humored.  Ak: Wait, why'd you watch it in the first place? It doesn't sound like something you'd normally watch... NK: The story's by CLAMP, the same group that did Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. It's a pretty long story as to why I actually started watching it, but I'm sure I'll explain it to you eventually.  Ak: If it's CLAMP, then why doesn't it look the same? NK: That's because xxxHolic has a different artist, even though it's the same group of people. The interesting thing is that there are a lot of objects littered throughout Yuuko's shop from other CLAMP series. Fai's staff makes an appearance, and I believe you see Kinomoto Sakura's staff at one point as well. The headphones Watanuki uses in episode 3 should also look quite familiar to CLAMP fans.  Ak: Should I watch those other series then? NK: You don't have to, though technically xxxHolic runs parallel to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. It never directly references TRC, though. Just a few random objects here and there.  Ak: Where do you rank it? Is it your favorite? NK: Not by a long shot. I enjoyed it, but not on the level of a 9 or a 10. It's one of those good-not-great series. Some people will like it, some people won't. I'm one of the ones that does like it.;Recommended
14;xxxHOLiC;pacuuuuu3;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pacuuuuu3;10;xxxHolic is an anime I just finished not long ago. It's based on the manga of the same name by CLAMP. It is also a spin-off of another CLAMP famous anime/manga, called Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle.  The story is basically about a guy called Watanuki who can see spirits and other supernatural things. One day, while he is being chased by a spirit, he finds himself entering a store with no reason. Once he enters, he meets Yuuko, the owner of the store. He finds out that it's not a normal store, but a store that grants wishes for a cost. Watanuki asks Yuuko to get rid of his ability to see spirits, so they can't chase him anymore, but in order to get his wish granted, Watanuki has to start working in the store.  That's basically the main plot. It may not sound as interesting as it is, but in every episode, something new happens. For example, an episode can be about a girl who is always negative about things, or about a girl who always lies, etc. Those persons with problems somehow get to meet Watanuki and you can see how what they do reflects in their lives, and how Watanuki tries to help them. All of this is developed with a paranormal touch, for example being negative can attract negative thing, and stuff like that.  The series is episodic, but really interesting, with every episode bringing something new, and a few 2-episodes arcs here and there which leave you in suspense.  Watanuki and Yuuko aren't the only characters however. Doumeki is Watanuki's friend and he can repel spirits, but he can't see them. Even when he is Watanuki's best friend, Watanuki is always fighting with him. He has a very calm personality, which differs from Watanuki's, and he's very popular with girls.  Himawari is the girl Watanuki likes, and she's a very good friend with Watanuki and Doumeki, but Watanuki doesn't dare confess her his love.  Overall the series is really good. The only thing that people think keeps it from reaching it's full potential is the art style. Something else people complain about is that minor characters just look like shadows, with no face.  Personally I don't really care about the art since the anime is so great and just feels so mystical at times.  The music is also amazing, with some awesome tracks that always make you feel what the anime wants you to feel. Most tracks were good IMO.  In conclusion, this is an awesome anime, don't hesitate to watch it now;Recommended
15;xxxHOLiC;graysky14;https://myanimelist.net/profile/graysky14;9;"&quot;Coincidence is nothing but an illusion&quot;, such are the words of Yuuko that influenced my life choices since I've watched this CLAMP masterpiece.  Xxxholic is a slice of life anime that showcases several supernatural settings that is in one way or another, very similar to real life situations. It shows how greed brings loss, lies can be fatal and how love andfriendship can save.  The story is about extra-ordinary events in Watanuki's life such as meeting creatures seen from folk and fairy tales and exploring different grounds known only from myth books, while working as a part-timer in a mysterious shop of Ichihara Yuuko, the witch that grants wishes for a price.  If you noticed how I emphasized this anime as a masterpiece, it's because I've never seen an anime done a marvelous job in connecting fantasy and reality than this one.  Regarding it's art and character, the design was good especially in creating Ichihara Yuuko (my favorite CLAMP character), the CLAMP expressed well how an Elegant Witch would be.  What I enjoyed the most is how every conflict was ended by a conclusion from Yuuko. In such ways, these words will be treasures not only br Watanuki but also by viewers on how they value the elements of life.  Every Slice of Life fan will surely love Xxxholic.";Recommended
16;xxxHOLiC;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;10;"I do love this show a lot but there are some problems in it too. Inconsistencies between the manga and the anime make me cringe just a tad. Now I have not actually read the manga, but I have seen enough to find that some of the artwork is not right, but we will get to that in a moment. This is pretty much Pet Shop of Horrors with wishes and spirits; sometimes their good, and sometimes they will try to rip you apart.  The story follows a fail of a boy named Watanuki. Pretty much everything he does, he messes up with and is always hunted down by spirits. He is the only one who can see them which makes him look like a fool most of the time when he runs around the town from spirits that seem to not exist. Now here is where some of the inconsistencies that I found. Almost every picture I have seen of him has two different eye colors but yet, the anime has given him both blue eyes. I am not sure exactly which is true but it’s what I’ve seen from the manga, it’s supposed to be the later. (Now that I have read the manga, I found out that it happens after a event.)  Yuuko is an interesting character and from what I’ve seen, they are actually alike between the manga and anime at least in looks. She has a way of getting what she wants with no worry as to what will happen to the other person although I believe she always knows it will work out. I never once saw her worried that something may happen.  If Watanuki wears his emotions on his sleeve, Domeki is the exact opposite. Maybe that’s why they make a great pair. Domeki cancels all of Watanuki’s crazy antics, giving mostly a base monotone as he speaks. I wish he was actually in the show more often and given a bigger role because it was really fun to see the conversation between him and Watanuki (and the idea of them being a yaoi pair makes my fan girl in me scream for joy...)  In fact, all the characters are pretty memorable as main characters except for one. Himawari is a little two plain and cheerful all the time. Sometimes I want to smack her hard because she just gets so annoying. There are many times that Yuko gives cryptic statements about her but it is never explained what is going on with her.  I somewhat understood all that was being said but then some of what they talked about, I felt would only make sense to a Japanese person such as the game ‘Angel’ which seems to be a Japanese version of Ouija Board or Wigi Board. When they first talked about it, I thought that it was something else. Another thing that is bothersome to me is that no one takes her advice, which I understand, some of the reasons for it but then they get into problems and suffer for it and I just have to roll my eyes at it.  The animation is alright but all the characters are much too thin and long limbed which makes it hard to watch sometimes. Even fluid movements would never make the shows good to me. There are many times when the artwork pretty much sucks for an anime, and really makes me wonder. It surprises me that such a low design could come from Clamp. In fact, the fact that there are references to other Clamp manga’s in the show is interesting if you take the time to pick them out. Sadly, the only details with this seem to be in the background except one or two things the characters end up wearing and the characters themselves are poorly lacking in detail and actual proportions with arms and legs going everywhere during freak outs. I also don’t like how their eyes are all blank. They have no high lights what so ever so it makes them look dead.  I really like the English Voice acting, which to me, it’s much better then the Japanese. The English has more fluid movement in fact then the Animation and feels like a cloud of smoke to the ears. At least for most of the things Yoko says. The other actors are pretty good for them going with Shizuka’s monotone to the crazy way Watanuki’s voice gets with some of the things he gets in to. Really I do feel sorry for the boy. The music is also really well done, giving it a really nice mystic feel to it and the opening is rather fun.  This show works a bit better in the manga because it explains so much more.";Recommended
17;xxxHOLiC;dbaranyi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dbaranyi;9;"The anime interpretation of CLAMP's story ""xxxHolic"" is a marvelously witty and stylishly animated look into the old saying, ""Be careful of what you wish for, because you might get it."" High school student Watanuki is not much different from most other guys his age. He just wants to outdo his rival Doumeki, and to win the affection of a pretty girl named Himawari who is in his class. But the ""difference"" in Watanuki is a bit more ""different"" than normal, because Watanuki attracts and can see spirits, but he can't keep them from bothering him.  This ""attraction"" eventually brings Watanuki to the very mysterious house/shop of an agelessly beautiful witch named Yuuko, who grants wishes for a price. Yuuko takes a fancy to Watanuki and offers to eventually rid him of his problem, but for the price of having Watanuki become an unpaid servant in Yuuko's very strange household. Watanuki very quickly learns that there are many things in the world that are much stranger than the spirits that pester him, as he gains both an education in life, and an odd sort of ""family"" to replace the one that he doesn't have.  The ""xxxHolic"" anime excels at mixing humor, horror, romance and pathos in surprising doses and patterns. The cast of characters are likeable and intriguing, and the stories skillfully reiterate classical morality tales. Add to this a very enjoyable sound track and theme songs, and the result is a series that is memorable and demands re-watching.";Recommended
18;xxxHOLiC;alienninjasaiyan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alienninjasaiyan;10;"xxxHolic is a 26-episode anime series produced by TBS and Production I.G. and is based on the CLAMP manga of the same name. It's a highly exciting and delightful anime, and will offer the viewer a different side of the CLAMP franchise. The art of the anime is superlative. It takes time to get adjusted to the slightly unconventional art, but one soon gets used to it. Additionally, every character except the lead characters is not clearly drawn; rather, you get gray silhouettes which serve to further accentuate the lead characters&rsquo; behavior. The lead characters themselves are very-well conceived of. Their physical structure embodies their traits, and gives us a sense of something slightly off from the real world. That said the story is eerily un-CLAMP-like. There are not many happy endings, just enough to get the reader hooked. Most times, the evildoer gets a punishment for what he has done, in a way that serves to hold his crime up to the moral judgment of the viewer. But the damage is not restricted; sometimes, even the person who is nearby or a family member also gets mixed up. The story at times seems so real-life that one has to literally shake his illusions away. Several philosophical issues are treated with such deftness that even the hardiest Sophist would be hard put to deny their efficacy on the viewer&rsquo;s mind. The character conceptualization is a work of pure finesse, characteristic of I.G. works. Watanuki is a deep study in psychology, Yuuko Ichihara is one of the charismatic philosophers ever seen in anime, and both Domeki and Himawari depict two sides of the human animal: the strong, disbelieving side, and the believer inside every one of us. Maru and Moro, as well as the irritably cute Mokona, serve to lighten the viewer&rsquo;s concentration with a dash of well-placed humor. Additional characters, such as the incredibly likable Vestal, and the hoity-toity Rain Sprite, also attract the viewer&rsquo;s affection or irritation: an altogether natural reaction that all anime hopes for. The music for the show is great. The OP, Suga Shikao&rsquo;s 19sai, is a foot-tapping number (and my flagship song, hee hee). Its tight vocals and awesome accompaniments will make it an effortless climber on your playlist for sure. The EDs are similarly awesome; the first one, Reason by Fonogenico, will bring out the goofy side of you, while the second ED, Kagerou by BUCK-TICK, is a great listen, well-assisted by the credit scene, where we see Maru and Moro playing air guitar. So, in conclusion, who do I recommend to? All the seriously concerned folks out there, for starters. Here many sensitive and basic ethical problems are treated with a delicacy and sophistry that&rsquo;ll probably satisfy all your dreams of being philosophers. Secondly, all you guys who like the fables and myths of Japan should check it out; these abound in the anime. Thirdly, I&rsquo;d recommend this anime to all those who enjoyed Ghost in the Shell and its beautiful leading lady; I assure you, Yuuko Ichihara is eminently suitable for your appreciation as well. But that&rsquo;s of course just a suggestion. All are welcome to see this funny yet serious, hysterical yet humbling view of men and their conception of their true worth in the world.";Recommended

Clamp's works remind me of Card Captor and Magic Knight Rayearth, both I enjoyed when I was in grade school, but watching them today doesn't make me a fan anymore. That's why I have doubts,, and doubts, and doubts, until....I heard the OPening...   Wushu!! it keeps on singing in my head until now,,for real..It definitely grew in me...How could you not like this? this song simply makes you for a good mood...and is so so so so appropriate for the anime it self...Yosh!  I never thought that I would love all the CHARACTERS in this one. Yuuko-san is the most LOVABLE Witch, as described in the DVD cover, I have ever known. it's okay that she isn't given much of a development compared to other leads because her general presence makes her femininity stand out the best!! I love her, she's like a bigger sister..Tee-hee ^__^  Watanuki is the most vulnerable male character I've ever met...hehehe, as if...He is so handsome when he is serious..I remember the first episode where he is walking in the street so seriously then suddenly started to run so fast as if someone is chasing him, later on revealed that he is being annoyed by the spirits which made him roll in the road for real...hehehe..so cute attention-getter for a start...He is voiced by my second favorite dubber, Jun Fukuyama,so great of him...  Is the relationship between Doumeki and Watanuki considered as Shounen Ai? Can it be called simply as Friendship? Why people have to label simple gestures as it is??? Sigh~~~ Whatever...  Anyways, the animation doesn't seem realistic..I mean how the characters are drawn, they don't seem like real people..But I think the artwork is great,,Well, I'm not really good with this technical stuff...hek hekkk.,,  Overall, this is a SUUUUPPPERRR recommended Anime. I have my best times, my average moments and my love-to-watch-it-at-night-but-is-so-scary-i-always-look-at-my-back syndrome...heheheheh   From me, Your Love BUG;Recommended
0;xxxHOLiC;JesuOtaku_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JesuOtaku_;5;On the technical side of things, I have many bones to pick with the art and animation here. Actually there are too many bones to pick out on these spaghetti people, who I feel like I could easily snap across my thumb if I ever pat them on the back, even the supernaturally voluptuous Yuuko. Seriously, that woman should have SPINAL PROBLEMS with a rack of that magnitude on that beanpole, and throughout the entire series’ run, I never got used to the tiny-headed, long-bodied creatures they call people in this show, or the way they move either. Really fluid animation could have compensated for this bizarre art style, maybe even made it really cool, but the animation here is middling at best, and oftentimes slips into shaky and poor. It’s just unsettling.  The music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it’s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY!  The dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki’s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I’ve ever heard. I’m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki’s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it’s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there’s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I’ll get to slam some bad voice acting…but not yet.  This series really isn’t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word “wasting” probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute “what the heck was that?” Let’s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another.  Mixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can’t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, “The Monkey’s Paw,” are a few among them. Still, I’m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb.  It’s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki’s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his “destined” servitude to Yuuko. It’s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP’s many other series, and if that’s a draw, you know you’re in trouble story-wise.  So, while there’s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino’s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I’ve reviewed that I can’t honestly recommend. It’s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise.  All in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it’s a hollow façade hiding a frequently boring show.

1;xxxHOLiC;MobbD;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MobbD;5;"Going into xxxHolic I had high hopes because the description and reviews of the anime gave the impression that it would be dark and creepy. What a disappointment! None of the ""scary"" stories would ever cause one to think twice about how ominous they are, let alone keep one up at night. The characters are so annoying and they say the same thing over and over, so many times in each episode that it will start to bother you. In my opinion the art design is lacking. WORST of all, after watching xxxHOLiC Kei, Rou, and Shunmuki there is no plot at all. I am not a fan of this series; for why check out the spoilers below.  Spoilers Alert, Spoilers Alert, Spoilers Alert, Spoilers Alert, Spoilers Alert, Spoilers Alert,...........  1. The main characters have so many issues -Yuuko never explains things 100%, she keeps things very vague -Watanuki mistreats the person who is suppose to be his best friend like trash even after saving his life he cant even say thank you -The girl he is in love with says the same BS every time......""you and (IDK what his name is and i am not going to bother to look it up even) are really alike"" -The love triangle comedy that comes up like 3 times every episode is so annoying and bland  2. The whole story has no plot -The series starts with Yuuko saying I will help cure you of seeing spirits -She never tells him how to do it, she just uses him like a maid -In the end she ends up disappearing on Watanuki without giving him his wish  3.

3;xxxHOLiC;Izayoi-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Izayoi-sama;6;This series didn't seem to have much of a plot and aside from the superstitious aspect, has characters and art that remind me of Ouran/Host Club. (Doumeki being the strong silent type like Mori senpai and Watanuki being the annoying Tamaki senpai.) The characters are unusually lengthy in both anime.  The one part that kept me watching were the lessons taught by Ichihara. She's very knowledgeable, wise, and likes to drink a lot. XD  This series is full of Eastern superstitions and interesting deities but the characters themselves (aside from Ichihara) span from downright annoying to needing more involvement in the series (Doumeki). I don't know what kind of people like a character as annoying as Watanuki, but if you can get past him then the other things in the series are interesting enough for a one time watch.;Mixed Feelings
4;xxxHOLiC;camay1997;https://myanimelist.net/profile/camay1997;6;"In the grand scheme of things I can't recommend this show. While I'm a big fan of different and outside the box anime, this felt lacking. It avoid all the cliches that one tires of in anime, but that's not enough. Noteworthy for not being note worthy. It mixes the genres of supernatural, comedy slice of life and romance, but doesn't excel at any of them. Also, it's not very exciting, and down right boring at times. It's at it's best when Yuko is granting wishes. But all in all it doesn't gain or build any steam. You'd think Watanuki would grow, learn, overcome and/or adapt but no (this becomes a problem considering how the last three episodes play out). So every character is reduced to one note that is repeated every episode. The very definition of lack of character development. While refreshing to see an anime stick with the same opening theme for 24 episodes, the two ending themes don't really fit the tone of the series. The gigantic bodies (or is it tiny heads?) that is the CLAMP signature is bothersome, but not annoying. It's distracting but not a distraction. It's worth pointing out because of a similar critique for Code Geass. Ultimately the principal thing I dislike here is Watanuki himself. He comes across as a terrible person. He constantly complains about his servitude and Yuko & Mokona's behavior, but masochistically complies. I get it he might face dire consequences for just quitting and walking out on Yuko, but we never catch a glimpse of that. His adoration of Himawari makes him a borderline stalker, flying into a rage whenever he talks to another male. And of course he can never simply just express his feelings for her without distraction or misunderstanding. Thus leaving the love unrequited, something I've grown to hate in anime. Then there's his baseless jealousy and envy of Doumeki. I understand Watanuki is suppose to portray an average high school boy with average high school boy insecurities; but Doumeki doesn't do anything to warrant Watanuki's outbursts. Maybe had I watched it when it was new (and I was ten years younger) I would have enjoyed it more. But c'est la vie, I watched it, it's over and I'm looking ahead to the next series.";Mixed Feelings
5;xxxHOLiC;0Unknown0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/0Unknown0;6;"Now when I first saw this anime, in my mind i thought it might be a good anime because I've seen many mystery anime but guess what I was wrong and let me tell you why. Be sure to know that this is my personal opinion and if I say something that you don't agree that's fine. I don't think I'll spoil it but i might just a bit because i was getting pretty pissed throughout the episode.  Story (7/10) : Okay so the story is alright but there were some episodes that didn't quite finish the story and was left not complete. Now I know this is a mystery anime, but some episodes were just left unfinished and i was quite piss because i wanted to know what exactly happen but it didn't show the next episode and went on to a different event or story whatever you want to called it. The story wasn't what i expected but it's quite nice and a bit funny to watch. So if you're looking for a good nice story. I suggest you watch this.  Art (9/10): It's great nothing to be concern about unless you're not into this kind of art. I gave that score it was because the people in the background was kind of disturbing since it has no color on them. You know what i mean when you watch it.  Sound (9/10): Not important to even talk about this since i find nothing serious wrong with it but just one thing that I found and it's quite of surprised that they missed it when airing this anime. I wonder if you guys can find it too.  Characters (5/10): Oh yeah this is what you're seeing five out of ten that's right the characters are horrible oh wait let me rephrase that again Watanuki , the main character, is horrible and i mean really horrible. Yes, he's a funny guy with a good heart but let's be serious okay because I'm pretty sure that I say something like I was pretty pissed throughout the episode, and he is what I would describe useless yes USELESS. He's the most useless MC (main character) I've ever seen and I mean really. I thought he would be a pretty good talker but no he's not what i thought he would be I mean yeah we wouldn't know until it seen it ourselves but let me tell you guys. If you're here to see a good know-how-to-solve character (Watanuki) I suggest you don't watch this. The other characters like Doumeki, Watanuki's ""love rival,"" is an okay character but nothing special about him, but I was kind of pissed at him too because he's the only person that always help Watanuki out which is like me watching a snake helping out a mouse. Himawari....that girl I didn't really pay much attention to her because i have no interest in her, but Yuuko is her who I really pay attention to. She's really mystery but it's what I like about her. There's more characters but they're not worth talking about. Don't be mistaken that I was talking about the style of the characters like they look skinny or whatever.  Enjoyment (7/10): Now just because I say something bad on the characters doesn't mean I wouldn't enjoy it but there were few I didn't quite to be honest with you. It's good what people would say it's nice and kind of smooth to watch (kind of).  Overall (6/10): It's fair. This first season was good and bad. The MC Watanuki is what I didn't enjoy watching him. I expected something good but no. He's what he is and I can't change anything from him and he doesn't change at all too. I would recommend this anime to people who is looking for a good story but if you're here for the characters or expect something from the Watanuki don't watch it. Let this be the final warning for you. I'll be watching the second season and see if there's something good would show but I highly doubt it. Anyway if you like this it's great but if you don't well that's too bad because you won't be liking it unless you don't care about Watanuki you're be fine.";Mixed Feelings
6;xxxHOLiC;AeroGunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AeroGunz;6;“xxxHOLiC” is what happens when You have a pretty nice premise but only surface level execution.  One day a high school student named Kimihiro Watanuki is assaulted by an apparition. Trying to get away he stumbles upon a strange house whose fence seems to save him from the attack. Inside he finds a mysterious store with an even more mysterious proprietress. She’s willing to get rid of the spirit that attached itself to the boy… for a price. Watanuki agrees and soon enough is freed from this burden. In exchange he becomes a part time worker in the mysterious shop that deals in wishes. His life, already full of the supernatural, is going to get a lot more fantasmal.  Despite having a few recurring characters the main cast consists of three characters: Kimihiro Watanuki - our protagonist. The boy didn’t have an easy life. His parents died when he was still very young and had to manage by himself. Thanks to that he’s dependable, a skilled cook and compassionate. Too compassionate as some episodes show. He also has a special skill - he can see and interact with the supernatural. Ghosts, apparitions, spirits and other, sometimes more sinister creatures are almost a daily occurrence for him. That said, he isn't like the protagonists of more recent anime. Most modern anime have a MC who is a blank page with mostly goals and little to no personality, that can’t make mistakes, the world bends over backwards for them and are OP in the confinement of their world rules. Watanuki isn’t like that. He has some personality. While it is true that he’s a bit of a pushover and does most things that he’s told he doesn’t just take it lying down. He’s rather mouthy when he doesn’t like something… or someone. He complains, loudly and despite often being ignored he still gives everyone a piece of his mind. He also makes mistakes. A lot. Some of them are rather costly. Because of his recklessness his friend (although Watanuki wouldn’t be caught dead calling him that) - Doumeki, is injured and risks his health and life to keep Watanuki out of harm's way. He also has a crush and isn’t especially shy about it… even if that got him nowhere. His power isn’t exactly all that powerful as well. He can see the supernatural but doesn’t have a special attack that can exorcise evil spirits that try to harm him, or even a sustainable way to ward it off. He’s very much vulnerable.  Shizuka Doumeki - Watanuki’s classmate and friend / rival / enemy (?). Yeah… they are friends, let’s be honest, but none of them would admit it, especially Watanuki. When it comes to demeanour he is the polar opposite of Watanuki. He’s stoic, at first glance cold and often sarcastic towards Watanuki. Despite that he helps him a lot even gets injured and saves his life on numerous occasions. He’s a member of the archery club and excels at it. A skill that helps him because he’s able to exorcise spirits using an arrow mage of energy he shoots from his bow. He isn’t able to actually see most of the apparitions but because of his upbringing he doesn’t make fun of Watanuki for stating he sees ghosts, nor he states he doesn’t believe him. Something that really rubs Watanuki the wrong way is the fact that Doumeki is popular with girls and even some spirits are in awe of his spirit. He loves to treat Watanuki as his personal chef but is more than willing to risk his life to save him.  Yuuko Ichihara - The true mystery of the show. She’s beautiful, mysterious and seemingly omniscient or at least close to it. She runs the shop that Watanuki works at and is responsible for freeing him from one of the apparitions that stalked him. Her shop deals in wishes and only people who need to find it even get to set a foot inside. She believes in equivalent exchange. For her services there always must be payment and always of equal value. No excess or scarcity is allowed. Something she uses against Watanuki everytime he needs her help. Despite being more than happy to use Watanuki as her personal errand boy the cook, she also acts like a mentor for him. She often warns him about the dangers that are nearby but allows him to make his own choices and mistakes simultaneously keeping a watchful eye on him. From the very beginning it is hinted that both she and her store are much more than meets the eye. Her knowledge of the supernatural and a collection of magic items hints at a long life of dealing with them. She seems to be fascinated by Watanaki and the path he will travel through life and doesn’t shy away from helping him grow… even if she does make him work more as payment.  I would like to make something clear: I don’t mind the heavy stylization of the characters. They give me a vague “Nightmare before Christmas” aka burtonesque vibe and as a fan of Burtonesque I can’t really complain. It may not be as detailed or full of personality in the case of Mise-en-scène as a proper burtonesque but the character stylization does the job. As a result I don’t intend to comment on the visuals. Simply put I don’t mind them and in some cases I believe that they amplify the drama.  The show is episodic in its format, we often get one problem per episode, sometimes per two episodes but that’s very rare. It uses urban legends, folklore and ghost stories as fuel for it’s plot. Most of the clients that come to Yuuko’s shop have wishes that can be granted with little to no supernatural help, just some good old fashioned armchair psychology from Armchair psychology from Yuuko combined with a little scare and maybe a touch of blackmail for good measure. That said, even in those cases there is often something supernatural. Like a smoke that is visible by Watanuki when a compulsive liar tells Yuuko her story or a visible sound wave when a young girl is depreciating herself. Other times Watanuki is faced with real spirits and other apparitions. Not all of them evil, like a fox running a food stand or a shy Zashiki-warashi that has a crush on him. Other times he is in serious danger like when facing a kind, gentle and loving spirit that sucks away at his life force (which she regrets… it’s hard to describe it without spoilers but those two episodes with her can hit pretty hard) or when a whole procession of spirits wants to eat him and Doumeki (and yes, it was all Watanuki’s fault).  The mysteries of the show are its weakest points unfortunately. There are four secrets that I was interested in but the show never really touched upon. Those were: Who/what is Yuuko? What’s the extent of Watanuki’s power? What’s the extent of Doumeki’s power? Why is Yuuko keeping Himawari close? It is hinted that there is a secret to Himawari but it’s treated as a throw away line. The everyday mysteries, if they can be called that way, are much simpler and often You know the answer before Yuuko turns into an exposition dump and just lays everything for all to hear. To be fair to the show because it wants to retain its “one problem per episode” format it has no choice but to be heavy handed and reliant on info dumps. Not all of them are bad but more often than not Yuuko just says obvious things that don’t mean much. Because of that the show suffers from lack of originality and immersion. It gives an interesting premise of the episode but then just resolves everything in a manner of minutes, like the aforementioned liar episode.  There are some episodes that were clearly given more love than others. The best example would be episodes 22 and 23 that have more personal drama and stakes for Watanuki than any other in the show. Another would be the episode with twin sisters, one an extrovert and the other a shy introvert or the snowball fight where everyone uses snow golems to fight. Even episodes that are seemingly lacking in originality like the one when Doumeki has his soul stolen have a twist that changes everything about them. More episodes should get this kind of love and imagination.  As a whole this show has a very similar vibe to “Petshop of horrors” or “Hell Girl”. Both use the supernatural to show different sides to human drama. But where those shows keep a more pessimistic, dramatic and suspenseful atmosphere for almost all of its runtime, “xxxHOLiC” doesn’t shy from a more optimistic, comedic and hopeful tone. Between the drama of people that come to the shop, the show gives us a look at the interaction between the cast. And it’s honestly pretty solid. Repetitive yes, I’m not gonna lie about that, but it’s entertaining enough that it helps with the overall pacing. Watching Watanuki interact with everyone and having a different approach to them is pretty solid and relatable writing (even if he does have one face for one member of the cast most of the time). The rivalry and banther with Doumeki, the infatuation with Himawari and a mix of respect and annoyance with Yuuko give the show a comic relief that it needs to let the drama breathe and give more of an impact.  All in all I don’t think the show is bad. I really enjoyed it with all of its pros and cons. Yes it lacks originality and most of the problems are resolved too fast in an info dump way but it still produces solid episodes and very likeable characters. I wish we got more episodes with Zashiki-warashi and her interactions with Watanuki and maybe more about Yuuko herself but the writing is decent enough to not bother me that much… until I got to the last episode and was disappointed that I didn’t get anything about her.  Would I recommend this show? That depends. If You liked “Hell Girl” or “Petshop of Horrors” You will enjoy this one. Probably even a bit more thanks to it pacing and giving a breather after one drama before setting up another one.  On the other hand if You expect good writing and organic plot You will be disappointed.  Personally I liked the show despite all its flaws;Mixed Feelings
0;xxxHOLiC;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;3;"Surprisingly enough, xxxHolic is the first request I've had for a Clamp review. For those of you who aren't familiar with the group, they're an all female group who started out writing doujinshi before moving on to professional work in 1987. They've been fairly prolific, but their end products tend to range considerably in quality. Some being spectacular, others being terrible. xxxHolic leans toward the latter.  xxxHolic is an anime that doesn't have an underlying plot so much as a series of loosely connected episodes that are all based off of Japanese folk lore. A young man named Watanuki can see spirits. He finds a shop that grants wishes and ends up working there part time. Shenanigans ensue. Most of the episodes have only very loose connections to each other. An anime can be setup like this and still be well done, but xxxholic isn't. One major issue that pops up multiple times is that serious moments, which should have some impact on the characters or the plots to come, are dropped and never mentioned again instead. Another issue is that the episodes don't really do anything interesting with the folklore. Instead it just throws the reference at you, follows up with some faux intellectual statement to wrap things up and moves on to the next thing. The comedic aspect is another area where it fails since there are very few moments that are actually funny. Most of the humour is based on Watanuki having really over the top reactions to what's going on and it's not particularly funny when they do it the first time. So doing it multiple times every bloody episode just gets repetitive and really boring. The semi-serious moments they try to have are also ruined by them always reverting to ""comedy"" quickly after those moments end.  The characters certainly don't make up for the largely absent plot. Each one has one or two exaggerated personality traits that define them. Watanuki over-reacts to things and is a tool. Doumeki helps Watanuki and has no visible reaction to anything. Himawari either doesn't understand the obvious or toys with Watanuki for fun. Yuuko always knows what's happening but only deals with issues personally when she has too. She also drinks a lot. And I just described the four major characters completely with a few adjectives. I could do the same for the secondary characters, but that would take a while. One other issue with the characters is that there are several plot lines involving individual characters that seem like they could potentially lead to development, but they either get dropped or go unresolved in favour of keeping the status quo.  The art is terrible. I'm used to borked proportions in anime, but xxxHolic just takes it too far. The characters have ludicrously long and slim limbs and bodies with tiny little heads. This makes them look more like models made out of string cheese than actual people. The backgrounds are generally sparse and the supernatural beings don't have much impact. They just look bland most of the time.  The voice work is difficult to judge. There are a lot of really talented voice actors working on this such as Nakai Kazuya, Ohara Sayaka, Itou Shizuka and Fukuyama Jun but they all adopt these really exaggerated voices which add to the lack of depth for their characters. I blame the direction since I know that all of them can do roles with depth. The music ranges from bad to generic.  The yuri factor is a 2.4/10. Simply because Yuuko gets really touchy with some of the other female characters and it comes off as a bit homoerotic.  My final rating for xxxHolic is a 3/10. The art is bad. The characters have no depth. It's not funny and what little story there is lacks interesting content. If you want a good anime grounded in Japanese myths there are far better options like Mushishi or Kino's Journey. If you want something by Clamp specifically there are still better anime, like Magic Knight Rayearth or Cardcaptor Sakura. As for xxxHolic, you can skip it.";Not Recommended
1;xxxHOLiC;Tuskus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tuskus;4;"xxxHolic (pronounced ""holic"") is an anime adaptation of a CLAMP manga of the same name. The anime was made as a 24-episode advertisement for the manga. There's no real overarching plot or even an end. The show expects you to read the manga if you want any kind of closure. This series is exactly what you'd expect from CLAMP. It's in each episode the main characters solve a person's problem, making the person happy by the end of the episode. If you've read anything by CLAMP you'll know what to expect. On top of that, the character designs for xxxHolic are downright ugly! Every character looks like some kind of demented Ent-frog with their tall, skinny bodies and long limbs. As much as I'm hating on it, it's not a terrible show. It's a lot like CLAMP's other non-Cardcaptor shows, remarkably average. So, if you've read the manga and want to see the exact same thing animated, then it might be worth checking out. But if you're not already in love with CLAMP, then you might want to skip this one.";Not Recommended
2;xxxHOLiC;cameronrb24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cameronrb24;4;"Quick Thoughts:  This show did not need to be 24 episodes. A premise is established early on regarding the main character's (Watanuki) ability to see spirits as well as his destiny in relation to his boss Yuko, but the show hardly delved deeper into it. Instead, xxxHolic follows an episodic format whose formula grew stale just several episodes in.  Story:  Yuko runs a shop that ""grants"" wishes, and these wishes are usually linked to something spiritual. Each episode generally involves Watanuki using his ability to see spirits to help Yuko fulfill those requests. There are some variations; such as more slice-of-life centered Watanuki's friend group, or episodes with more lighthearted interactions with spirits, but Yuko's requests are the main focus. Episodes conclude with the wishes being fulfilled, usually in a monkey paw type of way, and then Yuko monologues about the theme of the episode. This episode structure isn't bad, I think the elements supporting it (characters, art) were too weak too carry for 24 episodes.  Art:  Visually, xxxHolic is underwhelming at best. It seems like they were trying to go for a dark, mysterious vibe, but things like most of the background characters being grey silhouettes made the art seem flat and lazy. I never got used to the characters designs either; they're ridiculously lanky. It didn't seem consistent either. They would look fine in closer shots, but it seemed like as camera zoomed out, their heads would shrink and their limbs would extend. Animation-wise this show was fine. nothing notable.  Sound:  The soundtrack was simplistic, but pretty good overall. In particular, it worked well with the parts of the show that were more eerie in tone. Voice acting was solid as well. I did find Watanuki's voice a bit annoying, but it seems like that's the kind of voice they were going for.  Characters:  I think the characters and how they interact were a large part of why the show got stale so quickly. The main cast reacts to each other in very predicable ways. An example could be Watanuki's friend group: Watanuki either overacts to other character's antics in his shrieking voice or swoons over his love interest Himawari, Doumeki eggs him on by reacting nonchalantly, and then Himawari giggles and says Doumeki and Watanuki look like great friends or something. That's basically the slice-of-life portion of the show in a nutshell. The more serious side isn't much better. Having someone as goofy as Watanuki be the main character takes away a lot of the tension they try to build. Yuko helps mitigate this when she's actually on screen, but she's usually in the background playing a more supportive role for Watanuki.  Enjoyment:  I kind of enjoyed the show for what was in the first several episodes, but it dragged on too long and got repetitive in the latter half. Can't say I enjoyed it that much overall.";Not Recommended
3;xxxHOLiC;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;3;"NOTICE: This review covers the whole franchise; not just the first season. No need to make different reviews for the exact same show.  THE STAFF - Animated by Production I.G. which means it will have a good budget but the characters will behave like robots, or in this case like string puppets. - Directed by Mizushima Tsutome, who has some fame for his fondness of making comedies with cute chibi girls who act all erotic and/or violent (Hare+Guu, Dokuro-chan, Punie-chan, Squid Girl). Other than that, he is not good in anything else he was part of (especially with the crap he did in Blood-C and Another) and since this show is not about chibi girls it is not one of his better works. - Based on the manga by CLAMP, one of the most famous team of mangaka in the 90’s. Most of their numerous works have been adapted to anime and most of them were a hit in airing shares and sales. They have a style that combines the cute with the dark and know how to create spicy premises and hot romantic pairings. Sadly their stories are good only as far as premises go; their plots always fall apart under the lack of proper handling of their themes. You end up reading or watching just for the kinky situations and give up on the story. A note must be said here that they primarily make shoujo shows with lots of action and romance that ends up appealing to both genders. But since the shoujo is their base template, it is expected to focus almost entirely on character chemistry and visual aesthetics than… well, anything else.  SPECIFICS It is an almost entirely episodic show about Watanuki, a high school boy with a curse, working for Yuuko, an eccentric witch, in order to remove it and together dealing with supernatural cases concerning ghosts and demons. There is very little to write about the story; you can read the description of the premise and this is as far as the whole thing goes. There are some episodes in the second season that offer development to the main characters but it is still close to zero. And there is an OVA that exists purely to have a cross over with Tsubasa Chronicles, another CLAMP title that was nothing but a parade of cameos.  Because of the episodic nature there is very little character development throughout the seasons. Watanuki is just a typical hyperactive high school boy, and Yuuko is just an enchanting witch that loves to change clothes every episode. Just like in all CLAMP works, you mostly like them for their simple-minded personality and eccentric clothes. You tolerate everything just to see the sexual tension of Watanuki building up slowly next to the super hot Yuuki and you just wait for some spicy romance to occur… slow as always. There are some other interesting secondary characters from time to time but the show barely tries to offer backdrop stories for most of them, so they too have close to nothing as far as fleshing out goes.  The artwork is very good as far as cinematics, clothes, and decorations goes. There is a lot of detail given to make everything dark and plethoric as means to attract your attention. It is average to bad when it comes to animation, backgrounds, or character designs, since there is little actual motion, the sceneries are simplistic, and the characters look damn skinny and simplistically drawn.  There is nothing overall great regarding the music part. The first opening is somewhat good and there are some famous and professional voice actors in the cast but in all there is nothing I found above average or memorable. Most dialogues are dull, most BGM is passable.  Having close to no on-going plot and mostly style than substance is of course nothing new in the genre but it definitely looks less interesting than its cousin shows. - Mushishi is far better in atmosphere and philosophy. - Mononoke is far better in aesthetics and fleshing out the characters. - Bakemonogatari is far better in cinematics and fan service. - Natsume Yuujinchou is just… cuter with those cats. So in all, it is a boring and passable anime.  And now for some excused scorings.

0;s.CRY.ed;Nyron;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nyron;10;"Okay kids, time for some real talk. Dub Scryed is the best God damned show ever made, and will ever be made, in the history and future of visual entertainment. It's about this badass dude with a nuclear-powered arm and a jet engine on his back who takes shit from no man. Basically he enjoys his life living in an abandoned dentist's office in the slums with his loli fangirl until some uniformed douchebags from the city across the way show up to wreck his stuff and kidnap him. From that point on he, Kazuma The Shell Bullet (the main character. last names are for pussies), devotes his life to kicking their asses, especially this one pompus, justice-obsessed guy named Ryuho. He's pretty much your cliche bishounen hero and serves as the other main character of the show.  The main theme of the series is their rivalry in particular. No matter what else goes on in this show, it all ultimately boils down to our badass hero and our girly nerd hero wanting to beat the shit out of each other.  But seriously now, Scryed is basically what you'd get if you took Naruto, Bleach, DBZ and Code Geass, cut out the filler, terrible writing, homoerotic overtones and everything else that brings those shows down and put the gold left over into 26 episodes. Speaking of Code Geass, that series is literally just Scryed after Goro Taniguchi got paid tons of money to add Clamp art, school crap, robots and double the series length for no reason.  The pacing's good. The first half of the series has Kazuma coming to a classic shounen showdown with some of the wildest and most awesome/gimmicky/hateable enemies I've ever seen. In the background of all this, the plot develops as the big bad city and its police force comes into greater conflict with the slum people. Of course this all involves dudes with weird superpowers fighting too.  Later on in the show, after Kazuma breaks the universe in half with a flick of his wrist, the series jumps into overdrive and all sorts of awesome shit happens. Scryed shows that it can juggle multiple subplots at once with equal weight(something Code Geass wishes it could do btw), which does nothing but add to how awesome the last batch of eps are. The final episode of Scryed should be duly noted as the best final episode of anything ever. Not even exaggerating here.  Characters? Awesome. Many people confuse Kazuma with a cliche shounen hero, when in fact he's everything a good shounen hero has never been. Does he fight for his friends? Nah. Does he fight to become a great figure? No way. Does he fight just because he likes fighting? Well, yeah. Obv. But the key difference is that Kazuma does not give a DAMN. Do you have hostages and are threatening Kazuma? He'll just knock you the hell out with no regards for anyone else. He's impulsive, selfish, destructive, reckless, totally narrow-minded, PROUD and all the other things heroes are too balless or moral to be. These factors play heavily into his character development, as he becomes gradually more mentally unstable and self-destructive.  Then there's Ryuho. He's the polar opposite of Kazuma in every conceivable way in terms of personality, appearance, powers, back story, etc. Such is the point. He's almost as major as Kazuma, though I don't feel like typing a lot about him. Just note that he ""HATES EVERYTHING EVIL!""  There's also Straight Cougar as Crispin Freeman. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Hard to tell. Anyway he's the best character in the show besides Kazuma and a fan favorite. The whole premise of his person is to live fast and be awesome. He's actually stronger than both the main characters, but he doesn't even care enough to show it. That's how slick this guy is.  Others include: Kanami: Loli Narrator Kimishima: Kazuma's best bro, third best character right here Scheris: Boobs(in the manga) with Kari's voice from Digimon Mimori: The cancer of the series, we don't talk about her Jigmar: Mullet-clad commander of HOLY. sounds like Jelly Jiggler Tachibana: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSs_T23qqW4#t=02m00s Biff: HAMMMMMMMERRRRR Urizane: Has mighty watermelon powers Emergy: This guy actually summons a damn Gundam to fight Kazuma A humpback whale: The main enemy of the series Kyoji Mujo: The most wonderfully slick and antagonistic villain ever. He's actually just a gay elf but whatever.  Other Stuff: Hm... Music. Yes. As with like every Taniguchi show, this series has a plethora of dramatic Mexican trumpets, acoustic guitars, male choruses, etc which liven up action scenes, make dramatic scenes wonderfully Tele-Novela-esque in their cheesiness, etc. A+ OST.  Now let's shut up for a sec to talk about voices. You don't watch Scryed subbed. Let me repeat:  ###You DO NOT watch Scryed subbed.###  Not only does every sub group for this series suck horrendously in ways you can't begin to grasp(I hope you're reading this, incompetent ""FIST OF MY EGO!"" translators), but the original voices produce a very different series. A boring, desolate series only fools dare to tread where a really aggressive constipated boy does shoddy combat with some losers. A stark contrast to Dub Scryed(the correct title for the series) which follows the antiheroic exploits of a proud man with a prouder fist asserting himself upon dastardly cheesy wrongdoers who are running all up in his house. The scriptwriting in the dub is Pulitzer worthy, as shown by that youtube link above and these gems:  ""If it exists, I'll find it! Even if it doesn't!""  ""Kazuma~! How are you going to get out of this PINCH?"" ""You should know the answer... with my fist!!""  Oh yeah, there's art and animation too. Portions of the first few episodes of the series look very 90's, but as the series goes on it gets better and better. They actually spent a good portion of the budget on just the final episode, which is considerably smoother than previous ones and even features fully new transformation sequences and no stock footage at all. Not that there's much of that in the series in the first place.  SUMMARY: It's the son of G Gundam and First of the North star and the father of Needless and Gurren Lagann. Dub only, sub sucks. This is the only shounen fightan' anime you'll ever want or need to watch.";Recommended
1;s.CRY.ed;Stormy_77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stormy_77;7;"Story  The Lost Ground was created 22 years ago in the Kanazawa Prefecture when an unexplained geological / metaphysical phenomenon occurred which caused the ground to rise up into peaks accompanied by the release of a lot of energy. There were 2 effects of this. Firstly the Lost Ground split off from the Mainland. Secondly about 1% of the inhabitants of the Lost Ground gained special abilities to manipulate matter in various ways, they are called Alter Capabilists, with accompanying ""Alter"" abilities. If an Alter Capabilist's ability manifests in the form of a separate entity that separate entity is called an ""Alter"".  Politics makes this anime very interesting. There is the Mainland who treats the Lost Grounds as a sort of beggar nation. The city part of the Lost Ground has trade concessions and AID from the Mainland, and is separated from the rest of the Lost Ground by a high wall. Those outside ""The Wall"" are called Natives, and alter users there are Native Alters.  In order to combat the Lost Ground Native Alters, Lost Ground Admin sets up an institution called HOLD and a special division within that called HOLY which is basically Native Alters who have come to the Admin side in order to suppress other Native Alters from the other side of the wall. It's sort of like using mutants to fight other mutants. Also note that even within the Admin section of Lost Grounds, Alters are NOT accepted as equal citizens, but they are tolerated if they are members of HOLY.  What a WONDERFUL premise. Special people with powers. Politics. Socio-economic ramifications where the rich live in the city and the rest eke out a beggarly but INDEPENDENT existence outside the wall. Organized government vs. anarchy. Dictatorship vs. Freedom. By the time it hit episode 10, I was thinking ""this is GREAT"".  If all these wonderful possibilities had been taken to their conclusion I would have given story a 10, but it goes only part of the way there. I will say that the very last FRAME of the series brought the plot from a 8 to a solid 9. You'll understand when you see it.  Character  The main protagonist is Kazuma, the stereotypical rebel bad boy with a heart of gold. His alter is the ability to ""harden"" his right arm with metallic alloy which gives him the ability to smash through anything. At the beginning of the series he is a native alter living with his sweetheart, Kanami, who has masses of long red hair while keeping his identity as an alter ""mercenary for hire"" secret.  Before long he encounters Ryuhou, rich spoiled scion of an important industrial conglomerate who has emotional baggage from watching his mother die to a mysterous alter capabilist when he was a child. He is the co-protagonist and is the strong, silent, lawful type. He is the most gifted member of HOLY and is charged with suppressing Native Alters, because as everyone quickly figures out, only alters can fight other alters, normal humans don't stand a chance. Ryohou is ridiculously good looking. In typical aloof hero fashion, he is oblivious to the TWO girls who are in love with him.  Kazuma and Ryuhou start out as enemies but they don't stay that way as things progress. It all happens very naturally too. Sometimes I was not happy with the ""one dimensional"" nature of Kazuma as the competitive, I want to be the best/winner guy. It's too Dragonball Z. Ryuhou matured as the series progressed but even then there are some manly man man things that manly men can't change.  The cast of supporting characters is very well fleshed out, every single one of them. Straight Cougar is the comic relief but he has a ""deep"" side and ended up being my favorite characters. Shiree had the most amazing alter. The mainland princess is idealistic and unrealistic. Melon man has his own principles and the rest of the smaller guys you either liked or hated but they weren't easily forgotten. All in all the characters were very well done except for Kazuma's character development which could have been done better.  Art/Animation  By 2008 standards, this is fairly dated with TONS of frame reuse. Like every episode there's frame reuse. However to give credit to the artists the transformation scenes are very well drawn with excellent artistic licence, flow, color and creativity. You don't get bored of seeing the ""alters"" of various people. If not for this I would have rated Art a lot lower.  Sound  The first strains of the opening sounds reminded me of Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs""!! Serious!!! The alter sound effects were well done and voice acting was good. Not much else to say, nothing else jumped out at me as horrible or wonderful enough to give this more than a 7 rating.  Enjoyment  I didn't expect to enjoy this series as much as I did. Some parts of it were very predictable, characters fit into anime stereotypes but still with all the variety and interaction and plot driven devices this ended up being a very enjoyable watch. There's lots of fighting, cool alters, philosophical parts, drama, angst, love, what's not to like? Slightly better Art, a little more character development with Kazuma and pushing some other plot points to their conclusion would have made this a 10.";Recommended
2;s.CRY.ed;TeenTitan85;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TeenTitan85;10;"s-CRY-ed is one of my personal favorite animes. The wide set of characters is amazing, and the interaction between them is even better. In some way, all of them are connected through one another.  The story in a nutshell is set a few years after ""The Great Uprising"" and this in return sets up the character plots. Alters vs. HOLY. Alters are people who gained certain abilities from the incident a few years back, and they live outside the inner city just trying to survive, but HOLY wishes to either eliminate them all, or bring them to their side.  This show is very enjoyable. A lot of choice words thrown out here and there, nothing anyone hasn't heard before. If your a fan of DBZ, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. The story is great, the Animation is fantastic with awesome sound to go with it. As I said, the characters make the show even better, and it's just all around enjoyable.  Emotion also runs high in this one. A lot of anger from Kazuma, Scheris and Mimori make love a real issue for Ryuhou, and Ryuhou is just one of those lost boys trying to figure out what's really going on in the world and what really happened in his past. Kanami makes this story enjoyable too. And those are just a few of the most important characters. Cougar is a pretty funny guy too ;] The two main guys are Kazuma and Ryuhou, which in every other episode they're pretty much punching each other's faces into the ground, or arguing about something or other.  Overall, s-CRY-ed is one anime your not going to want to miss out on. The art is beautiful, the plot gets thicker and thicker as you get into further episodes, and you really have to pay attention in the beginning to understand everything to the fullest. This one isn't an anime you have to read the manga for either, so there's a plus. The manga goes into more details about the story, but oh well.  s-CRY-ed gets a 10/10 overall from me. Make sure to watch it sometime.";Recommended
3;s.CRY.ed;FullMetalTroopa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FullMetalTroopa;9;"You ready boys and girls? You ready for men's talk? Sit the fuck down and strap the fuck up. You have just been diagnosed with fucking HIV. You wanna know why? Because this show just had sex with you.  S-CRY-ED takes place on giant island, called The Lost Ground. Suddenly, the place just rose out of nowhere 22 years ago. People with special abilities are born sometimes called Alters. Most of the Lost ground is barren wasteland, With one exceptional city on it. We have 2 groups now. The city fuckers, and the natives surviving outside. In the city, a group exists called HOLD, within HOLD their is a group called HOLY. HOLY is made up of Altars organized to control other Altars outside the city, Native Altars. This story has such weak premises and devices, stuff we have all seen before. But the way it works with these is so astounding, its something i have never seen before.  Here is were we get to the center of this cream puff of fucking manliness. Wait, eww that sounded gay. Sorry, that aside we have one tough mother fucker named Kazuma. No last name, he doesn't need one. He lives with a 8 year old girl named Kaname who wants him to be a slave on a farm all the time. Kazuma say's he will do anything for money, so him and his buddy, Kimishima, take on jobs using Kazuma's Altar power. He turns his fucking arm into... A tougher arm and uses things on his back to propel forward using attacks like SHOCKING FIRST BULLET!  Anywho, tough guy Ryuhou is the second main character and he's working for HOLY. CAN YOU SAY JUSTICE?!?!?! Yeah hes the typical no evil good boy and all self righteous like Seto Kiba or maybe you could compare him to Suzaka from Code Geass. His altar is summoning his little doll to fight for him. Him and Kazuma, are EPIC rivals from beginning to end. At first hating each other guts in the first arc, to then teaming up in the second, but still wanting to kick each others ass, but with a respect. Personally, I like Ryuhou alot in the second half, just still not ass much as Kazuma.  Arts all like 2004-2006 what do you expect? I don't care that much so i just gave it a 9.  Sound is solid. Opening Reckless fire is sweet as hell and so is the ending. But one thing here. DUBBED fucking understand me subbed lovers? NO. YOU WATCH DUBBED. No exception.  We have a bunch of characters. From the ones in holy to the ones outside it. Development is really awesome but it kind of only comes after the second arc. My personal favorites is Straight Cougar, i guess he was like a mentor to Kazuma, and he uses the moves Kazuma does in the 1st stage of his altar. His motto is go through it fast so you have more time for the next thing. His altar is speedy mc speedy fuck awesome. I like most of the characters from watermelon man, to the ""Humpback whale""(Nyron) to Scheris who is Ryuhou's fanbase. One character i can NOT STAND is Mimori. Worst character ever. Give me a second to rant. She fucking love's Ryuhou, because she met him ONCE as a kid and has never seen him since and just follows him like fuck. Get a life. I hate this bitch. Whines and complains too. Perhaps she can cook? NO, probably not.  Anyway s-CRY-ed is underrated and freaking Incredible. I believe it to be a 10, and it deserves to be in my favorites. Here a gave it a 9, just because i don't want to look like as a review, i overlooked its problems because i didn't. As a master procrastinator i believe to save the worst for last. ALOT of characters have some build up but NO follow and through and at one point become completely useless. Tachibana or Jigmar for example. Also it is incredible cheesy, which i love, but something like that is a required taste. I love this show. Do you? Find out, because this is something that you don' want to miss.";Recommended
4;s.CRY.ed;xnipe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xnipe;8;The show itself is pretty average. Most of the characters are pretty much unimportant. The art and animation is pretty weak. The music was subpar. But overall I enjoyed the show alot. It made me excited to watch each episode and expect the next one to be more better. It pretty much delivered on that end because of one lone reason. The main character Kazuma. He is pretty much an anti-hero mold that doesn't take any bullshit. He is very decisive and does not get caught up in the small things. Basically he does not have any of the annoying characterics other popular shonen characters would have.  Honestly I wanted to give this show a 10, because I thought it was purely awesome with its fight scenes. Even if it was extremely cheesy with the characters finishing each other's line and all that other bread that comes with it. The two characters of Kazuma Straight Cougar pretty much make this show completely watchable even though Straight Cougar is not a lead. I did not think the story sucked since the story kept moving episode to episode but it failed to capture me in its setting. And Ryuhou is.. averagely cool in his own way even if he is the other main lead.;Recommended
5;s.CRY.ed;l0rdBradf0rd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/l0rdBradf0rd;8;S-cry-ed is a decent anime. I say decent because there were a lot of things the author could have done better. It was too short, something more could have been done with the characters. The plot was also a little stiff but it wasn't bad.  Enough about the negatives. This series is action packed, if your a fan of DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, or One Piece you will be engrossed in this series after about 5 minutes.  The Main character Kazuma is a bad ass, it is hard not to like him, this is one of the reasons I stuck with this series. The fights are intense and entertaining.  The series is good and I recommend watching it, but it could have been great,which upsets me.;Recommended
6;s.CRY.ed;OmegaKatana92;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OmegaKatana92;9;Despite being a nine out of ten I have to say I HAD A BLAST WITH THIS ANIME SERIES DESPITE IT'S HEAVY FLAWS! The story had some issues it takes place in a isolated island where people with special powers called alters reside and as a result an organization called holy are sent there from the main land to make sure the alters are under their control. The main characters are Kazuma (most awesome main character in the 2000's) and Ryuho (the Seto Kaiba/Ky Kiste of anime) well developed during the course of the series. From Fierce enemies to respectable allies. the other characters arent remarkable but do their parts decently but Kanmie (sorry for the misspelling) does here job well without being so annoying (man directors and mangaka please take notes if you want to do a shohen series.). The visuals are a huge blow for the enjoyment but not so much due to the story and action scenes. Also it's the gundam seeds character designer best work he was involve in. The ost however is a another huge blow/factor for this series besides the opening theme and ending are the best songs in the whole ost/soundtrack. Besides the flaws Scryed has to be in my top ten anime of all time due to the characters and the simple plot concept as well as the enjoyment level.;Recommended
7;s.CRY.ed;Ringrose;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ringrose;8;s-CRY-ed is an action series that follows the development of two young boys that have polar opposite world views. Both of them go through a character journey, losing things that are important to them and transforming both physically and mentally. Of course, there is a cast of regulars that appear and are interesting in their own right.  An early theme as the backdrop between Kazuma and Ryuho’s battles is Order versus Chaos. While it doesn’t stay the focus forever, it’s interesting to see how these viewpoints impact both the two main characters and the world around them, as well as the people that they meet. In the end, either they change someone’s view or at least take them out of commission.  Not every episode lands or is very important.. there are a few episodes that for half the runtime serve as more than recaps than actual story progression. But you can bet, however, that the next episode will pick up the slack the last one left. There are a few characters that I feel didn’t get the resolution they really needed, however.  Even where s-CRY-ed stumbles, there are still positive spots. The animation and sound are top-notch, and the fights between alter users are always entertaining at the least. The alter powers can range from gigantic guns to something like turning whatever you want into water.  In conclusion, s-CRY-ed is a good to show to watch if you want a consistently entertaining action show with a bit of self-reflection and solid character development. Just because it’s old doesn’t mean it isn’t gold.;Recommended
8;s.CRY.ed;Jezza_G;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jezza_G;10;"This show is awesome and remains one of my favorite of all time. I can't believe it isn't rated higher on this site. It's fast paced and full of action. There are plenty of amusing scenes, heart wrenching moments and everything else you could want in a show.  1. Story - For those Anime purists out there who can't just kick back and enjoy the show without a strong sub plot, the political and socioeconomic undertones in Scryed should be enough to keep you interested. A fight over a large area of land between the mainland, the wealthy citizens living on one side of the wall and the poor people who are doing everything they can to survive on the other side of the wall. The governments bid to harness the power of ""Alter"" by tracking down and experimenting on alter users. And in the middle of it all, the native alter Kasuma, determined to fight them at every turn.  2. Art - Not the best artwork. There was a lack of definition in the faces for me, but it honestly didn't bother me at all.  3. Characters - I felt most of the characters to be quite genuine (with the exception of the comic relief guys like Cougar) Cherise in particular and her unrequited love was very human.  4. Overall - Watched this series several times and love it every time I do. So do yourself a favor and give it a go.";Recommended
9;s.CRY.ed;KingofHeartsX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KingofHeartsX;8;"First Thing I should touch on is Scryed is alot better than people give it credit for but that's just my opinion so on to the review.  The series starts off strong with the introduction of the character Kazuma who is a native Alter in what is now the lost ground which was caused by an event called ""The Great Uprising"". In the lost ground there are ""Native Alters"" and Alters of Holy"" which is a government organization tasked with keeping the peace in the lost ground so that native alters do not effect the humans that live on the main land. The story of Scryed is simple but interesting at the same time the only thing I have an issue with is the charcters. Almost all the characters expect for Kazuma, Ryuhou, and Kanami get any push time. All around though it is a very enjoyable series. I recommended it to anybody who Likes, Zetman, Bleach, Trigun, Outlaw Star, or DBZ";Recommended
10;s.CRY.ed;Yung_Warrior;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yung_Warrior;8;"A perennially underrated gem, S-Cry-Ed will forever have life as a case study of what the late 90's/early 2000's vibe was like. Despite being marketed as a classically cheesy, over-the-top MANLY action series, this show not only succeeds on that front, but does so while including surprisingly nuanced characterization, brisk pacing, and a few daring creative choices that probably went on to inspire other series in big ways.  The setting is twenty or so years after the apocalypse, where a cataclysmic event breaks off a piece of Japan, the newly formed island becoming known as the ""Lost Ground"". The island becomes a lawless slum in the style of something like the Satelite from Yugioh 5D's or District 12 from The Hunger Games, both of which came after this by the way. Meanwhile, the mainland lives in prosperity with futuristic tech aplenty, the special forces unit HOLY on a mission to subjugate the lost ground and assimilate the people there into their society. Furthermore, the cataclysm triggered superpower mutations in a select percentage of the population known as ""Alter"" powers. This part sounds derivative, but in fact these Alter powers are uniquely and creative in implementation and execution. Rather than using generic elemental powers or ki blasts, the Alter powers include stuff like rewriting reality into a screenplay of the user's own creation (which can be broken by someone of sufficient will), throwing giant watermelons at the enemy, or being able to turn regular cars into hot pink turbo chargers. Sadly, the fights are not overly complex in terms of choreography, but the ideas are certainly memorable.  Fundamentally, the story is about the rivalry between the two main characters, Kazuma and Ryuho, as well as the stories of the people close to them. Interestingly, the conflict between the two is not precisely good vs evil as much as it lawful vs chaotic. Kazuma is the protagonist and undeniably heroic, but he can also be quite dickish at times and is overly impetuous, unfocused, and downright dumb at times. I wouldn't have it any other way - he is an enjoyable character and feels human. Likewise, Ryuho is quite dickish at times but is not ever really that evil. Even at his worst he never goes outside the bounds of his duty as a member of HOLY, and is often honorable, principled, and noble. The audience dislikes him because he opposes Kazuma, but I always liked both of them. Also notable is that Kazuma and Ryuho never succeed at winning the other over to their belief system, but learn to respect each other anyways, which is something I found refreshing.  Although Kazuma and Ryuho are fairly nuanced, most of the other side characters are fairly one-note in comparison. The most memorable by far is memelord Straight Cougar, with Crispin Freeman hamming it up (of course you are watching this dubbed). Otherwise, I liked Scheris and Kimishima. Mimori was pretty brutal at times, cannot lie.  The story goes to some surprisingly odd and weird places at times, but keeps a very fast pace and tells a complete story in 26 episodes. Unfortunately, the series was never too popular outside of a cult following in the west, but that's not so bad because the story actually has a beginning, middle, and end. Unthinkable these days. Two things to note - Kazuma's shell bullet is very similar to Issei Hyoudou's Sacred Gear from dxd, and the ending of this series echoes the ending of Naruto eerily. You can bet that many high-profile mangaka have S-Cry-Ed on the radar. They know a good story when they see one.  The animation was done by studio Sunrise, who also did Infinite Ryvius and Gundam Seed. Personally I am not a huge fan of their style but outside of my aesthetic preference I thought they did well on the production side of things. There are not that many re-used frames which is notable for a show centered around fighting. I would have personally loved to see how the show would have looked with Studio Gallop at the helm, but that's just me.  Overall, this series is a breath of fresh air in many ways and is one of my favorites. I heartily endorse it as one of those ""chill summer weeknight"" kinda shows.";Recommended

A goal in overtime, my daughter learning to crawl, an amazing encore at an Alkaline Trio concert. Now, after watching s-CRY-ed, I have a new reason to cheer.  The intro credits blast a mixture between a Mexican mariarchi band and jazzy rock number. You find yourself head bobbing while being caught up in character profiles and fight scenes. You're hooked before the first word is ever spoken. And then the series begins.  Right off the bat, you are introduced to our main lead character, Kazuma. He's not your typical hero. This guy is a fighter, not a lover. He doesn't care about anyone. He doesn't care about anything. Hell, he doesn't even care about himself. He just lives for the next chance to knock someone out. Does that sound like the greatest lead character ever?? Trick question. If you answered no, you're an idiot. Kazuma makes this series a spectacular journey.  Sure there is a plot involved. Two opposing factions battle for what they believe in to be right. Is either one right or wrong. NO!!! But who are you going to be pulling for. The bad ass kid from the wrong side of the tracks (Kazuma), or the spoiled rich kid who's perminantly ""on the rag"" (Ryuho).  It's the characters that truely make this a series worth not only watching, but owning as well. And I am not just referring to our protaginist. Sure he's cool, but the supporting cast is just as awesome. Each one has a ""power"" not seen in other ""power"" shows. You know the ""powers"" I'm talking about. Invisible, strong, mind control, speed, transformation etc. Boring and overused. These kids have unique physical attributes that make them stand out from the others. One can control a situation by writing it into a play. One summons a 20 foot pistol. One turns everything into water. Different and one of a kind powers. Another bonus.  The art style is your typical 90's art...AWESOME!!! Simple character designs and spectacular backdrops leave the eye wanting for nothing. The color schemes chosen for outfits and uniforms not only fit each character, but bring the character to life. They gives each one purpose and matches their personality perfectly.  As for the animation, another genius work of art. This show is plastered with some of the coolest and most addictive fights in anime history. You get to see how all your favorite characters stack up against our main dueling dude and watch them get pulvoristed. I don't mean to spoil anything, but he never losses.  All this being said, the show is not perfect. The plot is a little weak, some of the characters look and feel a little generic and one diminsional, and they could have finished the series (I strongly repeat COULD have) on a better note by ending the series an episode early. But these are very minor flaws.  All in all, if you love watching a good fight and love pulling for the underdog, this series is for you.";Recommended

There's a team of them working to iron out the differences, while others resort to violence. I found the series to be pretty enjoyable despite it's simple plot and progression, although I started to become disenchanted toward the end. Most, if not all of the fights were up-front with little thinking or strategy, and after seeing them play out the same way over and over it became boring.

1;s.CRY.ed;Jhale;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jhale;6;"Story: The story is mostly amazing, but it is also character-centric to a high degree. The reason I say ""mostly"" amazing is because of its male characters having tons of powerful scenes, but the non-amazing parts of the story are terrible as they deal with the female characters. This anime comes off as very sexist. None of the girls really pose a good fight to anyone and they are all put into serving roles 95% of the time while having minimal personality. I mostly remember them moaning, crying or calling out the male character names. They are basically objects and servants or non-existent. It never makes sense to have physically weak female characters in a world where super powers exist and while there are many, MANY shows that have managed to do it anyway. Even so, S-cry-ed is a tough act to follow when it comes to hatred of women. The female characters mostly do healing or nothing, even if they can fight. They are mostly defined by patience or faith, despite having abilities which should allow them to be more meaningful to the fate of anything.  Art: The art designs in this show are really good, in my opinion. Kazuma has a legendary character design, but other characters in the series have equally great designs. The fight scenes just look incredible most of the time.  Sound: Very solid. I like the ending theme more than the opening, but the soundtrack in the show itself really works, if I recall correctly.  Character: Like I said, female characters are terrible. Kazuma is a great character with deep manliness whereas his ""sidekick"" (I want to call her that) is boring and usually so one-dimensional that she can be characterized by calling out ""Kasu-kun"". She shows glimpses of a great character, but was never pushed far enough to make her seem like anything but a child archetype. Mimori is a character who seems like she could mean something, but is downright empty. Scheris' ""Eternal Devote"" is a phrase that has remained in my memory forever. I wish she was a good character, but she is also mostly empty and fails at everything despite being the most involved female character. None of Kazuma's real opponents are female.  Enjoyment: My enjoyment was low. Although the show was great, it was hard for me to really feel involved with it because the female characters were the ones I was invested in, but they never went anywhere meaningful for me.  Overall: 6 Fair. The show is really great if you are capable of ignoring its flaws. If I could, I would easily give it a score from 8-10.";Mixed Feelings

As far as shounen anime series go, it's not that I don't expect a certain type and amount of cliches, but I expect them to be built up steadily and solidly. The overwhelming majority of battles felt choreographically impoverished. Also, I am the kind of person that genuinely loves frequent battles, even to an excess, but they do have to serve a purpose. Many of the series' battles felt completely meaningless.  ◧ Gore elements: again, I don't expect massive amounts of blood loss and/or ruptured intestines from a shounen anime, but based on the unmistakenly destructive battles that tended to occur, I think that, one would reasonably expect something more than paper cuts and shaving nicks.  ◧ Plot: instead of focusing on a central antagonist, which is to be expected of a 26 episodes series, it spent the 1st half of its airtime on an antagonist that ended up being a de facto ally, while the 2nd half on the actual antagonist, with which the protagonists mostly engaged via proxy (a single person), before concluding with a 3' air battle. Also, the series concluded before adequately tackling with its most narratively significant theme, the existence of a parallel world.

Conceptually the themes are interesting on their own-but fall flat.  While watching, I found myself asking ""why?"" many times; mostly due to the lack of explanations or reasons presented in the show itself.  This anime is way too long, yet ironically 26 episodes isn't enough to present an idea, build on it, and flesh out a relatively small cast of characters.  Interesting ideas and problems that characters face are forgotten by the next episode, and characters that do absolutely nothing to progress the story somehow get boat loads of screen time.  There is no tension in the show at all. The special abilities that characters posses are not explained at all and the ""Alter ability"" generally has no rules or limits. Characters use and gain special powers and abilities out of nowhere just because something has to progress the story. This became more noticeable during the mid-end portion of the show.  The anime also suffers from not having a main antagonist. The show realizes this pretty deep in and tries to bumrush you with cannon-fodder villains to close it out.

0;number24;KANLen09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KANLen09;7;"One of the few rugby shows I initially scoffed at, at trying to be another abysmal Try Knights, but what it does, it does one thing well: sold the premise on bonds and friendship over the sport through improvement.  Being someone who is harsh on all aspects, I was surprised to find out that veteran script/series composer Rika Nanase is on this, and despite the no-name 3rd-rate production staff team onboard of this show, she definitely stands out as the main source of enjoyment, considering the ""cult following"" success of this show (for the 3 of you who watched this). Bleach, Eyeshield 21, Higurashi, Junjou Romantica, you name it, she has done all and shown her prowess at taking a genre and subconsciously subverting it to make up for the enjoyment experience, and it has certainly done in good spots.  What number24 is all about is not rugby, but the bishie sportsboys of Doushisha themselves. What the team comprises are of dreams of former players that don't belong and/or have given up in rugby, only to find themselves in the sport that's mostly persistent through the bonds and friendship of the bishounens involved.  Take the main team's quintuple for example: Natsusa Yuzuki, Yuu Mashiro, Yasunari Tsuru, Seiichirou Jingyouji and Ibuki Ueoka. These 5 have weaved the same red thread of fate for themselves in the path to find their true stance towards one another: Natsusa, being taken out of the team and imposed the Manager status (due to circumstances that rendered him unplayable on the field); Ibuki, who has lost his heart towards playing rugby and has no desire to take up the sport once again (but only does because of Natsusa's persistent teasing); Yasunari, in spite of being Natsusa's junior, has certain disagreements to how he'd function around the sport and leading his own private life; Yuu, in spite of his small size and although being barely fit to play, made him the Zhuge Liang team strategist and following under Natsusa's imposed leadership; Last but not least, Seiichirou, more than being the tropey childhood friend, is constantly being roped in by Natsusa due to his monotonous life and needing someone to lead his life.  Add in the seniors and juniors who only got less screentime and act as second fiddle alongside them, the characters overall are brutal for what they do, but it's also the same actions that teach them the meaning and spirit of camaraderie despite the different plays of all of them. Not to mention the light-hearted comedy that stems from Natsusa's improvised childishness to tease the characters so much it gives off a good chuckle. And that gets a very good sense of debunking the heart of this show, which starts off slow but gives a nice reward at the finish line.  Rightaway, the art/animation itself I really didn't have high hopes for and think much of since it's PRA (a studio mainly relying on outsource help), but to my genuine surprise that everything is clean and distilled, a better effort and not the far cry from Gonzo and Seven's efforts to produce Try Knights (like they have a very limited budget). Yes, everything is far from perfect (some PowerPoint-like recycled visuals), but it never really came off as something that's left to be desired. And for the longest time, breaking out of their shell to have a majority production stake is a good thing for the uninitiated. A fine job, really TBH, I'm impressed.  On the sound side, it's all fair, no complaints here. OP is good, and the numerous EDs are worth the ear-listening treatment from the bishie boys. A good job to the all-male VA team.  I'd think that for future sports shows like this going forward, constructing good character-driven stories is what keeps this genre flourishing, and also getting the right people to handle their job scopes (a.k.a Rika Nanase) is the first sign of relief that this isn't the low-tier that we've come to expect from shitty shows (a.k.a Try Knights, Cinderella Nine etc.). If only the anime industry have learned their lessons well...  Nevertheless, for sports fans, a good enticement of drama and play is essentialal, and I kid you not, this show delivers. Even as a guy who generally doesn't have a taste for bishie boys, this was a good treat to rest to, following the characters and living out their desired dreams and working together to achieve their goals. This is the fine gem amongst the rare in the rugby sports genre, in a fairly good way.";Recommended
1;number24;uzuxmxki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/uzuxmxki;8;Initially i did not think i would like this show however there is something so refreshing and lovely to me about the characters and how their bonds develop even within such a short period of time. I wont give it a 9 or 10 because it isnt complete but i truly believe it is worthy of a solid 8 based on what we have seen so far. I of course know the show isnt perfect, there are inconsistencies with the animation and other aspects which do affect the overall show however the best way i can describe the show is lustre. There is something about it (in my opinion the characters and their bonds) that make up for those other things. I felt emotionally invested, all the highs and lows really had my heart racing and it was very far from boring, the mal ratings surprise me to be honest because i believe this was super enjoyable. I really cannot wait for season 2!   the art was a solid 7, i love how the characters look and the obscure hairstyles for certain characters but the brightness (?) or colour scheme (yall im ngl i cant explain this part well idk the correct terms) was a tad bit off putting at first, it just seemed a little too bright. That aside it was quite nice and i liked it.  sound: Very good and fitting, never felt out of place. 8/10  character: easily a 9, Hands down one of my favourite main characters is now natsusa. He reminds me of a combo of saiki and tsukkishima but also has aspects that are so different and unique from any character i have seen. Aside from the main character, i was shocked by how well certain side characters were developed in such a short period of time. Of course some side characters felt like the classic background character with no purpose other than to shine light on the mains however considering the amount of characters and the length of the series this was a given. The characters have a very special place in my heart already.  Enjoyment: 8/10, it at times was annoying for me to understand what was going on during actual games, sometimes it was difficult to see the scores to be honest but aside from that it was extremely enjoyable.  overall: 8/10. I cannot in good faith give it a 9 or a 10, the flaws the show has whilst far from deal breaking are there nonetheless, however the lustre and appeal this show has is quite unique if despite certain imminent flaws the enjoyment across the board is still so high. I hope these flaws can be corrected a little in season 2 and this same character complex is continued.;Recommended
2;number24;guetea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/guetea;7;"If you're looking for a sports anime with a lot of focus on rugby and intense rugby matches that will have you at the edge of your seat, then I suggest you look somewhere else. But if you want a fun, uncomplicated anime about attractive college guys who occasionally play rugby, then you came to the right place.  Number24 is not an innovative anime, not deviating much from the tropes included in many similar anime from the past decade. It follows the members of an university rubgy club, showing the personal motivations and insecurities of the characters, as well and the interactions and conflict between them. Like many similar anime, it suffers from a weak plot (some episodes are completely all over the place in this regard) and the pacing is a bit of a mess. Also like many similar anime, it has waaay too many characters for a one cour anime, wasting time on trying to tell everyone's story instead of focusing more on the main characters and their stories. However, Number24 is one of the most enjoyable ""pretty boys anime"" I've watched.  The main characters are well fleshed out, with distinct personalities and motivations, and undergo positive development and growth. Natsusa is a really fun protagonist and his character arc of getting into terms with the fact that he can't play rugby anymore (not a spoiler, we're told this on the first 10 minutes) and trying to make the best out of his new circumstances was pretty touching and inspiring. It's also nice that the anime focuses a lot on the managers and showcases how much they help the team. The other four main characters (Yuu, Sei, Ibuki and Yasunari) all are very endearing, having their own character arcs, and all the secondaries are pretty fun. The dynamics between the characters are really fun, and if you enjoy having lots of ship teasing, you'll like this.  Imo the humor was also pretty fun, with some moments that legit had me laughing out loud, so even if the plot goes nowhere and the pacing was quite slow, this anime never bored me. The rugby scenes, while scarce, were in general exciting enough, especially in the last two episodes, and you don't need to have the slightest clue about rugby to enjoy them. The music is nice enough too, with three different EDS that alternate.  The acting was also pretty good overall, with some really well known names such as Saitou Souma (who plays a really fun character and does a great job) or Ishikawa Kaito.  In summary, if you're looking for some sports anime in the same fashion as haikyuu, you're going to be severely disappointed. But if you're looking for an anime more in the style of prince of stride or cheer danshi (but better than those imo) with likeable male characters and plenty of shippy fanservice and shirtless guys, then you'll probably have a good time with this.";Recommended

It's a daunting task to try and highlight so many characters in such a limited amount of episodes. However, the story flowed beautifully with dynamic characters, plenty of comedic relief, and a great emphasis on the bonds shared between teammates and the struggle to overcome one's own shortcomings. Each character is trying their best to move forward and improve themselves which was very enjoyable to watch.

5;number24;chi4you;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chi4you;8;"Sports anime? More like a Boys Life anime. I learned nothing about rugby but wholeheartedly enjoyed the character interactions and Natsusa being a snarky, lovable gremlin. For only 12 episodes, there was a lot of potential for the plot to be fleshed out more and for the character stories to be explored fully. Instead of a focus on the sport anime genre, this show falls into more of a slice-of-life category, so if you're down to relax and watch some chaos ensue from Natsusa's shenanigans, here you go.  STORY (8/10): For an original TV series, it COULD be better, but maybe if we get a season 2, then perhaps the pacing may see some improvement. There's some plot around the team assembling, internal conflict and friction between main and side characters. It wasn't necessarily tiring, but you could understand the frustrations and motivation of the people involved. There were several moving parts and many characters, so I feel like a bit more screen time could have been dedicated towards the main trio to fully tell their story. Understanding that the rugby team is big and the fact that we need to gain some perspective on each character involved to feel some empathy, for a 12 episode story, I think it may have been easier to just either make this 24 episodes so we can connect better or just skimp out on the non-main characters. I like the premise of where the story is going, however the animation team could have gone deeper so they can pour salt over our wounds. There's definitely more left to be desired.  ART (9/10): I like the art. It's aesthetically pleasing. It's the whole reason I started watching it. Natsusa is pretty. Yuu is cute. Yasunari looks badass. Seiichirou exudes ikemen energy. Ibuki.... is Ibuki. Plus I need to pinch all the junior's faces please. Also the ending credits theme has the softest art. Hnnnnng.  SOUND (7/10): Nothing too remarkable about it. I like the music box BGMs since it adds a touch of sweetness. Best song out of the 3 ED themes has got to be ""Kimi to Iru Nara"". It grabs your heart and puts it on chokehold. Whoever the heck directed Episode 8 knew what they were doing because the storyboard/music/art direction for that episode got me still thinkin about it.  CHARACTER (8/10): I started watching this show because I saw a clip of Natsusa being an obnoxious, snarky brat and I wholeheartedly love him for it. He is a refreshing change to the typical short / cute boy. He's got bite. He's got an attitude. And he doesn't want your patronizing sympathy. And he is 10000% a bully. He's hilarious. Plus, his interactions with Ibuki are the best. Short man has zero chill and is savage. Although Sei is a guy with little words, he is a sweetheart who deeply cares about Natsusa. I don't think there was enough air time to build on all of the other characters though, like Ibuki and Sei. They have solid premises and an interesting backstory that isn't discussed in detail because of the limited episodes.  ENJOYMENT (9/10): The show literally went ham within the first 20 seconds of the first episode. Our main boy gets into a car wreck and you get to see the moment that completely messes up his neck for life. That can actually happen to people in reality who end up suffering with chronic pain or relapses, and I think that was what drew me to the show at first. Every time he suffers, I physically wince from the pain on his behalf since I also personally injured my neck in the past and it is not fun. It's tragic. It's devastating. It's life-changing but admirable how Natsusa still tries to remain in the world of rugby as a manager even he can no longer be on the field. It's frustrating and can be a harsh reality for athletes or even regular people in our day to day lives. We're all one accident away from a potentially life-altering event that could impact our mobility. I don't recall watching any anime that focuses on these types of impacts about a character suffering from some disability/chronic pain, and that's what I appreciated about Number24. It's not like the typical sports anime with crazy superpowers (except for Ibuki and Sei's incredible skill I suppose-- but I don't follow rugby in real life to comment on how realistic their talent is). It's just a bunch of college dudes doing a sport they truly love. It's about basking in the sweet camaraderie of teamwork. It's about collectively working towards the same goal. It's about learning to let things go. Even if the show is rushed and we didn't get to see a lot of plot in detail, I feel that it was in the right direction. With more budget and HOPEFULLY a season 2, we can probably expect a jump in quality.  Overall (8/10): If you enjoy slice of life/character interactions and not an in-depth explanation of the sport, give this a try. Natsusa carries the cast with his humor and evil tendencies. The main trio are my favourite. There is untapped potential for how good Number24 could have been with all of the ideas introduced in the show, but I'll give them some credit for an original production. Also, the ship fuel has been fantastic. Much wholesome. Very comedic. I don't even care if they are platonic or baiting. This was so fun to watch and I hope we get a season 2. Their story is not finished!";Recommended
6;number24;cardamomo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cardamomo;8;"As I've stumbled on this anime, I was fairly surprised by a few little things which, in my opinion, contribute to make this one a work with some potential. Setting this first premise aside, let's start talking about some more specific aspects.  The story itself wasn't that bad and I found it quite enjoyable, but they could have surely done much better. On the good side, the secondary characters' dynamics were pretty good as they were somehow connected to each other but what leaves a bit to be desired is the final result, as it looks more like a mishmash of random events than a series of sub-plots that had some potential to become even more important in a future season. Even so, it was simple and easy to follow and, although the ending is quite rushed even for a anime that most likely will have a second season, at the end of the day the story in general was quite good.  Another aspect that left me with a sour taste in my mouth was the art; I truly loved all the characters' designs, but - especially in the second part - the animations were kinda crappy at some point and there were a few parts where the voice and the face didn't go along at all. It doesn't make sense if the character is speaking calmly but then his face suggests he's screaming, right?  As for the sound part, all the VAs did a great job portraying these characters and I don't have any major complaint about this aspect. Maybe the only ""bad"" point I can mention is that some parts felt kinda empty, but this has nothing to do with the dub and, apart from that, it was pretty good.  Finally, the characters. I was fairly impressed to see such a character like Natsusa having a main role as his counterpart in most spokons would be either a supporting cast or a second lead if they're really lucky. The analysis of his character was pretty good and I genuinely felt happy or sad for him as the story processed and he surely is a character you either love or hate, you still care for him. As for the other characters in the main cast, Seiichirou might come off as the cliché childhood friend who totally depends on Natsusa, but I think he's much more than that, it's just that we didn't get to see enough of him to think of him as a separate person. About Ibuki and Yuu, they're really good characters and they have been analyzed quite well, especially Ibuki as he largely contributes to create a different troupe for the main character than the one he was following before. About Yuu, we can say that his insecurities and struggles have been analyzed in dept and that he effectively achieves his goal to improve himself as a manager.  All in all, number24 was a pretty enjoyable anime and, if it wasn't for the sloppy animations and the confused sub-plots, it would have easily been one of the best, if not the best ""spokon"" (I'm not sure if it can really be called a spokon though.)  Sorry for my bad English!";Recommended

I will admit, I was expecting it to be super fruity, especially with the cover art? (No idea what to call it). But upon starting it, I was thoroughly surprised by the theme of friendship. There definitely were scenes that were questionable and fruity, but it wasn't overbearing and honestly, I would've had no complaints if there were more.  To start with, the characters are peak enjoyment for me. I love the MC and his very hot and cold personality. At one point he gets called a tsundere and that's pretty much what he is, except likable and funny. You don't see many MC's with this type of personality, they're usually A main character but not THE. There are many typical and common tropes but it was comforting. My favourite type of characters were part of the team like Sei, who is quiet, lowkey monotone and calm, but has a soft spot for one person. Many eccentric players, like the second years, who are either weird or sadistic (MC MC MC and one other). There is that boy who kinda looks like a girl and isn't as manly as the others, but he plays an important part, and adds to the plot.  The plot itself was straight-forward. The MC stays by rugby by being the manager to the team he played with and we see the team overcome fights, differences, jealousy etc etc. The pacing was perfect for 12 episodes, great character development and nearing a 9 at this point. I wish there was a season 2, but it ends on the right tone.  Overall, I highly suggest watching this. There's probably only about 4 girls shown (for about 15 secs max) throughout the entirety of this, so the testosterone level is HIGH. Which shouldn't be that surprising considering it's a sports anime about a guys COLLEGE rugby team. Think Free! in terms of character and plot but in rugby.";Recommended

I will try to keep this short and sweet so you can read it quickly to decide if you are going to watch this anime.  story: (no spoilers) the main character (Natsuya) got into a car accident and became not able to play rugby. He decided to join as the manager in a collage rugby club. And the anime talks about a senior of Natsuya, a junior of Natsuya, the kicker of the team and a the rest of the team. I really love rugby so I decided to watch this show. At first, the show was funny and cool but then, the events got random and messy. However, it was cool to see that Natsuya was a manager instead of a player so we can see the players play in a way the manager sees it. I also feel that the matches were way too short. Rugby matches are 80 minutes long, and there is no way they could cover the match in half an episode (10 minutes). The matches seemed like match high-lights, and not an actual rugby match. So 4/10 for the story, disappointing.  Art: Not much to say about it, I don't really love it but it is not bad. But my problem with the art are 1. the hair styles are way too weird. (Even for anime) 2. The colour scheme is way too pastel and bright, it bothered me a little. The animation has no problem, I am OK with it. 6/10, OK  Sound: Openings and Endings are pretty awesome, soundeffects and BGMs fit to the parts. 7/10, Nice  Characters: Except Natsuya who had an unique and fun personality and Ibuki who is the relatable dude, other characters had minimal to no real personality and character development. I feel that almost all the characters are way to ""childish"" for being collage student. I don't think Collage students are this easy to get that triggered and angry. For the designs, some characters looked way too young. Yuu looked like he could pass for a Grade 6 or 7 when he is in collage, I really though so at first. 5/10, so so.  Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the first episodes, they are funny and somewhat interesting. I would be looking forward to Wednesdays when new episodes come out. But for the last few episodes, I don't think I really enjoyed it or not, I only watched the last few episodes because I would like to know how the story ends or does the ending improve. I won't spoil for you. 6/10, fair.  Overall: 5, it is average";Mixed Feelings

2;number24;Resident_Green;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resident_Green;5;"TL; DR Who said that anime this average in every possible sense could be this watchable? I ended up liking every minute of it. A pretty boy for every taste, a snarky banters, a game that you don't need to understand to follow, and lots of drama. My brain left on a vacation, leaving me with two brain cells and they were enough to make the task done.  Summary. The plot is pretty sad if you think about it. A rugby prodigy got into a motorcycle accident and was left paralyzed for months. With a serious neck injury as a result of it (a herniated disk), even tackling him has paralyzing repercussions. And like that his rugby career is over. To stay in a game that he adores, Natsusa decides to transform from the player to the manager and trainer of the club. From that point onward, he figures out the club's internal drama and supports others. Dear, made myself depressed now. Besides the main storyline, several smaller ones are a joy to follow like who of them will go pro.  I fancy Natsusa, my cocky little gremlin. Put in an unfair and tragic situation, he chooses to focus on the things he can do, rather than drown in misery. But you can see that takes its toll on him. Aside from his resolve, he is pretty eccentric. Cunning and sarcastic, perceptive and opportunistic primadonna. A scheming sweet-talker. A little sh*t you will love. DON’T skip the ending theme.  It's a sports anime, so you know what that means...A bunch of pretty boys. Every guy here can be described in two three words: a big bro guy, a bad boy guy, a friendly chubby guy, a strict vice-captain guy, a lean smart guy... there are 24 of them, so start your list for easier memorization now! Some of them get some semblance of a thought-out personality, while others stayed one-dimensional. Either way, I like them hanging out together and being bros. By the time of the final game, I cared enough to be tense and worry about the score.  There are a lot of yaoi moments, but not official feelings. It’s quite obvious who is couple with who, even though it’s packaged as brotherly love. Dub goes one step further in that direction and amplifies words like thirsty or thick. There are some telling physical contacts and positions, too.  This anime lives for drama. Boys are always calling out and one-upping each other. Some rivalry here, some hurt feelings there, some buried history between. Many of the conflicts are solved by boys opening up and sharing their feelings, or throwing each other on the field. And at the end of each fight, some basic lesson about teamwork and self-confidence is served. ""Something something positive vibes, bla bla believe in yourself"". A pep talk never-ending.  Art is by far the weakest part of the anime. There is no fluidity of movement and lots of camera cuts when rugby is being played. Everything looks generic and done cheaply. And that eye coloring could be better. Also, why did they make the title design so ugly? It pains me to even look at it. And that crown on top of 24. A royalty? Really?";Mixed Feelings
0;makemagic;Jester_Monocle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jester_Monocle;3;"Very cool little musical number here. Recommend everyone to give the music video a watch. The art is what makes it feel special, it nails that storybook look while giving off a melancholic vibe. Only gets more entertaining as it goes on; very happy how it ended.  Though, it could very unclear halfway through depending on what kind of cliche you are thinking of when you see how things play out. Aside from that, the music is fine. Nothing to write home about. Definitely worth sitting through it for the few minutes it runs. But if you decided to watch this in the hopes it'll excite you for Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time, don't get your hopes up.

0;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia Specials;Asasphinx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asasphinx;7;These specials consist of 9 episodes with varying runtimes between 2-7 minutes each and in total last for about the duration of 2 normal anime episodes. These episodes are all slice of life moments based on different points in time during the show, but also consist of a good amount of character interactions and traces of lore from events in the show. The girls come in pairs of 2 each and they engage in casual banter as well as further fleshing out some relationships and individual character stories seen in the show.  The visuals for the most part consist of photographs and a few seconds long portions of animation with the characters talking over them. It's almost presented in a voiced visual novel format without the usual VN elements for sub watchers.  The final episode serves as an epilogue to the main series and is properly animated, but is unfortunately the shortest of the specials just giving you a just quick look at where the characters ended up following the end of the series. You're not missing too much if you don't want to watch them, but if you liked the main show, aren't gravely offended by brazen fanservice, and wouldn't mind more slice of life engagement with the girls why not watch it I say.;Recommended
0;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia;Sagoro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sagoro;7;"To tell the truth, I was not expecting much from this anime at all. Judging by all of the reviews and comments that I have seen floating around on the internet, I was prepared for a trainwreck. However I was pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong.  Xenoglossia's plot is ridiculous, to under-exaggerate. Add robots punching meteors together with Girl x Robot romance, and plot twists thrown left and right, and you get Xenoglossia. However, for a good part of the show - until just a little over half way - we have a story better categorised as a 'slice of life'. Rather, as a 'slice of a mecha pilot's life'. For some people, this may be seen as an euphemism for 'slow', but I digress. These episodes were used extremely well for building up character relationships and personalities. After this 'slow' beginning is the point where the action really starts, and we begin the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Viewers who survive until the end of the series will be rewarded with one of the best endings to ever grace anime. (Disclaimer - the previous sentence is subjective.)  Not having watched many mecha series before, my opinion on the art of the mecha may reek of inexperience, so I will just say that ""I did not dislike it"". Existing iDOLM@STER fans may be discomforted by the huge difference in character design initially, compared to the original designs, as was I. However the character designs have gradually grown onto me, and I can say that I have even come to like them. Other than that the animation is fluid, and there certainly are not many noticeable animation mistakes, as expected from Sunrise.  The background music is merely 'there'; not overwhelming, nor was it lacking. Voice acting was top notch, and never annoying or unnatural. The OPs and EDs were very catchy. I always enjoy the intro of EDs being played just before the ED animation sequence begins. Xenoglossia did this in every episode, if I am not mistaken, so it receives a bonus in this category for this.  Now we come to the best part of this anime. Remember that slow first half of the series? This is why it was seemingly slow: it is packed full of character development. It is only because half of the series is dedicated to introducing and building the characters that I was so attached to them. This is the first show I have watched where I was affected so deeply by the characters. Truly, my feelings reflected those of the characters - Haruka especially - and my heart was heavy when the characters were depressed. I could even understand Imber's feelings, who did not have a single line of dialogue throughout the entire show. It only through the continued exposure to the characters and their antics that we can notice these changes in character throughout the series. Because of this, every decision each character makes is clearly supported by their motivations. Coincidentally, this was the show which helped me fully understand the phrase 'character development'.  As you may deduce, I enjoyed this series immensely, and I could not bear to see that counter on MAL gradually rise to reach '26'. As I have said in the beginning, I had expected this show to be a trainwreck. But to my surprise, when I had finished this show, I felt very empty inside. This has only ever happened once before, when I finished K-On!!, which I loved at the time. I did not feel like starting up another series, or watching anime, for that matter, which only ever happens when I finish series that I grow very attached to.  So, what prompted me to write this review? Xenoglossia is so tremendously underrated that it depresses me. A score of 6.85 (at the time of this review) is usually reserved for very terrible anime. I am not saying that Xenoglossia is a masterpiece, but it definitely does not deserve such a low score. This score is easily explained though.  A reason for this is that there is not much in the way of action in this anime at all, for an anime which is categorised as 'mecha' and 'action'. Most of the action during the earlier half of this anime consists of robots punching meteors in space. It is only nearing the end of the series that there is any considerable amount of mecha action.  Xenoglossia is truly an exciting ride of emotions. It is a series that I will always look back on fondly, remembering the surprise I had when I could not let it go.";Recommended
1;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia;Jennpool;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jennpool;7;I'm mainly a fan of mecha anime, so never once did I wish to watch an Idolmaster anime. However, when I became aware of Xenoglossia, I decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a genuinely good mecha anime. The mechanical designs are unique and appealing, supported by supplemental information that lends Xenoglossia more Real Robot credibility than I expected.  I understand now that the cast of Xenoglossia aren't original to this anime, but debuted two years earlier in the original iDOLM@STER arcade game. If these are faithful adaptations of these characters, I can't say, but what I can tell you is that the characters presented here vary between good and great. I can pick out weaker, supporting characters, but I couldn't target any single member as poorly written. The development of the main, pre-existing characters is certainly one of Xenoglossia's strengths.  What I can't praise quite so much is Xenoglossia's music. It wasn't outstanding but it isn't bad at all either. There's one or two particularly nice tracks but overall it's simply 'good'.  There are two distinct halves to this anime, and the second is more typical of a mecha anime. Whereas the first half is very character driven and devotes most of its time to their development, the plot comes to the fore mainly in the second half. It's an admittedly strange plot but I still found it very enjoyable.  Overall, I think Xenoglossia is underrated. It's truly much better than it appears to be given credit for. I've read that is has since gained some popularity, and I would be happy if it continued to do so from now on.;Recommended
2;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia;_map;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_map;8;"As many other reviews are quick to point out, Idolmaster: Xenoglossia has quite a lot of stuff working against it. In fact, I think it has a lot *more* going against it than people seem to give it credit for. I would almost call it cursed!  For starters, the show aired on Mondays from April 03, 2007 to September 25, 2007... At 02:30 in the morning JST. Are you joking? We're talking about a timeslot where, if you were already into the whole 'mecha' thing, you would have to wake up at 08:30 AM on Sundays to catch the new Gurren Lagann, then set your alarm for 02:30 AM Monday to turn on the DVR so you could see whatever this new Idolmaster-meets-Eva thing was all about. Not to mention that if you were more into the cute girls side of the cute-girls-meets-mecha amalgam, then you were already staying up until midnight to catch the new Lucky Star!  Of course, none of that really matters now in the age of streaming. I just find it funny that, for one, a lot of young mecha fans probably experienced some very sleepy Tuesdays during the first term of their 2007 school year, but secondly, that it seems that this show has been fighting an uphill battle for survival since the moment it debuted — poor timeslot atop strange adaptation atop stranger romantic pretense atop the fact that the writers were pretty unashamedly cribbing off Evangelion's homework for a few of the finer points... and to top it all off, the show has the unfortunate distinction of also being released during the final phase of the transition from analogue to digital animation, giving it a certain style that it seems not many are particularly fond of and certainly didn't help in the all-too-easy Eva comparisons. So if any of the strangeness you've probably already read from other reviews is a turn off for you, then this is probably not a show you're going to care about in the least. There's a lot wrong with this show, and it would certainly be hard to argue that those things are ""good, actually"" in the way so many re-evaluations of older franchises seem to do. But if what you've seen elsewhere (romance? Eva-iM@S?) has peaked your interest enough to read another review but not enough to just go watch the show, let me be the one to humbily point you in that direction. This show is actually really, shockingly good despite what other people seem to think.  So if you *are* interested, then I do need to make one very important disclaimer. I've never seen an Idolmaster series before this one, nor have I played any of the games. That seems to be where at least a part of animosity toward this show stems from -> people saying that X or Y character ""wouldn't act this or that way in this situation"". I can't speak to that. I'll probably watch a season of Idolmaster now that I'm done with this, but if anything, that feels like the more appropriate way to do things, considering that the first season of Idolmaster proper didn't air until 2011 (which is another thing this show has going against it — could you imagine being an Idolmaster fan in the mid-2000s and the first time you get to really see these characters shine on screen is while they're piloting giant robots? I can only imagine it would be like if the first Project DIVA game ended up being a first person shooter or something! — hilarious and fascinating in its own way, but probably not in the least what you were hoping for).  My familiarity with the series aside, what I can say is that 1.) there is an unflinching sincerity to the setting which was both hilarious and engaging, and 2.) that whatever the distance between the characters in this show and their alternate selves from other Idolmaster parallel universes, the characters are good and while tropey and occasionally a bit contrived, gave the show that most important quality of a giant robot show: that I cared a lot more about the individual characters than I did about whatever was going on with the moon or the battles or whatever. Which is for the best, because those fight scenes are not good! But that's okay ; it's not really what the show's focusing on.  The setting and set-up to the show are endearing to a fault in my eyes. No spoilers here unless you care particularly deeply about experiencing the first 10 minutes for yourself —> Girl goes to an idol audition, flubs it, ends up getting an offer anyway, moves to Tokyo to join the agency, then lo and behold the audition wasn't for BEING an *idol*, it was for PILOTING an *iDOL* - the exceptionally contrived and silly name that they have given to the giant robots which no one in-universe seems to think is the least bit hokey. If you stopped right here for want of a show less -- well, hokey, then I could forgive that. For me, however, it lends an extremely strange sincerity to the show that endows it with this very disjointed sense of humor that permiates through every episode. It is at times a very profound show, asking questions about love and consciousness and what it means to be alive in the world, at times a very strange and silly show where teenage girls get jealous and angry at each other over very superficial things while trying to maintain a normal life and reach their dreams, and at times it is a bewilderingly written show which occasionally throws its hands up, gets bored with itself, and tries to contrive some reason for a girl to put on a sexy outfit. It all feels very goofy and human when it's not trying to be serious, and for better or for worse the all-over-the-placeness of the tone (and the tone IS all over the place) makes it feel human and interesting. I felt like I was seeing the world through the girls' eyes, not really understanding what the potential consequences and stakes of a given action really are -- things swing wildly between a ""fun and games"" sense of abandon and then suddenly crash down to reality and recontextualize everything before it. It's weirdly engaging!  I can't say too much about the characters or arcs without giving away more than I'm comfortable with, but I will note that, if you're anything like me, the first thing that caught your eye about this series was probably the mysterious ""Romance"" tag which seems to accompany this series on some websites but not others. So do be aware: this IS a romance show. The romance element of the show is more important than any of the fights or tragedies, because all those other things just dance around the romance which keeps the rest of the plot orbiting around it with its massive, bizzare gravitational pull. You should watch this show. You should watch it as a romance show -- albeit an unconventional one -- not as a mecha show or an idol show or an idolmaster spinoff. It's a weirdly executed, weirdly human, weirdly directed romance show written by people who were really, really into Evangelion and clearly wanted to make something LIKE Eva while exploring some of the other crevaces and possibilities left unexplored by Eva. And it's really, really good! Don't get me wrong, there's plenty wrong with it, but going into that stuff kind ruins the fun and surprise that the series has.  Ultimately, after watching a lot of other, newer, better animated, more cleanly written, and -- let's be honest -- more forgettable stuff this summer, I came across this weird little show by chance and watched it very hestantly because everyone seemed to hate it. The only positive reviews I could find seem to talk about it like it was a bag of potato chips -> fun in the moment, but ultimately just a cute little snack between heartier meals. I disagree completely! The show is great and completely worth a watch on its own. There's plenty bad stuff in there, but good, bad, in between, none of it is boring and I certainly don't think I'll forget it any time soon barring some unforeseen blunt force trauma.  Go watch it, go talk about the good parts and talk about the bad parts, go have a nice time watching a weird, goofy, inscrutable, and deeply human show. And have a good day while you're at it!";Recommended
0;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia;Malevolent;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Malevolent;5;"STORY: Well, there's not much to say except it was your basic fare. There are some hidden secrets and such, and many of the people are connected in some way. However, while there isn't a problem with this formula, it was executed terribly. Most of the &quot;revelations&quot; weren't surprising, and when you expected something great, it couldn't have been any further from it.  For a mecha anime, there was a surprising lack of action throughout the whole series until the end. When there was action, it was extremely boring. It's almost as if they were saving their budget for the end, and as a result, the ending significantly better than the rest. But still, this is not saying much. There were definitely some plot holes*, or at least events that should not have even happened if the characters had a fraction of a brain.  Oh, and look out for some episodes (not that I recommend watching it) that basically mirror NGE and musical ideals that parallel RahXephon somewhat. It just seems to be an extremely bad mashup of other mecha anime.  ART: I did like the designs of the mecha, especially when shown up close. Overall, the art was done quite well, and so was the animation -- again, it looked quite good for the last couple of episodes. There also weren't that many reused scenes (probably due to the lack of a significant amount of action). In fact, the only one I can't think of off the top of my head is the launch sequence.  SOUND: I won't go into this too much. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't excellent. However, along with the animation, it was one of the better aspects. Plus, you should not be basing a watch on sound when there are more imperative qualities that are lacking.  CHARACTER: This is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. I couldn't even count all the time I was left entirely disgusted with the amount of angst that all of the pilots had. Just when you think they became a better person and learned that important lesson, they regress back to exactly where they started. Talk about frustrating.  And of course, the relationship between Master and Idol was portrayed ridiculously. The main character, Haruka, said multiple times that she loved her Idol. She even called it her boyfriend. I am not making this up. No matter how many times they said that the Idols might have something equivalent to a heart, it's a ****ing robot. Really, it started to get extremely creepy.  OVERALL: I could go on about other faults with it. It's really just an average mecha anime, but they also did some very odd things with it. It just makes one question their thought process when they were making it. You also might be wondering why I finished it -- believe me, I had a hard time. But I just don't like to drop a series for some reason. So even though it was obvious that I don't like it, it wasn't bad enough to where I had to drop it. I definitely thought about it more than once; thank God it started to get better eventually (although it took around 18 episodes).   *PLOT HOLE; HUGE SPOILER: For example, why could Chihaya pilot Imber near the end all of a sudden when he was supposed to be so finicky?";Mixed Feelings
1;iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia;Asasphinx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asasphinx;6;"Prior to starting this show, I'd been eager to take that first step towards getting into the iDOLM@STER series one day, so of course I ended up here at the very first iDOLM@STER anime. Seeing the mixed reception this specific take on the series has made me all the more curious to watch it myself and I didn't really have too many expectations for it only wanting it to be decent...and I feel safe to say that that is exactly how I ended up feeling about this: it's really decent.  For the Mondenkind girls (Protagonists) we start with: Haruka, Iori, Makoto, Ritsuko, Azusa, Yukiho, & Ami. Yayoi is here too as Haruka's childhood friend, but made unaware of Haruka & her friends being mech pilots. For the Turiavita girl (Antagonists) we start with: Chihiya.  The first half of this show is for the most part a slice of life. These episodes may be considered slow to most, but they introduce us to the cast and the world so if you're here for the characters as seen in the games & the other version of iDOLM@STER you may appreciate it more. We're guided by the main protagonist Haruka Amami as she gets baited into becoming a mech pilot under the assumption that she was auditioning to become a music idol (kinda like me with this show) and starts to simmer into the idea of piloting a mech to save the world. We see her developing steady relationships with the rest of the girls clashing with them in various ways, becoming better accustomed with her mech Imber, and understanding the roles she and her friends serve in Mondenkind's mission objectives. Every interaction here helps to better serve the 2nd half where the plot starts to become more apparent after meeting everyone and getting a barebones grasp at what they seek to achieve. It does a good job at getting you to like the majority of the cast alongside Haruka by displaying the struggles each face, showcasing their individually view on things around them, and how they choose to act on those areas.  Without spoiling anything, plot is kinda strange. Government operation has a secret base of operations hiding in plain sight in the guise of a school where the objective is to aid mechs in destroying with chunks of the moon that fall at seemingly random intervals of time, which is kinda the general gist of why the mech concept is here and implemented. For some unexplained reason they need middle-high school girls to do pilot the mechs and they all develop these odd relationships with the mechs. The mechs are said to have core of which they derive some semblance of human emotion and feeling to a point where they can have brief conversations with as well as understand what the mechs want and feel through what I can only assume to be some odd spiritual connection, and I can't recall any explanation as to how it's even possible. And going on about lack of explanations, there are a lot of other things that'll happen and never get properly explained from large scale plot details to even some character details and some high-scale level of convenience that you're kinda just left to accept it and take in stride without letting downplay your experience by overthinking.  From a design standpoint of the whole show there's not much to write home about. The animation is good. Character designs are simple but I'd probably go out on a whim and say I kinda like some a bit better than the more polished versions in the main iDOLM@STER adaptation & revamp. I'll even say I appreciate the simplicity of their designs because it makes them feel more natural with the background characters around them. Though I'm dying to say it: Haruka looks A LOT like Cardcaptor Sakura in the show especially when wearing the ribbons & Chihiya is the spitting image of Misato Katsuragi from Evangelion in general so whenever those 2 clashed it was kinda like watching bizarre fan fiction at play.  I'm a bit surprised I don't have much to say about music given the series' name and all. THE OPs & EDs were all good, the 1st OP Binetsu S.O.S! was fire and kinda catchy, the ED Yuukyuu no Tabibito~Dear Boy was beaufiful in its own way, and the 2nd OP Zankoku yo Kibou to Nare felt like it set the mood of the 2nd half of the show pretty well. There's background music AT TIMES and it was simple having fulfilled its purpose while also a lot of moments left to the spoken dialogue of the characters.  I was expecting this to be similar to Macross or something integrating mech battles with idols singing, but this is purely a mecha and scarce acknowledgement of actual idol activity and seemingly minimal resemblance to what the main iDOLM@STER series and story should be like. Xenoglossia only seems like it's an iDOLM@STER show in name only while just using the characters' names and just loosely giving meaning to the term ""iDOLM@STER"" in it's own way. As flawed, odd, and unexpected this was as my first foray into the iDOLM@STER series I can't say I hated it. Perhaps those accustomed to the standard side of this series may struggle to accept it adjusting to my guess of character deviations and drastic change in setting and tone, but on it's own as a mecha anime it seems pretty decent. As someone who had no set expectations of this to begin with I actually ended up liking this more than I might've thought I would, but if asked if I'd recommend it...I'd say if you've got a good amount of patience and can showcase enough tolerance to let this show tell the tale it wants to in spite of it's clear-as-day issues.";Mixed Feelings

I am someone who enjoys all sorts of shows with idols involved, and as a fan AND player of IDOLM@STER, I wanted to give Xenolgossia a try. First of all I don't normally watch mecha, so my knowledge about them is minimal, to the point I can count with my hands and still have fingers left of the amount of shows that have them I have seen. When you jump into XENOGLOSSIA as an IDOLMASTER fan, you are prepared for the consequences. Aside from Haruka (which doesn't saves herself too much either, but it is the most intact character) all the character personalities are TWISTED, in the meaning that they aren't what you normally see on the franchise. Do you know Makoto? the one that strives to become girlier and wants to be an IDOL? She is DARN SEXY but very mean towards everyone, she only cares about missions and her big sister complex. Ami? DOCILE AND QUIET (wut) she is as energetic as her sister, but Xenoglossia didn't care, and made her to be a quiet (yet very helpful) girl. Yukiho? Not afraid of men anymore, still quiet, not so much change until later in the show. Chihaya? Well, not that she isn't like that, but they gave her plot, she is old and very dark as a person, even more than before, and I can go on and on about how the chars sucked... but there's a trick for this  The only way you can really enjoy this anime is to forget that this even has IDOLM@STER characters. Forget it, and you'll get your run of the mill EVA wannabe show. Realizing this sooner would had prevented the amounts of time the impressions I had on certain characters crumbled into tiny bits.  The story becomes good by the episode , but is still not good enough. If you are an IDOLM@STER fan, avoid this anime by all means. If you want to be tortured and suffer for the sake of supporting the franchise (like I myself thought was doing) do so prepared by reading the warnings above.;Not Recommended
0;gdgd Fairies Movie: tte Iu Eiga wa Dou kana...?;Robinne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Robinne;8;Welcome to the gdgd movie, the movie so absurd that even the translator didn't know what the frick these fairies twats were saying half of the time ! If you already loved the tv series you're in for a treat ! Still as smart and witty, it combines the best of both seasons, that is, the uncanny and hilarious nonsense cg gags as well as numerous pop culture references or even a new concept that goes in the continuity of dubbing lake, the 4koma manga line game, it won't disappoint you on these parts. But you'd be a fool to think this is just a 1 hour long regular episode ! While at the first glance it would seem to be the case, it is in reality much more ambitious than that, using its methodically planned lore to its full extent in a high fantasy setting as rich and dark as those of lotr or berserk (monsters are as dreadful as its cgi) it doesn't hesitate to kill and torture its characters in a tomino fashion that could remind you of ideon. I won't go in depth as to not spoil the fun of it but how the movie uses foreshadowing or the Chekhov's gun are mindboggingly impressive. Characterwise, our 3 adorable fairies are still the same as ever, what makes this movie superior in my opinion is the new group of multiethnical idols denpagumi that manages to put all the love live sunshine cast to shame, they didn't hesitate, for this occasion to use plenty of different musics and that's saying something considering than a single track represents a significantly heavier part of the budget than all its animation. It also reintegrates some of the side characters from the tv series and bring them in a new light to the audience. I'm probably preaching to the choir if you already cared to check this but this is definitely a sequel worth watching, improving on many aspects from its predecessors.;Recommended
0;gdgd Fairies;Mauno;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mauno;7;"Holy crap! I mean who thought that an anime with poor CG graphics, bland setting straight out of saturday mornings girls' cartoon and an animation studio nobody has ever heard of, could actually be kinda... good?  In my case, it all begun with a youtube video ""Piku Shiru Can't Stop"", which is a mash-up of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song and gdgd Fairies. I found it strangely entertaining and annoying at the same, and after a while I noticed that the 2nd season was among the on-going series. I watched some random episode and was pleasantly surprised how amusing it was, and right after got hooked on the 1st season.  To make it clear, this is no My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic kinda series that was targeted to little girls, but somehow grown men got around watching it. Gdgd fairies' forte is the constant flood of references and humour, most of which younger audiences wouldn't get in all its Japanese weirdness.  Most episodes go by the same formula: The opening, sitting around a table chatting (plenty with sit-com humour and tsukkomi), the room of might and magic (I think it was called something like that), where the fairies e.g. invent new sports such as bungee jumping from space and trying to catch a bread roll with your mouth at the same time. This represents the more physical and weird type humour much like the one you see in Monty Python.  Then there's also the magic spring that serves as a Teletubbie Screen that shows us another worlds that bear frightening similarities to Garry's mod videos. Then the seiyuus try to improvise and dub over these videos of naked old men soaring through the sky. This is literally improvising so the characters' ways of speech chages notably. The voice actors do a great job.  Finally, after the ED, is the next episode's preview, which actually is just a spoof of some popular anime such as Haruhi, Higurashi or Oreimo. It's way too easy to miss these, considering the relatively high entertainment value they have.   Overall, this is a better anime that anyone could reasonably expect. It's strange and funny as hell, but the animation is nothing to speak about and storyline non-existent. Many will definitely think gdgd fairies is just plain awful, but as many or more willl find it strangely addicting. Just watch some random episode like I did and find out.";Recommended
1;gdgd Fairies;wheatsquares33;https://myanimelist.net/profile/wheatsquares33;10;Comedy in anime can feel tired at times. Even the best series the genre has to offer will sometimes fall back on tropes that have been done a thousand times, whether in parodying them or outright playing them straight faced. That's not to say comedy anime is bad for this reason (it's one of my favorite genres), but sometimes the idea of watching a series completely out of left field in its comedy and presentation can feel refreshing and be a nice break from the same old stuff.  And this is why I love gdgd Fairies, a show that has legitimately made me laugh out loud harder and more frequently than any other anime series out there. The simple episode structure, excellently crafted jokes, unique visual style, likable characters, and overall fun atmosphere of this series work towards my considering gdgd Fairies a 10/10 show, meaning I love it on every conceivable level, which I will discuss here.  Each twelve minute episode of gdgd Fairies follows a three-part formula: the opening conversation bit, the Room of Spirit and Time, and the Dubbing Lake. The show follows pretty closely to this structure, though there may be an episode or two where one segment is cut out to make room for another one to be longer, and the final episode is completely fucking insane and does not follow the structure at all: you are not prepared for the final episode of season 1 of gdgd Fairies.  A typical episode of gdgd Fairies starts with the three main characters—the innocently dumb pkpk, quiet and mysterious krkr, and the more extroverted and cheeky shrshr—sitting around a table, drinking tea, and talking about some mundane topic, such as sleeping, sneezing, etc. While these conversations usually start in a reasonable place, they inevitably spiral out of control into hilariously imagined scenarios, which are visualized by the bizarre cast of background characters (which I will discuss later).  While the scenarios in these segments are funny in their own right, what really sells them is the chemistry of the characters. Despite being in a “cheap kids show”, the three main fairies are all adorable and lovable, each with a distinct yet realistic personality (none of the characters have gimmicks—they're all just dumb kids that feel real, not gag characters). Much like in a show like Lucky Star or K-On where a lot of the appeal is watching cute, authentic characters interacting with each other, pkpk, krkr, and shrshr are always a joy to watch on screen together, with dynamics that feel more realistic than many other more gag-oriented comedies.  The second segment of an episode of gdgd Fairies sees the three characters go into the “Room of Spirit and Time”, where their magical powers are greatly enhanced, allowing them to play batshit, absurd games that often reach massive scale. The scenarios presented in the first segment may be out there, the absurdist humor is pushed even farther in this segment, with some of the most unforgettable scenes in any comedy anime out there (shrshr launching herself out of a cannon to knock down over 600 old men stands out in my mind).  And finally, an episode of gdgd Fairies ends with the Dubbing Lake—a segment where the three fairies watch a short, silent, and strange clip and then make dialog based on what is happening in the clip. These scenes are often the funniest and some of the most memorable of the show, as the dialog here is actually improvised by the voice actresses themselves.  Watching the voice actresses fall in and out of character, playfully jab at each other's good or bad attempts at comedy, and often make genuinely gut-busting dialog makes the whole show feel like it was fun to make and work on in a way no other anime can. The voice actresses themselves almost feel like characters themselves, and learning about their own unique personalities and habits inform how we perceive the characters they portray. This extra bit of metanarrative makes the experience feel completely unlike any other anime out there (well, I say “unlike any other anime out there”, but there have been other series in this vein that have tried the same style of voice actresses improvising, like Straight Title Robot Anime and Tesagure Bukatsumono, but to a much lesser effect—I did not find either of these anime to be nearly as engaging as gdgd Fairies).  Now, if you've even looked at the poster for this show, you're probably thinking that there is one glaring aspect to this anime that I have yet to talk about in depth, and that is the way this show looks. Yes, gdgd Fairies is a low-budget CG kids show, but the fact that it is a cheap-looking CG show is part of what sells it so hard for me.  A lot of the comedy of gdgd Fairies is absurd, surreal, and just fucking weird, and the uncanny and unconventional artstyle of the show is able to capture the insanity of what is happening on screen better than any more traditionally styled show. While the main girls all manage to be adorable moe characters in their own unique ways, the “background characters” (stand-ins during games, “actors” in the Dubbing Lake, etc.) are all weirdly realistic looking, and the contrast between these real-ass looking people in their weird-ass situations makes the comedy that much funnier. Watching shrshr mow down 600 anime-looking old men is not as distinct and instantly memorable as watching her mow down 600 realistic old men. Absurdist comedy anime like Nichijou are funny in their own ways, sure, but there's just something about the contrasting, uncanny visuals of gdgd Fairies that really stands out to me.  Overall, gdgd Fairies is a unique anime that I love in every way. Sometimes anim can feel monotonous in terms of its visuals and content, and gdgd Fairies just exists in its own little bubble that feels untouched by anything else anime has ever tried to do. It's its own beast, and whether you absolutely love it like I do or just find it weird and offputting, I definitely think checking this show out worthwhile, just for the novelty of it. There is no other comedy anime out there that I have found to be so consistently funny, creative, and unique. It feels like gdgd Fairies has a goal in mind—to be an insane, absurdist clusterfuck of a comedy series that will leave you completely baffled by what is happening on screen, but not at the cost of sacrificing fun likable characters or solid comedy—and not only accomplishes it, but goes even further to add little details that aren't needed and metahumor and 4th wall breaking character depth.  If you are in the market for an original, hilarious comedy anime, definitely give this one a watch.  (note: I've given the Story a 10 and Sound an 8, but I'm equating story to content and therefore comedy and including voice acting in sound because the score is nonexistent, or at least I never noticed because it's not really necessary to fully enjoy this show.;Recommended
2;gdgd Fairies;KonataIwakura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KonataIwakura;10;"CGI. It's everywhere in anime nowadays, and some of them are made entirely out of it. Curiously, CGI exists in many forms, such as VRchat-based and MikuMikuDance-based anime. One of such MMD productions is Gdgd Fairies. This anime shows us the mental struggles of three little fairies called PikuPiku, ShiruShiru and KoroKoro (or more accurately, pkpk, shrshr and krkr), friends who gather everyday on a giant tree in the Fairy Forest to play around. In a formulaic but-not-quite manner, almost every episode starts with the fairies getting together for tea time, talking about their day, fun things they did or trivial things they've noticed about their daily lives. This always sparks a small discussion which goes completely off rails once their minds start brainstorming all kinds of solutions to scenarios they've cooked up, such as ""Need an unusual hobby with a twist? Why not watch theater buildings instead of the actual movies?"", all illustrated humorously.  Afterwards, it's time for the Dubbing Lake, where the girls switch through dimensions on the other side of a lake, TV style. The problem is, since they're merely watching a reflex of the other side, there's no sound. And so they dub over whatever's on the other side of the lake in turns, from a naked Saitama-ish dude farting through the skies to a fat lady dancing in lingerie as buildings collapse around her. This segment is highly notable for one reason: The voice actresses are not specifically in-character; they're ad-libbing through the entirety of each Dubbing Lake. We get to see their raw selves laugh, crack studio in-jokes nobody could hope to understand and say (hilariously) awkward things constantly with no script, with their characters animated accordingly. In the second season, the Dubbing Lake is replaced by a similar segment with even more ad-libbing goodness. Finally, we have the Room of Mental and Time, a magical room which amplifies the powers of the girls, allowing for infinite possibilities. At the end of every episode, the trio comes up with some kind of seemingly simple game or challenge which always descends into absolute chaos. This includes lauching themselves out of cannons to see who can knock over the most (not real) old men in a straight line (for reference, krkr knocks over 749 old men!), figuring out how to get people to watch your livestreams by showing them some magic, and doing a scavenger hunt while bungee-jumping from space. Again, this is a MMD anime, but if you were to watch this segment alone you'd think it was actually made in something like Garry's Mod due to how creatively crazy it gets with its usage of the 3D models.  Using the format to do things that would be impossible through regular animation and with a really special kind of narrative where we get to see the voice actresses bond with each other well beyond their script, Gdgd Fairies shows us that CGI doesn't exist solely to cut costs (CGI cars and the such in 2D anime are absolutely disgusting by the way) and that in the end, substance reigns over style especially in a medium where not everything can afford to look good.";Recommended
0;gdgd Fairies;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;gdgd Faeries is a bizarre comedy. In the sense that I couldn't find a Studio listed for it. It was directed by Sugahara Souta, who's done some stuff I've never heard of & written by Ishidate Koutarou, who has also done some work on things I've never heard of. I have no idea what to expect, so let's dive right in.  Story:  We follow three faeries, Pikupiku, Shirushiru & Korokoro as they boldly hang around a forest and chat. There are four basic types of gags in this anime. In the first, the three faeries sit around a stump with tea and just have strange comedic conversations on random topics. In the second, they go to the hyperbolic time chamber... I mean “room of mental and time” which resembles but is legally distinct from the similar area of empty space from Dragonball. In this room they basically play around with magic in absurd ways. The third type of comedy we get is the faeries gathering around a magic pool that let's them see into other worlds. And then the actresses ad lib responses to the random CG videos they're shown. The final type of gag comes with the next episode previews. Basically, instead of doing an actual preview they parody some other anime.  The comedy in this tends to be of the really rapid fire variety. Whatever's happening on screen, the japes come out at a pretty continuous pace. The comedy is also very hit and miss. When it's working, it's amusing enough but when it doesn't work it drags. During the conversation segments, for example, they might just ramble about something that isn't funny but you can tell they're trying to have some punchlines in there. The saving grace, when that happens, tends to be Koro coming in and just derailing the whole thing with a comedic non sequitur. You might get four minutes of a kind of boring conversation before that happens but it's something. The magic practice suffers a slightly different hang up. In those segments, they like to have more elaborate set ups leading to bizarre outcomes. The problem is that sometimes they just go on with one beyond the point where there was any good material for it. There are other times that the jokes end up being pretty obvious which isn't something you want in comedy that heavily relies on absurdity. The ad-libbed segments are actually my favourites. The actresses are quite clever at coming up with things to dub over the videos with. They're also clearly having a good time doing it and their cheer is more than a little infectious.  Characters:  This is one of those comedies where the characters are very simple but they complement one another pretty well and there are plenty of comedic opportunities to explore with their interactions. Which is good since this anime is mostly spent on the interactions.  Art:  There's no denying that this anime is pretty damn ugly. The CG looks like something you'd find from a particularly lazy Newgrounds animator. I thought Kemono Friends looked kind of bad, but compared to this it looks pretty decent. At least that series had more movement and more varied backgrounds. Then again, it probably wouldn't be practical to have the ad-libbed scenes in a work that put things like time & effort into the animation. So, maybe it's worth looking like they could have bought a single pack of gum if they used the entire animation budget.  Sound:  The main actresses of this give some good performances and not just with their improvisation skills. We've got Akesaka Satomi, Mizuhara Kaoru & Mimori Suzuko. The music is... it's okay. It's not a soundtrack you're likely to listen to outside of watching the anime but it serves its purpose.  Ho-yay:  There really isn't any. None of the conversations the trio have ever indicate anything that might be beyond friendship.  Final Thoughts:  So, that's gdgd Faeries. Overall, it's a series that looks pretty shit but it's not bad at all. It has its funny moments and both the characters and actresses work off of each other well. Is it one of the funniest anime you'll ever see? No. It's not an uproariously funny anime in general, to be honest. It's more one where the comedy is enjoyable and you can chuckle at it, when it works. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If it sounds like it could be your type of humour, I'd encourage you to try an episode or two. It may well work for you better than it did for me. Next Week I'll look at Twilight Q, no relation to a certain notorious book series.;Mixed Feelings
0;gdMen;Gundroog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gundroog;6;GudaGuda is one of the weirdest series of anime I had the pleasure to watch. They’re always weird, wacky and cheap but most of all they’re genuine and laid back. Hell, how often do you watch comedy anime that have actual adlib segments or embrace their low production values and use it for laughs? Those two are some of the staples for this franchise and unfortunately it’s not for everybody.  With that said GDMen is perhaps one of the weaker shows in the series. It still has all the staples but the focus of jokes and tone shifted a bit from casual discussions with absurd non-squirts to a slightly more focused story about characters that embody anime archetypes going on a mission to save the princess. Naturally it’s choke full of parodies of shonen, from a paranoid princess that sees kidnapping as little more than a dating opportunity to a fired up youthful protagonist whose hopes for a hot blooded adventured get curbed with every opportunity.  It sounds good on paper and I personally did get quite a few good laughs but like with all comedy your mileage might vary. There’s no denying that rapid fire of references to other shows in GDMen can get quite stale and self-awareness doesn’t always lead to the most witty humour but luckily it doesn’t dwell on any one segment for too long. Thanks to good pacing each 12 minutes episode felt like it was over in a flash and sometimes just left me wanting more.  With how harmless and quirky this show is I think it would be worth your time to give it a quick little try. Though you’re probably better off checking out GdGdFairies.;Mixed Feelings
0;gdMen;Mehless;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mehless;4;A spin-off that unfortunately pales in comparison to the original.  After finishing watching gdgd Fairies I was delighted to hear shortly after that a spin-off with male characters would come out. With each episode that then came out my excitement dipped as the things I hoped to see come out of this series did not transpire. This review will compare both series.  Both are intended as pure comedy series. Story does not matter, though I welcomed the attempt at having a running theme, though I wish it was more appropriately used instead of being forced most of the time. A lot of the jokes I felt failed to land, nor did they have a good set-up. The scripted segments felt bland and the improv sections even flatter. I was willing to cut some slack for the VAs since I assumed their ad-lib would improve over time, but it did not.  The series lacks the crazy, bizarre atmosphere of the original. The characters in gdMen felt boring and unrelatable. Some of the jokes relied WAY too much on throwing in random references just for the sake of it. When the original series used references it was often part of a much larger, grander joke, or is simply thrown in right before the OP.  I really wanted to like this series, but it failed. Please consider watching the original instead.;Not Recommended
0;ef: A Tale of Memories. - Prologue;Retro8bit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Retro8bit;8;"""Can anime be considered art?""  Well if you have ever seen the ""ef"" series before, then you already know the answer, as the anime has been well known for it's artistic style and drama, not seen often in a romance series. As the name of this title says, this version of the series is simply a 4 minute prologue to the first season (ef - a tale of memories). It gives little samples of what is expected to come in the actual anime. From Miyako and Kei's rivalry, to the growing friendship between Hiro and Chihiro! There really is little to anything new with this addiction, basically it show scenes from the actual series, but differs somewhat between them. For example, one character who was not in a certain scene during the series, has been added briefly to it. Or it may show a similar looking scene but shown from another angle. So yeah, other than a few tweaks here and there it remains pretty much the same. It gives a great taste of things to come, which is rightfully so since this prologue was released on DVD in Japan a few months before the actual anime aired. It overall does a good job of showing off the ""artistic ways"" of the series to come. Still, since this is only a 4 minute video which contains clips from the anime, it won't be anything in the way of special when compared to the actual series.  The art style is the same crisp and well detailed version from the anime, with great character design, smooth looking overviews, and well detailed backgrounds and environments.  The one thing I really enjoyed from this prologue, was where Yuu played the instrumental version of ""Yuukyuu no Tsubasa"" on the violin, truly a wonderful piece of music. Plus you get some great samples of the character voices through each scene! It really shows off what a moving soundtrack awaits!  They pretty much show every staple character from the series, from Miyako to Kyosuke, they are all here and accounted for. Now since this is only 4 minutes running time, it is split in half between character dialog and music scenes.  ""ef - a tale of memories prologue"" is a great taste of things to come, if you have never seen the actual anime series before, then this version is a great way to get an over view of what it's like. It must be said however that the series contains many extended medifore scenes, and won't be for everyone. But if you are looking for a different style of viewing an anime romance title, then this is a great starter!";Recommended
1;ef: A Tale of Memories. - Prologue;Argyll;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Argyll;10;"This review is attributed to the prologue ONLY.  I watched the prologue after the whole series (1st season). And I am glad I did not do it any earlier. The prologue (besides offering a good music video) is not required for understanding the anime. All ""mysteries"" about the characters will unwind as the series progresses. The prologue is presented as a brief quarrel between the two female main characters over the person they both like - a main conflict of one of the two stories in the series. However, it is, in my opinion, much more interesting to watch the series without the conflict already revealed. After all, the series is created such that viewers have to resonate and grasp the emotional turmoil of the characters and so gradually appreciate the conflicts.  Conclusion: DO NOT WATCH this prologue before viewing the actual anime!  (The rating scores are intended towards the actual series.)";Recommended

For example, is plot going to be an amnesiac gathering lost memories? An elderly person reflecting on memories of good and bad as they pop in mind?

This show has all the basic ingredients that's needed to make me cry. . However, not all shows with those basic ingredients have done so. What made this show so special then?  I guess the characters, and the way they were portrayed. They were all struggling... struggling with their dreams. What to do. Who to be with. That was portrayed in such a way that I completely fell into it, with my entire mind. It was as if I was standing next to them, having to watch them struggle through their dreams and loves... forcing me to cry, both in the good and bad times they were experiencing. Also, the animation and the way the scenes were made was really beautiful and enjoyable. It was something I've never seen before, and normally I'd probably say that it was weird, I guess. But with this show... it just fit in so perfectly. The ending of this show was also something that was enjoyable. When I started watching the show, I'd never think about the ending it had, and I'd definitely not like the idea of such an ending. However, after having watched it, I msut say that it was indeed the perfect way to sum it all up. It couldn't have been done more beautifully, not the slightest inch better. Not at all.

1;ef: A Tale of Memories.;KaminaKai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KaminaKai;9;“Put your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget…”  Ef – a tale of memories is one of those anime that will probably stay in your memory and will be used as a standard to compare with other similar series in the future. Why in the future? Because the entire series is so beautifully made that there is only a very small handful of shows that are worth comparing it to at present time. In fact, as far as animation quality and technique are concerned Ef – a tale of memories is one of a kind and will most likely remain so for some time to come.  The unique animation style is first shown in the first OP. While colourful images and sceneries directly taken out from the anime itself often proved to be an effective foreshadowing device (and a good way to capture viewers attention), the exact opposite apparently also work! With a simple coloured background plus a bunch of text, and some occasional symbolic representation of certain character/event, the OP of Ef – a tale of memories can be quite addictive to watch. Aside from the OP, the anime itself is equally impressive (if not more impressive). Extremely high quality animation is just a standard for this show. What makes it truly unique are the camera angles used in difference scenes, or in some cases the very effective use of repetitive text on the screen. The former often give viewers a greater view of things and present some background of the setting, while the latter case, the simple words and phrases are enough to advance the plot and at the same time depicts the mental state of the characters.  Viewers will most likely find the beginning of Ef – a tale of memories hard to follow. This can be attributed to the introduction of most (if not all) of the primary casts in the first episode. However, it was necessary to introduce all the seemingly unrelated characters at once since the storyline focuses deeply on the various characters’ developments. It should also be pointed out that a few of the secondary characters will actually become the main characters of the sequel, Ef – a tale of melodies. Thus becoming familiar with the sideline characters now will serve as a good foundation for the sequel.  There are two parallel plots occurring simultaneously. The first involve a simple love triangle between a guy and two girls (somewhat similar to True Tears for those who have seen it), personally I did not find this plot particularly well written. However, the second plot is what makes Ef – a tale of memories shine like a bright star among numerous other anime of the same genre (it is also where the title of the anime came from!). The concept of the second story was designed to move ones’ heart. It was built around pity and sadness. It was written in a way such that viewers will unconsciously find the couple destined to be together, yet due to some circumstances, made it near impossible for them to stay together. Overall, the story and characters are there to evoke a mixed array of emotions from us, the viewers.  As previously mentioned, the entire show is beautifully executed. This includes the music as well. From the BGM in the prelude episode to the OP to the BGM throughout the series to the ending, they all fulfill their purpose very nicely and matches perfectly with the particularly scene at that particularly moment. Personally, it was the amazing OP (plus stunning animation from the OP) that caught my attention to this series. The music are largely composed by Tenmon who happened to be the music composer of other great shows such as 5 Centimeters per Second, Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, et cetera.  Ef – a tale of memories is truly a great romance anime that all romance suckers should not miss. From unbelievably stunning animation to music to characters to story, there is hardly anything to complain about this show (aside from the lack of “big name” seiyu which some people care about). On the whole, Ef – a tale of memories is, without a doubt, one of the top romance anime of the decade.;Recommended
2;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Master10K;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Master10K;9;"ef - A Tales of Memories is a Psychological, Romance, Drama that may seem like all the other romance anime based of a visual novel (dating sim), yet there is something special about this one.  Video Alternative  The first episode of the series may seem pretty confusing and hard to follow, as the viewer is dragged, from one situation to another. However once you&rsquo;ve grasped the concept, it quickly becomes clear that this series is made up of two separate, main stories. From then on the show becomes easy to follow and to enjoy, for its uniqueness. There are so many twists and turns that are able to turn any anime cliche into a work of art.  The characters are great and very well defined, as they all developed in their own way, throughout the story. You will have some that are involved in a tangled web of romance, others with their own psychological issues and one in particular that is suffering from an illness (which I must say, has never been portrayed so well in a long time). These characters are then able to show a mixed array of emotions and in turn, makes us viewers feel a mixed array of emotions whilst watching them.  The animation and music quality are one of the best points as it illustrates scenes in such a way that you&rsquo;ll forget this anime was based of a visual novel (dating sim). This is just another one of the few SHAFT works that boast superb and somewhat unique artistic animation style and quality. The music is pretty amazing in its own way, with some really catchy OP and ED themes and during the show itself; there&rsquo;s also a wide collection of piano and violin melodies.  Overall ef- A Tales of Memories proved to be a truly captivating romance anime that excelled, far above expectations. Having to go up against the mighty titan that is &ldquo;Clannad&rdquo;, this short anime series proved to be a worthy opponent. It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable series to watch, as each episode brings forth an interesting development however some of these developments can make anyone feel slightly disturbed. But it's this that sets the anime series apart, from all else. If you have a soft spot for romance anime, then there is no chance you'll be disappointed with this work of art.  ^_^";Recommended
3;ef: A Tale of Memories.;MaxwellLily;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MaxwellLily;10;"ef - a tale of memories had everything to be just another harem show adapted from an eroge. The season also brought the incredibly antecipated Clannad, so many wouldn't have given this show a second thought. However, the way such a simple story was developed is different from any other eroge adaptation that has seen the light of day so far.  The story isn't that original if you think about it. Dependable girls that simply need the protagonist, a dose of drama here and there. You're certain you've seen it all before until there were twists you weren't expecting. Somehow, the distant story feels all the more reachable, that it doesn't seem like just another story anymore. The hurt, the love, the helplessness, it is easier to connect to them than you'd have thought, and although the pacing may be a bit fast, you'll be caught thinking &quot;Hey, if it were me, would I do diferently?&quot;  The art is unique. Some may question it, say that it ruins the atmosphere of drama and turns it into another &quot;SHAFT Freak Show&quot;. But that is not true. The colors are so vivid, it's like you're watching the emotions themselves. The facial expressions, the sky, the ocean. Everthing looks so bright and detailed, you wonder why no one thought about doing this before. Dark colors when the characters are down, shining colors when they're bursting with happiness. It's like a moving portrait. A work of ark.  The sound in ef is essential. Due to the eccentric art, there are times you can feel the tension rising through the background sound and the work of the seiyuus. The sound is sublime and as touching as the story itself. It's unpredictable and touching, and completely fitting for every situation. Each girl has their own theme, which show their hopes and fears. Not to mention the theme of the anime, Euphoric Field; even though it may have Engrish lyrics like so many others, it's shows completely what the show is about: hope.  The characters are more than they seem to be. What's most impressive about ef is how you can easily connect to the character's feelings. There are some flaws, yes, in the development. But the feelings are easy to connect and comprehend, the jealousy, the desperation, the love. The girls may be but princesses waiting for rescue, but their feelings can be dark and shadowed by real human flaws. And as each episode passes, you can see them grow, their emotions grow.  All in all, ef had everything to be 'just another show'. But between the two main stories, you're caught wanting more. It succeeds where many others have failed, at some times, being more touching than the big hit Clannad. But don't let the fact that it's a small series trick you. Have an open mind and embrace the emotional wreck that is ef. There are funny moments? Sure, why not. It's like the calm before the storm, and they lighten up the mood, almost trying to not prepare you for the worst. But ef is a drama series, and at that, it succeeds. And between all other 'drama' shows this season, it is the number one.";Recommended
4;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Ceptryn;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ceptryn;10;Stumbling across Tale of Memories amongst the sea of eroge adaptations is akin to finding a piece of artwork rivaling the Mona Lisa in playboy. Something so rare that its likely to be met by skepticism by friends till they experience the most unlikely gem themselves.  The premise of Tale of Memories isn't exactly original. It details the story of two guys. One who helps a girl who can only remember events for 13 hours achieve her dream. The other who must get over his indecisive nature before his love triangle becomes School days (i.e, deadly). But then, the Mona Lisa is just a picture of some chick smiling. The devil is in the details, and Memories tells these stories so flawlessly that you'll likely experience the joy and despair that each character faces first hand.  The second half of episode 7, for example involved a girl whose phone calls went unanswered for a day. While this likely gets a standard 2 minute treatment of a girl acting moe is any other anime, memories combines astounding voice acting with unprecedented symbolic visuals to form a portrayal of mental breakdown so powerful that it'll likely send Chuck Norris into a stunned stupor. Given that I have already given Clannad 10 for animation, memories deserves at least 11.  The artwork in Memories is astounding. While most anime are content to simply use animation to show what is happening on the screen, Memories goes several steps further, playing with everything from color saturation, transparencies, to background abstraction and non-standard cropping to convey powerful emotions in every scene.  This attention to detail permeates through all aspects of the series. The minor differences between episodes in the OP, the sudden scenes without color, everything has a purpose. Memories is one of those rare shows that deserves a immediate rewatch, for it is a joy to notice all the meaningful details you missed the first time round.  Memories only weakness is that like any piece of serious art, it is not friendly towards casual viewers. The first episode, with its unique presentation, and multiple intertwining characters, is likely to confuse. However, anyone who watches past episode 3 will be awarded with one of the most powerful and moving series they'll likely to have ever watched.  Just like the Mona Lisa, Tale of Memories isn't for everyone. It is not light hearted, it is not a romantic comedy, but it is a work of art. While the series is easy to be ignored on first glance, the closer you look, the more impressed you will be.;Recommended
5;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Demi_V;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Demi_V;9;Ef: A Tale of Memories (or rather, the ef series altogether) is what I consider one of the best romance anime out there. It’s not the cliché high school types with hesitant characters. Memories is far greater than any of those from its amazing artwork and unique cast. The characters are blunt and do not beat around the bush to slow down any development. The romance is not rushed, and the anime takes its time showing the memories the characters’ create together.  Memories has two separate stories. It focuses on the development of characters’ relationships while delivering the fantasy/supernatural aspects (e.g. Chihiro’s memory loss). The characters’ meetings are distinct and unexpected, and it becomes valuable throughout the anime. They all create both good and bad memories together to only become attached and inseparable. The story presents everything from all of the characters’ point of views to show how much they care for the other or the struggles of their daily lives. Each character has a dream and works to fulfill it as their significant other shows support. My only beef with Memories is that it is unbearably dramatic in some cases where it appears as a Shakespeare play than an anime with the characters’ excessive body movement during confrontations.  The best part about this anime is the characters’ bluntness. There’s no beating around the bush or annoying hesitancy from their speech. It keeps the drama moving with no unnecessary pauses of anxiety from the characters. Their honesty and monologue throughout the series reveal their hidden emotions and vast personalities. Supporting characters contribute to their relationships and offer advice or even a shoulder during tough times. It also adds to the comedy, seriousness, and uniqueness of the cast.  The Japanese seiyuu suited the characters’ personalities and emotions at appropriate times. The voices are so strong and compatible with the characters that you can grasp and feel the character's emotions. The music and sound effects are remarkable. Violin music and the rest of the background music fit the atmosphere and situations perfectly. Sound effects support the drama with echoes and repetition, such as a phone’s busy tone.  The art itself places Memories separately from other shows. The anime moves back and forth with the different color contrasts, transparency, floating words, illumination of the characters’ outline, silhouettes, all sorts of angles on the characters’ faces, etc. within a few seconds. It goes back and forth, and nothing is stable. It can either be so distracting or just appealing. The character design was good and distinguished the characters. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn. The animation had its moments where it was like an on-and-off switch. For example, one moment you can see movement in the ocean ripples, and the next moment it’s still. Regardless, the artwork and animation fits the characters’ artistic vision and reflects on the emotions presented in Memories.  Ef: A Tale of Memories is a must-watch for anyone who is into romance and tired of the cliché show with indecisive characters, which is why it is one of my favorites. It’s full of surprises and it does not annoyingly include naïve characters that show down the progression of a relationship. The art and animation is unique and fit the anime perfectly. It's indeed a very heartwarming and charming anime.;Recommended
6;ef: A Tale of Memories.;game8910;https://myanimelist.net/profile/game8910;9;When I was recommended ef - a tale of memories, I was not expecting much since it looked like another romance/drama show, and in the end it was, but it was not just like any other series out there...this one felt a little unique in its own way. Mostly because of how everything was delievered.  Story: This anime is mainly divided by two main stories happening simultaneously. Most of the episodes would focus half of its airtime to one story and they switch to the other one. IMO this didnt bother me but it does kill some momentum if there is something important going on. This story is really powerful and has some really shocking, sad and happy moments as well. I'll be honest and say that I favoured Hirono's story more than Renji's even if Renji's was filled with more tragedy while Hirono's had more drama, and that I also didnt really get into this story until after ep 7.  Art: I mentioned episode 7 because the last minutes of that episode have been one of the most breathtaking, unique, and even scary moments I've seen in any anime...the way the 99 messages where displayed was REALLY powerful and it would leave anyone with their jaws open. Now that I've mentioned that I can say that I'm giving this score to the art but not because of character animation but because of the scenery and the backgrounds. Also this show felt like watching an abstract piece of art in a way, with the way they would invert the backgrounds or even deliver some of the content, an example would be having 3 different ED songs and it would change between the 3 almost every episode, same goes with showed the OP for the first time AFTER then end of ep 2, and ep 12 when the OP was indeed changed with the JAPANESE version of the song...this is IMO the show's best feature.  Sound: I dont have much to say about the sound, other than they really made a great job on using the correct sounds at the correct moments. So in the end this score is mostly about not how good it is but how good it was used  Characters: I never really got attached to any character in the show but every character was really well developed along the conflicts and their reactions seemed to fit their looks perfectly. Chihiro was IMO the best developed character in this show.  Enjoyment: I dont have much to say, this show was really good and i found it quite unique.  Overall this is one of the better drama/romance shows out there and should definitely give it a try since I'm sure you will get amazed at the way this show delivers It's story.;Recommended
7;ef: A Tale of Memories.;MiakaDiva;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MiakaDiva;8;"I recently watched this series after I saw some recommendations about it when surfing the Kimi ga Nozomu eien page. Did it live up to my expectations ? Well, let's see....  Story  First off, please don&rsquo;t let the first episode turn you away especially if you never looked at summaries or played the games. I admit that I was confused after watching the first episode. After the first 3 episodes, it should be smooth. Aside from this, the story is excellent. For a 12 episodes anime, the character development is great. By the end, you pretty much know all of the main characters, their past and why they act in such a way. The ending is satisfactory although it leaves plenty of intrigue for another season to happen. Also, it certainly has a great replay value. Lots of things will make a lot more sense when I re-watch it. For example, the way some scenes were edited, the texts and words that come before some scenes and even during the opening songs, the different ending songs all have significance. I still haven&rsquo;t figured out everything since it was my first viewing but it will be fun to re-watch with another perspective.  Art  Picture perfect. The characters are well drawn and mostly colourful. The places and backgrounds feel real.  Music  The music fits the series well. From the prologue to opening song, the multiple ending songs and the dramatic moments.. It really adds to the story. Great soundtrack.  Characters  Like I previously said, the character development for such a short series is tremendous. You really feel like you know the main characters by the end. They made sure to show some flashes of their past throughout the series so you can get a better understanding of the way they&rsquo;re acting. They all had some kind of trauma in their past that prevents them from doing something or making the right choices. I would have loved to see more from some of the supporting characters like Yu and Yuko. Even if they were not well developed, you get a feel that there&rsquo;s more to them than meets the eye.  Enjoyment  I enjoyed the series and I&rsquo;m definitely going to re-watch it . If you like a short series that has some drama , romance, great characters , excellent music and great art, this is for you!!  Overall  I gave it a eight. For most parts, it lived to my expectations. However, the thing that prevents me from giving it a higher mark was because I just felt it peaked at episode 11. The ending was good but I found myself on the edge of my seat at episode 11 not so much at episode 12. Aside from that, great series and I&rsquo;ll be waiting for another season.";Recommended
8;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Mr_Cherry;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mr_Cherry;9;"ef : A tale of memories..  This is my first review of an anime or it would be better if i said the first time i though of writing one...  I was attracted to start watching this anime only because of its overall but it seems to be far more fascinating than i expected it to be..  Lets go straight at my impressions as far as the story, the characters and the effects of this anime are concerned.  Story (10)  The first episode, which i tried to watch with a friend but i never finished it, was very complicated for me. There were many blanks at my mind and many things i just could not understand. Remember that this is not a romance story like others and this can be revealed even from the first episode. As i said i wasnt very attracted by the first episode and so will you. But as the episodes were reaching at the end and as the plot was continuing i stuck at it before i could understand it. It's not just a romance story but also a social modern fairytale which passes many messages to whoever watch this. Imagine how good and weird (in a good way) the story was that i score it with a 10/10 even if im not a romance or drama lover.... The hint of this anime's success is the fact that the story isnt limited at only one couple of people but much more that take place at the same time... Its just gorgeous... I dont like speaking of the end of an anime so i just want you to trust me and discover it by your own.  Art and Sound (9)  The effects are very carefully chosen and some of them are of high importance for the plot.   Character (10)  As i said the story could be described as a social modern fairytale. Each of the characters has its magic and way of thinking which may be wrong and right at the same time. The protagonists can become from likeable, unlikeable and the opposite. Just astonishing.   Enjoyment (10)   I went through all the possible ways of experiencing happiness and distress, empathy and dislike so yes i enjoyed myself very very much.   Overall (9)   Its not easy for me to score a 10 overall at an anime. Even when im not a romance lover... But remember that this one made me write all these imformation to make you watch it... So its a (9)  To all ""helpfull"" but also ""not helpfull"" votes i hope i didnt make you feel tired and of course i made you give this anime a try... And remember!!  As the year today comes to its end...  "" Put your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget.."" ~ And make them look, like a modern messed up fairytale. ~ "" Make them look like your own tale of moments, your own tale of memories""  Happy 2015 to everyone :D";Recommended
9;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Wasabi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wasabi;10;ef - a tale of memories is another brilliant work produced by Shaft, responsible for Negima!?, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and Hidamari Sketch. Based on the visual novel of the same name, ef is split into two different storylines told simultaneously across 12 episodes. As it being a romance story, you can expect many cliches, but this is definitely one of those anime that molds all of that into a brilliant plot.  Story: The plot is split between two stories, both told simultaneously throughout the show. It follows through different scenes of melodrama, emotional distress, and many touching scenes. The plot is slightly slow for the first two or three episodes but picks up to an amazing finale.  Art: Shaft's presence is definitely noted in this show as well as their other works. The art designs are actually not at all that great but due to Shaft and their experimental style, it generates a beautiful environment and colorful characters. The colors are vibrant and ever changing, fitting in with the flow of mood changes throughout the show.  Sound: The music in this show is simply outstanding. The music is produced by Tenmon, also responsible for the music in Makoto Shinkai's movies (5 Centimeters per Second, etc). The music fits perfectly with the scene and changes at a dime's notice for even more well executed dramatic effect. The soundtrack is definitely one to be picked up.  Characters: The characters here are full of personality. At times you can feel you can connect to them in different ways and at other times, you'd might even hate them. The characters are not exactly the most original created, but they definitely fulfill their roles in an amazing way.  Enjoyment/Overall: I am personally not a big fan of serious romance drama so I gave it an 8 for Enjoyment. Even so, the story and style was extremely done well. The show just completely oozes of romance and it certainly delivers. A definite choice for a romance drama for those in search for one.;Recommended
10;ef: A Tale of Memories.;zSolaris;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zSolaris;10;"I'm not quite sure how I should write this. More or less, this series had the potential to be either a grand slam or a game ending triple play. In fact, the first time I watched it I thought it was pretty bad. I dropped it after watching half of the second episode. However, I picked it back up on a whim and boy was I surprised. This epic drama is probably the perfection of Greek drama on top of the romantic expectations in this day and age. But here is a warning, ef - a tale of memories demands more of the viewer than the average drama does.  In most dramas, you can predict a lot of the things happening. There will be ""X"" love triangle, there will be ""Y"" incident, etc. In a sense, one of the two stores in ef -a tale of memories does that (the one reloving around Hirono). However, it is the other strand (the one revolving around Renji and Chihiro) that makes this drama. The complexity of their story will probably move you to tears (or close enough). Though it is an extraordinary situation, it hits home hard. Without Renji and Chihiro's quest, I doubt this anime would be any different than the scores of romances and dramas out there. It was their relationship that had me glued to the computer screen watching all of ef - a tale of memories. Of course, saying any more would reveal this wonderful plot.  The story line was great. Though it is confusing to start, once the story begins to reveal itself, it absorbs you and you want more and more of it. Some of it is predictable, some of it is a surprise, and some of it is predictable but still delivers the same blow as a surprise turn in the plot would.  The character art could leave a bit to be desired but overall, the creators used color transitions, black/white, different drawing styles, color overlays, etc. in a beautiful manner. I couldn't really ask more from a show than this.  Now the soundtrack wasn't the greatest in the world. It wasn't bad, it was good, but I felt that it had its ups and downs. There were times when it was right on cue and enhanced the scene. There were times when I thought that it worked but something different would have been much more effective.  The characters all start a bit confusing but their development is fun to watch and it is their development that enhances the story. They aren't a bunch of static or stereotypical characters. Each one fits his or her role perfectly and work amazingly with the plot.  I enjoyed ef - a tale of memories a lot. In fact, it is probably one of the best dramas I have ever seen. So I think its worth a try whether you are interested in this genre or were just looking for something to watch.";Recommended
11;ef: A Tale of Memories.;michaelfeb16;https://myanimelist.net/profile/michaelfeb16;7;I was inspired to write this view to provide an alternative viewpoint on this good, but not great, show.  Story - 4: The story suffers from trying to cover too much. By covering six main characters, the show dilutes the huge potential it had. In the first half of the series, the story abruptly jumps from character to character requiring jarring adjustments of the mindset of the viewer. Although it is possible to jump between situations and tell a good story, it is a difficult task that ef has failed to meet. I believe that, given more time to develop context and maintain fluidity, this show could have been a perfect ten.  Of the two main stories told, the relationship between Chihiro and Renji is the most enthralling. The emotional struggle over the value of memories, while a familiar topic, is presented in a invigorating way through romance. The exploration of the concepts of memory and its part in defining identity give ef weight that could easily cause one to reflect on their own life.  Hiro's story, by contrast, is a massive letdown. He is confronted, oddly and without warning, with a choice between two girls. Kei's situation is common in anime, but left underdeveloped by ef, causing it to be forgettable. On the other hand, Miyako's character is refreshing, but an emotional connection to her is sabotaged by gross underdevelopment. Overall, ef is fortunate that Chihiro's story overshadows this one, because this part of the story is utterly unremarkable.  The positive reaction received by this show makes you wonder what it could have accomplished if it had decided to tell a single coherent story.  Art - 9: My weakness in understanding of technical side of anime, I thoroughly enjoyed the artwork here. Every scene felt natural to me, lacking clutter or voids. I particularly noticed colors doing an excellent job of supporting the mood at any given moment. Various effects used during the show (static in the library comes to mind) were overused without explanation, but besides that, the abstract presentation used at times did wonders for setting the theme of the show.  Sound - 8: I don't have much to comment on. The music never detracted from events, but it never managed to push emotionally when it could have. Outside of the show, the OP was excellent, but I never saw the ED.  Character - 10: I feel that the characters are what truly shine in ef. The cast as a whole is struggling between their pasts and their future dreams. Despite the disappointing amount of time available to explore the characters, many of them seem to have truly developed over the course of the show. As implied in the description of the story, Chihiro and Renji shine as the most interesting and endearing characters.  Enjoyment - 6: Although I did enjoy ef, my experience was hampered by the erratic story telling and the unexplained random text and scenes used to fill the screen (and this is coming from someone who thinks the original ending to NGE, while not pretty, was excellent). The potential for great enjoyment here is lost do to the schizophrenic pacing not allowing the viewer to settle into the show.  Overall - 7: ef - a tale of memories is a good, even if overrated, show. The show suffers heavily from an underdeveloped half of the story (that of course being on Hiro's side). While the half of show focused on Chihiro and Renji was a masterpiece in my eyes, the contrived nature of the drama and romance surrounding Hiro knocked the shows feet from under it.  This is a must watch for serious fans of drama and romance, but casual visitors to the genre will be much better served by finding a more lighthearted show or something easier to follow such as Clannad (specifically after story, of course).    (Please note that this review was written within a day of completing the series. I worry that my views may be colored by having, in the past few weeks, completed two shows that have become my favorite drama and my favorite romantic comedy. I will likely rewatch the show and revisit this review later this year and update to reflect such a possibility.);Recommended
12;ef: A Tale of Memories.;BakaScarlet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BakaScarlet;10;"I loved this anime very much. It is extremely emotional and very well written. First of all, this was NOT a typical romance/love triangle anime.  Story: The story is very well thought out. It can be confusing at times, but is quickly cleared up. It is full of surprises, morals and everything a fan of anime would love to see. Its split into two parts with two stories following extraordinary events (damn, sometimes i wish i was him.) and is set in the same place. I believe that the time of the stories were different, however, it is plain to see if you watch this series which i highly recommend. Despite the switching between the two &quot;stories&quot;, it flowed extremely well with each other. A climatic event may be coming up soon, but it suddenly switches. This was perhaps, the only flaw that i found in the story. To me, this bother was so miniscule that it didn't impact my viewing experience in anyway. Hirono, the manga artist, had an awkward love triangle story going on, which brought frustration. Despite this, it is highly amusing and intriguing to watch. Renji's story was different; it brought depression and sadness. Metaphors are used EXTREMELY effectively in this story. Together, the series is overflowing with human-problems that it seems like it will be difficult to conclude the series in an effective way. This was quite the opposite. Through the drama, frustration, sadness, romance and jealous, the story concluded shockingly well. One of the best I've seen. Many shows try to incorporate many different themes, but have failed. This is one that succeeded.  Art: The art is beautiful. The scenery (sunsets, beaches, etc) was gorgeous. The desperation shown by one of the characters was amazingly portrayed. The last few minutes of that episode was so nervewracking (in a good way) and was shown with a fading screen. Very powerful. The opening scenes during the theme songs were very colorful and bright. It was very pleasing to the eye. The characters were also very well designed and colored.  Sound: The sound? I guess i could say the sounds were used effectively. When doors slam shut, all you here is the slamming; there is no useless background noise. Also, to emphasize the sounds, the screen fades to black so you can focus.  Character: The character development was very good. I fell in love with many of the characters, but that is just me. Piece by piece the information concerning each of the characters comes. By the end, you will know everything about each of the characters. Development was great, we knew what we needed to know about the characters in order understand what was going on and why it was occuring at that specific time. Each of the characters were unique, there was no character that acted the same way another character did. Chihiro was my favorite character because her past seems so clouded and mysterious, i got hooked. Her 13 hour amnesia makes room for a hugeee character development. There are so many things that could result of this one small detail. Also, the art of the characters are very good.  Enjoyment: Ah, how do i describe this. You are presented with morals and things you can do in reality to make your life better. Never give up, follow your dreams, yeah yeah sounds repetitive. Wrong. Instead of mindless nonsense, characters state their respective problems, then pursue them to correct them. I enjoyed the series very much also because of the story. It never lost my interest. It is one-of-a-kind. How often do you watch a accident-victim who can only remember 13 hours of memories?  Overall: As previously stated, it is very unique, effectively incorporates romance, sadness, happiness, frustration, jealous and morals. The art was amazing, story was topnotch, characters were lovable and most importantly, the ending was so well done, i don't think i've watched any anime that concluded such a perplexing storyline so well in 12 episodes.  Being able to watch how a character reacts in a love triangle can be very informative, and funny at the same time. This is one of the best drama/romance/slice-of-life shows i have ever seen, so i highly recommend you watch it. It sure is a tear-jerker and this is one i will not forget in 13 hours. ;)";Recommended

You can see so and so breaking up with so and so ten miles away... ef~ gives the to predictability vibe the entire story... But you end up WRONG every time!

Are the characters so awesome and enthralling that you feel like your part of the story. I'll be the first to say this sounds like it would be a well written story if you feel like your part of it but thats wrong. It doesn't matter how great a story is if the characters don't invite you in to the story, their lives. You feel like you are part of every dilemma, ever heartbreak. That's what make these characters so great. They've let you be in there lives, they feel real.  Lastly: To be a masterpiece it has to change your life. I'm not talking about sending away the voice in your head or getting you off your Zoloft prescription. It has to of changed you on in the inside enough that you'll never forget the story and you'll be great full that you were touched by it. Maybe it's as simple as setting an example that can make you a better person. Maybe you understand some aspect of this world a little better.

Bonds and dreams- they are two of the things which connect human beings on a universal level. Humans are social creatures, they need bonds in order to keep on living, and they also need those bonds in order to strengthen their confidence in themselves when things do not seem to be going the way they wish them to go. Unfortunately, life works that way sometimes and as result, the bonds formed between lovers and even friends are at times necessary to remind us of who we are and that which we wish to become.

These ideas are conveyed through the story, art, sound, and characters within the story.  Story- The story of ""ef"" follows a group of individuals and their relationships with one another. However, the story is different then a lot of other anime's because of the way in which it is told. For example, while in most anime's it is not surprising to see multiple relationships viewed from different perspectives, I find myself hard-pressed to find another show where it is as nicely done as it was in ""ef"". However, much of why the story was good has to do with the overall presentation of the show, since without it, the story would not have been nearly as outstanding as it was.  Art and Character development- Words cannot describe the importance of the art direction in ""ef"". It is the element which makes ef, well...ef. Interactions between characters take place in front of a backdrop that is constantly changing, seemingly reflecting the mental state of the characters as they interact, and often times the viewers thoughts as they are watching the scene. In addition, the incredible art direction seems to foster a deeper connection between the viewer and the characters within the story, a connection that is quite different then any other anime I have seen. The existential themes of the show are very much reflected in scenes where characters are left alone and given a chance to reveal their thoughts and feelings unabashedly- in such scenes, faces contort and change, and the color palettes of these scenes follow suit. It is truly an incredible thing to see.  Sound- The music in ""ef"", is just as effective in conveying the themes of the show as the art direction is. Music, like art, is an essential part of most peoples lives- much like dreams and bonds are- and the creators of ef did a great job in using this to their advantage, creating an almost unconscious connection between the show and viewers. For instance, in the real world there is a sound for every feeling, a music for every mood, and in ef these ideas are realized splendidly. To illustrate this, one need only look at scenes dealing with Chihiro and her dream world, since without the music that accompanied these scenes they would be nowhere near as effective, and let me tell you, anyone that has any emotional capacity whatsoever will know what I mean upon watching these scenes. Voice actors are also incredible in this series, doing their part in making ef's presentation a thing to see.  All that being said, I enjoyed this show very much and I don't think I have had as much of a connection with an anime as I did with ef. But it must be noted that the show needs to be watched multiple times since if it is only watched once, viewers will lose many of the subtle nuances that make ef the show that it is. In conclusion I give ""ef- a tale of memories"", a 10, and while I do realize that I did not say to much about the actual story of the show, I must say that it is something that needs to be experienced rather than simply read about. So what exactly are you waiting for? Watch it, I guarantee you that you will not regret it.";Recommended
15;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Jikkir;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jikkir;10;"Wow.  I have now seen this series twice... Both times it has hit me. Hard.  Art: This is the very first thing that strikes you, right from the start. It's pretty amazing... The animation style is constantly switching. This may be seen as simply a novelty be some, a tool to show off the animator's artistic prowess... Yet it really isn't. The changes of style bring out what the characters are feeling to an even greater extent, and really helps keep it interesting and fresh. The attention to detail is also outstanding. The backgrounds, the foregrounds, the sea, the buildings, the sky...Especially that sky!  Characters: The characters are also brilliantly designed and animated, and the development in every case is superb. While not always the most original characters, each is different from the rest, yet you can still identify with all of them (though some hold grudges against either one of Hiro's two love interests...). The relationships between the characters, however, are what really make the show. Everyone is connected in some way, and they all have their own individual problems to take care of. By the end, you will be overwhelmingly attatched to at least one of the characters, if not all.  Story: Yeahyeahyeah, love triangle, 50 First Dates, knights and princesses, etc, it's been done... I still love it. I feel it is a 10, but I can see how others would argue differently... I reckon it makes a big difference whether you watch this show in one sitting, or over the course of a few days/weeks. However, it is personal preference...Some prefer the continuity of one sitting, while others prefer to have some time to think about each episode before moving on to the next. Try both. =] You'll want to rewatch it eventually anyway. The story remains strong throughout, with a few extremely memorable and powerful events, and once finished, you will be thinking back over it for days to come.  Sound: The sound is excellent all throughout the series - it's used to great effect, especially in the build-ups and climaxes. I recommend using headphones to experience the full effect. While I liked the opening and ending themes (a couple are really catchy!), I don't think they suited it too well... For instance, at the end of episode 7... The sudden intro of a J-Pop song sort of spoiled the effect. However, this sentiment may not be shared by all... Plus, it's only a slight problem. It detracts from the sound rating, and not the series as a whole. I do like how they changed the theme songs each episode, though.  Enjoyment: As you can probably tell if you read all this, I really enjoyed this series. I laughed, I cried, and was completely connected to every character, and after seeing it again, the feelings were even greater, if anything. This is great to watch, great to rewatch, and great to think over afterwards.  Highly recommended, for anyone - even if not a fan of the genre, as it does not just stick to the usual clich&eacute;s, in any aspect. Absolutely brilliant.  10/10. Pretty much perfect. Much love to this series. &lt;3. ~ This was my first review, so any comments would be appreciated. Cheers. ~ 07 April 2008 - Edited a couple of times after some feedback.";Recommended
16;ef: A Tale of Memories.;slpless;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slpless;10;"Ef a Tale of memories was based on the visual novel ef: a fairy tale of the two. One of the biggest selling point of the game was the amount of CG and its presentation. The story was, at least according to my roommate, pretty standard fare. So how is a studio going to adapt a game where the biggest selling point was the CG and presentation, where such things are standard in the anime medium? While a part of me would love to see Naru Nanao draw everything herself, that would be completely unrealistic (sighs&hellip;). So I resigned myself to accept the fact that ef would likely be simple story with normal animation and excellent character designs. I watched the trailer and it seemed to hint at my suspicions. Then I watched the first episode&hellip;  The presentation and animation was anything but normal. If ef a fairy tale of the two (the game) pushes the envelop for presentation for a visual novels then Ef a Tale of Memories (the anime) pushes the anime medium to its limits in terms of presentation. Yes, I should have known better, since the animation studio is Shaft and Akiyuki Shinobo is supervising, the same team that brought us Negima?!, Pani Poni Dash, and Sayonara Zetsubu Sensei. There really is no way to describe the way the art/animation is handled besides watching this or other Shinobo works. The unique animation is often used to amplify scenes, to act as metaphors, and used simply as an artistic take on certain scenes. In addition, the colors and visuals will often tell us exactly how the characters are feeling and/or reflect the mood of the scenes. The clouds in particular are often used in this manner. Although, there are time I think its just there to remind us that Shaft is animating this&hellip; I&rsquo;ll admit it does take some time to get used to ef unique animation and this may deter some people from watching. Although, it does get toned down after a few episodes. Probably due to Shin Oonuma taking the lead more and reducing the influence of Shinbo.  As I said before the story isn&rsquo;t anything special and we&rsquo;ve all seen them before. However, once again it&rsquo;s the presentation that breaths life in an otherwise typical romance anime. There are 2 major storylines running parallel with each other, Myako/Kei/Hiro and Chihiro/Renji. Both storylines are loosely related, with Kei being Chihiro&rsquo;s sister and both sharing themes of memories. I do think that ef could have done better if they only focused one story or have the 2 stories more related to each other. However, I can forgive this as there isn&rsquo;t enough material for one story to fill 13 eps. Also, in the game the stories are told linearly (ie one couple, then the next) and there are 2 degrees of separation between Miyako/Kei/Hiro and Chihiro/Renji.  As for the voice acting, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been truly blown away by voice work. There were scenes where the voice actors had to carry nearly half an episode by themselves and oddly enough those were some of the most memorable moments I&rsquo;ve seen in anime. The big thing that surprises me is that I had never heard of any of the voice actors. Ok, if theres one weakness in the voice acting its Chihiro&rsquo;s voice, it makes me want to pierce my ear drums&hellip;  Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; The ost is another one of ef&rsquo;s strong points. It features many calm and soothing pieces as expected by Tenmon. I really like how there is a special ending for each of the female characters and how well each of the ending really fits the characters and their story. In addition, the ending that gets played depends on what the episode focused on, especially that last moments of the episode. The OP, Euphoric Field was quite nice despite being Engrish and was very fitting for the series. Also, I really love the minor changes they made in the OP for the last episode. It only shows how much detail the creators put into making ef. All this detail makes the series very rewatchable so one can catch all those small things one may have missed the first time around.  The original character designs were originally done by Naru Nanao (female characters) and C2=Galore (male designs). Naru Nanao is one of my favorite artist so its pretty obvious that I love the character designs. &lt;insert fanboying for Naru Nanao here&gt;  One interesting thing about ef is that when I stand back and think about it, there are moments that can be seen as overly dramatic. However, oddly enough it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I attribute this to ef&rsquo;s unique atmosphere and because of this it somehow fits/feel natural. If the creators had decided to play it straight and went on a more normal route with the animation then those moments would had definitely stuck out.  I love Ef a Tale of Memories and it is only overshadowed by 5 cm/s for 2007. To all those that love romance/drama anime titles watch this now! However, a quick warning, the unique animation may deter some.";Recommended
17;ef: A Tale of Memories.;ExtendedRenegade;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ExtendedRenegade;10;"It's very rare that I come across anything that I can actually say is hard to review. Being an avid gamer, and maintaining a review blog I have much experience doing it, and it's never really tough to find a flaw in something. As far as anime goes, I'm a fan of just over a month now. In this time I've seen 40 different shows, the most prolific thus far being Chobits. Since I finished watching it I've searched and searched for anything that could move me the way it did, but couldn't find it, not even in Clannad, something all my friends couldn't believe.  And then ef: A Tale of Memories happened.  ef: A Tale of Memories tells two stories at once one of Hiro and his love triangle involving his childhood friend Kei and a girl he stumbles upon Christmas Eve and winds up spending the day with named Miyako, and the story of Renji and Chihori, a girl who suffered an injury from a car accident at the age of 12 that causes her to forget all her memories from 13 hours ago.  I'll get this out of the way right now; Hiro's story is nowhere near as touching as Renji's. That's not to say it isn't good, and perhaps to some it may be just as good, but I just couldn't connect with the characters on that end. The outcome to it just didn't seem to go the way it felt like it should have, and both Miyako and Kei felt somewhat immature and unprepared for a relationship.  Renji's story however, is an awe inspiring masterpiece. It's difficult to really point out what makes their tale so incredible; there are so many ways. It sounds so cliche to say, I know, but for the first time in a review, I honestly can't point it out. Renji's strength and determination to stick with Chihori despite her condition is inspiring. Equally so is Chihori's desire to keep Renji in her thoughts; constantly re-reading her diary entries of him in order to not forget him, to the point that she passes out from sleep deprivation. And those are just two of the things that left a strong impression on me; rest assured, the whole of their story is unbelievably heartwarming and at times, tragic.  Assisting both of the stories is the absolute best animation I've seen thus far. What makes ef's art so breathtaking isn't simply in character or environment design (which is still better than both Clannad series in my opinion). The show will often change contrast or camera angles multiple times during a scene to go along with what a character is saying. In a flashback scene describing Miyako's past as a child, the color scheme is switched to pastels and made to look as though it was colored in crayon.  While I wasn't particularly impressed with Hiro's story, it is where you see these types of scenes and effects the most, and they're incrediibly powerful. One of my favorites was a particularly emotional scene in which Miyako is leaving messages on Hiro's cell phone as she gets stood up by him. It's simply a white screen with a simple picture of her sitting there. As you hear the messages she's leaving you can hear the pain and anxiety in her voice increase with each one. Each message is written on the screen as she says it, causing it to gradually fill up the screen with text, each message adding to the chaos, mirroring her mental state during each message. Simply amazing.  As far as sound goes, voice acting is very well done, though that only goes for the English dub; I don't do subtitles. Music is good as well, but I honestly feel having the English version of the opening theme ""euphoric field"" was a mistake. There are multiple ending themes, but honestly none really stood out for me.  What did impress me though was the use of sound and audio effects throughout the show. Much like the various visual effects that were used, sound is also changed up and tweaked in order to reflect the mood of the moment. It's not as powerful or moving as the visuals, but they still contribute to the unique feel of the series.  Lastly, we have the characters. Much like the story, the characters in Renji and Chihiro's half are a little more likeable, though oddly enough, I feel the characters' backstories are done better in Hiro's story. My main issue is that Hiro, Miyako, and Kei all feel somewhat shallow and generic in comparison to Chihiro. I'll admit Hiro being a successful Manga writer before even finishing high school is kind of interesting, and Miyako's turbulent past with her parents is sad. But it's really tough to compare to Chihiro's backstory, which is one of the best I've ever encountered, if not the absolute best. After witnessing all the pain and suffering she's endured through her life, it's hard not to feel a sense of elation when real, pure happiness befell her.  I don't know if I would say ef: A Tale of Memories is better than Chobits I know that might seem blasphemous to most, but my reasons for adoring Chobits as much as I do are for another time. Suffice to say that ef is right there next to it on my favorite anime list. There isn't a single thing I won't remember here; the moving story, incredibe visual and audio effects, the endearing characters. All of it is a breathtaking experience, one that anyone, not just anime fans, needs to experience.";Recommended
18;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Deadlynathan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deadlynathan;8;"ef: A Tale of Memories(which I will shorten to just ""ef"" from this point on) was an anime I'd heard was great, but was one of the many sitting in my backlog. However, a recommendation from Reimei-Chan (should definitely check her profile out) gave me the motivation to power through it over the break, so here we are. I like this anime a lot, and definitely got more out of it than the romantic slice of life I was expecting. Here's the breakdown:  Story: 9 Ef's story is composed of three groups of characters that, initially, are unrelated, but intertwine as time progresses. This makes it a little hard to follow in the beginning, because no explanation is given as to what's going on, and there's identical twins involved, which doesn't help. That only lasts until about halfway through the second episode though, and then things clear up. Each individual story by itself is excellent, but the real power here is how the stories connect to form an overall theme. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but the story is great, and while I didn't exactly like how some of the relationships developed(muh ships), the ending more than makes up for it. I did find the pacing a bit weird though, with the romance really focused in the last 3-4 episodes. It felt a bit rushed. Overall, you won't find it as emotional as say, Clannad or Angel Beats! (manly tears), but it definitely is chalk full of feels towards the end.  Art:10 I loved the art style here. Not only does the art style look current enough that you can't tell it's from 2007, but there's also all sorts of effects used as well. Some scenes will be entirely done through character silhouettes, some will be in red or blue, and sometimes you get just a few frames of black and white. It reminds me of Bakemonogatari, but nowhere near as extreme. These effects are beautiful, keep things refreshing, and help set the mood throughout the anime.  Sound: 7 Usually I care more about the sound over the art in anime, but not in this one. While I do remember there were several piano pieces that I liked quite a bit, nothing in my mind sticks out as being exceptional or memorable. It's good, but not great. The opening and ending are really catchy though, so there's that.  Character: 8 With the three separate stories, this anime features a lot of different characters. Also a benefit of the individual stories, they all get a large amount of screen time and a lot of back story. Because of this, the character development is great, and the characters themselves are very human like. None of them are perfect or over idealized, but they're also not overly flawed. With a little imagination, this story could easily play out in real life. I also like that what I consider to be the main character in each story specializes in a specific artistic medium(writing, drawing, and photography). It's a minor detail, but I found it interesting considering how important the art is to the story.  Enjoyment: 8 Definitely very enjoyable, I found that I could watch around 3-4 episodes in a row without trouble. I wouldn't recommend watching it this way though, because I think you miss a lot of the smaller details. I powered through it in about 5 days, and then ended up watching again because I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending the first time around. So, I think to fully enjoy this one you need to space it out and let each individual episode sink in, as opposed to watching 3-episode blocks. If you do power through it though, try watching it again, especially if you felt like something was missing. I didn't find it unbearable re watching it, and I think you'd be surprised how many things you missed the first go round.  Overall: 8(Very Good) Ef is a great anime, and one I highly recommend watching if you like the romance/slice of life genre. As I said in my intro though, even if those aren't your genres of choice, I'd still watch it, because there's so much more going on. You can't just fit this one into a genre like that, you just can't. It doesn't do it justice. I'm not sure if it was obvious from my review, but it was really challenging to try and break this anime down into categories, because, using a cliche, this anime is more than just the sum of its parts(also, if it was obvious, terribly sorry if it was a struggle to read in some areas). TL;DR Watch it, and if you like it, know that there's also a great visual novel that goes along with it if you like those.";Recommended
19;ef: A Tale of Memories.;dot_tsun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dot_tsun;7;"Every animation studio popularly known has a specific twist that sets them apart from the others. Whether that was moé cranked up to eleven, beyond outstanding CGI, crisp and clean standard animation, or even just the distinct way that every character was designed. These distinct quirks lead to being able to differentiate between studios and their ability to present something of their own unique style. However, every so often we're presented with something different. Something that pops, something that you could not forget no matter how hard you tried. Every animation studio popularly known has a specific twist that set them apart from the others, something as memorable as the birth of a studio. These shows blow our expectations away and find a way to go above and beyond for every aspect of the show. In taking the risk to create something away from the usual, the show becomes something memorable to those who see it and commonly pave the way for an entirely new style of presentation to come. One studio that was capable of pulling this off early on was the now beyond popular Studio SHAFT. SHAFT's animation style was uniquely different from any other style anyone had ever seen and demanded that its viewers be not only mentally sucked into the show, but visually captivated as well. SHAFT combined their outstanding early animation with powerful visual symbolism and stories that would last a life time. SHAFT chose a presentation style that would be memorable on more than just the story level and made all of their shows an experience everyone must see for themselves. One of the masterpieces this studio pulled together was the anime we will be reviewing today: Ef: A Tale of Memories.  Ef: A Tale of Memories is the anime adaptation of the adult visual novel ""Ef: The First Tale"" and is a romance anime revolving around two primary storylines. The first follows protagonist Hiro Hirono, a professional manga artist, who works his way into a love triangle with a girl whom he meets on Christmas Eve, Miyako Miyamura, and a childhood friend of his, Kei Shindou. Hiro becomes friends with Miyako one Christmas Eve when Miyako steals his bike to chase after someone who stole her purse. However, she soon gives up and Hiro finds her unconscious with his bike completely ruined. After Miyako wakes up, the two spend the rest of Christmas Eve together and end up developing strong feelings towards each other. When Kei finds out about this relationship she has a hard time dealing with her own feelings towards Hiro and ends up making a tremendously dramatic time. In the second storyline, we have protagonist Renji Asou who meets a girl at an abandoned train station, Chihiro Shindou, and promises to be her first and only friend. He finds out that she can only retain thirteen hours of memory due to a tragic childhood accident and has a hard time finding ways to keep a meaningful relationship with the girl as he becomes very fond of her. These storylines and concepts are far from unheard of, and have lately become quite common at that, but the way that the story is written is more powerful than what I initially expected. The show does its best job at making genuine conflict as well as fitting in a perfect amount of character development that makes you form very strong feelings and opinions about every character, but I digress. The way that the story and character interactions are written is so perfect at moments that it's impossible for your mind to be focussed on anything other than the events currently happening. Both Hiro and Renji's stories are unique in their own rights but find ties to each other and make both stories relevant towards a common storyline. Along with the visuals, the story helps create an incredibly addictive property that the anime holds to its name, making you want to come back and watch it as again as soon as you can. Though, with the positive said, there was still plenty wrong with the way the story was presented. This was mainly in weak moments that felt incredibly awkward to watch and left me feeling that the scene could have been far better written. These moments are easily overbalanced by all of the positives that this show has to offer, but they are still present enough to affect the overall experience of this show.  As far as the characters are concerned, we're given a moderately large cast that are all (more or less) unique...or at least are presented this way. When initially presented with each one, you get the feeling that you've never experienced a character quite like them before, but as the show progresses they begin fitting more into the usual tropes. This isn't to say that ALL of the unique qualities that every character originally had completely vanishes over time, but they do fade to the point where you can label almost every character with one of the dere types. If I had to pick a weakest suit that this show has to offer, the characters would be my go-to decision. Despite the way that they transform into duller forms of themselves, the way that the characters are initially presented is nearly perfect. No character introduction feels awkward and no two introductions are remotely the same. The same goes for the characters themselves. While they do fit into archetypes as if that was that they were written for, each one feels solid and no character is like another. Both of our protagonists feel unique in the way they go about everything and all of the supporting characters fit their own unique ways to help support the show. The way the show kept the cast nice and diverse in ways, helped the fact that half of every character was an archetype. This way, despite that we've already seen every character in the past (if we're avid anime watchers) they were spread out enough so that it didn't stick out and wasn't a real problem unless you're extremely picky about those types of things.  The animation in this show was something that caught me off guard and will continue to have that special place in my heart as the first anime I watched by Studio SHAFT, and I have yet to see a single show out-do the extremely unique animation style that was done in both of the Ef series. There was something unique and symbolic on the screen at all times and every last scene popped out. The animation was unique to the point where it dictated the mood of the scene and amplified already existing moods beyond that which any other aspect of presentation could ever do. The animation is something I've yet to even see SHAFT do again and looks like all of the aspects of animation they were practicing before later dividing it up into the different animation styles the perfected for shows such as Monogatari and Madoka Magica. While many might argue that the sheer amount of CGI usage was completely unnecessary for the production, I beg to differ as in my eyes it added to the presentation in an absolutely perfect way. Nothing was ever flat, nothing was ever static, and every setting was clear and impossible to mix up with any other. I would try to describe the animation, but the only real way to understand how unique the setting is animated is by experiencing it yourself. The characters were animated in a way that everyone looked gorgeous to a point that's better than modern anime character animation. I, honestly, would go as far to say that the animation in this show was perfect. When watching through the show for the first time, I saw absolutely no flaws in the animation and was awed by it in a way that only ufotable has been able to do since then.   The soundtrack in this anime wasn't too special. It fit the scenes well but not in any way that was drastically outstanding. The opening is a nice ""Engrish"" song that is one of my favourite anime openings to date, but nothing else in Ef: A Tale of Memories' soundtrack was special in any way. The voice acting was superb, every voice sounded as if it fit its character perfectly with the exception of one character: Chihiro. Chihiro’s voice actress, in my opinion, was a terrible casting choice. This isn't to say that her voice actress, Natsumi Yanase, is a bad voice actress as some of her other roles I found were perfect for her character, but when voicing Chihiro her voice felt like an awkward last-minute casting decision that could have been given to a number of better voices for Chihiro's part.   With all this said, I personally enjoyed Ef: A Tale of Memories a lot. As a matter of fact, Ef is my personal favourite romance anime to date. Something about it just appealed to me in every way shape and form and lead to me having a very good time watching it, even with all of its flaws. It has appealed to me in a way that even makes me interested in the visual novel it was based off of. For anyone with a soft spot for drama and romance shows, this one is perfect for you. Everything was done in a way that still holds to be good at the time of writing this review and is an experience I would gladly suggest to anyone. Every aspect of the presentation works perfectly together and if even one piece was slightly lacking or slightly overdone then the show wouldn't be as perfectly flawed as it is now. Studio SHAFT did an outstanding job with this series and if you haven't yet, I suggest watching it very soon. I give Ef: A Tale of Memories a 7 out of 10.";Recommended
0;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Fonbella;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fonbella;6;"I decided to watch this anime after watching some AMVs. I've always despised the art style of this anime (big heads, pentagonal faces and skinny characters don't really appeal me), but the animation was gorgeous, which motivated me.  Story: 5. The story doesn't pick up until episode 5. I almost dropped watching it because it's boring at first, but it does get better as it goes, and since it's actually a short anime, I recommend watching it all. This anime could be divided in three stories. Sadly, aside from Renji and Chihiro's part, the story is very poor. If you're looking for a more complex, mind blowing story, I recomend not watching this. While I love drama and I respect the director's decision to stage it in a unique way, some of the most dramatic parts in this anime are laughable, Like when Chihiro falls at the beach and Renji reaches out for her, or when Renji breaks down in later episodes.  Art: 6. Here I devide it in two, visual style and animation. For visual style: 3, animation: 9. As I said before, I'm not fond of deformed characters, with extremely huge heads (like Miyamura's), but it's not for me to state my personal preferences in this review. I really like how a lot of the scenes in this anime look like vectors moving, it was really original and it's what I like the most about this anime (the opening itself is a very good example of it).  Sound: 10. I have nothing to say here. It's really good from the very beginning to the very end. All songs are brilliant and it blends in magically. ""Euphoric Field"" is something you'll want to put in your iPod right away.  Character: 8. For a 12-episode anime, the characters develop pretty well, each following their own pace. Most notably are Kei and Chihiro. Miyako also changes a bit at the end, but overall, she's your tipical annoying, childish girl.  Enjoyment: 7. This anime has a very serious problem: you'll find youserlf glued to the screen at some point while watching it (episode 11 speaks for itself), but at other parts you'll just yawn and think about dropping watching it (like when Miyako calls Hiro in episode 7 and 10).  Overall: 6. It could've been better written, but it wasn't a waste of time watching it. I'm still in love with it's animation and vector-like style (can I call this 4 wall breakage? I really enjoy that. Google it if you don't know what it means). It's not an anime I'd recommend to others, but if people asked me if it's worth watching it or not, I'd simply say: It's good.";Mixed Feelings
1;ef: A Tale of Memories.;qwel76xyo9;https://myanimelist.net/profile/qwel76xyo9;6;"I almost dropped this anime, but since it only had 12 episodes, I kept watching. I'm not saying it's a crappy anime, but I didn't like it. And there are reasons. Lots of them.  Story The story is pretty easy to follow, even though it's actually more like two stories and not just one. I don't see the idea of having two stories, though. Although they are somehow related, I really don't understand it. That put aside, the story is quite basic with a few things that make it different to your normal anime story, but if you don't think about these few things, it kind of seems like you have seen the anime before somewhere. The way I look at it, this story doesn't have a plot worth talking about. It just revolves around some teenagers with some problems, and that's about it. Of course the problems might be a little odd, but that doesn't make me rate it any better. However, I did like the ending.  Art The background scenery and the drawings were very well made. There were a lot of colors, and the animation worked very good too. One thing I'm extremely dissatisfied with is the overuse of colors to describe how a person feels. Suddenly a person is drawn entirely in black and white, and on other ocassions the same person is drawn glowing red. I fully understand the use of this, but I just.. hate it. I think it makes it far too antirealistic (not that I hate antirealism, I just don't think it fits to this kind of anime). I also don't like the way some of the scenes function. Example: One of the main persons is talking to another main person. Suddenly the camera switches focus to the lips of that person (It's a girl, that's why), and then to somewhere completely else. A few second later there's another change in scenes, and it continues that way. I get the idea, but I think that changing scenes all the time is, well, annoying. It's not that you can't follow what's happening, it's just that I think it's more or less meaningless (especially when it's used all the time). A lot of people might say that I simply don't understand real art. And that's true. I do not understand art. Period. I just want everything to be simple, yet useful. And that applies to everything in my world - not just anime. And by &quot;simple&quot;, I don't necessarily mean drawings without details. That would be a shame. I mean that there shouldn't be anything that's far out with no meaning in particular. That's what I think...  Sound There's not really much to say about the sound. It works. I don't think it's bad, and I don't think it's amazing. It's just plain good. A thing that bothers me is, however, that this anime, like a lot of other animes, used some English lyrics. In my opinion, the English/Japanese mix wasn't good.  Character The characters were (mostly) types I had seen before, but I honestly don't care about that. There were different personalities, some of them being complete contractions of one of the other characters, while some of them were more similar to each other. All of the characters were well thought up.  Enjoyment As stated earlier, I almost dropped this show. I did enjoy some parts of the anime, but then again, a lot of the time I was just bored. Because this wasn't a comedy, I thought I would have a nice time watching some drama, but I never really liked it. It missed an exciting plot that would've made me watch it with enjoyment. Sure, I did cry a little sometimes, but that's not uncommon for me.  *** If you think your way of thinking is similar to how I think of thinking (hmm..), I wouldn't recommend this anime. On the other hand, if you like going to art museums or something like that (to me museums equal hell x 1000), there's a chance you'll like this.  But I didn't.";Mixed Feelings
2;ef: A Tale of Memories.;OmegaSiets;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OmegaSiets;5;"Are people merely a collection of their memories, or is a personality innately part of one's self? Ef: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore interesting questions like these, and while its heart is often in the right place, its execution ends up being problematic for numerous reasons.  Ef could really be thought of as two tales combined into one, as it follows two different sets of protagonists in their struggles to overcome their life problems. Hirono, an unmotivated high school student and fledgling manga artist, often has to have his longtime best friend Kei pick up the slack for him and make sure he keeps up with his education. One day however, Hirono encounters a girl named Miyako who frequently attempts to drag him away from his studies, which not only angers Kei for distracting him, but also starts to fuel her jealousy, as Miyako and Hirono increasingly become more attached to each other over time. The other tale focuses on Kei's sister Chihiro, who had suffered from a serious accident early in her life causing her to only retain the last 13 hours of her memory along with the memories she had prior to the accident. As a result, she continually has to relive the pain and realization that she will no longer be able to accumulate memories for the rest of her life. Through a chance meeting with a boy named Renji however, she is presented with a glimmer of hope that the remainder of her existence may not be so miserable as predicted. And that more or less sets the stage for the majority of the plot to come.  I really liked the idea of having two different plotlines essentially running parallel to each other with a completely different cast of characters placed in each thread. It's an interesting way of presenting the narrative that is rarely explored in anime or most any medium for that matter. Unfortunately though, it missed a huge opportunity to explore this concept to its fullest potential by eventually having the two plotlines intersect, which would open up interesting possibilities for the two sets of characters to share insights with each other. For example, Renji struggles with his future not knowing what he wants to do with his life. In contrast, Hirono is already living out his passions as a manga artist. Having the two characters eventually cross paths would have allowed Hirono to offer up some advice for Renji in helping him discover his passion, and likewise Renji--being the more sensitive-minded protagonist of the series--could have helped Hirono understand Kei's feelings better, but none of these possibilities are ever explored. Instead, we are only given a handful of situations where Kei and Chihiro occasionally exchange text messages on their cell phones. Consequently, this leaves the whole dual-plotline aspect of the narrative feeling mostly superfluous, and it just left me wondering why they didn't simply tell the two stories as completely separate anime. Since there was so little attempt at linking the two plotlines together, there wasn't much point in presenting them together when they have no real impact on each other. It merely breaks up the flow of the story unnecessarily. This problem is especially exemplified in the first episode. Because it has to spend time setting the stage for two sets of main characters instead of one, the introductory episode just ends up feeling like a series of jumbled random events that fail to hook you into the story and don't even find enough time to establish that Chihiro has a disability yet.  The problems worsen for the series when we examine Hirono's story arc, which mostly rehashes typical love triangle tropes and doesn't do anything particularly interesting with them. Further adding insult to injury, neither of Hirono's love interests are very likeable characters, nor is Hirono himself for that matter. Miyako mostly comes off as selfish and clingy, with very few if any redeeming qualities at all. She has no real hobbies or personal interests that make her unique, and she shows no genuine concern for Hirono and his problems beyond any that pertain to herself, which really makes me wonder why Hirono finds any interest in her at all. Kei is at least a slightly more palatable character, being that she has a talent for basketball and she makes an effort to look out for Hirono, but when her jealous side starts to kick in, she can be almost as cruel and selfish as Miyako. On top of all this, Hirono is painfully bad at recognizing Kei's feelings, and his inconsiderateness similarly makes him unlikeable. The one good aspect to this story arc however was the revelation that Kei had where she realized that she waited far too long to express her true feelings for Hirono. It's something that I could relate to in my own life and it is well-handled in that it shows how people continually delay saying things that need to be said thinking that there will always be a more appropriate time in the future to do so, but in reality that ideal future will never come and there is no better time than the present. All things considered though, this story arc was mostly underwhelming in its execution.  Thankfully Chihiro's story is significantly more worthwhile, offering up more relatable characters and a satisfying conclusion, along with its much more in-depth exploration of the anime's key theme: memories. Watching Chihiro struggle with her memory problems was heart-wrenching and engaging, and Renji, unlike Hirono, actually gives a damn about the things he does and the people he affects; making the characters on this side of the plot a hell of a lot more sympathetic.  Even in spite of Chihiro's tale offering a better story though, both sides of the plot suffer from still more narrative problems. Very little actually happens from episode-to-episode, with many of the characters often trailing off into long bouts of small talk, monologues, and introspections that aren't particularly enthralling or justifiable in wasting your time, and considering that this anime is only 12 episodes long as it is, there really shouldn't be any excuse for such slow pacing. These tedious moments are often further exacerbated by the animation, which seems like it's trying to pass itself off as being ""artsy"" with experimental abstract techniques, but what it's really doing is just allowing the animators to be lazy and take a break. For instance, at one point in the plot Miyako has an emotional breakdown on the phone when she realizes she can't reach Hirono, so she proceeds to leave a very long series of messages repeatedly begging him to answer. Not only is the dialogue lengthy and monotonous here, but it's all set to an entirely static backdrop with nothing else but text appearing on-screen. We never actually get to see Miyako's facial expressions the whole time, which would have added much more dramatic effect, aside from being more interesting in general than having us stare at a static background for an uncomfortably prolonged period of time. As for the art and animation overall, it seems merely passable when it's doing its job and feels like it's trying to take shortcuts when it ventures into the experimental like the example above. The color palette has a sort of ""washed out"" effect to it which creates a melancholic atmosphere that was likely done as a stylistic choice to differentiate the anime, but as an unintended side effect it makes the visuals look more dated than they actually are.  As I have only seen the dub, I cannot make a comparison between the two audio tracks, but I will give a brief overview on the quality of the voice acting. If you're a frequent dub watcher, you'll probably recognize that most of the voice cast from Clannad is present in this series, with experienced actresses like Brittney Karbowski as Kei, Monica Rial as Chihiro, and Luci Christian as Miyako. On the whole though, the quality of the dub doesn't quite stack up to Clannad's; in part because Greg Ayres feels miscast as Hirono, who sounds less mature than he looks as a result. Monica Rial also tends to be cast in a lot of moe roles when her voice is far from moe, and unfortunately this is another one of those cases. She is a talented actress, but much like Greg Ayres, she is frequently misused. Regardless, even if Ef had a better dub, it would have done little to alleviate the bigger problems with this anime.  Ef: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore many interesting and relatable themes dealing with love, jealousy, memories, and loneliness. Though sometimes it succeeds, the pointless use of dual plotlines and the often uneventful pacing take a severe toll on the narrative, aside from Hirono's story arc being mostly disappointing to begin with. I can only recommend this series to enthusiasts of the genre, as Chihiro's tale may be just enough to satisfy, but for a more casual romance viewer like myself, it's difficult to justify the time spent.";Mixed Feelings

For example: In some parts there is unknown girl appearing suddenly and giving advice to the character.

One of the upsides to this show is that you have a few storylines going on simultaneously, which is convenient when one of the storylines is eye-rolling and intelligence-insulting.  The romance storyline between Renji and Chihiro is what really drags down this show. Her ""ephemeral memory"" was obnoxious, his personality was practically nonexistent (so why care about him?), and the pseudo-intellectual waxing combined with the overly ambitious art made the whole arc come off as pretentious. The writer pollutes the dialogue in this arc with painfully-obvious metaphors and symbolism, seemingly with the intent to prevent any viewer from having the chance to figure out anything for themselves. Supporting characters in this storyline aren't very helpful either as they needlessly spew deepities and other faux-wisdom. Was the writer channeling their belief or message trhough those side characters, or did the writer intentionally write said characters to be useless and unhelpful? I'm not willing to watch the show a second time to find out.  The rest of the show is good and seems surprisingly normal. Not amazing, but watchable. It's just the Renji-Chihiro side story that really killed the experience for me.";Mixed Feelings
5;ef: A Tale of Memories.;RyanSpring;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RyanSpring;6;"Being a huge Slice of Life fan and a sucker for romantic plots, on paper this show should have been right up my alley but upon actually watching it it just wasn't. I do not understand the 9 and 10 reviews I've seen so many of here. I see many, many flaws in this show.  The first half of it was unbelievably slow and boring and it was hard to stay focused and awake. It doesn't get remotely interesting until episode 8 or so and even then it's merely passable, not anything special. There is zero combat, zero mystery/thriller elements, zero suspense. The plot as a whole is extremely linear.  The character development and base premise are shallow and generic- just your standard Slice of Life fare that you've seen many times elsewhere.  There are ridiculously cheesy and non-believable conveniences such as a character showing up at EXACTLY the right time at the end of a phone conversation after ""searching every pay phone in the city"" or another character recovering many thrown away pieces of a journal that would be literally impossible to retrieve, such as pieces underwater or hanging out in completely inaccessible locations such as on the side of a very tall building.  The music and voice acting were both fine but neither were standouts.  This anime opts for constant camera cuts and shots from different angles. Whether this is good or bad is a personal preference thing I guess but I felt it was way overdone, sometimes to the point where it felt like the anime was trying to give me a seizure.  Overall this felt like a very mediocre, forgettable Slice of Life to me and not something I'd particular recommend or care to watch again. At the end of the day, this show is simply boring.

(Not going to though, unless hubby or friend wants to) The characters were very watered down to me.. a bunch of the story lines for the characters felt kinda slapped together.. Be warned that it takes until the 5th episode or so for the story to actually get rolling so if you're more into fast paced anime like kore wa zombe desu ka (Is this a zombie?!) for example, I don't recommend this series as it is a slow start.

1;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Infatuate;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Infatuate;2;ef: A Tale of Memories. An anime that I had never heard of yet somehow made its way into my list.  In my abruptly deceased quest to find a show that could move me, I stumbled upon this gem. It was a coincidence really, I can't remember clearly but there it was, in the MAL top user recommendations for a certain drama anime that I enjoyed.  So I got curious, checked out the synopsis and art. Looked good. Checked some scores and they were even better. What could possibly go wrong?  Well, everything did.  Now with the uninteresting prologue finished, I'll move on to the actual review.  We are introduced to a fairly small cast of characters, split into two different and simultaneous story arcs that never connect between each other despite having characters of the same family in both.  The first arc, is about a love triangle between a manga artist, her newly found obsessed girl who is all over him, and a childhood friend. The second one is about a girl with a condition that prevents her from remembering anything at all for longer than 24 hours, and how she meets a guy named Mr. Plainy Plainster. There are a few other support characters who have a story of their own I guess... none of them are worth mentioning.  About the first arc, it's your overused love triangle. No, there are no special twists. The male main character is as plain as you can be, with his only defining trait being his talent for manga drawing. He lives in the house of a female childhood friend (who is sister of the girl with memory problems in the second arc) that is also in high school. He then meets an apparently popular and perfect-on-the-surface female, and chaos ensues.  And if you thought there were few characters in the first arc, allow me to introduce you to the second one. Two characters total. The girl that can't remember things for longer than 24 hours, and a male lead that makes Kirito from SAO look like an interesting man full of virtue.  The story (or, stories) had some potential, but sadly always failed to be anything more than a laughable attempt to be deep or metaphorical. It would be less embarrassing if a mediocre show didn't try so hard to be something it's not. What I'm trying to say is, that this was made by SHAFT, so expect flamboyant and unnecessary animation. The artsy environments and overused symbolism are present everywhere, and they can be amazing additions to amazing shows, however they can also be a double edged sword if the content it tries to enhance simply fails to meet any expectation. This was the case with ef: a Tale of Memories.  So little happens in the actual anime that trying to delve deeper into the story arcs would probably spoil the minimal plot points that ef has to offer, so I won't do that. Just know that this anime was based off an eroge, so needless and random sex themes are around just enough to break any possible immersion. Oh, I forgot that supernatural themes are also present for no damn reason too!  To conclude, the only things that you'll find in ef are: the worst kind of melodrama, unnecessary fanservice and suggestive themes, pointless supernatural elements, hilarious attempts to make this disappointing anime seem deep (through different means), and a very diverse cast of boring, bland and whiny characters.   Detailed analysis below:  General: -Atmosphere 2/10 --- This is a lackluster tale about teenager love. The repetitive 'cute' backgrounds and symbolism are simply out of place. -Characters 1/10 --- Completely unlikable cast of characters. I couldn't feel ANYTHING at all for any of them. -Story development & ending 2/10 --- I laughed at the ending. And I don't have a heart of stone or anything, like I said at the beginning I started this because I wanted it to toy with my emotions, and the only thing it did was to toy with my laughter. Unexpected results.  Technical: Art 7/10 --- The actual animation is nice when it isn't trying to be 2deep4me Soundtrack -/10 --- I actually didn't pay any attention to the sound. And the version I watched lacked any opening sequence so I won't comment on this aspect. Voice acting 3/10 --- Whoever did Chihiro, aka the girl with defective memory, needs to quit voice acting.  Personal: Priority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 4/10 --- To be honest I was expecting for something to happen... Memorability 7/10 --- I'll never forget the worst show I blindly ventured myself into.  Final score: 2/10 --- Horrible  I wouldn't recommend this piece of anime to anyone... maybe to some enemies? It was the first and last time that I actually take MAL's user recommendations seriously.  The themes in here can be quite inappropriate even though this show seems like an innocent tale about teen romance. Out of place scenes and dialogues that do not fit with some of the characters' traits are included just to be faithful to the source material, I suppose, which added to the overall hilarity. Not recommended for 14 y/o or younger.  There's also a second season or rather, a spin-off called ef: a Tale of Melodies. Based on the minor characters of this one. Needless to say I didn't bother to watch it, nor will I ever do it.  This has been my second review, which was more in the verge of becoming a rant, but it had to be said. Don't watch this.;Not Recommended
2;ef: A Tale of Memories.;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;Ef- A Tale of Memories is a twelve episode anime based on an adult visual novel. Of course, there have been some decent anime based off of H games, not many mind you, but maybe this'll be one of them. Let's take a look and find out.  There are really three loosely connected stories in this. The first is a love triangle with a moron, an idiot and a brainless twit. The second is about a naive moron who meets a girl with a memory defect and the third is about an imbecile trying to make an art film. The only one that had the potential to be interesting is the second and that potential is squandered both by the time wasted on the other two stories and by a major problem with the entire anime, melodrama. This anime is melodramatic to the point of ridiculous. Every minor thing that happens in loose relation to the plot gets needlessly exaggerated in an attempt to make you empathize with the cast which is a futile exercise but more on that later. What isn't absurdly melodramatic is just dull and drags on. It's not like there wasn't room for interesting story in this, the execution just fails.  Now, let's talk about why empathizing with the characters just isn't going to happen. The biggest issue is that they're overly dramatic, dull-witted teenagers. They're like the people that no one wanted to be around in High School because they turned everything into a huge issue from a teacher chastising them to another girl wearing the same shirt as them. It's not charming or endearing, it's annoying. If I wanted to watch high school students being overly dramatic and stupid, I'd be a teacher. Really, the characters needed to be older in this, not to mention more three-dimensional, for the concept to work and that simply isn't the case.  Talking about the art in this is going to be a bit longer than usual. They try to be artsy with such stunning visual effects as randomly going black and white or cropping out almost everything on the screen to focus on one small thing, but that kind of style doesn't work unless there's a coherent reasoning behind it. That isn't the case with this, the anime isn't that intelligent. It's simply trying to appear intelligent through superficial means without actually having intelligent content as such it's just annoying. It's the equivalent of that one idiot who tries to look smart by wearing glasses that they don't need. No one falls for that either. Take away the effects you get art that's pretty mediocre with uninspired character designs and scant backgrounds.  The voice acting isn't particularly interesting or memorable. I don't blame the voice actors for it since they're working with a script that fluctuates between melodramatic and dull. Honestly, it's a bit impressive that they manage to not be completely obnoxious during the melodramatic scenes. The music is so utterly dull that I really can't remember anything about it even though I just finished the series a couple hours ago as of the moment I'm writing this.  The yuri factor is a 2/10. There's a minor character who mentions having a crush on her female upperclassman once, but it's a throwaway scene that goes nowhere and is never mentioned or alluded to again. Ef- A Tale of Memories: where scenes don't have to connect to the plot in a meaningful way.  My final rating for Ef- A Tale of Memories is a 4/10. I honestly don't hate it. It's a mostly dull and mediocre series with a few annoying factors that make me consider it sub-par overall. I can't really recommend it to anyone unless you really enjoy high school melodrama.;Not Recommended
3;ef: A Tale of Memories.;syncrogazer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/syncrogazer;4;I'm kind of angry to be honest. How can a drama/mystery/romance with an >8 score be this bad? I was really looking forward to it being one of my next favourite romances, and this is what I get.  The first half really wasn't all that bad. Things progressed decently, I loved the OP and music in general, animation was good and I appreciated the art shifts to an extent. That Renji character looked ridiculous, but other than that all of the girls were decent, even if I don't usually like character designs of this kind. The whole memories thing seemed a little contrived but I figured it'd get emotional by the end. Nope.  I consider it a bad thing when I find myself laughing at supposedly dramatic and heart-wrenching moments. This was also around the time the art shifts started to get on my nerves.  After a certain point, the balance between the various stories was lost, and every time we were immersed in one story al I wanted to do was watch the one they weren't focusing on. It seems neither could keep my interest because the personalities of all the characters had undergone a dramatic shift into annoying territory. Almost all motivations come from somewhere in the distant past, as if everybody is suffering from the same illness. (Tale of memories, yeah I know, but that doesn't make it any better). Really there almost no characters that stayed likable for very long. Well, except the guy with the film camera, I thought his character and little story line was interesting.  Also, this was a talky-one. But not couples talking, no the guy characters usually talk to someone else about what they should do about their girl. And when they do, expect a lot of melodramatic one liners and art shifts that don't really fit anything. They try to be profound, but it really falls flat.  My idea to make this a much better anime: Get rid of all the other characters and story lines and focus on the film maker trying to capture the beauty of the enigmatic girl through his camera lens (And the subsequent romance that arises from finding her and enrolling her in his film project). That little story line (for me) was more captivating and interesting than all of the others combined.  All around, what we have here is a very disappointing romance that misses every target it tries to hit. Undeniably, a below average release. I honestly don't see what the others are seeing.;Not Recommended
4;ef: A Tale of Memories.;Hedgie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hedgie;3;Ef: A Tale of Memories. I’m baffled by this anime score of an eight and above. It’s cliché, generic, unoriginal, it doesn’t do anything to differentiate itself from other romance anime. It does the exact opposite while trying to be more profound and deep, I’m all for that, but it was in my opinion horribly executed. It’s if half of Myanimelist was watching this during their teenager years or was one their first few romance anime. It was a hardship to get through and I love romance anime.  Story: 3  There are two main stories ongoing at the same time while correlating with one another. An angel appears, well not exactly a mysterious girl known Yuuko, narrating our stories. The more favorable story beginning with Renji Asou and Chihiro Shindou. It starts off with Renji always catching a glimpse of girl with an eye-patch sitting everyday by herself at an old abandon train station with book in her hand. Eventually, he musters up the courage to introduce himself to her thus begins their friendship. There’s a reason with Chihiro is always by herself and doesn’t at the time attend school. However, that’s for Renji to find out why.  The next story involves an upcoming manga creator Hiro Hirono and his childhood friend Kei Shindou along with Miyakomo Miyamura. Hiro is always doing things half-effetely never committing to them with or giving it his all. Hiro ditches school to follow his true passion creating and writing manga, even though Kei always insist on him to attend school. When Hiro meets Miyakomo, he finds her very odd and friendly, at times even annoying seeing how she wants to be around him for no real apparent reason.  Art & Sound: 4 | 6  I’m all for symbolic meaningful imagery, but it felt really out place in this anime. The weird transitions cuts made during a conversation, sometimes it close and personal into the character face or they were out frame or out of placed. The questionable locations it showed at times. It was as if it was trying to be deep to the audience, even though at times the show itself wasn’t that. The opening was mediocre at best, nothing to great. The music though was pleasant and went along with the more emotional scenes. Looked and feel like an older anime, with an exaggerated enormous eyes and wacky hair nothing wrong with that felt a bit outdated or more of moe look.  Characters: 3  None are really worth mentioning nor do they stick out, each one has his/her own problems. Although some of their actions are questionable. At times I found them to be annoying and cringe worthy. They’re portrayed as high school student so without a doubt some characters can extremely selfish for their own motives, even if it causes pain to others. If I had to nitpick there being a worst girl it was Miyamoko due to being increasingly needy and irritating at times. Yuuko was most interesting character even if only she was in the anime for a handful of a few minutes.   Enjoyment: 2  I did not enjoy it for majority of the time. It did have a few heart-warming scenes her and there, nothing to more to that.  Final Thoughts/Overall: 3  The score for this anime was deceitful. I was just waiting for the episode to end and it seemed to drag along longer than expected. It’s really generic following lots of character traits I don’t particularly enjoy but if done right can be pleasant to watch, which it was not in this case. It’s imagery and out of place segment scenes, left me scratching my head wondering why they were chosen. They were nice to look at but it felt like those scenes interrupted the flow of the anime at times. It just wasn’t my cup of tea, but I am in small percentage of a community that thinks otherwise.;Not Recommended

The series basically consists of 'atmospheric' scenes with long, empty dialogues. the pseudo deep, artsy symbolism is never once explained. This concept would work if the cast wasn't so incredibly generic and boring (then it would might be something like Bakemonogatari). I read a lot of comments how people found the characters unlikable but I wouldn't even say this.

It really is a unique experience!  Story: 8/10 Taking place after the first installment known as ef- a tale of memories, we now follow the tale of most of the supporting cast from the original I just mentioned. Going into this I was a bit bummed that they didn’t decide to simply go with a whole brand new cast for this, but it actually worked out quite well, as this time around we get to learn more about: Kuze, Mizuki, Yuuko and Yu. (which again were simply the supporting cast from the first ef series) And get a better understanding as to who they are, and also answer questions that were not answered from the original. You will be transported back and forth from the past to the present, as the overall plot can only be understood by doing so. Now watching this series you won’t really find anything particularly new here with the story, most of the events that take place are more along the lines of what you would see in a Soap Opera---in other words, lots and LOTS of drama here. Basically each of the four cast members will (or eventually) fall for one another, each having to face their own personal demons (just a medifore) in the process. Most of them are not quite what they appear to be at first, and as the story progress you get a much more in depth look as to who they are. The way it is told though, is what really makes ""ef- a tale of melodies"" stand out. You don’t just simply watch the story and love scenes progress like you would a regular anime. This one is told in a more artistic tone. For example: when the characters are in deep thought from a certain situation, you may see them in a room by themselves--or even see them all chained up as a black silhouette, (this of course represents that the certain character is a prisoner either to themselves, or by another) and a lot of it takes place in the character’s mind and not in the physical form. So you can’t go into this series expecting a ""what you see is what you get"" idea, because this series doesn’t do it that way. Setting the artistic themes aside for a moment, the situations themselves are pretty standard for a drama, which may turn off some people and give the feeling to them that the whole ""medifore"" idea is simply there to only cover up a more standard fared story. Which quite honestly isn’t too far from the truth, as many scenes tended to last quite long, and sometimes seemed to give a more slower pace to the storyline. Still, what it lacks in actual new material with its story, it makes up for by the artistic way it shows it. It also has a worth while ending too!  Art: 10/10 The art of this series is so rich and detailed, I would expect nothing less from the ""ef"" series, in fact just watching the opening scene with the paper airplane gliding along the sunset sky, is truly appealing for the eyes, as is the entire series. The character design (while nothing particularly new) is well distinct. I especially liked the eyes of the characters. The water effects that come from the ocean will seem to just glide across your screen so fluently. And the character animation and backgrounds are truly superb!  Sound: 8/10 I have to say that the sound was the weakest link for me in the anime, the opening and closing were indeed well planned out tracks (both ranging from soft and sincere, to catchy ""finger snapping"" tunes, "" one even sung in English no less) The background music was a bit lack luster though, while you do get nice and appropriate orchestral music that plays in the back during events, nothing ever really stands out too much, with the exception of Kuze’s violin piece. The voice cast was a bit of a ""hit and miss"" for me too. Most of the deep males voices were nice at complimenting the artistic theme of the anime. But most of the female cast I found to be a bit on the standard side, with the exception of a girl name Yuuko, her’s was well fitting the part. Overall it was a great soundtrack, but it just didn't seem to be quite as good as the original's.  Characters: 9/10 I really liked each and everyone of the characters, nobody ever came off as annoying, or would make you feel that they tossed one in just for the sake of doing so. I was especially captivated with the character ""Kuze, "" he is a musician with a quite interesting past, and the turmoil he goes through is quite sad--yet exciting at times. The character chemistry was a bit rushed for one of the couples, but seemed to be pulled off appropriately at the end. Since half of this title is all about back story, you get a pretty in depth look into the character’s lives and can really connect with just who they are, and will feel what they feel!  Overall: 9/10 ef - a tale of melodies is a truly satisfying experience if you can appreciate it’s approach in things. It's debatable as to whether this one surpassed the original or not. It can at least be said however, that this is truly an outstanding sequel! If you prefer a simple and casual romance themed anime then it would probably be best to avoid this one. As many of its extended medifore scenes may tend to drag out and frustrate some viewers. But if you’re an anime fan with a taste for the arts, or perhaps looking for a new way of viewing a romance title, then this series is for you. ef - a tale of melodies is not spectacular in what it shows...but how it shows it!  Side Note: If you are interested in watching this title, I would recommend watching the prequel first. As some of the original main characters from the first make an appearance here, and the whole overall story can only be understood fully from both sides.";Recommended
1;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Demi_V;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Demi_V;10;"*Please watch ef: A Tale of Memories first, because there is a continuation of the love stories presented in the prequel. Feel free to read my review for Memories also.*  After watching Memories, you probably asked yourself these questions: - Why does Yuuko pop up out of nowhere and disappear before you can blink an eye? - How do Yuuko and Yuu know each other? - How do Renji and Chihiro; Hiro and Miyako; and Kyousuke and Kei's relationships continue?  ef: A Tale of Melodies will answer all of those questions as it introduces the background of vague characters from Memories: Mizuki, Yuuko, Yuu, Kuze, and Nagi. There is a brilliant connection between those characters and the ones from Memories. Just like in Memories, there's drama, psychological history in characters, brutal pasts, and everlasting romance resulting from someone refusing to let go of the person they love.  The anime shows three stories: - Yuuko and Yuu have one of the most romantic histories in the series, mainly because they knew each other since childhood. They met each other in an orphanage when they were younger. Yuu lost his little sister in an earthquake in Japan, and he rejects Yuuko because of his grievance. Once they meet again in high school, Yuu regrets how he treated Yuuko after he finds out how brutal her life became after she left the orphanage. Determined to protect the woman he loves, he goes through all odds to hold onto her.  - While visiting her cousin Renji in Australia, Mizuki was introduced to Kuze by Renji's mom. Mizuki heard a beautiful song played by the violin one day, and Renji's mom insisted that Mizuki and Kuze spend time together. Mizuki and Kuze spend the next few days together in Kuze's nearly-empty house. After confessing her love for Kuze, their relationship began to blossom. Shortly, Kuze began pushing Mizuki away to avoid hurting her, even though he loved her, too. Despite Kuze's medical condition and his rejection, Mizuki is determined to stay by his side no matter what it takes. You should see all of the crazy yet romantic things she does to make him happy.  - Relationships from Memories continue...  Art and Sound: The art and sound fit perfectly together. It is more museum-like with the mirrored bodies and masks. As the art is displayed, dramatic music is played simultaneously. Kuze's violin piece and Yuuko's improvised lyrics fully explains the moral of the entire series. In order to avoid confusion, the anime presents footnotes at the end of each episode to describe certain terms and references mentioned in the episode. Also, it attaches the time so you can recall where you heard the reference.  Characters: - Yuu is an artist and draws quite often. He never desired to join the Art Club, but he drew amazing landscapes and portraits, especially of Yuuko. His dream is to create a beautiful city filled with kind people, which is why he stayed in Australia. - Yuuko was Yuu's lover in the past. She is now the magical advisor that appears before the main characters to bring happiness to them all. With the same dream as Yuu, she is located in Japan. - Kuze is a famous violinist and Renji's next-door neighbor. He struggled with a personality disorder ever since he had a heart spasm during a concert. As he awaits for his death, he attempts to end all relationships in an attempt to make it so that he simply disappeared. - Mizuki is Kei's close friend and appears off and on in Memories. She's quite energetic and refuses to shed a tear in front of others. After graduating from Otawa Academy, she moved to Australia to live with Renji (her cousin). There is when she met Kuze. - Nagi is the elder sister of Hiro, Kei, and Chihiro. She used to crush on Yuu in high school but lost to Yuuko. She later became engaged to Kuze.  Just as Memories, you're in for some deep romantic stories.";Recommended
2;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;nightsword;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nightsword;10;"&ldquo;Right art tells right people the right things&quot;  I don&rsquo;t remember exactly in which movie did I hear this phrase, but it has haunted me ever since the first time I heard it. It contains in itself an irrevocable truth about human mind, that tastes are not &quot;universal&quot;, but rather contained in each individual. Thus some people would manage to enjoy stuff like Rosario to Vampire and Miley Sirius music, while others might rather puke at mere mention of them.  Where does the difference lie? In the intelligence of the one who enjoys it, perhaps? I doubt it. If such were the case, it would be reason, not emotions, the one that would makes the difference, and its a well know empirical fact that don&rsquo;t &quot;think&quot; you like something, you just &quot;know&quot;. (It is more probable that intelligent people might be reluctant to be lumped up with &quot;the stupid&quot; and avoid everything that&rsquo;s &quot;main stream&quot; like not long ago the aristocracy rejected that which was done by those not belonging to noble class. )  I think the difference falls into the capability of the subject to relate it self with the art. Once it become something similar, akin to experience, one can truly understand its meaning and able to get its true message. Think of this: love songs will often sound &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; until you fall in for the first time. Then, Oh! everything make sense. In fact , Too much sense  When one &quot;gets&quot; what they are talking about, then you can move on to the next phase. The art cannot only speak of what you have already experienced, but leave you with a new perspective of the situation. It might affect your way of thinking altogether and change you for good. That is right art, one that is not only a passive object, but one that becomes part of the observant and modifies him into something new.  With that in mind, I can say with out regrets that Ef- a tale of memories/melodies ( I must consider both, since they actualy belong to the same game) is not only a piece art, but &quot;right art&quot;. It tackled to of my favourite topics (God and death) and managed to give me new perspective into those issues, and some little changes in my view of my life as a whole. (it may sound exaggerated and melodramatic, but think how many people had their life changed because of Evangelion. That one did screw up my entire generation, and almost every generation after that one. Compared to that this one is just a mere breeze )  With that in mind, I must lay down a warning. You might find it either a Masterpiece or no more than a cheap soap opera with around 15 minutes of talk and 10 minutes of Songs. It depends on your capacity to relate to the story, which in itself depends on the way you had lived your life so far. It will also depends in the reason you have to watch anime as a whole, or even in your emotional states as you go throught the episodes. Then, I specially recommend trying it if had ever thought you are fucked up and hated God, if you had loss someone you loved, or if you like pretty drawings and shiny colourful scenes that have nothing to do with the story. If you are not one of those, I could still recommend it if you have nothing else to watch, if only so you can brag about it later and write condescending reviews to mocks those who didnt like it so they can see how cool you are.";Recommended
3;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Seijurou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Seijurou;10;"""Sequel."" A variety of reactions could be displayed when seeing/hearing this word: ""I hope this is as good as/keeps up with/better than the original."" ""Will they explain that?"" ""No, this is enough; anything more will ruin the story."" Some more of this piece of crap?"" ""Yes, more of this show!"" Of course, I had the last sentiment. It is no easy task to follow up on a story. As we all know, if something drags on for too long, it loses its essence, and I believe that usually, beginnings are the best part of anything. Rarely they are not. This is an especially difficult task with an anime as great as Ef. I can safely say, though, that Ef - A Tale of Melodies lives up to its prequel, Ef - A Tale of Memories.  The anime is based on an adult visual novel, called Ef - A Fairy Tale of the Two, with original female character design by Nanao Naru, who also did the manga version. The mystery of Himura Yuu and Amamiya Yuuko finally unravels here. Firstly, let me give you a proper synopsis.  As narrated by the protagonist, Himura, there are two cities called Otowa, one that is built on the burnt rubble of its former self, and another that is a fake mirror of it. Yuu and Shuuichi are talking while the latter is burning his letters, ending his relationships, including one by Nagi, which, though rare of her, he does not read. In the past, a high school boy was walking down the street, when he noticed a girl on a roof. He went to her, and the two talked. It seemed as if she, Amamiya Yuuko, knew who he, Himura Yuu, was, yet, he did not recognize her. She proceeded by saying that she still hated Yuu. At school, Himura saw the words ""Art room - Hirono"" on his desk, and exclaimed ""ano baka (that idiot)."" On his way there, to his surprise, he met with his friend, Kuze, who was having a flea market before going abroad. After Shuuichi learned where Yuu was going, he wished him a safe trip (as if he were leaving to a dangerous place). Near the art room, Himura also met with Amamiya Akira-sensei, who thought that Yuu was at last joining the art club, like Amamiya had always wanted him to, but Himura quickly and bluntly dismisses the idea. Holding an unlighted cigarette, Amamiya said that it is horrible how people are always drawn to art, whether it is voluntary or by being dragged thanks to those who are, advising Himura to simply join. After reaching the room, Yuu witnessed Hirono Nagi there, drawing a nude self-portrait with no clothes on. He immediately told her to wear her uniform, thinking that what Amamiya had said might really be true, then she forced him to go shopping with her, much to his dismay. Going home, they noticed a girl, Amamiya Yuuko, following them. A conversation ensued between the three, and ended up with Hirono throwing a sketch book she wanted to give as a present on Himura. Yuu and Yuuko went to the beach, where the former eventually said he remembered the latter. At the present, Hayama Mizuki, who is about to enter college by recommendation, is staying with her cousin, Asou Renji, a former protagonist. After waking up from another bad dream, she realizes that famous violinist, Kuze Shuuichi, is living next door, and insists on meeting him to hear him play nama (live or bare; there is a small joke on that here and a big one in B Gata H Kei). Renji suspiciously tries to prevent her from doing so, but he has no choice, since, unlike Mizuki, he has to study for college examinations. She finally meets Shuuichi, who immediately reminds her of Tsutsumi Kyousuku, another previous protagonist and her senpai, Shindou Kei's boyfriend; a womanizer. He agrees to play with her. However, Mizuki notices strange things at Shuuichi's place, but for which he always comes up with an excuse. First of all, his living room contains very little furniture, making Hayama think Kuze is about to move, but he says he just likes big spaces. Second of all, she tells him she wants to hear him play the violin, but he replies he cannot, and after being inquired as to why, he says it is broken. Third of all, a clock alarm rings in the afternoon, and Shuuichi exclaims that it is for his stomach (to eat). Mizuki only finds drinks in the refrigerator, but he informs her he has ice as well. Kuze speaks in a formal manner, which Hayama picks up on, but he explains that he has to talk this way, as he meets a lot of people, likening it to wearing masks, which he has hung up on the wall. Mizuki lightly says that cat masks are kawaii (cute), and asks Shuuichi to lie on the ground with her, just relaxing and enjoying the lack of shoujo manga, which she loves, that takes up space in her room. Later, however, when Hayama leaves, Kuze, alone in a dark room, feels a severe chest pain, and is forced to sit on his couch, saying, ""not yet . . .""  A good mystery is answered with more mysteries, as this season does. One of the few down points this series has is a supernatural element that is revealed at the end. Those who finish it will understand. I still like the morals that are taught, though.  The best way to continue a series is by showing past events, linking them to current ones, which Ef - A Tale of Melodies brilliantly and intricately executes, despite the aforementioned extraordinary happening. Showing the main characters as young kids is informative and gives depth to them. Seeing the lead, Himura Yuu being more carefree and displaying funny facial expressions is refreshing from his current more depressing, somber self. The same thing can be said of the heroine, Amamiya Yuuko, who is now a serious, wise girl, where she was outgoing and always smiling, hiding her true feelings. Hirono Hiro, the prequel's protagonist's oneechan (older sister) surprisingly plays a major role now, where she was just mentioned as part of his pseudonym, Shindou Nagi. Their love triangle is similar to Hirono Hiro, Miyamura Miyako, and Shindou Kei's, where two of them have a friendly relationship, and a girl appears, changing things. Another surprise is that two people have met before any of them could remember, but it happens later, in episode ten, the best and saddest one, although it is in black and white.  The opening sequence is also played in black and white. Similar to the previous season, the song, portraying the main characters, is in English, except for the final episode, twelve, where it is played in Japanese, which is better, with the same catchy tune. In one episode, the piece is instrumental (referring to the title, I believe) (showing no characters), and, at one time, the ending sequence is a slowed-down version of the opening sequence without the melody; both of which never took place in the prequel. Again, however, like the first season, the ending sequences vary, with some of them dedicated to the heroines. The soundtrack and seiyuu in general are amazing.  One of the other reviewers said that he wanted a different cast for this season. What is that about? The entire series revolves around Himura Yuu and Amamiya Yuuko; it would not be right to leave their story hanging, though I would not mind if there were an unrelated (or related) third season, because I could not find another series even close to this one in terms of epicness, but that is highly unlikely, since it is based on a game that has already finished, as mentioned in the Latter Tale's trailer.  I could talk on and on about how wonderful this show is, but you will have to see it for yourself. This is romance, drama, and tragedy at their best. The artwork is beautiful and the story is spectacular. I guarantee you will love this anime. It is my all-time favorite one (along with Ef - A Tale of Memories).

4;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;KnightessKana;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KnightessKana;10;ef - a tale of melodies is a deep, unique anime embedded with both strong and subtle themes in a purposeful elegance.  The second season of the ef series (tale of memories was the first season), a tale of melodies comes full circle. A tale of melodies is an awe-inspiring storyline that can be described as enigmatic, ephemeral, and turbulent, yet leaves an impression that (ironically) is vivid, lasting, and resolute. Little about tale of melodies is immediately straightforward, yet that is what makes the story possess the kind of depth that enables it to project multiple themes.  While the first season (a tale of memories) confounded many viewers with its strange representation and plot development, a tale of melodies thrilled using the same strategy. Much of it is attributed towards the familiarity of the intended audience to some of the characters and better continuity associated with brilliant storylines.  As a warning, I would not recommend watching a tale of melodies before a tale of memories although in my opinion a tale of memories is a much inferior work, as it is important to understand the characters, which a tale of memories did not do as well or project to such a high level of excellence.  Of the many facets that make a tale of memories amazing is the number of thematic layers it possesses with such an unpredictable plot. The depiction and manipulation of time and space within the anime was played to perfection by allowing viewers to see the anime from multiple perspectives (each with their own unique set of themes) that eventually merge into one. The anime is is devoid of 'filler' and each scene has a purpose.  One of the things I found to very impressive about a tale of melodies was that it was able to preserve the continuity and consistency with story and character despite the entropic pace and developments within the story. Everything that happens possesses a meaning, yet nothing is immediately obvious before it happened. Often the anime has abrupt shifts in themes, yet blend with masterful synergy. Nothing from the anime is what it initially seems, and that is one of the reasons it is so good. In a sense, the creators imposed a set of strong themes towards the viewer without giving anything away, which is rarely seen in animes with similar storylines.  Along with depth and uniqueness, the broad variety of characters with different personalities, behaviors, beliefs, and even morality added more color and detail to the already intriguing anime. The level of information gained within each character was amazing given the anime's short length (12 episodes) to develop each of them. Not only were the creators able to do that, but they also developed the characters to such a high level of synergy that each character was connected to the other characters within a large web that if broken would distort the entire anime. To develop an anime that can sustain such a brilliant plot and strong themes while navigating through such a fragile web is nothing short of masterful.  However, in the end what makes a tale of memories a masterpiece is its message. It pieces together many facets of life such as distress, egotism, nostalgia, love, sorrow, loss, and hope and knits it into a quilt that provides different messages based on the viewer. Although the message might vary from person to person, it is undeniably profound.  A tale of melodies is a work of art. It paints a medley of characters in a world that it cannot be detached to and leaves viewers amazed.;Recommended
5;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;whi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whi;10;"I often see people making the comparison of this anime to Clannad. But in my opinion, that is a little misleading. Unlike the focus on family with a general tone of warmth. ef is more like finding that dwindling bit of fire in the cold world and live on with an iron will.  Otowa, the place where the story takes place in, is spelled as 音羽 in kanji. ""音"" means ""sound"", referring to the Suuichi's violin, and how the music will stop when the bow stop. ""羽"" refers to the eternal feather of Yukko and the continuation of hope.  In fact, the theme that carries throughout both season of ef is the decision of eternal and temporality. Like 13 hours of memory that Chihiro has and Renji's untiring pursuit of her. Or the conversation between Hiro and Mihako on the telephone. Unlike other shows that ask rhetorical questions and never answer them. ef gives its solution.  ""No matter how much you treasure them, both people and things will die someday. The bonds, the feelings, the memories, the hearts, and their lives. There's nothing in this world that won't die. There's nothing that won't break. Happiness is nothing more than a fabrication; a false mirage. That's why... That's why we should treasure them. So that we can face the farewell that'll one day visit us without regret. Because it'll break, it is precious. Let's make it precious.""  The anime is also filled with symbolism and clues in its progressively changing op, use of colors, camera transition screens and even the tiles of each episode. (hint: the first letter)  I guess the reason why I spent this much time writing this ""review"" is that I don't think people truly appreciate this anime and how barely anyone mentions it in anime discussions. I guess that's the fate of being an art piece: not being financially successful and is only enjoyed by the few. Yet, a part of me almost doesn't want it to be popular. Like that small cafe down the corner of the street. You enjoy its quietness and the coffee and want to share it with more people. Yet that would ruin why you like it in the first place: the peacefulness.";Recommended
6;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Zaku88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zaku88;10;"In my mind, the Ef series defined what great animation was in its time; and the animation style paved the way for some of the techniques that Shaft is now famous for. It is a great relationship show with actual meanings, something that many shows these days seem to lack. Thus without further ado, let us proceed with the review.  Ef- A Tale of Melodies is more of a continuation than a sequel to A Tale of Memories. It tells the tale of the older generation (Kuze, Yuko, and Himura) that seemed to show up randomly but at key moments in the first series to give the young couples words of advice. This series greatly deepens the meaning of the relationships in Memories and puts the whole ""two cities"" and other ideas in perspective. The story very nicely generalizes to the main story behind Himura-Yuuko and Kuze-Mizuki while still maintaining cameo appearances by the cast in the original Memories.  This series, unlike many other recent watches, attempts to carry a message to the viewer rather than just serving as a means of entertainment. On the note of entertainment, this series is very dark; I would not recommend this series for those under 14. However, the entire point behind the combined series (Memories and Melodies) is the theme of perseverance and hope.  Melodies did an outstanding job of uniting the stories of both series as well as bringing a satisfying sense of completion to the franchise. The ending is very well planned and executed (a sharp contrast with DCIISS) and left me very impressed. I had high expectations for this series after Memories and it did not disappoint.  Animation: The animation quality is very high, making use of many colors giving the series a feeling of warmth or coldness when appropriate. Characters are well drawn and emotions are very apparent at times, basically expect what you saw from Melodies.  There are many stylistic points that are unique to the Ef series (Minori really) including halos around characters in dark environments and simple yet potent artistic animation sequences.  Many may disagree with me on the animation score due to the fact that many of the animation sequences seem cheap, such as the characters being drawn in monochrome or other easily-animated ""short-cuts"". However, I feel that this is an artistic decision and successfully contributes to the underlying theme of incompleteness. If you pay attention to the OPs/EDs (as in Memories), the final episode is different as now the story is complete and the characters have now been fully exposed (and thus no longer opaque!).  As I believe the animation decisions were key to the presentation and feel of the series, I felt the drawing style complemented the story and themes perfectly. As close to a masterpiece as I had seen at the time.  Sound: The OP is done by ELISA just as in Melodies. Though the song is not as vibrant as in the previous series, it still has the same general feel to it. It is in somewhat broken English but those watching this are probably already used to it from Melodies. There are multiple EDs as in Memories and those are fair in quality, comparable to Melodies. The BGM is very reminiscent of the first series. It carries a calm yet not quite friendly feel and compliments the atmosphere created by the artistic style and animation. There is a repeated theme that is played throughout the series. It starts as a fragment of a memory and develops slowly into a complete song by the end of the series, again a great execution decision that adds to the climax.  The VA cast is the same as in Memories though the main VAs have shifted. Those that had a supporting role in Memories are now the main VAs. Yuko has a particularly difficult role and the VA did an awesome job. If I had anything against the series it would be Himura's voice. He doesn't seem to have the enthusiasm that most of the other characters show, even more so given his character portrayal.  Story: Yu Himura, Yuko Amamiya, Kuze, and Mizuki were all supporting character in Memories. Now they take center stage as their past and present are told in an intricate tale that also links to relationships in the original Melodies series.  As in the original story, the story takes place in two cities, one in Japan and one in Australia. The two mirror cities is a theme that will be exploited greatly and finally explained in completion by the end of the series.  The two main stories are the history of Yu Himura and Yuko Amamiya and the present development between Kuze and Mizuki. Both stories are told concurrently in a similar fashion to Melodies, the difference being that Yuko's story is in the past. There aren't episodic cliffhangers, as the entire series as a whole is a cliffhanger in that each episode serves as a teaser to whet the viewer's appetite. Many of the characters have had a very dark past and/or present and these are explained in excruciating detail, giving the viewer a sense of the character's pain. As mentioned previously, some of these are quite graphic and may not be appropriate for younger audiences. However, the series then puts everything into perspective and finally leaves the watcher with a very philosophical and hopeful message at the end. The conclusion explains many of the happenings in both Memories and Melodies and gives a very satisfying sense of conclusion.  Overall, the stories are intricate and well planned. Expect some surprises along the way that deepen the meaning of both series.  Character: The development of the main characters takes the majority of the series as the viewer listens in to the character thoughts. It is very difficult to say much here without spoiling parts of the story but suffice to say all the characters have had significant difficulties in their past that they are trying to overcome. The exposition of each character is wonderful (yet painful) and the main characters from the previous series also return to explain how their roles are actually related to the main stories in the present.  Value: Melodies is a wonderful, yet painful, experience that explains many of the confusing aspects that were in Memories. It is show full of details and buried themes that the philosophical-minded viewer will enjoy. As many of the subtle points are buried behind animation sequences and hints, a re-watch will definitely reward the viewer. This series truly breathes life into a genre that I hadn't watched in a while. And it still resonates years after its release. Pick this up if you've watched Memories and liked the artistic qualities and get ready for quite an adventure.";Recommended
7;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Ru-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ru-chan;10;"Ef - a tale of melodies. Can you hear that? The melody of truth.  1. ARTISTRY: 10/10 ""Artistry is the quality that appeals to one's sense of beauty.""  In my opinion, if I were to compare this anime to all the other anime I've watched until now, I'd say this show is unique in a certain aspect.  It's rare that I get to experience an anime wherein which the artistry and the visual aspect of anime itself moves me deeply.  Symbolisms. These are underated elements that are unseen to some people in the naked eye but I tend to look at each show's symbolisms and imageries, as these hold a secret yet an immense meaning behind them. Symbolisms appeared all over the anime, which is one reason why I like it. Masks, concealing your true identity, indeed a parasite that eventually becomes a part of you as it isolates you from your real self and lives you a life of a fraudulent person. Keys, a symbolism pertaining to the key that opens new doors, new doors in life. Paper airplanes, they soar through the vicinity of the endless horizon, aiming not only high but also forward amidst the sky. Indeed, this series held a bunchful of symbolisms and each one had a distinct and incredible meaning.  The songs used in this anime are also absolutely beautiful. “Music is what feelings sound like,” and I believe that the feelings felt in each and every song were portrayed to the utmost perfection. A big commendation to the song, A Moon Filled Sky. The violin's tune and melody along with the lyric's message, with them combined, they are able to form a song that brings about feelings of happiness, melancholy, nostalgia, pain and love all at once. Songs like this bring me to tears and bring me to LSS.  The set-up of the plot, finally, was also plotted out nicely. The story was indeed unique and not cliché. Each series featured multiple stories of a couple's story towards their journey of reaching one another and they were able to balance out the interest of each story.  2. INTELLECTUAL VALUE: 10/10 ""Intellectual value refers to the anime stimulating thought. It enriches our mental life by making us realize fundamental truths about life and human nature.""  Who wouldn't learn anything after seeing two seasons that foretold true love, pain and anguish of separation? ef - a tale of melodies. was packed with fundamental yet unrealized truths about life itself.  Every conflict each character faced through, every action each character did, every consequence each character faced is already a realization of the fundamental truth that goodness begets goodness.  3. SUGGESTIVENESS: 10/10 ""Suggestiveness is the quality associated with the emotional power shown and experienced by the audience.""  Wow, I was moved throughout the whole course of the series, both of them, especially this sequel.  Practically, every wavering scene moved my heart. When conflicts appeared and in consequence, caused sadness with each presented couple, when an answer that could solve the problem appeared and eventually did and then they fell happily ever after. In all these moments, strong emotion built up inside of me, I almost wanted to cry but I didn't, as if I did, I would be interfering the flow of the show.  The very fact that I forced myself not to cry in order to waver the feelings in my heart more while watching the show already raises a 10/10 for suggestiveness, no doubt.  Intense emotions, emitted both in the scene and on the audience's point of view, that is the true epitome of suggestiveness.  4. SPIRITUAL VALUE: 10/10 ""Spiritual value is the quality wherein which the show elevates the spirit by bringing out moral values which make us better persons.""  I consider the spiritual value of the show the most among all the other aspects. If I learn something out of it, if I'm able to change myself for the better thanks to a show, that show deserves a 10/10 for changing an individual's life.  ""To keep on dreaming... that's the first step to making a dream come true.""  This show led me to realize that miracles do happen, dreams do come true and that nothing is impossible. All of them had a simple way for them all to be true and that is to never give up.  Life. Oh yes, it is undoubtedly going to be one hell of a journey. You're going to experience loneliness, anguish, despair and all other painful moments at some point in your life but in the same time, you will experience the greatest feelings you will ever have such as love, happiness and joy, as featured in this show. Everyone in the story had a happy end with an everlasting shine, nevertheless of all the painful experiences they've went through.  This show gave light to life, despite this world's cruel society, with all the corrupt officials, merciless murderers, deceiving friends. The show singlehandedly inspired me to look at life in a much greater aspect than I had seen it before. I am just pumped up with inspiration and motivation to strive for the best right now so I can live my life to the fullest after watching such a masterpiece.  5. PERMANENCE: 10/10 ""Permanence is shown when a great show endures time and space. Thus, it immortalizes its maker along with the show itself.""  I'm not gonna forget this show for a long time, I can guarantee that. After all I've learned from the story, there's no way I'll immediately forget it. The moral messages shown throughout the series, those words will soon turn into actions of kindness in my case. I keep in mind that if I learn something, I will always apply it into action to further engrave the message into my mind and into my life.  OVERALL: 10/10 or 10/10  My overall score may seem a bit exaggerated but what I grade it is true. ef - a tale of melodies. is one of the most magnificent masterpieces of anime I've seen in my whole history of watching anime. If you were to hear my opinion whether this is worthy enough to watch, all I can say is that it won't be a waste of time and that you won't regret watching it. Infact, if you're not watching it yet and you are reading this review, you better stop reading and start watching and I bid you happiness as you watch the series where you indeed can and will hear the melody of truth. ;)";Recommended
8;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;lotusres;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lotusres;10;"It is so beautiful, i enjoyed it better than the first season. The characters are really well-made and have very deep connections with the ones in the first season. The plot is even better than the first season; the beginning is a bit strange but it just keeps getting better and better. The music is what i like the most. Every song was perfect in the moment they placed it, they're also really beautiful and fit the series perfectly. The art is really something. Not only the abundance of opening versions they made, about 8, but also the landscapes and those romantic moments; the art it's been worked on a lot. I really enjoyed this series to the4 point i cried in the last episode. If you like original romantic anime I strongly recommend this. It's not your typical romantic story, it's fantastic.";Recommended
9;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Kurogashi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kurogashi;10;This is probably one of the most beautiful, yet complex anime that I have ever laid my eyes upon. Every little single details in this anime are continually emphasized to draw in the viewer closer and closer. I am almost at lost of words right now. The way they portrayed everything was too beautiful and surreal that it is almost unexpressable.  I absoulutely loved how closely season 1 and 2 are incorporated. Every character from season 1 and 2 were carefully intertwined with one and another, giving the show a wonderful feel to it.  The opening from both seasons were awesome and sung in english too, which is something that doesn't happen very often. There was even an episode that had both of the openings played and thus added in a lively tone for the episode.  This anime was certainlly a masterpiece. Each and every little love story were strokes of success for this anime. Ef, was certainly a refreshing one and is something that will stand out for many years to come. It has truly inspired me as a person to persue my passions and have also encouraged me to face the long road of happiness ahead. I hope that every single viewer out there can take a little piece of this anime and keep it for the rest of their lives. Then maybe one day, there will be a town full of happiness.;Recommended
10;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;lendiznick;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lendiznick;10;Finally got to watch this after catching up on other animes and this one is a good one and a must see.  The main story in my opinion is mostly renji-kun life, they had other small stories for everyone else, but most of it i believe leans more to renji. Renji always walks down a railroad track which has been broken for a long time, he meets a girl name Chihiro Shindou while he is walking. they start to talk alot and get to know each other, he has been warned not to fall in love with her and if he does, he will have to face what happens afterwards. Renji finds out that chihiro has a memory of a 13 hour life span, she can only remember 13 hours of her life, she always brings a diary with her and writes everything down so when she wakes up in the morning, she knows what she did they day before. Renji falls in love with her despite the fact of her condition and helps her with a dream she always wanted to do but was nearly impossible because of her condition, which is to write a novel. Anything else i say will basically be spoilers but for some reason i believe the main character in the short stories they have in this anime, renji would be the most important one.  The art in this anime is beautiful. you have your summer Christmas in a different country, then your winter Christmas in japan. Not only that this anime is all about art, the characters in the anime love to draw, one is a manga artist for example, so seeing all the art and pictures they make themselves is very good.  This is an overall good anime, you'll need to watch this first before watching ef a tale of melodies, so please watch memories first then melodies, but dont forget to bring something to wipe your tears with after watching this anime, this anime is all about love and romance and how far someone will go to be with someone they fell in love with.;Recommended
11;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;ray357;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ray357;9;Future? A unknown phenomenon that occurs after the present moment. You’ll never know what might be in store for you so the only thing you must do is gather your courage and determination and march forward!!  If you have watch the prequel of this story then you will not be disappointed however have you ever wonder who was the girl with the blue hair was. She always appears when the main characters are in a slump, troubled on what to do next. Exactly who and what is she? a deity? a ghost? She appears and then disappears without a trace. Also who was Himura, he seemed to know a lot of the answers regarding life but is it from personal experience? He was waiting for someone and in the end the first series, he was waiting for Yuko, the girl with blue hair but who is she and what exactly is their relationship? Well you are about to find out in this sequel to E.F: A Tales of Melodies!! If you like the first series with the crazy philosophical sense in the artwork and in the setting then you w]on’t be let down. This time it isn’t just full of drama.. it has action too. This time this story is focus on the characters that were giving guidance (Himura, Yuko and Kuze) to the protagonists of the first series. We get to look into the proof behind those words that help the young protagonist out, starting with the view the relationship that Himura had while he was in high school. After all Himura is the protagonist of the story and present Kuze. That’s right instead of 3 male lead, its 2! This series rather than focusing on the emotional dilemmas and love ties like “A tales of Memories” this series does indeed has those trait incorporated but it takes them to a whole another level. This one incorporates the themes from the prequel plus the addition of torture and suffering of losing someone. The only difference is whether one wants to enjoy ever last moment they have or try to forget them before they get to deep. The protagonist is rather considerate to others yet very cruel to himself. He would rather suffer and die alone without bothering anyone or hurting anyone too deeply. In one view point he is very courageous but in another viewpoint he is very conceited. Though it is a really painful decision to make and not anyone could have this determination to break all ties. The other protagonist however is face with a more traumatizing dilemma. Everyone has a scar that can never heal after losing a loved one in an accident, but everyone has their own way of recovering over it. In Himura’s scenario, it’s rather intense. He encounters his childhood friend who got adopted before him and learned something horrifying about her. Nobody could be more prepared to suddenly lose a loved one. No can cope with the facts right away. Wounds take time to heal especially the one in the heart, but this scenario is insane. “When one thinks of another’s feeling and blame oneself, it actually makes the other suffer more. But when the one inflicting the pain is the one who felt the most pain. When one loses a loved one, one could recover by the comfort and support from family or friend but what if that family or friend is the one you lost and there’s no one else who could help you? This person found a replacement for their loved one. Instead of showering them with emotion of the one they lost, they inflict pain on the innocent. However there is a twist!!... As the plot deepens, the story gets more realistic in the way where we could somewhat apply in our own lives. This story shows us a grander psychological angle. However the similarity between both characters is that they are both running away from reality. They seem to be thinking they are doing the right thing but that is only for self-satisfaction. They are insecure and thinking it’s the right thing to do. However they are scared to face the truth!  As always the artwork is fantastic as well, the symbols of the scenery really capture the mood and setting. Plus the variety of colors really describe the mood of the characters and sort of sending out a subliminal message on how the viewers should feel. The characters are drawn in the same way as the first series, and the character get drawn in a different frame all locked up to inscribe to us how they are feeling inside. Showing us this abstract scene really get oneself engross on the character. This part I don’t despise but sometime I feel frighten on how the story unravel. However that is this anime’s hook!  This anime is truly a beautiful piece of work. It is magnificent, how the story is laid out the way it is. I especially like how it has more than one male lead in these romance stories because that way the story does end and not leave the viewer hanging and also for other people to not loathe the author for not matching up the character with the one they chose.  Honestly to sum up this series, I’ll end with a quote! This is a story of “Will.” “People who walk toward the future will eventually reach the place that they once dreamt of. Toward the tomorrow that gleam of light”  I highly recommend this anime to those fanatics out there who really loves a good romantic, sad and tragic anime. You will really enjoy this and will be engross with it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.   Can you hear it?

12;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Rohirim91;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rohirim91;9;"Spoilers regarding the general feel of endings included - beware!  ef: A Tale of Melodies, which I will refer to as Melodies in this review, manages to pull out a demanding, parallel past and present, storytelling style which follows two seamingly separate, yet ultimately connected storylines of Yuu and Kuze. Before going into more details I feel obliged to note that Melodies was the first part of the ef series that I have watched, which has in no way made watching the show harder or more confusing - which is a quality of it's own.  Story - 8: The story of Melodies was truly intriguing, yet with ultimately predictable and cliché twists and predictable endings of both storylines. However, the endings were satisfying enough for Melodies to be forgiven for these fallacies. Of the two endings, Kuze's one is happy, yet with a degree of uncertainty (which to be fair is countered by the general atmosphere of hope for the future) and Yuu's is happy but bittersweet and might remind the viewer of the Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End ending, which features a bittersweet long distance and time limited love relationship. In general, Melodies resisted the popular trend of sad, melancholic endings and managed to deliver endings which can appeal to the tastes of both sugarhappy and bittersweet ending loving viewers.  Characters - 9: The love relationships between Yuu and Yuuko, and Kuze and Mizuki felt rushed and forced at their starts, but if accepted as they are, they are not hard to follow through. Rushed and forced relationships are nothing new in storytelling, but Melodies managed to make it believable enough for them to be acceptable. Despite the supporting cast being unknown to me due to not watching the original show first, they were introduced well, and more importantly, in a way and amount needed for the sake of Melodies' storytelling, making Melodies work well even as a standalone show. Due to this, it was not untill the very end that I realised that Melodies might be a sequel of another show. In general, aside from the forced relationships, I have no problems with the cast of Melodies. I must also express my pleasant amazement with the portayal of Kuze's internal struggles about such a grievous life situation, which stole the show for me.  Art - 10: The artstyle in Melodies simply screams ""THIS IS STUDIO SHAFT"" in Gerrard Butler's Leonidas style and I must say that it is the main supporting pillar of the show. The similarities of the artstyles of Melodies and the Monogatari series oftentimes made me feel like im watching the latter. The OPs and EDs were also excellent, especially the OPs which togheter with the soundtrack made me enjoy watching them despite my habit of almost always skipping OPs and EDs. The part of the OPs in which Mizuki jumps and dissipates into feathers is an exeptionaly amazing eyecandy, together with the aformentioned Kuze's internal struggles as well as the scenes of confrontation with professor Akira Amamiya in his house.  Sound - 8: Aside from the song used in the OPs, the soundtrack was generaly nothing amasing nor memorable. It fulfilled its purpose when necessary and added to the general quality of the scenes.  Enjoyement & Overal - 9: I am not a big fan of drama and dramatic, complicated love relationships (or any such relatioships for that matter). However, Melodies was not overly dramatic and didn't reach the point of outright melancholy and masochism even for my low levels of tolerancy. It may have been the general feel of show that kept me watching even whenever drama kicked in.  To conclude, I watched Melodies in one sitting without ever feeling too tired by the pacing or being annoyed by the predictable twists and not completely sugar happy endings, despite sugar happy endings being the ones I prefer and enjoy - when they are done right. It is a heartwarming show, which I would recommend to anyone who is at least a bit into love hurdles and drama, those who enjoy art and in general to anyone who managed to get to the end of this review without saying ""nope, not watching"".

13;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;MALHI;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MALHI;9;"Very infrequently one comes across an exquisitely presented work of art that mesmerises, thrills and captivates. With every passing glimpse, the spectator is left with a plethora of emotions and a stream of portentous thoughts reverberating around their mind like a pulsating ocean. “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is a tour de force of this calibre that elicits the full range of emotions from the astonished viewer who is left with a fuller perception of the triumphs and hardships of life. Struggles, achievement and benevolent bonds between individuals encompass life, a reality that is elegantly portrayed by “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” as a cast of remarkably believable characters coalesces with a gracefully crafted storyline of immense distinctiveness. This series is the sequel to the exceptional “Ef: A Tale of Memories” that was in itself a truly singular accomplishment; in many ways the sequel is able to serenely surpass the original.  Taking place after the first instalment, “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” entangles the mysteries of most of the supporting characters from the original series. The series uses a narrative similar to the first instalment as two separate and parallel plotlines are successfully portrayed. Yuu Himura is the diligent and assiduous protagonist of the first story which is set years in the past; he is depicted as a determined young man who is intrinsically fixated with maintaining his topmost academic position at Otowa Academy. At school he fatefully comes across an enigmatic girl by the name of Yuuko Amamiya who, to his stark bewilderment, appears to clearly recognise him. From this point the viewer begins to be enthralled by a quintessential emotional voyage as memories from a detached and tragic childhood, fragments of a difficult past rather left irretrievable, begin to come back to Yuu through his encounters with Yuuko. This consequential reunion with Yuuo causes Yuu to once again confront the dejections and resentments of their shared past and present- it sets Yuu on the altruistic path to save Yuuko from a history of violent abuse. Yuu Himura is a young man who carries many intricacies; he is depicted as an archetypal pessimist whose negativity borders upon nihilism and a confused individual who is chronically indecisive. Through his interactions with Yuuko Amamiya, person who displays immense kindness and emotional rigour amidst arduous circumstances, we see the maturation and mental development of an individual who was initially tentative about life. Both characters are effectively portrayed but the encounters between the two can at times be overly dramatic to the point where some scenes lose their realism. Nonetheless, this story is strikingly well-developed and perhaps the more superior plotline of the series as it induces sorrow, anger and pity through characters that ultimately convey an emboldening sense of equanimity.  The second plotline, which focuses on the present -day lives of Shuuchi Kuze and Mizuki Hayama, is the weaker story since it is not as emotionally charged and distinctive as Yuu and Yuuko’s arc. Due to slower pacing it lacks the gallop of anxiety and the vivid suspense that makes the first story so transfixing; Kuze’s arc is fascinating and well portrayed but the individual scenes are not as well executed as the impeccably weaved melodrama of Yuu’s melancholic past. With regard to the story, Shuuchi may appear to be a definitive womaniser but it soon becomes clear that he is indeed a truly convoluted and tragic character who craves isolation. Yet by sheer chance he comes across a girl by the name of Mizuki Hayama who is infatuated by him as soon as she hears the alluring and ravishing sounds of his violin performance. It is later established that Shuuchi is suffering from a terminal condition and that his days are severely numbered; amidst this reality he has decided to cut off all of his relationships and submit to a sequestered demise. The poignancy of Shuuchi’s character is exceptionally portrayed as the producers skilfully craft an atmosphere that almost forces the viewer to become sympathetic to his condition and struggles. Mizuki Hayama, however, is a person who will not let him perish alone and without resistance; Mizuki attempts to become closer to the dismissive Shuuchi, giving rise to an incipient romance that is blighted by the dejecting shadow of imminent tragedy. The arc is deficient in the emotional melodrama that the first story so powerfully portrayed but on its own, Shuuchi’s plotline is compellingly enacted due to a profound and deeply resonating message- through force of will and sheer determination one can valiantly confront their struggles. The two plotlines introduce a thoroughly engrossing psychological element as the producers give regular insights about the thoughts dominating the characters’ minds, which increases the emotional rapport between the viewer and the cast. Both Shuuchi and Mizuki are flawed characters whose pretensions of ebullience are a façade to mask their own mental conflicts and inner anguishes. The pragmatism through which they are portrayed is a major strength of the plotline since the viewer is able to relate to the characters through a tender heart and sentimental perspective. The viewer is also delightfully reacquainted with the characters from the original series, such as Renji, Chihiro and Kei, which expands the range of the series. Ultimately, both arcs coalesce at as Yuu confronts Shuuchi which engenders a flawlessly weaved narrative that will be cemented in the viewer’s memories.  “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is a technical and artistic masterpiece as every scene is meticulously and elegantly crafted- the artwork is singularly detailed and among the finest one will see. So many visual techniques, such as silhouettes and colour contrasts, are utilised to give rise to a series with unrivalled presentation that can be described as a chef-d'oeuvre. The soundtrack, including the themes and opening, is impressive in that it immaculately accompanies the most portentous and emotionally riveting scenes of the series to ascertain that they firmly resonate with the viewer.  Through assiduously presented features, a narrative that captures every possible human emotion and a cast of thoroughly relatable characters, “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” establishes itself as a series with few equals. Whilst the series has some flaws, its accurate depiction of the strengths and flaws of human nature is remarkable and gives rise to an idiosyncratic series that will capture the hearts and imagination of any viewer. Watching “Ef: A Tale of Melodies” is like witnessing an artist who is painting the successor to his greatest work; his skills have been refined, his technique has matured and his mind is more focused. The series is an artistic stroke of genius that transcends convention through its idiosyncrasies and poignantly elicits emotion in the most effective of manners.";Recommended

It tell us about how Yuuko Amamiya meet up with Yuu Himura and how Mizuki Hayama knows Yuuko Amamiya . I'll be honest that Melodies made me cry a bit more than Memories . Won't say much because i'm just gonna spoil it for you  Art:9 The arts and animation is improved a bit on this one . More 3D animations and it does have some beautiful arts that capture my interest .  Sound:8 Same voice characters from Memories . Love Chihiro voice actress by the way . The OP and ED is good . Not enough to made me listen many many times but it's okay i guess . I just love the violin part . It's was relaxing and yet a bit sad .  Character:9 The same characters from Memories . Now , they focus on Yuuko Amamiya , Mizuki Hayama , Yuu Himura , Kuze Shuichi and Nagi Hirono . I just can't accept how Yuuko's life was that sad . It literally made me sympathize her . While Kuze Shuichi with his sickness . All i can say is that Melodies did a good job on the character plots .  Enjoyment:9 More drama , less comedy , perfect for those who in need of crying . Does have some weird moments like Yuuko rapping (refer to episode 6 if i'm not mistaken) and Kuze rapping (forgot which episode was on) . Literally , it was a bit of weird because how fast they can pronounce each words correctly . Japan got talent for rapping i guess .  Overall:9 I will say that Melodies did make me watch with one go . It was a good anime that focus on drama . If you want to have some crying moments , this is for you . But , do mind to watch the Memories first because if you watch this one first , It might just spoil everything and ruined it .;Recommended
17;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;earthshine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/earthshine;9;"Story: The story in &quot;melodies&quot; is definitely better than in &quot;memories&quot;. Once again, we have two storylines- One focusing on the past of Himura (the guy with white hair), and the the other on Mizuki (Kei's blonde friend). After watching &quot;melodies&quot;, i realised that issues of characters from season one were rather... Shallow. For example, the whole problem of &quot;love triangle&quot; in &quot;memories&quot; is really weak in comparision with Yuuko and Himura relationship. The ending was much more convincing as well. If it is about the second story, it's very similar to Chichiro's issue from season one. The main difference lies in intensity of the story, though i can't write anything more, because it might spoil the fun.  Art: It was really solid. Character design haven't changed, but the animation got better, and much more artistic eksperiments were used. There are some memorable scenes, but no suprises- you are probably used to the unusual directing if you watched &quot;memories&quot;  Sound: Nice, but nothing out of ordinary. There are no tracks that you would remember after finishing whole series, but they match the scenes, and are quite enjoyable. The opening is very similar to the opening from the first season, but it has a nice feeling to it.  Character: The main characters in &quot;melodies&quot; are very well made, and i liked them much more than main characters in &quot;memories&quot;. I felt that they are more mature and convincing, but their development was rather predictable. Still- better than in first season.  Enjoyment: I believe everybody will find something they will like in &quot;ef - a tale of melodies&quot;. The story is quite intense (for a drama series), but short (12 episodes). Personally, i finished it in two days, so i didin't get too attached to the whole series, but i still find it very amusing, and i don't regret one minute spent in front of the screen.  Overall: Great piece of work. Everything is solid and well-made, so i gave the series 9. If you didin't liked the first season, i don't think you will like the second, because it basicly extends the ideas from the first one. However, it's worth a try, since it's a a little bit better.";Recommended

0;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;Wilio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wilio;6;Ef- a Tale of Melodies is somehow an unnecessary sequel. Unnecessary in a way the first season didn't let any hole for a new season, as I felt it was complete and didn't need to go on. Even tough, I was still thrilled to watch A Tale of Melodies since its predecessor was absolutely beautiful. Perhaps, it would be as beautiful or as interesting.   Sadly, I could only dream about it.   The story is presented in the same pattern as Memories, at this point the viewer shouldn't be confused in the way it's made. While most of the cast are back, they actually switch roll in a sense that the main characters of the first season would become the support cast and vice versa. The most drastic change some can feel while watching Melodies is that is darker than the first season and perhaps darker than someone would Imagine. And here's the problem, both of the story arcs were dark and yet they both failed to have a sense of suspense. SHAFT was successful in creating a blend of suspense and romance in the first season(Notably the ending of the Hiro-Miyako) and thus the reason why A Tale of Memories was very good. One could think that A Tale of Melodies would be a parallel. Well, Shaft didn't succeed this time.While the stories had a premise start, As darker these story arcs were, they also felt more cliché, more unbelievable and sadly more boring as it was getting to its end.  I also have to point that ending didn't have the same expectation as the first season. While A Tale of Memories felt completed, the ending of a Tale of Melodies is left with the feeling that there's still something more to tell which can leave an unsatisfying feeling for the viewers.  Nothing can't really be said against the art except for some of the characters design that really felt bland or been done before. Truly amazing backgrounds and sunset. The SHAFT art, which consist of high contrast, simple colours, black and white and so on is also magnificent as it played a key role in the most important scenes.  A Tale of melodies did deliver a great cast, no doubt about that. Yet, the series still suffered from few characters who weren't developed enough and made them quite uninteresting(Notably Nagi, who even though she's a supporting character, still had an important role). Another problem that can be regarded is the quality of the dialogues. The series did have some good dialogues, yet a lot of them were predictable, silly and also cliché.  I have to admit, enjoying the series was quite hard. While I admit Melodies had beautiful moment and memorable SHAFT scenes, it still suffered from long scenes where all it did was turning around the block(Not getting to the point).  In overall, A Tale of Melodies could have been a great sequel there's no doubt about that. We hoped for something as good or better, but it isn't the case. Like I said, it had a premised start and the only element needed was a good execution. This element was never included.  Beside, most of the fans of first did like this one. I guess I wasn't in the majority. So go on, flame me.;Mixed Feelings
1;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;zelda-knight;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zelda-knight;6;"Ef- A tale of melodies -first impression- 6/10 It's a sequel to Memories, or a prequel, depending.  Story- Half of this story takes place in the past, which helps explain things from the first season that made everyone say ""Wait, what was that?!"". You see a semi-new story, well a side story really, but it's still nice.  Art- Carries the same style from the first season. It's still nice.  Sound- Where this anime really shines. The OP and ED are just awesome. In show music is very mood-setting. It's both relevant and well-done.  Character- He's an ass! (You know who) Aside from that, most of the other 3 characters are likeable, although Mizuki is super-needy, it fits her char. well.  Enjoyment- You may or may not enjoy this as much as the first season. It's iffy. I really only watched it because of the first season, and it didn't add too much. It's also a breeding ground for melodrama.  Overall- If you liked Memories, watch melodies.";Mixed Feelings
2;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;RyanSpring;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RyanSpring;6;"You shouldn't be watching this unless you've completed season 1 or a lot of things simply will not make sense and I can say very safely, since by and large the shows are very similar, if you enjoyed season 1 you'll enjoy season 2 and if you didn't you won't. I didn't particularly care for season 1 and as such, while this show isn't horrible and I liked it slightly better than its predecessor, I didn't particularly care for this either.  Most of the praises and complaints from my season 1 review are still applicable here. Like the previous season, you could easily skip the first four or five episodes here and miss little to nothing- it's a very slow, boring start. The visual presentation scores high marks for originality and artistic beauty and it's even better this time around. The story, as a whole, is lacking. There just isn't a lot of meat on the bone. At the end of it all, while very pretty, you're more or less viewing a bare bones story presented in the most artistic way possible.  If you're someone who enjoys abstract art I don't see how you'd not love this, as this show goes deep into that territory. I'm not one of those people, so I found many of those scenes simply weird as opposed to deep and compelling.  The plot also has some serious problems and conveniences. Did you know dropping a lit cigarette can set an entire mansion ablaze? I didn't either, but it happens in this show. Did you also know that a person can hit another person with a car on a busy street with zero witnesses, no inclination to get out and help or call an ambulance and no one will pass by or notice the victim bleeding out until the main character does? Did you also know that two people can have a deeply close, father/daughter type relationship for a decade but the entire time the father has no clue what the daughter's last name is? Dumb things like that made it hard for me to take the show seriously and absolutely detracted from my overall enjoyment.  The music was passable but forgettable and the opening theme in particular felt lazy as it was more or less the same song from the first time around- same beat and all- but with different lyrics. Also, one of the characters is a ""world renowned violinist"" but until the second to last episode of the show he seems to know one, and only one, violin song.  All in all this might be a good watch for abstract art lovers or those who are easily touched by anything remotely in the realm of emotional but for me this was largely slow and boring and there just wasn't a whole heck of a lot of depth. Couple that with some plot problems and forced down your throat ""moral of the story"" moments and you're left with something mediocre that I'd not be interested in ever watching again.

0;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;rogue1982;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rogue1982;5;I actually made my account on myanimelist because of this anime. I wanted to share my views after seeing it all.  Having watched Tale of Memories, I went into this one with high expectations. And, unfortunately, was let down.  'Tale of Memories' was the first anime after 'Clannad' to actually move me, both 'Air' and 'Kannon' failing in that department (I only saw the latter two after Clannad, and they felt pale in comparison). However, 'Tale of Melodies', in my opinion, went the wrong way. It OVERLOADS you with stylistyc art and does not deliver on the story.  If you split it into two stories, neither brings any joy from watching.  The back story is borderline awful, dark and twisted. One of the characters is so despicable and horrid that you wish only the worst kind of death for him. His resolution felt extremely out of place. The drama in the story was also very much forced and out of the blue.  The 'contemporary' story is not any better. Actually, what story? Looking back, there hardly is a story to begin with. 95% of it is just fancy art stylings.  Possibly the worst thing about this anime is that it almost ruined some of the characters from 'Memories' for me. Luckly, in the end, they were 'spared'.   Bottom line is: If you only liked 'Tale of Memories' for its art only, go ahead and watch 'Melodies'. There is plenty more of it in the sequel (almost to the point of annoyence). If you liked 'Memories' for the story, the characters and the feelings, 'Melodies' will disappoint you. Don't expect anything remotely close to the touching story of Renji and Chihiro in this one.;Not Recommended
1;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;PreFuturism-0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PreFuturism-0;3;"In comparison to its prequel, which I gave a score of 5, this series is stale and basically inferior in all aspects.  Another two love stories featuring characters struggling with undeserved burdens are presented in parallel in the same minimalistic surrealism-tending way, but keeping to the format is forced and botched: it appears disjointed and will bewilder some people given how loosely connected the stories are and that one of them largely occurs chronologically earlier. The themes of the stories are heavier—both deal with mortality with one extending to spirituality—but because the standard of writing is still slackly simplistic their deliveries are farcical: one quickly becomes grossly predictable and concludes preposterously with what the male protagonist achieves while the other abruptly backs down from its tension building when the main character for that makes a belated reveal. It’s all elementary and the frequent internal conflicts and monologuing in the plot becomes pretentious and tiresome; this show actually has little entertainment or practical value.";Not Recommended

But I have never wanted to rid of a character's existence before, not even in School Days, until now.  Okay, so this is a sequel to Ef: a tale of memories. Which I found pleasant; sure it was a bit forceful with the emotions at times, but all in all at the end of the emotional roller coaster I felt satisfied. But Ef: a tale of melodies was way too pushy and on top of that had one character in particular who wouldn't just shut his mouth. It's like they want me to feel bad for some arrogant, deprived, indecisive, (I can't think of another word) ass-HOLE. He's constantly whining and talking about how ""everyone is wearing a mask"". Good grief, it's like he's an over dramatic 15 year old girl. Oh wait, he's in his twenties....And because of him being so unfortunate he disregards everyone who cares for him and out of his self loathing somehow manages to steal a poor high school girl's heart. It made me sick. I wished for his death so many times while watching this anime.  Other than that douche and his disgusting tale of ""I want to die, no wait I want to live, please pay attention to me."" There was another tale in the series that did touch my heart like its prequel. I'm glad I got to witness that story even if it did leave me a tad unfulfilled. However that ignoramus really ruined the entire experience for me. There, hate review done.";Not Recommended
3;ef: A Tale of Melodies.;yoloswagger95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yoloswagger95;2;In ef - a tale of melodies trauma and abuse are thrown around to spice up the drama element in a really distasteful way. It would probably work if it wasn't for the shallow and forgettable characters you can't empathize with. Why do so many people 1) like this series 2) are somehow able to engage in those delusional scenarios. The Yuuko arc somehow panders to a pathological savior complex and is (even if there is little to no effort to make her a multifaceted and interesting character) insulting to her.  The only reason I don't give a 1/10 is because artwork and sound are way too good to be wasted on this plot.  Love yourself, don't watch this;Not Recommended

It might be from the movie or the Ova but not this.  Story -How often do you find yourself cursing out? How often do you blare that horn? No longer will you worry about such matters at least not as much. Thanks to some improvements (which we are starting to see now a days in real life) we have self driving vehicles or a.i.'s. Although, even with this kind of luxury doesn't prevent certain issues from happening. For there is really no stopping improvements no matter how efficient the current ones are. Perhaps, that is due to the American way on how bigger is better. -Intro is classy and somehow as a somewhat familiar intro song, can't seem to place it. Perhaps one you viewers will tell me why the start of the song sounds so familiar to me. -Conclusion was okay but the art was clever.  Art -no complaints -In terms of how the conclusion are was clever the artists took what we see for almost everyday and tweaked it to suit their needs. A real clear approach. An example of this kind of approach would be a dead end sign only to have the car drive off thus ending the film. Not a very good depiction but understandable when you see the actual film.  Character Each main character has what the other lacks. A good common match up. A good ideal scenario when one is depicting a partner scenario.  Enjoyment While others may write this off as any ordinary action comedy show i beg to differ. Perhaps it was just this show but the writer and the director seemed to agree to save the audience the frustration. The frustration i am referring to is the headache caused by too much tension. We get the idea we behind it. On how it is good marketing and allows for character connection but in truth sucks. For what is stopping me from walking away from the annoyance. Here this animation is very straightforward. An understandable wait period from one point of the movie to the next.;Recommended
0;eX-Driver: Nina & Rei Danger Zone;Prawin_28;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prawin_28;6;-NO SPOILER-  I watched this before the original series as this is the prequel. This one-shot is based on the minor characters from the series named Nina and Rei. This was an 'OK' for me.  This feels like a buddy cop movie, we have 2 good looking girls driving in a tricked out Mazda Miata and an angry police chief. Personally I would've loved to seen Rei being a badass on her Ducati like her appearance in the main series but, they had her riding shotgun for Nina and being a techy (I love Miatas but, I'm a biker and love Ducatis more).  -MILD SPOILER-  The story and the villain are what didn't do it for me. I was hoping to see the villain from the last 3 episodes of the main series who was a former eX-Driver. I wanted to see his work as an eX-Driver and his relationship with the chief, Nina and Rei but, instead got a Nina fanboy.  I would recommend this if you have some time to kill and if you have already watched the main series and are curious to watch something else than rewatching the main series again, otherwise you're better off watching a new anime and exploring something else altogether.;Mixed Feelings
1;eX-Driver: Nina & Rei Danger Zone;stmwg01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stmwg01;5;Quick take: If you liked the series and the movie, skip this as you'll be disappointed. It's a waste of time and the only thing that saves it is good art and sound.  I could break this up and talk about each individual aspect, but I honestly didn't like this OVA enough to care. The only thing that saves this score is the sound. Acting is very good (English dub) and even better than many, car sounds are good and well done. The acting only suffers sue to the poor scrip writing and change of the two main characters when compared to the original series.  The story is bland and that's because it dumped the charm of the original series and movies by changing the main characters to Nina and Rei. Quite honestly, this would have served as a filler in a full fledged show and not even a good one at that.  I know both Nina and Rei are supposed to be quite a bit younger than they are in the series, but neither acts like was previously established or in any way consistent with how they would become.  I actually wished that this show would end at one point. Looking back, had you replaced Nina and Rei with the original crew, it might have been quite salvageable. Had you given me a reason to care about Nina or Rei, maybe I could feel different about the story. However since none of that ever was achieved, we're left with a stand alone OVA that had no bearing on the original series and is better off skipped.;Mixed Feelings
0;eX-Driver the Movie;stmwg01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stmwg01;9;Quick Take: Storyline to the movie is actually much more enjoyable compared to the series it is based off of. If you like cars, you'll get enjoyment out of this series and movie, possibly even if you don't. While the series suffers from it's six episode short run, the movie faired much better in almost every aspect. Character development is still a bit short, but with the team now a known quantity, it is a bit easier to overlook.  I found the art style a bit lackluster and a little outdated i n the series, but the movie seems to be a bit more on par for the era in which it was released. The inconsistencies in the series' art is largely gone and the movie is much cleaner in both action and non-action scenes.  The sound remains truly stellar. The cars sound proper, that is to say a Europa sounds like a Europa and different from the Stratos. When the car shifts, the sounds changes properly and the voice acting (English dub) is better than many, even it's predecessor.  While there wasn't enough time to fully develop the story line and characters out in the series, the movie shows us what a longer show might have treated us to. The story line is not stellar by any means, but it was quite enjoyable. Whereas the original series felt like the action got old quick, the movie presented new challenges and situation. The plot was also decent and felt a bit more cohesive.  The same thing happens with the characters. With Lorna, Lisa and Sōichi now a known quantity, the movie shines a bit more in displaying their relationship as a team. It is now fully clear that Sōichi and Lisa are attracted to each other and as I suggested in my review of the series, they are able to use that budding love interest to lead to some fun interactions between them and other characters. It made for a much more enjoyable character set.  Even the characters outside the main three are better thought out and developed in the movie, which overall raises the score.  The most frustrating part of this series is its premature end. Worth a watch, especially if you like cars. If you were disappointed by potential in the series that was not fully realized, it is all a little bit more polished in the movie. It makes me little bit sad that there never got to be a longer run of this concept.;Recommended
0;eX-Driver the Movie;megafat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megafat;4;"Surprisingly, eX-Driver managed to get a movie, with the uncreatively titled “eX-Driver: The Movie”. And it's using the word 'movie' in it's title in the loosest sense popssible, since it's closer to an hour long direct-to-DVD special that managed to get a bump in animation quality.  The movie follows the three leads from the series as they enter and win a domestic preliminary round and advance to the eX-Driver world race competition held in Los Angeles as a representative team from Japan. Not long after arriving in LA, an AI car goes haywire, setting off a chain of events that leads out main trio into a conspiracy involving the race competition and some of the people involved with it.  If my reaction to the series was lukewarm at best, the movie doesn’t do much to change that. We don’t even get to see that many differences between how Japan and America deal with how they handle their AI cars, which would have made for some good world building and could have been a neat culture shock for the three main characters, and would have made the movie stand out more by giving it some personality.  Like I mentioned earlier, the animation is a step up from the series since the team behind it probably either had a bigger budget or had less to work on so what they ended up making ended up looking better, but unfortunately, much like the series was stuck with early digital animation, the movie is stuck with the early 2000s CGI used for it's cars. To be fair, it’s not the worst CGI that I’ve seen from the era, but that's such a backhanded compliment that there was no point in even bring it up.  But that’s not all, because on the same day that the movie was released, a short called “eX-Driver: Nina & Rei - Danger Zone”, which was featured as a bonus on the same DVD as the movie, and is a prequel to the series featuring two minor characters, who are the top eX-Driver team.  I’m going to include this as part of my review for the movie because I still want to talk about it, but I don’t think I can justify a whole review for it, especially since it’s only 24 minutes long, and doing a stand alone review with a minimum character/word limit would be stretching it out to it's breaking point.  The plot of ""Nina & Rei - Danger Zone"" focuses on a mysterious mini-AI car that terrorizes the city, and it’s up to Nina and Rei to stop it, all while having to deal with something or someone from the eX-Driver's past.  Out of the entire series, this is the most entertaining entry purely because it has no filler. Instead of 6 drawn out episodes or an hour long movie, this special gets straight to the point. The whole thing felt like an homage to an 80s or 90s buddy cop action movie, with the angry police chief cliche and everything. The villain for this special was also pretty fun, and I’m not going to spoil it.  While the OVA wasn't anything special, compared to the rest of the series it feels like a breath of fresh air, where something fun is happening instead of having to watch three under developed characters repeat the same thing over and over again. If anything, it feels like an episode of ""You're Under Arrest!"", which just makes me want to go watch that series again.  If anything, you could probably watch this without knowing anything about the rest of the series, even if you know nothing about the characters, and you would have to only spend 24 minutes at most to watch it, no more than a lunch break.";Mixed Feelings

1;eX-Driver;SodaDerp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SodaDerp;7;When I first heard about this anime I thought It was going to be similar to Wangan Midnight, with street racing and tons of cars. I was wrong.  Story: A future where cars are controlled by computers, and a team of gasoline powered classic car drivers chase them down when they go haywire, sounds like a very repetitive plot. But it turn out it's not, I wont ruin the plot, so ill just say there's events that keep the plot going.  Art: The animation has a very 'mid-90s' feel to it, which isn't a bad thing. The thing I like most is the cars. The animators did very well making the vehicals realistic.  Sound: Now, I don't know if it was the copy I had or the series itself, but the quality at times was, not the best out there. To me it sounded fuzzy and almost like the voice actors where talking through a thick foam pad. But like I said I don't know if it was my copy or not so don't take the sound to seriously.  Characters: Each character has there own defined personality and unique style to how they get the mission done. (Not much to say on that one)  Enjoyment: For a six episode series (plus a movie) it's not a bad watch in your down time between other anime.;Recommended
2;eX-Driver;neuralww;https://myanimelist.net/profile/neuralww;8;eX-driver doesn't have the best storyline or the best character development you'd expect in modern animes. Most people can say it's just another car anime from the 90s like Initial D, but is it really? No. When you first watch it, you get the impression that it's a rather odd anime, because it is, and this sensation latches on you as you watch more and more and it's hard to say why without spoiling anything. Not that the story is godly, but because it's just something you have to watch 3 episodes and get used to.  It's not like the other car animes out there like Shaokotan Boogie or Wangan Midnight that are mainly about cars and racing. eX-driver has a completely different approach on cars, and what they do and why. Yet it shares resemblance to those animes which sort of explains why it doesn't feel like a complete product, especially in the end.;Recommended

In other words this not a substitute for NASCAR racing. This show is more adaption with technology on cars and making sure everything 'runs' smoothly. Introduction was okay. Not quite a good transition from the prequel but upon watching the show you get the 'idea', which i took at as a time lapse. As for the conclusion beautiful. Not only does it go along with the purpose of the company in the show but the win wasn't settled in a common gloves off fashion. Confused by symbolism think of dukes that should help.  Art -beautifully done. -with the vehicles being the highlight of the show they did a good job with detail. -One of the drawing features they did that i enjoyed that was comical was the pin points eyes from time to time character Endou, Lorna had.  Sound- nothing worth noting  Character -while the characters are indeed different from the original show the shame attributes are there. Lorna, is kind and smart. While her partner Lisa is reckless and rough. - If you came for comedy i suggest keeping tabs on lisa. While other characters are comical in their own fashion i feel most jokes involved lisa.  Enjoyment:Why should i watch this show? I could say because i am telling you to. Not because i am being paid (*sigh, i am not). You should watch this for the powerful message behind it. I wont be very direct nor will i be distant with my explanation. The message is similar to how modern life reacts towards animals and babies but in terms of cars instead. Both are valuable and should be treated with careful consideration. Sure, one could 'drive' one of them to a higher level but because they can't see the proper emotions they have they would be doing more harm then good.;Recommended
4;eX-Driver;manasteel88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/manasteel88;7;eX- Driver is not a great series. The characters aren't well crafted or deep. The story is grounded in an interesting concept, but ultimately winds up shallow and derivative. If you are looking for an anime you will bill as a must see, go try and find something else. What eX-Driver is, is popcorn fun and that's okay.  The highlight of this series is the animation, setting, and action. As a glance into our possible future, the world is filled with automated vehicles. Very few people actually know how to drive a car so every vehicle is equipped with an AI that gets them to their destinations. It's when the AI shorts out that the vehicles become a danger to the society around it. That is where the organized team of youths driving petrol powered cars show up to disable the vehicles that have gone out of control by knocking out the sensors on the vehicle run amok.  Sure this is a bit out there, but there is a crazy amount of detail that was put forth by the team to make this work. Here's an example for you. The team consists of 3 people driving a left hand drive Lancia, a right hand drive Lotus, and a single seater Caterham 7 so that they can basically flank all sides of the car they are approaching. Little details that nobody really should pick up on, but are sprinkled in there to make the system work. Which it does. The logic is all there as to how this society functions around these cars as vehicles move out of the way in emergencies and lock up to let the ambulances or eX-Drivers get through to help the people in need.  Its that the story just winds up falling in to tropes that were a bit stale even when this was produced. Instead of information on why car AIs seem to go out of control on a weekly basis or why children are chosen to hot rod about in high speed chases we get sexy motorcycle ladies, bickering between the crew, and jealousy over who gets to be in a TV show.  eX-Driver has a shocking amount of attention paid to it, but not a lot of depth applied. Which is why you should be grabbing that popcorn and sitting down to watch a fun sci-fi action car chase movie because what works here really does work well. I could easily detract points from this series because of what it should be. However, what it is really is a fun little show with cool looking cars skidding about.;Recommended
5;eX-Driver;TheCompletionist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheCompletionist;8;eX-Driver is a futuristic anime that focuses on a team of three teenagers (Lisa, Lorna, and Souichi) under the supervision of Kei Munatata that are tasked with protecting the city from vehicles that have artificial intelligence computer systems that have broke down and gone rogue therefore being a danger to the people that are inside these vehicles as well as the residents of the city itself. This team resolves the danger by using their own gas powered vehicles and their sharpshooting skills in order to stop these rogue vehicles. Each of the three main characters of this anime has their own individual vehicle that they use in order to resolve the conflicts that they are often put in and each of the vehicles are different enough and really cater to the each of the characters personality. You have Lisa who is brash, stubborn and hard headed, Lorna who is soft spoken, shy and reasonable, and Souichi who is selfish, idealistic, and goal-oriented. Despite the fact that the main characters are all different, and their personalities often conflict with each other it leads to a believable and heartfelt bond that all the characters have with each other. Lorna often has to be the mediator because Souichi and Lisa are often at each other's throats on who is the better driver.  This anime has a very short length with only 6 episodes but if you ask me I think it's the perfect length when dealing with such an obscure subject matter. The setting in the anime takes place in a futuristic society where people don't personally drive anymore - every vehicle in the city is controlled with artificial intelligence but building a society where all transportation is controlled by computers is literally a recipe for disaster because eventually technology will break down and not work anymore so there needs to be protocols put in place in order to protect the people inside these vehicles in case the artificial intelligence system fails. The majority of the episodes focus on some kind of rescue and after awhile the rescues literally feel all the same in every episode until some proper enemies/antagonists are established but it doesn't happen until episode 5 and 6. It's okay to recycle the same type of final conflict for a few episodes but it can often be aggravating if you feel like your watching the same resolution in each and every episode especially if the anime lasts as long as 12 or 24 episodes but with 6 episodes it never reaches that point where it does feel aggravating. However, the way that the eX-Driver team stop the rogue vehicles is pretty much the same for the most part. They freeze passenger compartment of the vehicle while either smashing or blocking the two sensors in the back of the vehicle and the two sensors in the front of the vehicle minus the odd exception in order to stop it while the rogue vehicle tries to do everything in its power to stop the eX-drivers and their cars from stopping their chaotic nonsense.  For an early 2000's anime the animation is incredibly beautiful, every car is animated beautifully and some of the chase scenes are really enthralling to watch. The opening and ending themes are relatively solid, but the strongest musical aspect of this anime is definitely a lot of the background music. There are beautiful ambient tracks throughout a lot of the cityscape scenes especially in a lot of the background scenes that involve water but when the driving happens the music gets really intense and wild especially when the action scenes start to take over.  I really have to give a lot of respect to the english dub for this anime because there is a lot of great anime voice talent in this obscure anime such as staples of the 90's anime scene such as Lia Sargent, Richard Epcar, and Steve Blum while mixing in some voice talent from Digimon. To be honest all the voices really suit all of the characters in this anime regardless if it's a main character or a side character.  I think deep down this anime knows exactly what it wants to be. It never feels heavy handed and every episode finds a way to be enjoyable. When villains are finally established in this anime, it adds a little extra depth to this anime beyond the standard rescue mission even though the motivations of the villains aren't up to the level of supervillain standards but that is a-ok in my eyes because for the most part it's a simple anime with a simple premise and knows exactly what it needs to be do to be enjoyable. Each of the heroes cars suffer damage in many of the rescue missions and conflicts and nobody ever feels truly invincible in this anime but it lends to the strength of keeping the characters and the vehicles they drive in grounded despite being set in a futuristic setting.  Even though the anime caters to some of the typical anime tropes (the female characters being sexualized), the tropes are so minor it actually doesn't detract you from enjoying the anime from what it really is. The anime in itself doesn't really have a lot of humour per se but it's worth watching for the race scenes and the character development between the main characters. The anime is not violent, raunchy, or bloody but it doesn't need to be because it's focused on being entertaining and as far as I'm concerned it certainly succeeds in that.  I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed it and in my eyes it's a very fun and easy watch. If you like your cars fast with some really beautiful animation I highly recommend giving it a try.;Recommended
6;eX-Driver;stmwg01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stmwg01;7;Quick Take: Good but dry storyline, good characters and dated artwork. If you like cars, you'll get enjoyment out of this series, possibly even if you don't. This series suffers from it's six episode short run that doesn't allow story arcs to be fully completed.  As I complete this easy to watch anime, a few things stick with me. I found the art style a bit lackluster and a little outdated. For an early 2000's anime, it seemed okay but was also rather inconsistent. In the scenes with less movement, the art was great but once there was action, the art seemed to suffer a bit.  The sound is truly stellar. The cars sound proper, that is to say a Europa sounds like a Europa and different from the Stratos. When the car shifts, the sounds changes properly and the voice acting (English dub) is better than many, only missing the mark once or twice.  Aside from the art, I think the characters and the storyline are what suffers most. Ironically, it's not because the concept or characters are bad, but because there wasn't enough time to fully develop them out. In regards to the story, each run away car is similar and although the exact details in how they are stopped are different, the main concept doesn't change and becomes old by the third time around. When the story does start to pick up and you think there might be some good plot lines or twists coming, we're treated to a premature end.  The same thing happens with the characters. I could see that the relationship between Lorna, Lisa and Sōichi was supposed to be the main focus, but unfortunately, just as the characters were getting warmed up to each other, the series ends. It is especially frustrating as it's clear Sōichi and Lisa are attracted to each other, so I know there could have been plenty of jokes between the two had the series continued.  The most frustrating part of this series is its premature end. Just as the plot and characters were starting to shape up into something, you're on episode six. Worth a watch, especially if you like cars, but if you're like me and become a bit frustrated at potential that is not fully realized, you'll find it here.;Recommended
0;eX-Driver;megafat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megafat;4;"When I saw that this series was written by Kosuke Fujishima, creator of the ""Oh My Goddess!"" and ""You're Under Arrest"" anime series, and with me being a fan of ""You're Under Arrest"" and hearing good things about ""Oh My Goddess!"" before I watched series, I became interested in checking it out. After seeing that it wasn't as popular as his other works and getting some less than good, I went into eX-Driver with moderately set expectations that I would get at least some entertainment out of the six episodes knowing what the creator was capable of. And after watching it, I can easily see why this wasn't as well remembered or well reviewed as his other works.  Set at some point in the 22nd century, people no longer drive cars themselves, instead relying on cars with an artificial intelligence to drive for them. But when the AI systems in these cars started malfunctioning, causing the cars to lose control, a team called eX-Drivers (or eX-D for short) were formed, driven by actual drivers, to chase down the cars that have gone crazy. I don't know why the group of people who actually drive cars are the ones called eX-Drivers, but whatever.  The series follows three such eX-Drivers, Lorna, Lisa, and new addition to the group, Soichi. Soichi is the youngest of the group at 12 years old, and the other two are in their teens. I imagine that making them younger was to appeal to a younger audience, and I don't really mind having three kids as the main characters since this is more geared to a younger audience, but it just raises questions to me, like how does a 12 year get a license, especially for such a dangerous job. But I'm guessing this is going off of Pokemon rules, with how children are often put into dangerous situations but somehow never get hurt, with this series relying on the same set of convenient rules.  eX-Driver does bring up some neat concepts to explore, such as an underground community of drivers mentioned in the first episode where characters have a boost button in their car and have modified the cars programming, and later in the series, there are characters with gasoline cars that can't be tracked by the same system as the AI cars and are off the grid. It would have been neat if the series explored this stuff, but unfortunately due to it being only 6 episodes, it never really gets to do that.  And that's not taking into account other stuff that it could have brought up. Is there no one would doesn't trust the automated systems of the cars, and even cites statistics of AI failures, or at least talks about all of the news stories of failing AI as a reason to not have an AI car? Or even just dislikes the idea in general, based purely on personal preference. What about people who simply can't afford the AI cars, or simply don't care about what car they drive, and just want a way of getting to where they're going? And I'm pretty sure there are car enthusiasts out there who would want to drive, tune, and build their own cars, or just want to buy and deal with classic cars. You could have even had an episode where a mentor once shows his skills of to the kids, who hope to be as good of a driver as him one day.  There could have even been an episode where the characters didn't have access to cars, like being stranded somewhere where they didn't have access to the system, or being forced to take a break since the job is clearly stressing them out, and it ends up being a bonding experience. There was enough here for it to expand out to a 12-episode series at least, but unfortunately we got stuck with what we have.  All of these could have been good ideas for episodes, and could have easily broken up the repetitive monotony of the series and at least taken the series from a completely forgotten for good reason series to a beloved cult classic with a few neat ideas.  The series also came out at that time when anime was transitioning from traditionally done animation cels to digital animation, and it obviously shows. Characters look flat and overly bright at times and the whole thing just looks mediocre at the best of times.  Which is unfortunate, because the series clearly shows off Kosuke Fujishima's love of cars, and by extension, motorcycles, and seeing it either be done a few years earlier with cel animation or a few years later when studios were more experienced with digital animation and the detail of the cars would have really popped out more, it would have at least made it worth watching for the eye candy.  And it seems like such a waste to not let Kosuke to show off his love of said vehicles and let him stretch his creativity a bit for a sci-fi series with cars we haven't seen before. If this couldn't have been continued as an anime, it would have been nice to see Kosuke continue it as a manga at least.  The only interesting thing about this series is just how predictive of self-driving cars it was. But since it never goes that in-depth with the concept either, so there's no real reason to watch the series based on that alone.  While eX-Driver is nowhere near the worst thing that I've watched, I doubt that anyone is clamoring for a re-release. But considering some of the stuff that Discotek have picked up, I wonder how long it would be before they get their hands on a release for this. Unless this get some sort of new series that actually expands on the concepts of the series, I can't really recommend it.";Mixed Feelings
1;eX-Driver;Prawin_28;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prawin_28;6;"I was scrolling down the ""Cars"" genre on MAL and came across eX-Driver and felt this sudden hit of nostalgia. I remembered watching an anime with a yellow Caterham as the hero car when I was a kid. I immediately clicked on it and was able to recognize all 3 main characters Soichi, Lisa and Sorna.  You know that feeling of nostalgia you get when you watch an anime from the past that you still remember, for me that would be ""Dragon Ball"" ""Naruto"" ""Inuyasha"", I didn't get that feeling because I recognized the characters and the Super Seven but didn't remember anything about the story. I didn't even know that this was such a small series. I decided to binge all 6 episodes and started watching. Soichi and Lorna are likable, Lisa is a bit annoying but, she grows on you. The chief is always angry like in buddy cop movies. Everyone has a flat character arc and no development or rather a development in character isn't necessary as the series itself is so small and needs to concentrate on world-building rather than giving the characters something that they have to get over and cannot justify their change in such a short time, as that would lack connection with the audience.  I appreciate that part but, after a couple of episodes it starts feeling repetitive, that's bad especially when it's a short series and you think it would be fresh till the end. I rather enjoyed the last 3 episodes more than anything as we are introduced to Joe Todo and would've liked to see more of him in more episodes or rather have him introduced earlier in the series. His backstory was decent but was made worse as it wasn't shown but explained by the chief. I would've loved to his relationship with Rei, Nina and the chief as a former eX-Driver.  My favorite character was the car Mechanic Ogawa and would've liked to see his badass driving as something about him just screams that he is an awesome driver. I would've liked for him to be a former eX-Driver turned mechanic, who was called to assist the current eX-Drivers in facing Joe but, alas.  I've given the Story an 8 as the world of AI-driven cars for the public where no one even knows how to drive anymore but, there are some special drivers and riders who still have a license and are the ones who are called upon to stop an AI car when it goes out of control. The story has more potential.  Overall, watch the anime if you are interested to experience something different in between all the new anime you are watching, it is a short series and is watchable.";Mixed Feelings

0;_Summer;chichiriNoDa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chichiriNoDa;9;People might think it's pointless, but I love this OVA!  _Summer starts of in a perverted way! (Ridiculous). Takumi was forcibly dragged by his friend to peek at the girls while taking a bath. (They got caught of course, hahahaha)......  The cast consist of wide variety of personalities. From the main guy who is clueless and slow. The bestfriend who acts cool, who is insearch for a girlfriend. The childhood friend that cooks for him every morning that's quiet. The sister that's outgoing and cheerful. The childhood girl's bestfriend who is agreesive,bossy,loud and shows no interest on guys (tomboy-ish) but deep down ya know. The school girl idol who only talks to Takumi. Of course the most funniest of all, the weird/mysterious/robotic sounding girl, Chiwa (by the way she's my fave!). This might sound very typical but it works, great cast huh!?!  While the premise is about Takumi trying to find the girl he likes, but the show isn't about that, it's about the importance of friendship. (I think this is why people was put-off and mentioned this is stupid and pointless.)  I don't know why but I do LOVE this (for how many times now? LoL), it's very relaxing, cool, simple and great. I wish that there were more episodes but seriously I love this series!!!!! The story isn't original nor great but I love the atmosphere of it. The characters were fun especially Chiwa. It has 2 awesome episodes, even in it's shortness this anime has definitely earned a spot for my top ten list. Enjoyable episodes. Seriously I'm addicted to this! They need to do more episodes.  If your looking for a simple short series that is worth watching you'll find it in _summer. For me there is something special about this anime, that got me hooked hard into it.  I can't guarantee that everyone will like this same as me but hey give it a try.;Recommended
0;_Summer;rockintomordor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rockintomordor;5;"If you'd like to waste 60 minutes of your time, watch _summer. It's not even that it was that awful. In all honesty, there was just no point to it. The ending is just outrageously unsatisfying. They introduce you to some characters, hint at some chemistry between a few of them, then end it with a weak attempt at a moral message. After watching episode two, the first thing that came to mind was &quot;Alright, where's episode 3?&quot; It was as if they decided to simply not conclude it, for the sake of making me angry.  Aside from that, everything else was fine. Characters designs were satisfactory, albeit a little stale. Animation was a little bad for an OVA, but whatever. Music wasn't particularly remarkable but it certainly didn't detract from the experience (although I have listened to musical works with a little bit more depth).  If the story had a definite ending with a little spark of drama (to say the least), it certainly would've been an enjoyable experience. However, due its lack of a clear conclusion, I recommend watching something else.";Mixed Feelings
1;_Summer;Hr0n;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hr0n;5;"In confession - what usually catches my first glance when selecting Anime to watch is the title. and &quot;_Summer&quot; was such a unique title, I simply had to watch it - given it was only two episodes, as well. Being Swedish, at first I had some heck of a hard time understanding the alternate title &quot;Underbar Summer&quot;, with &quot;underbar&quot; meaning &quot;wonderful&quot; in my language, until my slow brain realized that it was referring to the &quot;_&quot; in front of the title. -_-; &quot;Huh, is the alternate title in German or something?&quot;   If you're into Ecchi, then it's watchable. If you're not, there's not really much else to gather from here. As others have already told, it ends too soon; it's a good setup for a harem kind of anime, and had it drawn on for some ten episodes more, I'm positive it would've gotten much more enjoyable, not to mention acquired much more recognition. But...  STORYLINE &quot;Storyline&quot;? Hahahaha. It's a setup for a storyline, and not much more. The rest is up for us to guess, I suppose.  ART No complaints here, though. Although I'm weak for these kinds of things - very few new shows have such art that I'd call &quot;horrible&quot; or even &quot;bad&quot;. The animation is as neat as expected from Anime shows.  SOUND My only quirk is with the lead blond girl sounding just a tad whiny. Otherwise, the voices are fine, the music is fine. The opening theme is pretty; the opening theme carries a lot of weight, since it's supposed to introduce the series in a fair way, and I think it did a good job.  CHARACTER You have most of the stereotypes here. Quiet, pretty girl; energetic tomboy; silent, emotionless girl; perky little sister. And of course, the annoying sidekick guy who knows twenty times more about picking up girls than the lead character, but still never gets hooked up. Ever. So hey...  ENJOYMENT There are some half-naked sceneries, including the classical &quot;outdoors bath&quot; where the guys peek at the girls and the girls throw things at the guys. There are also hints at relationships, but they are oh so subtle and never progressed in the actual show. That's the enjoyment I got from it.  OVERALL So as said...if you can't find anything else to kill time with, then by all means, I'm not one to stop you. It's only two episodes after all, and then you have another &quot;completed watching&quot; series that you can brag about. ;P Sure, I've seen better shows, but granted, I've seen worse ones as well.";Mixed Feelings
2;_Summer;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;5;There's not much to talk about this OVA, because it doesn't really explore what we were introduced to.  Well, in the synopsis it says that the protagonist starts to become aware of liking the opposite sex, but this was never mentioned in the OVA in a clear way, it was not explored. There is also kind of a romance that is left very open between the protagonist and his childhood friend, Konami. And guess what? It is not explored either. The protagonist's friend, Osamu, is always after a girlfriend, but never gets one. In the first episode it is hinted that he might have a relationship with Shino, because they are always arguing. This, too, is not worked out.  The characters themselves are not bad, but the plot does not help to have that much attachment for them. The character design is very good, it's what I praise the most in this anime. And I also love those anime designs from the 2000s.  The work ignores a lot of things, to in the end have a message of living in the now, because good memories are important. Well, that would be good if it explored the things that we were introduced to.  It's an average anime, it's okay to watch. But as a whole, it's a potential that was wasted.;Mixed Feelings
3;_Summer;Sayayurin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sayayurin;3;It's catered more to the customer base who have experienced the eroge that the anime's based on since the story took little to no time to introduce the characters or elaborate in any way further than surface level on their relationship or the attraction the girls have for the protagonist. The protagonist status of the main character is painfully obvious when every side character and harem member is calling out for his name and attention despite a strong lack of personality. Rather, he's got more flaws than merits. In comparison, his sole male friend, the comedic relief who gets beaten up most of the time during his screen time, sees things more maturely and clearly than he does yet remains all that he is, as a comedic relief. The harem members are extremely cliché with the exception of the quirky one. I get the idea of the anime aiming for a coming-of-age sentimental angle, but it fails to deliver when you cannot relate or connect to any of the characters. If it was aimed at new potential customers for the game, it still flops, because these girls have 0 personality aside from their cliché build-in trope of -deres. Animation is passable, OST is forgettable.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zutto Suki Datta;Vaponilluxeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Vaponilluxeon;1;"I never thought that the lack of synopsis for this entry in all websites would set off a series of traumatic thoughts of my hentai-watching experience. Before I continue, this review will contain the exact plot points of this show, warning you of the horrors that await. Spoilers, beware!  This anime starts with a promising premise—a girl who is madly in love with a boy for so long—hence the title ""I have love you for so long."" This is merely a generic start for many hentai—and romance—stories.  However, the title is disappointingly very misleading. It's not about the romance of the girl and the guy she likes—it's about how an ugly bastard of a teacher blackmails the girl to have sex with her. It's very frustrating! Even so, I tried ignoring it. I was still a neophyte in watching hentai and my preferences aren't yet that solid, so I gave it a chance. My expectations, unfortunately, were thoroughly broken. After two episodes of mental torture with the girl not getting on it with her loved one, it was like I finally relate to the girl—depressed and tired. But then again, someone had to make a sacrifice! I tried my best watching through the whole series. After it was done, I can't even joke about rejoicing that the hellish experience I got through is finally over. The story is so appalling that I will never forget the memory of this disgusting hentai—even if I wanted to. Is this the fate of going in to this anime blind? Yes.  When we talk about Queen Bee, I usually say that while their animation style is not that great, they have the best of sources. However, this hentai was the completely different. It's like the studio's quality got reverse specifically for this anime—their animation style for this one is actually better than most of their adaptations, but the story is one of the worst ones. A misleading title caused these chaotic thoughts and whatnot—there are no words that can fully describe my displeasure.  I can't even focus on the sound because of how garbage the characters are. I tried to cling on to hope that a good ending will happen, but no—I can't even enjoy it! I might need some sort of warning to keep me away from hentai like this. A synopsis? Please.";Not Recommended

The art is good as usual. Its presentation is neat and tidy with a lot of bright colours all around to get you in the spirit of the series which is centred around young love and the revolving storylines surrounding it. The story is fairly simple. There's the normal unoriginal Honeyworks cheesiness. If you can't stand cliches, I'm afraid that you're in the wrong place. This is what Honeyworks is known for. The music is nice since they are originally derived from a series of music videos. Characters are uninteresting as usual. Perhaps they get more interesting with the more series that you watch since there is some backstory involved sometimes, but it's nothing really extraordinary. It's mostly what you get on the surface. Some characters honestly have no personality. The characters in this film are no exception. I probably enjoyed this a little more than the average person only because I have watched most of the Honeyworks series, so this was a nice add-on.  Overall: It's not unique. If you're looking for a revolutionary series full of new things, go somewhere else. Watch the other Honeyworks-related content first.;Mixed Feelings

2;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Ectisity;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ectisity;7;Story: If you've read a lot of romance manga you probably won't consider the story as very original. The entire movie is about different characters trying to build up the courage to confess their love. However, I do not believe that there are many animated stories of this kind which makes it unique in it's own sense. Sure, it doesn't have any super original plot point or anything that makes it very unique, but the story is well executed for what it is and if you're into more pure love stories, I believe you'll like the story in this one.  Art: I rarely care about the art in anime to be honest. The art is good and of normal 2016-standard.  Sound: Some fantastic songs that set the mood very well. Really was a big part of the movie for me.  Characters: The characters themselves are nothing out of the ordinary, but what is special is the relationships between the character. Natsuki and Yuu are your typical childhood friend love cliche, Akarin and Mochizuki have never really talked with eachother properly, and Haruki and Miou are pretty much dating, but they haven't realized it yet. It was interesting to see all these different types of relationships in one movie.  Enjoyment: Through most of the movie I was screaming at the characters to just get together already, but I must say that I really found the story and characters refreshing in a time where ecchi, magical girls and tragedy rules the romance anime industry.  Overall: I feel like a lot of loose ends will meet in the sequel which will be released in december, but until then I'll give this movie an 8 overall score. It's really worthwhile if you like pure high-school romance animes, and especially if you like series like Ao Haru Ride. Don't expect someting AMAZING and I'll think you'll enjoy this movie.;Recommended

Well this anime is your typical High School Love Story. Childhood Friends and etc.  The Story is quite typical to a high school love story as mentioned above but I still gave it a 9 despite the fact that it's quite ordinary because I am into this kind of anime, so can't resist giving a 9.  As for the art & sound/BGM, it totally gets an outstanding which is 10 because the art & sound/BGM are what I can describe as ""exquisite"" and ""total masterpiece"". Just one second into the movie, I am already astonished by the art & sound/BGM that were presented to the viewers.  Actually, the thing that really made me astonished was the 5 words ""I have always liked you"". I thought I accidentally skipped to the ending but when I look at the player bar, I was relieved. Well, would have s*cked if I were to skip to the ending but I think the ending is quite predictable even without watching.  Nothing much to comment on the characters except that they are quite everyone's typical normal character that you can find in any anime that has the same genre and plots with different settings.  In Conclusion, I enjoyed this anime as mentioned, I liked this kind of anime and a 9 will totally be a satisfy mark for me to give, if not, I will not be able to forgive myself. Anyway, a good anime indeed if you prefer school love, I will totally recommend it. If one already got bored with this kind of anime, I totally advise one not to watch because it will totally bore ones' out, because since the beginning one is already not interested in it. Then, why bother watching, right? :3  Sorry, if my review is not as grand as one expect from a reviewer and sorry if any of the contents are offensive to anyone.  P.S. The ending graphic was cute.

5;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Minouette;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Minouette;7;"Story: I've noticed that a lot of the reviews have downvoted the story, but I personally didn't have any real qualms with it. It was cute; it didn't try to go too deep, but that was really to be expected from a (less than) hour movie. The story follows the love stories of three high school girls, as they try to figure out how to confront their feelings. Very shoujo. I would've preferred if the story had focused primarily on one romance, the one between Natsuki and her crush, but it was rather refreshing to see the different character interactions from characters that had appeared in Honeyworks's songs. (As a standalone, I understand why people weren't big fans of the story, but I'll elaborate upon that more later.)  Art: Personally, I really liked the art style. It's very clean, in the same style as Honeyworks' MVs, and there wasn't a depreciation (so to say) in the quality of the animation and the artwork in between scenes. I do feel that there could've been a little bit ""more"" whenever a character paused, but overall, it wasn't terribly jarring.  Sound: As a fan of Honeyworks's songs, I really enjoyed the music. The VAs did a great job at conveying the feelings of their characters, and the songs, though sometimes a bit awkwardly incorporated into the story, were solid on their own. The BGM was pleasant too.  Characters: As I said earlier, the story doesn't delve too deep, and neither did the characters. I feel that in certain respects, Honeyworks intended for this movie to be presented to a certain demographic (fans of Honeyworks's songs), and they intended for the feelings and characterizations of the characters to be revealed through the music. The characters are ""okay,"" with minor character flaws, but none of them seem to be particularly memorable, even if acquainted with Honeyworks.  Enjoyment: I enjoyed watching this. It was cute and light-hearted, a nice pick-me-up when I just felt tired. Although I can't say that it's a new favorite of mine, I can't deny that I liked it and would watch it again.  In summary: if you enjoy watching shoujo and have some spare time, give it a try--especially if you're a Honeyworks fan.";Recommended
6;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;AnihcP04;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnihcP04;8;"First off, ""Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita"" is, to anyone who doesn’t know, based off the stories and characters of a song series by a creator named HoneyWorks. So as a stand-alone movie, or to anyone who hasn't encountered HoneyWorks before, it may appear as a buttload of cheesy anime high school rom-com right off the bat. However, to someone who had HoneyWorks songs and PVs on replay before (still do on occasion), it was immensely enjoyable albeit its attempt to squish all those personalities, unrequited loves, sibling loves, and love triangles into a mere hour.  The story in which the movie revolves around is just as sweet as its song [Kokuhaku Youko Renshuu], but peppered with cliffhanger stories as much as the PVs are peppered with cameos. The movie is gorgeous HoneyWorks art, animated and voiced. While it was a treat to watch, it leaves the audience hanging and a fan yearning for more stories and songs to be featured.  All in all, ""Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita"" was a joy to see even if it was only 60 minutes long, but may be less so if the audience is not familiar with the song series it was inspired by. I highly doubt they’ll leave it as it is, so I’m certainly looking forward to more movies in the series.  *So whether you've already watched it or not, if you're interested in a rom-com song series with peppy tunes and manga style art, HoneyWorks is worth checking out! It might even clear any confusion about some characters in the movie because yeah, there were a lot of them to process in an hour, all of who deserve individual movies themselves.";Recommended
7;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Sammy_Lee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sammy_Lee;8;"I personally absolutely loved this movie. But, I believe that I have a bias. This entire movie was based off of the events that took place in the song ""Confession Rehearsal"", by HoneyWorks, which can be heard in the background of the buildup to the finale. (There were other subplots that were based off of other songs such as ""Solution to Jealousy"", ""Confession Rival Declaration"", or Inokori Sensei, all written and performed by HoneyWorks) Because I knew the plots and characters so well I think I was more blown away by the execution, which was GORGEOUS!! I know it's not a very original plot, nor characters, but I would definitely listen to the songs that I mentioned and others, HoneyWorks is an amazing group and they 100% percent deserved this lovely movie based off of their work.";Recommended

Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Cheri_Bonnefoy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cheri_Bonnefoy;10;Watching this shouldn't be about originality, it should be about whether you've enjoyed it or not. A lot of the anime are about the same but it's not like nobody doesn't enjoyed it. I may not have watched a lot of shojou movies or anime but I have a lot of shojou manga and this has by far, won my heart over.  I love the characters, I love the story, and it may not have many twists but it shows relatable characters, romances and all. It doesn't have to be fantasy, full of turns, deaths and what not to make it interesting. If you read the tag and synopsis, you know the genres, don't shit on this series when this beautiful piece of work doesn't meet YOUR EXPECTATIONS when you should have known what to expect.  Is this movie typical? Yes. Does it mean it wouldn't be or isn't enjoyable? NO. I especially love the character Koyuki, what he said was so encouraging, so heart-wrenching and the effort he puts in is so admirable! This movie shows off 3 different types of girls, it's not only about Natsuki who struggles with confession but she shows courage, Mio who know about each other's feelings but felt that that feeling will only drag Haruki down because he is going overseas and Akari who wants to know more about love.  Please watch their music videos to know more about the story!;Recommended
9;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Focuss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Focuss;8;"NO SPOILERS !  There doesn't always have to be a deep intellectual story in every single anime/movie. Sometimes it's fine to just kick back and watch anime just to smile and laugh.  Like I implied, this movie didn't have a deep story but it was fine because the other aspects of the anime made up for it. The story was pretty cliche where a girl/guy likes another girl/guy and they don't know it..you get what I mean.  Even though I had close to no love life in high school this movie made me smile because how the actions of the characters brought positive emotions in me. All the characters looked really cute and the way they acted made me wish I had taken more action in high school lol. In addition,the music in this movie was great and one of the strong points of this anime, the music fit really well with what was going on at the moment. It made me enjoy the movie a lot more and the hour went by really quickly, it only felt like 30 mins or so.  If you are someone that just watches anime looking for ""masterpieces"" that blow up and everyone is talking about then this anime isn't for you but if you are like me, someone who watches anime just to laugh and have a good time then this anime is for you.";Recommended
10;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Not-Bot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Not-Bot;8;I'll keep this short, informative and spoiler free. It's a typical romance movie about 3 couples trying to confess their love. If you're looking for romance with twists and drama then sorry but you'll probably not like this one since the story is about high school romance and we all know how those go. I was very much impressed with the art and visuals, since they are pretty amazing and i'm not the only one who feels that way. The soundtrack is pretty good too which is important cause the movie is filled with songs. It becomes quite clear after some time who the main couple is and how their story will go. I felt like it was a bit short too and because of that there was not enough character depth. In the end it's a movie worth watching which won't take up much of your time and impress you with it's amazing visuals but will leave the romance fans or those who have watched a lot of romance anime a bit disappointed due to its lack of originality.;Recommended
11;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;badabass;https://myanimelist.net/profile/badabass;8;An okay movie, its worth a little to fill your blank heart or even waste your time. The story feel classical to me with the concept: the young lover and their complex love story. Trying to get the confession story get a long run, making all clear route get complicated even if their flag really understand to seen. This show even try to make the main thing get a long run while the white hair guy trying to steal. But, thats just only a plot device to make the story feel interesting. For me, its impact a little, only a little feels got some kind of burst out of laugh.  Yet, i kinda worry with this kind of show. Because i just feel bored with the theme. However, after scanning and understanding what is going on, my simple mind got a nice review for these movie. Although its music attachment not quite nice, their attempt got my respect. Idk, i feel like, the music just disturbed the flow of some good romantic moment in no time. Tbh, i like the sound track, however, its irked me a little. Its not suppose to fill that song on that scenes. I mark, some of missed moment failure to get the feels when track of sound appear at the half of the movie.  Thats all my weak point for this. At general, i dont blame with the classic typical romance appear as a main plot for this movie. A typical childhood love road, a classic love at first sight, a decent high-school love story that appear at every show, this show prove some basic romance story. I feel the strongest point only on its music, even i kinda worried about their decision for inserting the song on such scenes. Somehow, its missed some good point. And one point miss, no kissing at all in this show. Mark that, and, feel that.  Yes, theres no point for blaming kiss scenes. But, thats my opinion for this show. Even if i dont read or trying to know its resource material, i kinda feel that scenes must be added. Since this shows was actually too decent and pretty generic for the usual romance show, right? Okay, for the main course, i will do my complete score for other sections like usual.  For the story, its too generic, maybe i wanna say lame accusation for the sake of the classical school romance with no flagship. However, the third party in the half really get intrigueing for the progress of the story, and i salute for that attempt. Other than that, the flow feel normal, and nothing new for my sense of romance show. For all of them, and some point just got state on my statement above (feels with yourself, you will know what i try to implied), i wanna take 7 points as a gratitude.  Sounds, abit off-side, even i like the songs and insert music with my general sensical. Fortunately, their VA save the show, while trio heroine show-off their cute voices. With all of them, i kinda take a 7, sligthly below 7, but its take a 7 as my final.  Art, an okay blown up, a nice and heart-warming scratch. I dont have much complain on this, because i love the cuteness, and the art really completed my purposes. 9 for it.  As characterization, i take it to 9. No questions. Its same for my enjoyment, with my final wish drop to 8 points So for the overall, i make it short, i mean rate all of them to show my respect for all kind of sections. Then, afterall, 8 point must be enough for this show. A fair judgement for me, despite how decent and generic this show was.;Recommended
12;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Avalon_Izanyan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Avalon_Izanyan;7;Firstly this is coming from a giant honeyworks fan (and its my first review) but because of that I am mainly criticizing this film for what it could of been and how it doesn't do the original music videos justice.  The main problem with this film and the other adaptations is that it doesn't include all the information you need to understand fully what is going on and many plot points are left for the viewer to guess or never learn about unless they have seen the music videos or read about it in the novels. This is most likely a limitation due to how short this movie format is and other areas suffer because of it such as mochizuki's and akarai's relationship basically being completely shafted in all 3 adaptations due to lack of time and the poor release date of the adaptations in the first place. Thankfully Miou and Haruki get their own series to adapt their relationship. Lastly Sena and Midori were very much secondary characters but at least got an OVA to give them some more screen time.   Story: 6/10 Of course the main focus of this particular movie is the love triangle between Natsuki, Koyuki and Yu. This has at least adapted most of it right but still leaves out quite a bit of details.  Art: 4/10 I don't know what went wrong but I just feel like the character designs are so different then what we see in literally anything else related to honeyworks and they just don't capture the artstyle right.  Sound: 10/10 Ok this is where the bias would shine. Featuring a lot of honeyworks music including some new original songs sung by many popular utaite's that have worked with honeyworks, including some new original story related songs like Koiiro Ni Sake which makes this a 10/10. There is also some cool attention to detail where the characters may say a line at the exact same time they would of sung it over the background track playing.  Character: 7/10 The couples of honeywork's stories are all quite varied in how each relationship is formed from childhood friends liking each other for awhile to someone simply having a crush on another and trying to get their crush to like them. Though many of the problems I have said above still apply with alot of the characters not being fully developed and alot of details about them being left out.  Enjoyment: 9/10 Being a big honeyworks fan and watching this, it is a real joy to see some form of an adaptation with a somewhat cohesive story all presented at once. Even if some certain song's stories weren't adapted, you would be able to at least hear the instrumental version of the song as background music at times (such as Tokyo Summer Session).  Overall: 7/10 Now I have rated it this low as to someone who knows nothing about honeyworks and watches this for their first time, it would be very disappointing and give a bad first impression to how great honeyworks can actually be. Additionally is this low to just how poor of an adaptation this is for the stories they are trying to adapt. A longer 12-24 episodes tv series would of done a lot more justice to what there actually is.;Recommended
13;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Very_Fun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Very_Fun;8;In truth, the actual plot of the movie is very stereotypical. Most of the things that happen are very predictable and a lot of people might not enjoy a movie like this. If I didn't know the honeyworks songs prior to watching this, I'd probably have rated this very low (around a 4-5). Having played the songs from this movie on OSU tons of times, I'm very familiar with the music & what their songs are about. I recognized the stories the movie was telling immediately & it was nice seeing it being played out while remembering the lyrics to the music =P. Overall a 8/10 for me but the music was 10/10. Really good art too. Highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of honeyworks or an OSU player that's familiar with honeyworks maps! Very nice experience.;Recommended

Which can be found through my profile. ------  ✦Story What can I say, a very simple, cute and sweet high school romance anime. Great sweet vanilla. It wasn't anything special nor boring, it was simply cute and sweet thing to watch, a very enjoyable premise and execution. With a bit of drama, a fair amount of silliness and a great dose of cuteness. Although, as always with dramas, it tends to still annoy me to some extent (some more than another) that the main ""drama"" issue that people keep having is simply their own inability to be honest and say what they feel/think.  ✦Art & Sound Good, bright and simple art with cute and sweet songs. Nothing else to say.  ✦Character Cute. The end? I'm seriously not sure what else to add. There were some stereotypes and some really, really adorable side-characters that barely got any screen time. Lot of shyness and attemps for confession. Getting embarrassed and becoming silly over cutesy romance things, is just adorable.  ✦Enjoyment & Overall Cute Sweet Vanilla  I did enjoy, nothing too melt worthy, nor boring. It was simply bright and cute high school romance.";Recommended
17;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;VampirePony09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VampirePony09;9;"As a devoted Honeyworks fan, I was waiting for this movie since the first trailer came out. It reached my expectations, but it could have been a little bit better.  Story: 7 What you should know about the movie is that is based on a series of Vocaloid Songs. This movie focussed on Yuu and Natsuki, two childhood friends. Natsuki decides to confess to Yuu, but after her confession she got nervous while waiting for his answer so ""It was just a prank, bro!"" and the story goes from that. It's not great, it's not bad. It's average. Another one of the pairings is Mochita and Akari, who barely know each other. Mochita (or Mochizuki, but that's too long) fell in love with Akari at first sight, but he has never talked to her. His feelings are the purest, but he can't help but feeling jealous about every single boy that talks to Akari. Meanwhile, Akari is clueless about love, she doesn't like anyone and never has had a crush. The interactions between the two of them makes their story interesting. I find it hilarious how Mochita is constantly asking to himself ""who does she like? who does she like?"" and Akari just thinks about cake. Then there's the third couple...who you barely notice they are there...Miou and Haruki, too oblivious and shy teenagers who have a crush on each other...and everyone knows that except them. I see why they didn't get as much screentime as the others, there isn't much going on in their story. I would have given it a 6 if it hasn't given us extra content that we hadn't seen neither in the songs or v-comics.  Art: 9 I don't know much about art so this will be shorter. It was really cute and the colours were so nice to the sight. Although I'm used to the art of the PVs, which in my opinion has more quality and detail, but that's only because there are just images and not animations.  Sound: 10 Of course, as a fan of Honeyworks I'm going to give the sound a solid 10. It was amazing to watch the movie and that the background music in many MANY scenes were the instrumental of the songs in the saga. That was a really cool detail and it made me want to sing them. The new songs for the movie (op and ed, and the song in the middle) were as good as you would expect for honeyworks. Catchy songs, with cute lyrics (quoting Natsuki ""a little embarassing"") and really good instrumentals, the usual honeyworks formula.  Character: 7 I love these characters, but i feel like they weren't developped properly in the movie, but that's acceptable, there's only an hour to tell a whole story. Natsuki and Mochita were the ones that got more screen time, while their love interests Yuu and Akari were there plenty of time too. But, as i said, Miou and Haruki barely appeared.  Enjoyment: 10 The hype was real. I enjoyed watching my favourite characters animated. I enjoyed singing along the songs I knew. I enjoyed listening to the new ones. I enjoyed all the references i could get. But that's my enjoyment as a devoted fan, as a casual watcher, i would have given the movie a 7 probably.  Overall: 9 It's a great adaptation, but i feel it works as a summary. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't heard the vocaloid songs it's based on. If you do, the story may look simple and bland, typical shoujo-anime. But if you had heard the songs (or even read the light novels) it'll be great and it'll fill you with hype to see your favourite characters animated. It also summarized and wrapped-up the story of the saga very nicely. In terms of story and characters, the second movie will be better, I'm sure.";Recommended

Seriously, Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai made LA think that by the end of the movie with mixed results...  Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai follows three relationships in three different perspectives, that of a love triangle, a friendship slowly blooming and love at first sight.  Let's look at the love triangle which is the main focus for Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai, the love triangle has Natsuki Enomoto voiced by Haruka Tomatsu in the center of this love triangle, with Yuu Setoguchi voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya being the childhood friend and Natsuki's confession practice partner and Koyuki Ayase voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga that forms the love triangle. -sigh- LA said this about Just Because! and this similarly applies to Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai and that is of LA liking the beta couples more than the main couple and though this love triangle is contrived and annoying to some extent, at least it has some degree of not being overly melodramatic (though it does occur in one scene..because...angst?) and not us constantly teasing us on who Natsuki will choose and yes she chooses, with the most logical option. Natsuki's love triangle is frustrating to say the least but gives some payoff at the very least with some predictable results. But yes for our main focus of Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai, it's subpar in comparison to our beta couples in LA's eyes.  Our ""love at first sight"" couple is of Akari Hayasaka voiced by Kana Asumi and the very shy Souta Mochizuki voiced by Yuki Kaji and really they have a simple romance story mainly on Souta needing to gather the courage to ask Akari out, simple but sweet and it works in this kind of situation and really this was the couple LA was rooting for the most in Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai.  And finally our ""friendship blooming slowly"" is of Miou Aida voiced by Aki Toyosaki and Haruki Serizawa voiced by Keniichi Suzumura, they get the least screentime throughout Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai and is the biggest detriment to what could have been something similar to Akari and Souta's relationship.  LA didn't exactly elaborate on many of the characters individually and more or less talked about the relationships in Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai and yeah, really Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai focuses heavily on it's relationships more than it's characters and sure you can easily defend in saying ""well that's what it's suppose to be"", but considering LA's disinterest and frustration in our main love triangle and the fact that besides all the main cast to be stereotypical to their archetypes and not much besides romance in their minds...really doesn't help Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai case for being entirely focused on it's relationship and forgetting that we kinda need to be interested in the characters first before diving into their romantic lives.  Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai has the transitional music video shifts in it's movie and that is because it's also trying to advertise to us HoneyWorks music and though LA doens't mind this too much as many of it's insert songs has relevance in some sense to the relationships in this movie but they do make it blatant and LA meh about it overall mainly because Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai derived it's source materials from HoneyWorks' music so there's that...  The animation by Qualia Animation was decent enough with some decent backgrounding work and the crisp, polished character designs but because the character designs looked somewhat homogenized (yes even with the various hair colors), LA constantly mistook many of the male characters because of their similar hair styles at times. Nonetheless Qualia Animation did decently to say the least with the rare facial derpiness but that's nothing to rage about.  Voice work, well we have a talented cast....saying some embarrassing and sappy dialogue at times and though many would laugh at the voice actors for this, LA more or less praise them for doing it, it shows talent, most notably being Haruka Tomatsu who has a niche in voicing characters like Natsuki. Kana Asumi did decently enough as the calm and collected yet kawaii high schooler with Aki Toyosaki being very similar but a bit more shy than Kana Asumi. On the other side of things, Yuki Kaji is being Yuki Kaji in Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai and that's totally fine, Hiroshi Kamiya is well the same and expected in many cases as well. Really LA would had wanted to hear more from Aki Toyosaki and Keniichi Suzumura due to their short screentime. Nonetheless talented voice cast, expected from veteran voice actors who's done for years and years.  LA at the start of this review made the comparison to Just Because! and to be honest there are similar vibes to it just that Just Because! has a love triangle along with one beta couple, Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai is the same but with two beta couples and honestly LA sees Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai as slightly better in this respect, at least Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai gave a resolution to our main love triangle whilst Just Because! just plain teased us at the notion.  Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai is not THAT bad of a romance anime movie, from being adapted from HoneyWorks music, it has it's problems from it's somewhat frustrating love triangle and it's generally bland characters, but Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai IS about romance and does just that even if it's the first step like confessing your love along with it's decent animation and talented voice work. But what is dragging Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai down is sticking to it's stereotypical tropes that most anime romances has done time and again and really not doing much to the formula if the relationships are going by...";Recommended

Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;crispyn64;https://myanimelist.net/profile/crispyn64;5;"Why Is Love So Hard? - An ""I've Always Liked You"" Review  I did not like I’ve Always Liked You. To put it bluntly, this 1-hour and 3-minute long movie is shallow, generic, and all-around meaningless. Its sole purpose is to showcase the moments of high love confessions, in ways that are neither clever nor original. Just like many other stories in the genre of romance, I’ve Always Liked You uses these confession as a sort of “payoff”, yet it doesn’t offer up any kind of worthwhile setup for them. The characters are also unmemorable and lack any compelling motivations or adversities. While the animation and music are of an acceptable quality, from a narrative standpoint this film is plain mediocre. But let’s dig a little deeper than that, shall we?  First let’s take a look at the characters and the respective narratives they fit into. The main plot centers around Natsuki and Yu, the token childhood friends that actually DO end up together. Yu is the nice guy that’s always been there for Natsuki, he’s kinda cute and that’s about all there is to his character (all the characters are about this shallow by the way). Natsuki is just a loveable tomboy who’s shy about her feelings like everyone else in this movie, and for some reason wears sweatpants under her school uniform. At the beginning of the film, she confesses to Yu and then quickly retracts that confession, playing it off as “just practice” for the person she’s really in love with. Then the entire movie passes before she comes back to him and confesses for real. Leading right up to that moment was a bunch of still-frame flashbacks to their childhood, showing all the times that Yu had been considerate to Natsuki, serving as evidence to why Natsuki likes him in the first place. It’s pretty shallow because they never actually show a genuine, written out moment between the two for portraying how and why they feel the way that they do. I’d liken it to watching a slideshow at a wedding for people you barely know. Oh boy, it’s the bride and groom as children moving up to the point that they’re at now, except I don’t really know who they are and wasn’t there personally for these moments so this doesn’t really affect me at all. *makes fart noise with tongue*  Next there’s Akari and Souta, the cute purple haired girl and the guy who falls in love with her for solely superficial reasons. It’s that sort of “love at first sight” catch-22, where it’s really not meaningful at all if they actually fell love at the sight of each other, because that makes their relationship based off looks and not personality. There is a bit of reason beyond that very base level of affection, as Akari does have a moment of appreciation for the act of kindness she witnessed Souta perform slyly on a train. In Souta’s mind however, it’s basically a matter of “I like her, how can I make her mine?”. Of course, it sounds a lot more innocent coming from him, but by the time he finally works up the courage to ask her out he comes off as borderline misogynistic. The nicest way to put it would be that he has a very “traditional” mindset, and he basically demands her to make lunches for him every day because that’s what good girlfriends do…ugghh.  As for Miou and Haruki, they secretly like each other and nothing happens.  Finally, there’s Koyuki, and he’s in love with Natsuki as well. This white-haired shy-boy asks her out to a HoneyWorks concert and then needlessly walks her home after it’s over. He ends up not being able to control himself and hugs her under the soft glow of a street lamp, illuminating them in the night for all the neighbors to see. They didn’t really do anything inappropriate, but Yu comes barging out anyway and takes Natsuki away from Koyuki. Natsuki cries but quickly gets over it by the next morning and that’s about it.  Overall, this film is wholeheartedly hollow and unoriginal in terms of both plot and characters. There’s virtually no conflict, and these downright privileged students have nothing to overcome but a very basic sense of nervousness. There is not one single hurdle put in front of these characters that prove to be even the tiniest bit difficult, and they lack any significant flaws that could hinder them. Without having to go through any remotely serious strife, what makes their achievements important, or anything they do in life compelling? And the only answer I can come up with is: nothing. This story is a very simple answer to a very simple question: If you like someone, summon the courage to tell them your feelings. And then everything will be fine because it turns out they like you too. While it might be entertaining to watch cute high school students to go through the motions of romance, there is absolutely nothing consequential to learn from this particular experience. And that’s a shame because it actually looks quite pretty.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;CHLO_JO007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CHLO_JO007;5;"Reviewers point of view: I was having a romance marathon and thought why not add fuel to the fire. I saw both movies, but am only putting in my opinion for the first one. I did not read the novels. I don't listen to vocaloid.  Story: Put nicely, the plot is basic and rushed. I know the movie is only an hour, but I felt like it put in stories that it couldn't handle. I didn't try to remember most of the characters' names (I'm also VERY bad with names) so if I was asked to describe all the love stories, it would sound like I was spreading some middle school rumor: ""Insecure guy likes pretty feminine girl who he thought for a second liked androgynous white haired boy who likes cliche tomboy who likes her childhood friend who is friends with a loud blonde boy who likes tomboy's best friend but can't tell her."" And I'm STILL leaving out another love story so that's 5 love stories!!! Only 3/5 love stories had some sort of conclusion and only 2 got definite answers via confession. The movie only truly focused on the relationships involving Natsuki, the cliche tomboy protagonist. I felt like I would've liked the movie more had they just stuck with Natsuki's story instead of adding details on unnecessary love lives around her because they got no sort of conclusion. And I would've liked it if it was adapted into a show, giving more time for detail and conclusions with the supporting characters.  Art: The art was absolutely gorgeous and the main thing that hooked me to the movie in the first place. It was bright, fresh, and colorful; an appropriate design for a movie about adolescent ""love"".  Sound: So, I'm not involved in the vocaloid community. I don't think I've voluntary listened to vocaloid besides some songs in Mekaku City Actors. But for the most part, they were okay. The lyrics to the songs were perfectly matched with the scene. I think there was only one song I really liked while the other one's I just didn't hate.  Characters: I know the movie is only about an hour, but I have watched 10 minute short films (Yeah, you know which one!!!) that made me feel something towards the characters more than this movie did. All of the characters just seemed like your generic cliches without any complexity put into them. I was also rather annoyed with Natsuki's hypocritical friends who urged her to confess her love but never did the same thing themselves. Finding any conflict or climax between the characters was like grasping for straws. I think the big issue for my apathy was the fact that I wasn't cheering any relationship on. The characters were yearning for love, but for why? ""JUST BECAUSE?"" (lol, it's another romance anime). Although I know love is hard to explain, it's I would appreciate a reason as to why it can't be anyone else.  Enjoyment: Not that enjoyable. The characters were bland, predictable, and more annoying than they were funny. The plot was basic, rushed, and had no complexity. My only enjoyment was watching the pretty animation.";Mixed Feelings
2;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Mxyiee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mxyiee;6;To avoid spilling some spoilers, I'll make this review as simple as possible...  If you're looking for an anime with interesting and unique plot with lots of unexpected development, then I would not recommend this to you. This is a normal romance school anime. A one-hour-length film with an overwhelming number of characters. A flat story where I haven't felt intensity or something unique that will instantly hook me into the show. In other words, if you're planning to watch this movie, then lower your expectations and just enjoy the whole thing. Also, the effort given for this show is not a waste at all since it still has its good aspects.  There are two possible goals in this movie that I could think of. First, It tries to make us relate from our past romance back in our youthful days, which is not that effective since everyone doesn't have those cliche situations or story. Second, it wants to give us romantic excitement which I've never felt while watching the movie. But that's just me, I do think that some people would appreciate this show more than I could since the MAL score is high.  I felt so detached from the characters, they are too many of them and the flashbacks doesn't help in building up their developments. One hour is never enough. In fact, making it as a seasonal anime could make this show much better. Well, they do have a sequel movie but the main roles has changed, and I'm not yet convinced to watch it because of the impression it gave me. I heard the songs used were their original, so that is a wonderful effort. The soundtracks were actually many for a one-hour-length film, and they're not bad at all.  There is one note that I came up with from this story. No matter who you are or what your personality is, whether you act cool or you act strong, everyone's weak when it comes to love. The courage you gain comes from the sole reason why you love that someone. So basically, enjoy your youth because it won't last long. Well, I'm a person full of regrets. High school is high school. It may be one of the cringiest segment of our lives, but it is also one of the happiest, which I haven't felt back then. Well, time for me to sulk for a little bit. Ja Matane!;Mixed Feelings
3;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;triplebreasted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/triplebreasted;6;It was very predictable and boring at times. I had previously watched the movie, but because it's so forgettable, I forgot that I had watched it and re-watched it. The characters were very surface level, with no true depth to them. It was mentioned that the two main characters were childhood friends, but there were no solid scenes that showcase the history of their relationship. Only still images of scenes from their younger days were shown.  The movie had so much potential to explore and dive deeper into the characters' personalities and backstories, but failed to do so.  This movie was decent enough, but very mediocre at best.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;Tepria13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tepria13;5;I didn't really expect much going into this movie, as just from the summary it seemed pretty unoriginal. Plus, the short run-time wasn't doing it any favors considering the multiple points of view it was trying to convey in a short period of time.  Story: 5  The unoriginal and uninspired plot makes for a bit of a boring watch. The scenes from multiple different perspectives are lumped together awkwardly to the point where you have trouble discerning almost anything other than what is currently happening between the characters in the scene. The ending could be better and the cliffhanger isn't even a good cliffhanger. It didn't leave interested in watching any more.  Art: 8  -Nice art that pops in the right moments.  Sound: 7  -Some nice music inserted throughout the movie. Most of them were in good spots, but some felt out of place, especially in the middle. I believe this movie is an adaptation based on a series of music videos, so that may be why. Still, it's decent music, but it doesn't stand out in any way from other soundtracks enough for me to rate it any higher.  Character: 3  -This is the worst part of the film. The characters are boring and one-note. Some may have quirks here or there, but there isn't enough time in the movie to make them enjoyable to see. I guess in a movie about a bunch of students being in love with each other can start to feel that way when every character is constantly thinking about one person. There is no development either. Each character stays the same beginning to end, which makes it extremely boring to watch. It was also obvious from the start that certain characters would get together, making it a pain to wait for the inevitable - especially when the movie is boring to progress through.  Enjoyment: 4  -Like I said before, this movie was a pretty boring watch. The lack of any development, movement, or change made it a chore to finish. That says a lot for an hour watch.  Overall: 5  -While not necessarily bad, this feels like a movie without life, passion, or character. While the art and sound is good, it doesn't make up for the boring story and the one-note, soulless characters. The fact that there are multiple viewpoints in an hour length means that it is hard to form any kind of connection or relation towards any of the characters, and the ending is predictable and unsatisfying. It's a pretty easy pass for those who haven't watched it yet.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;AiwiloNik;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AiwiloNik;3;"I gotta admit, I'm a sucker for a good romance. I like it in basically every shape or form: I like it with a sad ending, a happy ending, with comedic ambiance, with serious atmosphere and one of my favourite types is the cute, heart-warming one.  But this one?  This one I hated.  I can't even describe how excruciating it was to watch. The plot was completely decentralized, unnecerarily jumping from one character to another. I guess the writers wanted to include as many stories from the music videos as possible but because of the limited time they had for this movie, it ended up being about everything and nothing at the same time.  The formula that worked in case of the music videos, where we knew close to nothing about characters but still rooted for them, certainly shouldn't have been applied here. The personalities of the characters are just your cookie-cutter shoujo archetypes or at least they seem so because, as I mentioned before, we know close to NOTHING about the characters. We don't really know much about their relationships beside who-has-a-crush-on-whom, we never learn why these characters are in love with each other, we don't really know their history, we are just randomly presented with certain informations about them like ""this girl likes this band"", ""this boy likes video games"", ""just person likes this person... just because"". This one hour is filled mostly with some mundane, irrelevant to the plot and random scenes that don't even add much to the characters, they just happen because ""everyone eats food, people eat food and have a small talk, let's have a scene with 3 characters stuffing themeselves and talking about nothing!"" or that scene that got me scratching my head the most with the question ""why does it have to exist?"" which is... a shot of each character sitting in their bathtubs at the same and just thinking about how much their suck when it comes to love.  Dear Lord, cease my suffering.  I wasn't expecting some kind of super deep-psychological character development or complicated plot or anything. I wanted to see a simple, cute high-school romance and let go of my worries for today. But this is so badly written storyboard-wise, and since I write stories myself, I just can't help but get irritated by how you can delete the majority of the movie and it would change almost nothing about the plot. The story is just a one big mess. Instead of introducing us to a close to 10 characters, the writers should've focused on the main 3 the movie is supposed be about: Natsuki, Ayase and Yuu and just go with their story.  This way there would be more time to invest in showing us the relationship between Natsuki and the boys and we would know why are we supposed to root for them. Because I don't root for them. I don't fricking care who she end up with at the end because I know close to nothing about this characters, their history and their personalities. Let us see why Natsuki and Yuu are such good friends, let us see how they interact with each other. Show us how Natsuki and Ayase met and why he fell in love with her. Fricking show us his make-over he supposedly did just for her! We are only presented with this fact in the fricking moment he shows up on the screen for the first time! Like ""This is Ayase, btw he looked like this in the past but this was before the movie"". This way we would have mor cohesive and engaging story.  There's this other movie about Yuu's little sis Hina, which btw I watched before this flick because I didn't know they were related. They did what I just said and it turned out sooooo much better. I mean, it wasn't great but I can at least say I kinda enjoyed it. We saw how Hina met the guy, how she started falling in love with him, why she fell in love with him, what she felt back then etc. etc. It revolved mostly about her story, hinting from time to time that there are other characters with their own crushes (""check our music videos for more, *win wink*"") but it never to deviate from the main plotline which was good. Heck, I only know anything about Ayase thanks to that anime!  And that's why I think this story is terrible and you shouldn't waste your time on it, go watch the music videos, good night.";Not Recommended
1;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;DomTheBomb7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DomTheBomb7;3;"Story: It's nothing new or original; just a very straightforward story about crushes and high school love. Not that it HAD to be an original or innovative romance, but when the plot is THAT cut and dry, it's hard not to be bored out of your mind as you're watching it. I wouldn't even say it executed the whole romance aspect particularly well.  Art: I actually did enjoy the art. It was very pleasing to watch and had a lot of attractive colors.  Sound: The sound and music were fine. Nothing really stood out, but it generally was appropriate for a movie about romance.  Character: This is probably where the movie falls flat on its face. The characters are incredibly shallow. What I mean by that is that they're very one-dimensional and you know (and care, for that matter) very little about them. None of them really have any qualities that make them memorable or relatable. I don't mean to be harsh, but honestly, every character I encountered in the movie is a throwaway character that adds nothing to the story or has any substantial dynamic with anyone other than their love interest.  Enjoyment/Overall: It was pretty boring to be honest. When you give someone a bunch of pointless characters who don't do anything more than have very simple crushes on each other, it's hard to keep their interest. Maybe a movie wasn't the best medium for this kind of story. Maybe if they had more time (like in the form of a regular one cour anime), the creators could better develop the story or get the audience more invested with the characters.";Not Recommended

3;Zutto Mae kara Suki deshita. Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai;MotherOfUltra;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MotherOfUltra;4;"*Disclaimer...? First of all, now that I realize Aida Miou's side of the story is also getting animated, I'm gonna conserve all judgments for it. Yaaaaaaay!!! Miiiiiraaaiiiiiinooooowaaaaataaaaashieeee Also I understand A-1 only helped and the real animators are Qualia Animations, but it's really likely that this new studio came from A1, which then means they contributed way more than just a subservice. So point still the same. But if the third movie is much (or at least a little) better I'll delete this right away.       Fuck you A1.  I think through this one it's finally official. A1 doesn't give a jack shit about making a good anime.      When I first heard that my beloved music series was getting animated, I had nothing but doubts after the last one's...uh, unfortunate turnout. I'm of course referring to Shaft's adaptation of Kagerou Project. Then again, adaptation is a kind word here. But when I heard that it was getting done by A1 who love to make adoring girls more adorable than humanly possible, I had my hopes. And even more so when I heard that they were making a movie out of this, and not a series. While I would've personally wanted to see Enemoto and Miou and hear Sana's voice every week, a movie would spell lots and lots of budget, and that meant fluid movements, uncringey (at the very least) dialogues, and infinite moeflower. This was one of those anime that would benefit from having a shameless display of infinite moedom. It's a simple series of music videos with a simple storyline, there's nothing complicated. That's one of the greatest thing about Honeywork's works.    Before I go any further, though, let me be clear; the music was amazing. I seriously can't get enough of Sana's voice in my ears. Not to mention some of the greatest voice actors/actresses of our generations were hired into this thing.  My point is: and for what?  There's no point in even saying spoiler-free or there's no revelations. It's a simple love story. I mean, it's in the FUCKING TITLE. The girl loves someone, and confesses to him, and gets cold feet and goes back on her confession, have some troubles along the way, and lo and behold, ends up dating the guy. Wow, who could've seen that coming?  So what the hell is so complicated about all these?  There's nothing difficult about making girls in love look cute and talk like they're girls their age, and same with boys. #genderequality. But what exactly did we get?  They just made a two-hour-long version of the music videos.    And I mean it. The dialogues were blatant copies of the actual song (yes, because people talk like they sing all the time) and character design was borderline unwatchable. But to be fair, the animation was good, except it wasn't. We got the one-frame bullshit we are so sick of watching by now in a FUCKING MOVIE, and even worse they almost basically REUSED some of the illustrations from the music videos.  Why in the hell would I listen to someone talk about a song I love for two hours instead of just, you know, watching the actual song?  There was no point in this movie at all. The only exceptions were maybe seeing the characters move (which was halfly done and sometimes not done at all) and listening to Sana and the voice actors/actresses' renditions of the songs I love and enjoy. But, and here's the thing, if this is all they were good for, how is it better than watching a nicodouga mad video of a new song by honeyworks? It isn't. It really isn't. I actually wanna see that happen now.    The characters were a joke. The actual characters in the music video are top-notch, of course, but they were almost shamefully underused. For example, we never got to see what the hell happened to Aida Miou. This chafed me up so much because she was my most favorite character. What even is the point of her besides giving the angry fans time to calm down and put down their pitchforks? We never got any glimpses of her problem or her issues, and we never even saw if she ended up with the guy.  Then they at least focused on the main couples, right? Yeah, no.  Fair enough, they got the most screeentime. But here we see time and time again, their lacking dialogues and cheap animations. They at least got all of their stories out, so I guess that's a start...     Overall, I was just too disappointed to give this movie a fair judgment. If I didn't know about the original music video series I would've given it a 6 at the lowest. But here's the thing about adaptation; they're adaptations. There's a reason people raged on Death Note and Ghost in the Shell more than the other hollywood garbage regularly produced. They are supposed to satisfy the fanbase. At least Death Note and GitS did their best. Both went out of their way to fit a mainstream audience, changed the settings to not simply make a remake, and gave no commission to the budget. Yes, I know, comparing hollywood to anime movies is harsh, but here's my counterpoint.  Sagiri.    So no. Fuck you A1. You had time to give Sagiri her own animator in the trashiest show of the season, if not of the year (of course I exaggerate) but you couldn't give two fucks to give Honeyworks and their crew a proper adaptation, in a movie, in a story simpler than the Giving Tree?  Fuck you A1.";Not Recommended

0;Zuori Qing Kong;overControl;https://myanimelist.net/profile/overControl;9;"I will try my best to keep this spoiler free ^^. As you may already be able to tell from my score. I really enjoyed this film. Being a new wave of 'Chinese' produced anime, from studios, I have never heard of. This film was a very fun and interesting watch, I found myself watching this weeks before my exam, in need of procrastination (not a good thing). Only to be left astounded with the breathtaking animation-at times. And the beautifully composed characters and story plot. Overall I will be splitting this review into 5 sections, for simplicity's sake.  One - Story. This story was beautifully written, set in a high school where students find themselves unsure of their future, and their future envisioned by some of their parents. Like most Chinese films I have seen prior. Instead, this was incredible with its new modern ideas and takes on a stressful time period for some. It leaves one with a moral, and some to think back on, to reflect. Which I believe differentiates the best of movies from the worse.  Two - Art. At times the art was spectacular with truly jaw-dropping moments, with amazing CGI to plain out garbage moments, but be not discouraged and strive on as it will not affect the plot in any shape or form. Be aware that at some moments it feels rather rushed and rough. But what sticks is the amazing views, the amazing character designs and the amazing detail put in at just the right moments. Overall for the artworks you either love it or hate, because of the incontinence from the producers or you will love it for the scenes that do deserve praise.  Three - Soundtrack. Early in the film, to my surprise, I had realised they were using ANOTHER animes opening, being Slam Dunk I am unaware for any other instances thus will remain neutral on this. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was not out of this world, (Grammy Nominatible) but rather simple and sweet, with good moments every now and again. However, to no one's surprise, I must mention the Chinese Dubbing as this show was made in China. On other reviews, I saw people say they hated it just for that one reason, or they could not get hooked because of the unfamiliarity. I find these claims flat out stupid and hypocritic coming from the very same people who mouth on about how 'subs are better than dubs!'. Almost funny to an extent, I must although include my reason for bias if any. Of the fact that I am not of Chinese descent but have been taught a few Chinese words here and there so it was refreshing to understand some words properly instead of just 'NANI or ONIICHAN'. The voice acting is not really well and must be praised.  Four - Characters. The characters are composed and put together really well, with story elements of the MC tracing from his past to the present, even leaving one with a really great ending. The four main leads to this show are portrayed really well.  Overall - I think this show is a must watch for people pursuing something to make them think, or reflect back on about their life or think towards the future and what they truly like and want to pursue. In the end I think that people should not feel discouraged from the Chinese Studio and Chinese Voice Acting, instead should stay open-minded for something refreshing. Thanks for reading, and I sincerely hope you give this one a try! ;) TRY YOUR BEST!!!";Recommended
1;Zuori Qing Kong;cluesagi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cluesagi;7;"Disclaimer: I am not Chinese, nor am I very familiar with the culture, so there were undoubtedly some subtle cultural things I missed while watching this film.  Overall: 7/10 I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I decided I wanted to find some Chinese anime to watch to learn more about the culture and language. I rated this movie a 7, but that's still a massive compliment compared to most other Chinese shows I've seen. It's overall pretty good and wouldn't be out of place as a Japanese anime movie, aside from the language obviously.  Story (no spoilers): 7/10 This is the story of a small group of friends as they are finishing high school and seeking what they want to do with their futures. The story really emphasizes following your own dreams and not just doing what your parents or teachers want you to do, which is relatable to pretty much everyone but, I'm sure, doubly so for Chinese viewers. The film seems to take inspiration from Makoto Shinkai's works, especially ""5 Centimeters per Second"". If you enjoy that sort of sad, introspective storytelling, I think you'll enjoy this.  Art: 8/10 I stated above that the film seems to take inspiration from Makoto Shinkai, and that is also very evident in the film's art style. It is a gorgeous film. Any frame could make a good wallpaper. It really looks like Shinkai's films in that way. Unfortunately, while the frames look good on their own, the animation itself leaves a lot to be desired. It's not horrible by any means, but it gives the impression that most of the budget went to making still frames and the animation between them was a bit of an afterthought. If it weren't for that, I'd probably give the art a 10/10.  Sound: 6/10 There are a few vocal tracks throughout the film. I don't really understand Mandarin, but the songs were nice to listen to anyway. The voice acting was hit-or-miss. The main characters were mostly good, but some of the side characters' VAs sounded completely disinterested. Again, I should stress that I don't understand the language or culture so I could have just misinterpreted the characters' intonation and such.  Characters: 8/10 I was surprised by how much development some of the characters got in such a short amount of time. Almost every character seemed layered and thought-out, and the main characters especially are likable and believable. I found myself getting really invested in their story. I also really appreciated that several characters, including side characters, had scenes focusing entirely on them. In that way, I think the film balances its development well. I think this is probably the strongest aspect of the movie.  Enjoyment: 8/10 I greatly enjoyed this film and would gladly watch it again. My score here would be higher, but I think it's a little too slow in the first half.  Overall, I'd highly recommend giving this a watch if you're a fan of Shinkai's stuff (or others like it).";Recommended
2;Zuori Qing Kong;Bowserinator;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bowserinator;9;"Story:  The story really hits you in the gut, you'll like it, especially if you're into movies like A Silent Voice. It's not like other romances I've seen, this one takes a different approach to adolescence that I haven't seen before.  It was a shame the subs I used didn't fully represent the story. It wasn't just that the english wasn't great, but many times they completely mistranslated what was said, or left out details that would've added so much more depth and understanding. Also they didn't bother translating the songs, which are pretty good.  Art:  The animation's pretty high quality. There were some moments with slightly bad CGI (since the film was in development hell for a while), but it never detracted from the experience, and tbh I didn't notice it much. The rest of the visuals were great, with a lot of wallpaper worthy scenes. If you're familiar with the style of Your Name or Weathering With You, this film's style is similar.  Sound:  SFX wise it's pretty standard, nothing that pops out. The music is amazing though, it fits the tone. The subs I used didn't translate them, which is a shame since the lyrics perfectly matched what was going on.  Character:  The characters are what drive this story. They're relatable and memorable; this story really puts you into their perspective. They're also written realistically, with realistic motivations. I never once thought of any of them as a character trope.  Overall:  I thought it was a pretty good, you should at least give it a try. Although maybe after better subs come out, as of the time of writing there only seems to be one group that subbed it.";Recommended
3;Zuori Qing Kong;Dark_Yagami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dark_Yagami;7;The movie has some incredible animation and breathtaking backgrounds, but is wildly inconsistent. Not that any of it is terrible, but some parts clearly stood out as rushed or with janky cgi character movements. Other scenes are quite striking, with fluid animation that adeptly conveys both action, and more subtle body language. In fact, one of the film’s greatest strengths is the animation’s ability to capture the personality of the characters in each scene, whether it’s the rebelliousness abandonment of Qi Jingxuan, or Yao Zhe Tian’s quiet desperation to find purpose and break free from her overly structured life. Even side characters like the teacher, who alternates between egotistical authoritarian, sniveling brown nose, achieve a depth of character through their movements and expressions...which is fortunate, because the English subtitle translations often left me unsure of what was really being said in dialogue.  The other great strength of the film is a touching soundtrack that hits all the right emotional notes and really like a punches you in the gut when it wants to make an impact! While not a masterpiece, it’s a respectable feature film from this first wave of big budget Chinese productions. This is a movie that I would like to rewatch if I can find a copy with more accurate english subtitles.;Recommended
0;Zunda Horizon;bontakunARX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bontakunARX;7;Plot-wise, this anime is suitable mainly for vocaloid fans and fans of the Tohoku sisters (Kiritan, Zunko, and Itako) specifically. They are at their cutest here. It's a wholesome show where you'll get some side knowledge about gastronomy as related to soybeans as well. That being said the plot is very cheesy, especially during the resolution. You will not find anything particularly ingenious or heart wrenching here. But if the sight of Kiritan finally using those cannons like you always thought she could is enough to make your day, then do watch this.  Quality of production is good. The singing synths are used in the actual music, of which there is quite a lot for such a short show. And the art is great, with the Tohoku sisters looking like they should and the other characters having distinctive designs.;Recommended

I have merely watched it for 2 hours and it has already changed my life. Before watching this anime, I weighed 647 pounds, Now I weigh merely 178 pounds. It has gifted the gift of a good career in film directing, and has guided through the troubles of early adulthood. This Anime is a second parent to me. Zumomo to Nupepe, is my savior. All hail Zumomo to Nupepe!  As my dad was always fond of saying, ""You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the egde"". Honestly this encapsulates Zumomo to Nupepe perfectly. There was never a dull moment with this anime. The non-stop adventure kept me engaged and immersed. The incredible audio visual experience further boosted this experience. I lived in the Anime. This Anime is a must play. For anyone. It will change your life";Recommended
0;Zukkoke Sannin-gumi: Zukkoke Jikuu Bouken;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"""Zukkoke Sannin-gumi: Zukkoke Jikuu Bouken"" is an installment in the long-running ""Zukkoke Sannin-gumi"" franchise, which includes manga, novels, multiple live-action movies and dramas, a TV anime series and a few OVAs. The franchise is similar to ""Doraemon"" in content and tone, but is hardly known outside of Japan. This particular OVA was not sold commercially; those who purchased a book in the series had to order the VHS using a postcard included with the book.  ""Zukkoke Jikuu Bouken"" follows the adventures of three 6th-grade boys who, when trying to see their new teacher, Ms. Wakabayashi, and interview her for a school newspaper project, get sucked into a time portal mirror and end up in the Edo period (late 1700s). While they are initially chased by some samurai who think they are outsiders and heretics, the boys meet and are helped by Hiraga Gennai, a real-life historical figure. Also, prior to his trip through time, one of the boys spies another teacher, Mr. Nagai, going on a date with a mysterious woman as well as receiving a present from Ms. Wakabayashi. He intends to write up a scoop for the newspaper project based on all of this. How will the boys get back home, and what is the true identity of their teacher, Ms. Wakabayashi? What is the relationship between Mr. Nagai and the two ladies, and will the one he's dating say yes to his marriage proposal? Watch the OVA to find out.  The plot is coherent and relatively easy to follow, although one may have difficulty understanding some of the Edo period stuff if they don't have much knowledge of that era of Japanese history. The ending feels somewhat sudden and forced, but it is conclusive.  The characters are easy to understand without having seen/read prior entries to the ""Zukkoke Sannin-gumi"" franchise. They're a bit one-dimensional, but that's understandable given the story content and target demographic. The three main characters are similar to the ones in ""Detective Conan"" or even ""Doraemon"": you've got the main character, Hachibei (Conan or Nobita); the nerdy/brainy character, Hakase (Mitsuhiko or Suneo); and the chubby character who likes food, Moo-chan (Genta or Gian). The side characters, although also one-dimensional, have clear and straightforward roles.  The animation and art are okay; nothing flashy, but along the same lines as ""Doraemon"" or ""Sazae-san."" There are a few instances where characters speak without their lips moving, however. As for music, there are some musical interludes during the OVA, in addition to the opening and ending theme. All of these fit the tone of the series well, but aren't really memorable. The voice acting is decent.  As for objectionable content, there isn't any visually. In the dialogue, there's a scene where the antagonists in the Edo period accuse the three boys of being Christians, to which they reply, ""No, we're Japanese!"" This requires context -- Christians were persecuted during this era of Japanese history -- but it still comes off as rather dark for something aimed at kids. Also, the boys want to save Hiraga Gennai from his fate of dying in prison, but they're told they can't change history. So there are some rather dark and depressing undertones to this generally comedic anime.  Overall, this is a pretty solid OVA that's easy to watch, although the ending is a little underwhelming, and reasons why some key events occur remain unanswered. Recommended if you like ""Doraemon"" or other similar shows.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zukkoke Sannin-gumi no Jitensha Kyoushitsu;Gisheon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gisheon;10;"Honestly this is one of the greatest anime I've ever seen in my whole life and i really feel like this one deserves a lot more recognition i mean seriously i found out about this anime just by trying to find the lowest rated anime ever on this website but then i found this priceless gem and I'm very upset that no one had ever told me about this. Honestly this anime was the best use of 14 minutes I would give up my first born son to relive the experience of watching this for the first time so apparently that review up there wasn't long enough but i really don't think i even need to say anything more about this lovely anime just go out and watch it and you will see so right now imma post the entire script to the bee movie According to all known laws of aviation,   there is no way a bee should be able to fly.   Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.   The bee, of course, flies anyway   because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.   Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.   Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.   Barry! Breakfast is ready!   Ooming!   Hang on a second.   Hello?   - Barry? - Adam?   - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.   Looking sharp.   Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.   Sorry. I'm excited.   Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.   A perfect report card, all B's.   Very proud.   Ma! I got a thing going here.   - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!   - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!   Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!   - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.   - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.   Never thought I'd make it.   Three days grade school, three days high school.   Those were awkward.   Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.   You did come back different.   - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.   - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.   - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.   Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.   Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.   I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.   I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.   That's why we don't need vacations.   Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.   - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!   - Bee-men. - Amen!   Hallelujah!   Students, faculty, distinguished bees,   please welcome Dean Buzzwell.   Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...   ...9:15.   That concludes our ceremonies.   And begins your career at Honex Industries!   Will we pick ourjob today?   I heard it's just orientation.   Heads up! Here we go.   Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.   - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.   Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco   and a part of the Hexagon Group.   This is it!   Wow.   Wow.   We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life   to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.   Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.   Our top-secret formula   is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured   into this soothing sweet syrup   with its distinctive golden glow you know as...   Honey!   - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!   - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.   - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive   to improve every aspect of bee existence.   These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.   - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.   Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.   - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey   that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.   Oan anyone work on the Krelman?   Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know   that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.   But choose carefully   because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.   The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.   What's the difference?   You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off   in 27 million years.   So you'll just work us to death?   We'll sure try.   Wow! That blew my mind!   ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?   One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.   I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.   But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?   Why would you question anything? We're bees.   We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.   You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?   Like what? Give me one example.   I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.   Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.   Wait a second. Oheck it out.   - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.   I've never seen them this close.   They know what it's like outside the hive.   Yeah, but some don't come back.   - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!   You guys did great!   You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!   - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.   Their day's not planned.   Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.   You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.   Right.   Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.   It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.   Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.   Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?   Distant. Distant.   Look at these two.   - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.   It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.   Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!   He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!   - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.   What were you doing during this?   Trying to alert the authorities.   I can autograph that.   A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?   Yeah. Gusty.   We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.   - Six miles, huh? - Barry!   A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.   - Maybe I am. - You are not!   We're going 0900 at J-Gate.   What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?   I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.   Hey, Honex!   Dad, you surprised me.   You decide what you're interested in?   - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.   Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?   Son, let me tell you about stirring.   You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.   You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.   You know, Dad, the more I think about it,   maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.   You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?   That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.   Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!   - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.   You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!   - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!   Wait till you see the sticks I have.   I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!   Let's open some honey and celebrate!   Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.   Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!   I'm so proud.   - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.   Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.   Yeah, right.   Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...   - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!   One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.   - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!   Wow!   Oouple of newbies?   Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!   Make your choice.   - You want to go first? - No, you go.   Oh, my. What's available?   Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.   - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.   I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.   Wax monkey's always open.   The Krelman opened up again.   What happened?   A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.   Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.   Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!   Oh, this is so hard!   Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,   humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,   mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?   Barry!   All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...   What happened to you? Where are you?   - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?   - Out there. - Oh, no!   I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.   You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?   Another call coming in.   If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd   that gets their roses today.   Hey, guys.   - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?   Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.   It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.   Really? Feeling lucky, are you?   Sign here, here. Just initial that.   - Thank you. - OK.   You got a rain advisory today,   and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.   So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,   hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.   Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.   Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!   - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,   bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!   All right, launch positions!   Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!   Black and yellow!   Hello!   You ready for this, hot shot?   Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.   Wind, check.   - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.   - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.   Scared out of my shorts, check.   OK, ladies,   let's move it out!   Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!   All of you, drain those flowers!   Wow! I'm out!   I can't believe I'm out!   So blue.   I feel so fast and free!   Box kite!   Wow!   Flowers!   This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.   Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.   Roses!   30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.   Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.   That is one nectar collector!   - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.   I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,   a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.   That's amazing. Why do we do that?   That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.   Oool.   I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?   Oopy that visual.   Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.   Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?   Affirmative.   That was on the line!   This is the coolest. What is it?   I don't know, but I'm loving this color.   It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.   Yeah, fuzzy.   Ohemical-y.   Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.   My sweet lord of bees!   Oandy-brain, get off there!   Problem!   - Guys! - This could be bad.   Affirmative.   Very close.   Gonna hurt.   Mama's little boy.   You are way out of position, rookie!   Ooming in at you like a missile!   Help me!   I don't think these are flowers.   - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.   What is this?!   Match point!   You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!   Yowser!   Gross.   There's a bee in the car!   - Do something! - I'm driving!   - Hi, bee. - He's back here!   He's going to sting me!   Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!   He blinked!   Spray him, Granny!   What are you doing?!   Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.   I gotta get home.   Oan't fly in rain.   Oan't fly in rain.   Oan't fly in rain.   Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!   Ken, could you close the window please?   Ken, could you close the window please?   Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.   You see? Folds out.   Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.   What was that?   Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...   Drapes!   That is diabolical.   It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.   What's number one? Star Wars?   Nah, I don't go for that...   ...kind of stuff.   No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.   When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.   There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.   I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.   I predicted global warming.   I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.   Wait! Stop! Bee!   Stand back. These are winter boots.   Wait!   Don't kill him!   You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!   Why does his life have less value than yours?   Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?   I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.   My brochure!   There you go, little guy.   I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.   Put that on your resume brochure.   My whole face could puff up.   Make it one of your special skills.   Knocking someone out is also a special skill.   Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.   - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.   - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.   - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.   I gotta say something.   She saved my life. I gotta say something.   All right, here it goes.   Nah.   What would I say?   I could really get in trouble.   It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.   I can't believe I'm doing this.   I've got to.   Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!   No. Yes. No.   Do it. I can't.   How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.   Here she comes! Speak, you fool!   Hi!   I'm sorry.   - You're talking. - Yes, I know.   You're talking!   I'm so sorry.   No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.   But I don't recall going to bed.   Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.   This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!   I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,   but they were all trying to kill me.   And if it wasn't for you...   I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.   That was a little weird.   - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.   I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!   I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.   - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?   The talking thing.   Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.   - That's very funny. - Yeah.   Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.   Anyway...   Oan I...   ...get you something? - Like what?   I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?   I don't want to put you out.   It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.   - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.   - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.   Hey, you want rum cake?   - I shouldn't. - Have some.   - No, I can't. - Oome on!   I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.   - Where? - These stripes don't help.   You look great!   I don't know if you know anything about fashion.   Are you all right?   No.   He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.   He finally gets there.   He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.   And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.   Why would I marry a watermelon?""   Is that a bee joke?   That's the kind of stuff we do.   Yeah, different.   So, what are you gonna do, Barry?   About work? I don't know.   I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.   I know how you feel.   - You do? - Sure.   My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.   - Really? - My only interest is flowers.   Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.   Anyway, if you look...   There's my hive right there. See it?   You're in Sheep Meadow!   Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!   No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.   - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?   - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.   - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.   Just having two cups of coffee!   Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.   Yeah, it's no trouble.   Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.   Are you...?   Oan I take a piece of this with me?   Sure! Here, have a crumb.   - Thanks! - Yeah.   All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.   Or not.   OK, Barry.   And thank you so much again... for before.   Oh, that? That was nothing.   Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...   This can't possibly work.   He's all set to go. We may as well try it.   OK, Dave, pull the chute.   - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!   It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.   Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!   Giant, scary humans! What were they like?   Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.   They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.   - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.   - How'd you get back? - Poodle.   You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.   You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.   - Well... - Well?   Well, I met someone.   You did? Was she Bee-ish?   - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.   - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.   I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.   I can't get by that face.   So who is she?   She's... human.   No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.   - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.   She's so nice. And she's a florist!   Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!   We're not dating.   You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes   with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!   She saved my life! And she understands me.   This is over!   Eat this.   This is not over! What was that?   - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!   And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!   - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.   It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...   Sit down!   ...really hot! - Listen to me!   We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!   Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?   There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!   You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!   - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   There he is. He's in the pool.   You know what your problem is, Barry?   I gotta start thinking bee?   How much longer will this go on?   It's been three days! Why aren't you working?   I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.   What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!   Would it kill you to make a little honey?   Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.   Martin, would you talk to him?   Barry, I'm talking to you!   You coming?   Got everything?   All set!   Go ahead. I'll catch up.   Don't be too long.   Watch this!   Vanessa!   - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.   He doesn't respond to yelling!   - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!   I'm not listening to this.   Sorry, I've gotta go.   - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.   A girl? Is this why you can't decide?   Bye.   I just hope she's Bee-ish.   They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?   To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!   Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.   A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?   No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?   It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.   Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.   TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!   You don't have that?   We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.   Oh, my.   Dumb bees!   You must want to sting all those jerks.   We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.   So you have to watch your temper.   Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,   write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:   Anger, jealousy, lust.   Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?   Yeah.   - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.   He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!   What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?   Yeah, it was. How did you know?   It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.   You've really got that down to a science.   - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.   What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?   How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,   Ray Liotta Private Select?   - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.   - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.   You don't have enough food of your own?   - Well, yes. - How do you get it?   - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!   And it's hard to make it!   There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!   - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!   It's just honey, Barry.   Just what?!   Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!   You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!   And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.   I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!   Hey, Hector.   - You almost done? - Almost.   He is here. I sense it.   Well, I guess I'll go home now   and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.   You're busted, box boy!   I knew I heard something. So you can talk!   I can talk. And now you'll start talking!   Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?   I don't understand. I thought we were friends.   The last thing we want to do is upset bees!   You're too late! It's ours now!   You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!   You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!   Where is the honey coming from?   Tell me where!   Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!   Orazy person!   What horrible thing has happened here?   These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now   they're on the road to nowhere!   Just keep still.   What? You're not dead?   Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?   To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.   I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!   I'm going to Tacoma.   - And you? - He really is dead.   All right.   Uh-oh!   - What is that?! - Oh, no!   - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?   Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!   Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!   How much do you people need to see?!   Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!   From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.   But don't kill no more bugs!   - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!   - You hear something? - Like what?   Like tiny screaming.   Turn off the radio.   Whassup, bee boy?   Hey, Blood.   Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.   Wow!   I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.   I mean, that honey's ours.   - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.   It's a close community.   Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.   - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.   Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!   At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.   Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.   Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.   You got to be kidding me!   Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!   - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!   I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?   We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.   What is this place?   A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.   They are pinheads!   Pinhead.   - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.   The Thomas 3000!   Smoker?   Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.   A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.   They make the honey, and we make the money.   ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?   Oh, my!   What's going on? Are you OK?   Yeah. It doesn't last too long.   Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?   Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.   This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!   That's a drag queen!   What is this?   Oh, no!   There's hundreds of them!   Bee honey.   Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!   This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.   Oh, Barry, stop.   Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.   Do these look like rumors?   That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.   How did you get mixed up in this?   He's been talking to humans.   - What? - Talking to humans?!   He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!   Make out? Barry!   We do not.   - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?   The bees!   I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.   Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?   I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!   Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked   your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.   I remember that.   What right do they have to our honey?   We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!   Even if it's true, what can one bee do?   Sting them where it really hurts.   In the face! The eye!   - That would hurt. - No.   Up the nose? That's a killer.   There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.   Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.   No more bee beards!   With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.   Weather with Storm Stinger.   Sports with Buzz Larvi.   And Jeanette Ohung.   - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.   A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,   intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,   packaging it and profiting from it illegally!   Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,   we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,   Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.   Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.   Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""?   Bees have never been afraid to change the world.   What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?   Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.   We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.   How old are you?   The bee community is supporting you in this case,   which will be the trial of the bee century.   You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.   It's a common name. Next week...   He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...   Next week...   Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.   Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.   Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.   In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!   It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.   Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?   Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.   - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!   I'm helping him sue the human race.   - Hello. - Hello, bee.   This is Ken.   Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.   Why does he talk again?   Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.   But it's our yogurt night!   Bye-bye.   Why is yogurt night so difficult?!   You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!   Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.   - Frosting... - How many sugars?   Just one. I try not to use the competition.   So why are you helping me?   Bees have good qualities.   And it takes my mind off the shop.   Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.   Those are great, if you're three.   And artificial flowers.   - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.   Bent stingers, pointless pollination.   Bees must hate those fake things!   Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.   Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.   - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.   You sure you want to go through with it?   Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able   to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!   It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,   where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,   we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.   What have we gotten into here, Barry?   It's pretty big, isn't it?   I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.   You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?   Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.   - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.   Well, if it isn't the bee team.   You boys work on this?   All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.   All right. Oase number 4475,   Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry   is now in session.   Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?   A privilege.   Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?   I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.   Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,   my grandmother was a simple woman.   Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right   to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.   If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,   just think of what would it mean.   I would have to negotiate with the silkworm   for the elastic in my britches!   Talking bee!   How do we know this isn't some sort of   holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?   They could be using laser beams!   Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,   he could be on steroids!   Mr. Benson?   Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.   I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.   It's important to all bees. We invented it!   We make it. And we protect it with our lives.   Unfortunately, there are some people in this room   who think they can take it from us   'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,   you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have   but everything we are!   I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!   Oall your first witness.   So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.   I suppose so.   I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!   Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.   Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.   I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?   - No. - I couldn't hear you.   - No. - No.   Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,   it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.   They're very lovable creatures.   Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.   You mean like this?   Bears kill bees!   How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!   Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!   OK, that's enough. Take him away.   So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.   - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.   But you've never been a police officer, have you?   No, I haven't.   No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example   of bee culture casually stolen by a human   for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.   Oh, please.   Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?   Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.   Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!   That's not his real name?! You idiots!   Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on   your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.   Thank you. Thank you.   I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome   with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.   I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?   Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?   Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't   have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?   Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!   This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!   Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!   - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!   Order! Order, I say!   - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!   I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.   I think the jury's on our side.   Are we doing everything right, legally?   I'm a florist.   Right. Well, here's to a great team.   To a great team!   Well, hello.   - Ken! - Hello.   I didn't think you were coming.   No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.   I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.   Oh, that was lucky.   There's a little left. I could heat it up.   Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.   So I hear you're quite a tennis player.   I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.   That's where I usually sit. Right... there.   Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,   and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.   You think I don't see what you're doing?   I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.   Do we?   Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.   That's just what I was thinking about doing.   Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.   I'm going to drain the old stinger.   Yeah, you do that.   Look at that.   You know, I've just about had it   with your little mind games.   - What's that? - Italian Vogue.   Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.   A lot of ads.   Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?   Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!   I think something stinks in here!   I love the smell of flowers.   How do you like the smell of flames?!   Not as much.   Water bug! Not taking sides!   Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!   I've got issues!   Well, well, well, a royal flush!   - You're bluffing. - Am I?   Surf's up, dude!   Poo water!   That bowl is gnarly.   Except for those dirty yellow rings!   Kenneth! What are you doing?!   You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!   We need to talk!   He's just a little bee!   And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!   Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?   No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!   Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...   My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!   Goodbye, Ken.   And for your information,   I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!   I'm sorry about all that.   I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!   I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.   I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.   Are you OK for the trial?   I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.   We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.   Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...   Yeah.   Layton, you've gotta weave some magic   with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.   Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around   is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.   - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?   Only to losing, son. Only to losing.   Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.   What exactly is your relationship   to that woman?   We're friends.   - Good friends? - Yes.   How good? Do you live together?   Wait a minute...   Are you her little...   ...bedbug?   I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,   doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?   - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!   - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!   Hold me back!   You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?   He's denouncing bees!   Don't y'all date your cousins?   - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!   Adam, don't! It's what he wants!   Oh, I'm hit!!   Oh, lordy, I am hit!   Order! Order!   The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!   I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!   You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!   Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!   - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.   What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison   from my heaving buttocks?   I will have order in this court. Order!   Order, please!   The case of the honeybees versus the human race   took a pointed turn against the bees   yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.   - Hey, buddy. - Hey.   - Is there much pain? - Yeah.   I...   I blew the whole case, didn't I?   It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.   I'd be better off dead. Look at me.   They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.   Look, there's a little celery still on it.   What was it like to sting someone?   I can't explain it. It was all...   All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!   All right.   You think it was all a trap?   Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.   What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.   What will the humans do to us if they win?   I don't know.   I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.   Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!   Oh, my.   Oould you get a nurse to close that window?   - Why? - The smoke.   Bees don't smoke.   Right. Bees don't smoke.   Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.   That's it! That's our case!   It is? It's not over?   Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.   Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.   And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.   Mr. Flayman.   Yes? Yes, Your Honor!   Where is the rest of your team?   Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.   Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,   and as a result, we don't make very good time.   I actually heard a funny story about...   Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs   taken up enough of this court's valuable time?   How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?   They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges   against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.   I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!   Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going   to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.   But you can't! We have a terrific case.   Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?   Show me the smoking gun!   Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?   Here is your smoking gun.   What is that?   It's a bee smoker!   What, this? This harmless little contraption?   This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.   Look at what has happened   to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?""   Is this what nature intended for us?   To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines   and man-made wooden slat work camps?   Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?   - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.   Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!   Free the bees! Free the bees!   Free the bees!   Free the bees! Free the bees!   The court finds in favor of the bees!   Vanessa, we won!   I knew you could do it! High-five!   Sorry.   I'm OK! You know what this means?   All the honey will finally belong to the bees.   Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.   This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.   You'll regret this.   Barry, how much honey is out there?   All right. One at a time.   Barry, who are you wearing?   My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.   - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?   We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.   Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?   First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.   Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,   every last drop.   We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more   than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.   We're all aware of what they do in the woods.   Wait for my signal.   Take him out.   He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.   And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...   But it's just a prance-about stage name!   ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products   and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.   Oan't breathe.   Bring it in, boys!   Hold it right there! Good.   Tap it.   Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!   - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.   Shut down honey production!   Stop making honey!   Turn your key, sir!   What do we do now?   Oannonball!   We're shutting honey production!   Mission abort.   Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.   Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.   Oh, yeah?   What's going on? Where is everybody?   - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.   They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.   I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.   At least we got our honey back.   Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?   It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.   This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.   And now...   Now I can't.   I don't understand why they're not happy.   I thought their lives would be better!   They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.   You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?   - What did you want to show me? - This.   What happened here?   That is not the half of it.   Oh, no. Oh, my.   They're all wilting.   Doesn't look very good, does it?   No.   And whose fault do you think that is?   You know, I'm gonna guess bees.   Bees?   Specifically, me.   I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.   It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.   That's our whole SAT test right there.   Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.   And then, of course...   The human species?   So if there's no more pollination,   it could all just go south here, couldn't it?   I know this is also partly my fault.   How about a suicide pact?   How do we do it?   - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.   Right, right.   Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.   I had to open my mouth and talk.   Vanessa?   Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?   To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.   They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.   It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.   Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.   I know. Me neither.   Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.   Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?   Roses!   Vanessa!   Roses?!   Barry?   - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.   Flowers, bees, pollen!   I know. That's why this is the last parade.   Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?   Oould you slow down?   Barry!   OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.   Yes, it kind of is.   I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you   with the flower shop. I've made it worse.   Actually, it's completely closed down.   I thought maybe you were remodeling.   But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.   I don't want to hear it!   All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.   I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.   All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.   - Bees. - Park.   - Pollen! - Flowers.   - Repollination! - Across the nation!   Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.   They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.   Security will be tight.   I have an idea.   Vanessa Bloome, FTD.   Official floral business. It's real.   Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.   Thank you. It was a gift.   Once inside, we just pick the right float.   How about The Princess and the Pea?   I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!   Yes, I got it.   - Where should I sit? - What are you?   - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?   It goes under the mattresses.   - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.   You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!   Let's see what this baby'll do.   Hey, what are you doing?!   Then all we do is blend in with traffic...   ...without arousing suspicion.   Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.   Stop! Security.   - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.   Has it been in your possession the entire time?   Would you remove your shoes?   - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.   I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.   Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.   Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!   I think this is gonna work.   It's got to work.   Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.   We have a bit of bad weather in New York.   It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.   Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.   I gotta get up there and talk to them.   Be careful.   Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?   I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.   Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.   - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.   Bee!   Don't freak out! My entire species...   What are you doing?   - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?   Don't move.   Oh, Barry.   Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.   Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?   And please hurry!   What happened here?   There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.   One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!   - Is that another bee joke? - No!   No one's flying the plane!   This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?   This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.   Where's the pilot?   He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.   Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?   As a matter of fact, there is.   - Who's that? - Barry Benson.   From the honey trial?! Oh, great.   Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.   It's got giant wings, huge engines.   I can't fly a plane.   - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.   How hard could it be?   Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.   This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,   where a suspenseful scene is developing.   Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...   That's Barry!   ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers   and an incapacitated flight crew.   Flowers?!   We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls   with absolutely no flight experience.   Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.   I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.   They've done enough damage.   But isn't he your only hope?   Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.   Their wings are too small...   Haven't we heard this a million times?   ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.""   - Get this on the air! - Got it.   - Stand by. - We're going live.   The way we work may be a mystery to you.   Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.   But let me tell you about a small job.   If you do it well, it makes a big difference.   More than we realized. To us, to everyone.   That's why I want to get bees back to working together.   That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.   We get behind a fellow.   - Black and yellow! - Hello!   Left, right, down, hover.   - Hover? - Forget hover.   This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!   Barry, what happened?!   Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.   - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!   So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.   All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!   Move out!   Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!   Don't have to yell.   I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.   It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!   It's not a tone. I'm panicking!   I can't do this!   Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!   You snap out of it.   You snap out of it.   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.   How is the plane flying?   I don't know.   Hello?   Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?   The Pollen Jocks!   They do get behind a fellow.   - Black and yellow. - Hello.   All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.   Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?   No, nothing. It's all cloudy.   Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.   - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.   - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.   Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.   Bring the nose down.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.   Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?   Affirmative!   Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.   Land on that flower!   Ready? Full reverse!   Spin it around!   - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?   - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!   That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower   made of millions of bees!   Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.   Rotate around it.   - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.   Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?   Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!   Just drop it. Be a part of it.   Aim for the center!   Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!   Oome on, already.   Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!   - Yes. No high-five! - Right.   Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?   What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!   - Thank you. - But we're not done yet.   Listen, everyone!   This runway is covered with the last pollen   from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.   That means this is our last chance.   We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.   If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?   Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?   We're bees!   Keychain!   Then follow me! Except Keychain.   Hold on, Barry. Here.   You've earned this.   Yeah!   I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.   Oh, yeah.   That's our Barry.   Mom! The bees are back!   If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.   I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!   Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next?   Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.   Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!   Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!   I had no idea.   Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?   Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.   Sorry I'm late.   He's a lawyer too?   I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.   Have a great afternoon!   Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.   No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.   You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next?   All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.   Thank you, Barry!   That bee is living my life!   Let it go, Kenny.   - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.   - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.   Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.   You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.   - Thinking bee! - Me?   Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.   I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?   I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!   All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.

And a beautiful, cute, fun and kind of naughty supporting character. A great combination. Great characters in general. All heroes are really cool, fun and interesting.  The plot itself is great, it leaves us very curious about what will happen. And when we think the story is going one way, it ends up going the other way.  The animation it's kind a bad. It is a work that deserved to have been better produced, to have had a greater investment.  Yes, Mandarin is a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it quickly.

Zuihou de Zhaohuan Shi/The Last Summoner has a whole lot of variety from a lot of inspiration. The author really knew what was good and how to put it in his own work.  Starts basically, the Summoner goes from meeting his spirit, pet, and girl in the block, to getting hunted together, to battling in a trial but there is so much more to the description of this story that I'd be oversimplifying the fun stuff and this is how every episode watching the donghua is different and interesting.  It gets rapidly good, brutal headshot enemies that kills, and episode 9 of Season 1, you meet sexy Bonnie also!  The characters, like the Maid guy with mecha and the funny also moe girl spirit Dora, the jokes pointing to the world like Mexican Cartel, and the allusions to the entertainment medium are hard to miss.  I brought up variety, because there really is a lot of variety to enjoy. 10/10;Recommended
0;Zuihou de Zhaohuan Shi;WuXu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WuXu;6;"NOTE: I have watched the Chinese dub of this release not the Japanese Dub.  Lets just start by saying after hearing/reading the name I thought this to be an Isekai/Reincarnation release but it was not; it somewhat surprised me but the S1 does not do anything else special.  The story is not much interesting; the MC is bored with his every day2day life but is very good at cooking and one day summons a goddess with his food. The history of the MC is also unknown as his parents left him at age 5 and he doesn't remember them much; its the same with the summoned goddess Dora/Duola, she has amnesia and does not remember anything about her other than she was caged a few centuries ago. The MC is not OP at starting but as how the story is progressing it is not off the books that he may become one in future.  The animation is decent but with CG scenes here to there that sometimes change the flow while watching. It has a good OP/ED compared to others. It is somewhat entertaining if you don't compare it much.  Story-6 Animation-6 Sound/OP/ED-7 Entertainment-7  --Similarity-- At first I thought it to be similar to ""Black Summoner"" but the first few eps were similar to ""Kinsou no Vermeil"" (without ecchi/nudity) and the last couple were similar to ""HxH Arena arc""";Mixed Feelings

Character: I liked the all girls, even though the octopus one didn't even talked. The second guy was pretty funny but the other two were just eh.  Enjoyment: The action seemed kind of slow, so I think it was actually a good thing that they packed all four stories in just a single episode.

0;Zoo: Hidamari no Shi;flipsard;https://myanimelist.net/profile/flipsard;8;Randomly searching for shorts to watch I stumbled across Zoo: Hidamari no Shi, I was at first put off by the mediocre art and weird sounds, but within a few minutes of it starting I found myself entranced in the story of this young girl/robot and the mysterious man who made her.  Story - 9 The story is rather simple, especially during the beginning, it simply follows a girl discover more about her world and herself, but as the story progressed I was amazed at how something so short could invoke so much emotion, I found myself tearing up during some parts, something I did not expect from this, truly a well made story for what it is.  Art - 6 The art is nothing to be proud of, it is very basic, especially the character designs. The background art especially in a few scenes is rather pretty and enjoyable to look at, but the characters don't often blend well with the background and stand out a bit to much.  Sound - 7 The voice acting wasn't the best in the world, but it also wasn't the worst I have ever seen, I didn't really notice anything bad from watching it other then a few weird sounds when the girl would turn her neck in the beginning.  Characters - 8 The girl was a nice character, I enjoyed watching her emotions blossom as the movie progressed, although she likes to drink coffee with sugar so I don't know about that, I enjoy how she is self aware about many things but also like a young child in many others, the man was also a nice character, especially as you began to learn more about him and his past, I truly did enjoy the character and drew close to them in such a short time.  Enjoyment - 8 From the simple story to the nice background art, the little details added throughout, I am sure with a larger budget it could truly look beautiful, but I don't think it is something that should put people of from experiencing this nice short movie.  Overall - 8 I don't usually enjoy many short movies, but this was something special, that I am glad I found, I would recommend it to someone who is looking for something shorter and easy to watch, from some of the small details and even some of the deeper themes it had, I enjoyed it all.;Recommended
1;Zoo: Hidamari no Shi;TheFullmetalNaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheFullmetalNaru;8;Once upon a time, on a warm and sunny day, a young lady opened her eyes for the first time. Born not of flesh, but of circuits and steel, she was a robot, created in a lab to serve a lonely man who was living in solitude out on a desolate cliffside field. Her duties included making his coffee, doing his laundry, and tending his garden, which had recently been beset by a hungry little rabbit. After a month of this, it began to dawn on the robot girl that there was a purpose to her daily routine beyond mere servitude. He was teaching her to appreciate life, to live in harmony with nature, and to understand the tragedy of death... And most devastatingly of all, that his own demise would soon come to pass. With only a week left to carry out his final wish, burying him so that his body can return to the earth that he loves so much, will she finally be able to peace together the truth behind her birth?  You probably haven’t heard of Hidamari no Uta/Hidamari no Shi, otherwise known as Song of the Place Where the Sun Shines, and that’s not just me being a hipster. The background behind this short film is fairly unique, and it’s also the reason why the entry for this title is locked on Anilist(and now deleted, so yay, MAL gets exclusive dibs on this one). It doesn’t technically qualify as anime by this site’s standards, even though it’s a piece of animation that was produced and released in Japan. To be fair, Hidamari wasn’t released the same way most anime are released... It was released as part of an anthology film, and it was the only segment on that film that was animated. The film was called Zoo, and it was a collection of works inspired by the writings of acclaimed Japanese Horror author Otsuichi. Zoo is basically to Otsuichi what the Creepshow films were to Stephen King.  I personally saw this film at least a decade ago, when the DVD was available for cheap from Rightstuf, and while my memories of the film are vague, Hidamari was one of the two shorts that stuck with me, and for good reason. First off, this is a very visually striking film. I’m not sure what to call this aesthetic... 3D sounds inaccurate, because that’s something you’d need special glasses for, and CG also sounds dishonest, because pretty much all anime is made via computers these days. Hell, you know what I mean without getting all semantic on me, right? I’m going to call it 3D, with that understanding between us. 3D anime is rare even these days, and Hidamari was produced in 2005 for a 2007 release. It’s fair to say that the best looking 3D anime I’ve ever seen also came out in this time frame, but Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children will always be the exception that proves the rule.  Movies that are just extended video game cutscenes aside, even today, 3D animation in Japan is extremely hit or miss. It’s at its best when it’s animating non-human characters, so that it’s able to lean into the uncanny valley and actually take advantage of it, which is why Land of the Lustrous works so much better than Knights of Sidonia or the newer installments of Berserk. Hidamari also takes advantage of this, and the result is animation that looks... Good. Not amazing, not breathtaking, but good. That might not sound like praise, but for an indie project in 2007 that didn’t have a Square Enix sized budget to throw around, 3D animation that doesn’t look terrible is still hitting above par. The animation does its job perfectly fine, it never feels janky or creepy, and it also helps that they used what appears to be a water-color palette to soften the edges. It’s a nicer looking project than it has any right to be, but I guess I'd expect nothing less from Toei.  As for the other reasons why this short stuck with me for so long... It’s kind of hard talking about the story and writing, because it’s a thirteen minute anime that actually manages to have some massive spoilers in it, so you’re going to have to excuse me talking in broad strokes about what it was specifically that struck a chord with me. As soon as the short opens, you’re immediately presented with a scenario that invites you to ask dozens of questions, but it never asks any of them for you, or even suggests which ones are the most important. Right out the gate, there are endless little theories you can cook up about what’s actually going on, and the narrative is very careful to only feed you bits and pieces of the true answers as it leads up to the devastating third act. You’re given several clues that seem to point in one obvious direction, only for their true meaning to slap you upside the head on a second watch. If you’re like me, and you’re a huge fan of Key the Metal Idol, you may believe right from the start that the girl isn’t really a robot, and she’s just delusional. I’m not saying whether or not that’s true.  In the past, I’ve praised certain anime titles that I’ve reviewed for being about certain topics, and while I generally stand by most of my previous reviews, being about something doesn’t necessarily make an anime good. When I watched the infamously boring Glasslip last year, I was able to pick up on layers of depth and meaning in the story... There’s a reason that story is told the way it is, it has something to say, and it says it exceptionally well, but that still doesn’t change the fact that it’s fucking boring. So, when I say that Hidamari is about life and death, I want you to know that that alone is not an endorsement. There are millions of ways to explore that concept... Some of them are good, some of them are bad, some of them are stupid, some of them are profound, etc. What matters is whether or not the concept is explored in an interesting and thought provoking way, and in my opinion, Hidamari does exactly that.  Out of all the different perspectives that you can explore the basic yet somehow still ambitious topic of existence itself from, I have to admit, the perspective of a robot who was created to serve and ultimately bury a dying human is definitely an intriguing one. We don’t spend a ton of time with our nameless protagonist, but we do experience life and death right alongside her as we observe the month and change that she’s able to spend with her creator, and it’s explored in some genuinely touching and unexpected ways that, again, I’m sad to say, I’m not able to specifically discuss due to spoilers. Personally, I think it would have been better if it had been extended to a full half hour, so most of the robot’s development wouldn’t have been relegated to a montage, but it’s not a bad montage or anything. It’s just the one glaring flaw in what was, otherwise, a tightly written story that will probably stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.  Hidamari no Shi has only ever been made available stateside through the original Zoo DVD release, which is long out of print, and is not pretty expensive on Ebay. The short on its own can be viewed for free on Youtube, even if the video quality isn’t all that great.  Hidamari no Shi may not shock you... It may not tug at your heart strings and make you cry... As powerful as its twists may be, they may not hit you like a sucker punch to the gut, and I doubt I can really present it to you as a tear jerker. What I can promise is that even after every question has been answered, even after it’s played its last card, this is a short film that will make you think. Even if you never felt a deep connection to the characters, you will remember their plight. While the story is mostly unique and original, outside of being an adaptation, it takes elements from stories like Frankenstein and Alice in Wonderland to help make its point, and the end result is richer for it. If it were made ten years later, it wouldn’t have felt out of place in the Netflix series Love, Death, and Robots. I’d highly recommend checking this short film out, and I’d especially love to hear what other people were able to take away from it.  I give Hidamari no Shi an 8/10.;Recommended

It's a short little anime about a zombie family making meat pie and foraging for ingredients in a cemetary. Add in a creepy character and you get some fun interactions. It's nothing special but with only 5 minutes overall, expectations should not be too high. I would recommend to watch this during Halloween or to get a small dose of ""spooky"" if you only have a couple of minutes to spare. It's short enough that even if you do not like it, the time wasted won't be too sad to let go of.";Recommended
0;Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I;Cheesyhoboe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cheesyhoboe;7;"Zone of the Enders: Dolores, i happens to be one of those unfortunate titles which get a bad rep for reasons which don't pertain to its actual quality. This is mainly due to fans of the (excellent) Zone of the Enders PS2 games who prefer the darker tone of the rest of the franchise as compared to the more upbeat and humorous Dolores, i. If the former is what you're looking for, then you'd rather be watching ZOE: Idolo, but by doing so, you would also miss out on one of the most delightful and unique mecha series ever conceived.  Generally, mecha shows tend to fall into two categories: Boisterous and outrageous (think: TTGL) or grim and serious (think: Gundam). Dolores, i is one of the few series which doesn't quite fit into either. It has the lightheartedness of a super robot show and the realism of a real robot show without the utter absurdity or relentless angst that usually accompany them. In fact, Dolores, i subverts many of the typical cliches you would come to expect from a mecha show. There's no whiny teenage protagonist here; instead, you get James Links, a grizzled, middle-aged working class space trucker and the father of two fully grown working class children, who compose the rest of the main cast along with the the title character, Dolores. Dolores is the star of the show and may make or break the series for many people; she's a rosy pink mecha with the personality and naivete of a sheltered teenage girl, and yes, she talks. Her antics contribute to much of the humor of the show and her development as a character, while not particularly original (think: I, Robot) is still quaintly executed and ends up being surprisingly moving. This is bound to be too silly to some people, but it's a fresh idea in the series and is actually quite charming in practice.  While Dolores is a great character on her own, the rest of the main cast is just as excellent and is undoubtedly one of the best things about this show. The aforementioned James Links is a fresh of breath air, and is one of the most down to earth and sympathetic main characters I've ever seen in this genre. He's an everyman with a sense of humor, but also a man down on his luck, bordering on alcoholism and trying to keep the fracturing relationship between him and his children, Noel Links, an affable and tomboyish construction worker, and Leon Links, an image-conscious salaryman lacking self-assurance, intact, who blame him for their mother's death. His luck appears to get even worse when on a trucking job, he is framed for murder by space pirates attempting to steal his cargo. But when the cargo turns out to be an Orbital Frame (read: mecha) named Dolores, who holds a message for him coming from his long lost wife, Rachel, his goal in life shifts to finding the woman he presumed to be long dead, with his children going along with him being forced to by unfortunate circumstances. This journey takes them between all sorts of destinations in Earth and Mars, all while being chased as fugitives by police as well as a mysterious organization seeking to recapture Dolores and strengthening the bond between the main cast, whose internal struggles are relatable and whose growth as characters are soundly satisfying.  The plot isn't a work of genius, but it serves well as a vehicle to move the characters from scenario to scenario and manages to reach a thrilling climax and conclusion. The show moves at a perfect pace, never staying on any scene for too long and achieving a perfect balance between comedy, action and drama. The show has a charming and genuinely funny sense of humor without becoming too childish or absurd. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well enough, but aren't particularly outstanding. They get the job done, but make no mistake, this is not the show to watch if you're looking for pure action. Don't expect sterling production values, either. The animation and soundtrack are just about average, meaning they're nothing worth noting, but they're also not bad enough to be distracting. The animation is acceptable and the soundtrack is used appropriately without being memorable. The art fares similarly; it's unimpressive, but the character designs are still attractive and the mech designs are eye-catchingly sleek.  In conclusion, ZOE: Dolores, i is a fun, tongue-in-cheek mecha show with a heart and a sense of humor which isn't completely brain dead. It's a solid show from all angles and comes as an easy recommendation to anyone yearning for a good adventure romp. Very under appreciated series.";Recommended

Scenario : 7/10  A father wanders through space (and troubles) and involves his children inadvertently and tries to make peace with them, while trying to protect an Orbital Frame (yeah, a mecha) and to find his wife that was supposed to be deceased.  Art : 8/10  The anime is drawn in a realistic manner that didn't age at all. I really enjoyed it, no flashy colours, no exaggerated features, maybe lacking some emotions  Sound : 9/10  The OST is incredible. There are some really dark tracks and some epic combat tracks absolutely awesome. The ED is also really sad and beautiful although I didn't like the OP.  Chara : 8/10  Perfectly human reactions. Anger, Revenge, Pride, utter confusion, Joy, Sorrow, everything is depicted with utmost accuracy. This anime is a poem on human feelings.  Enjoyment : 8/10 which is the final grade i gave;Recommended
2;Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I;Keedoscoxy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Keedoscoxy;7;There shouldn't be any beating around the bush when it comes to ZOE. If you liked the games, watching this series and the OVA is highly recommended. It's a very good spin-off that fits nicely into the continuity and expands it's lore.  However, if you are unfamiliar with the games - it's just a solid adventure title. It involves characters that change and evolve, cool mecha action and the level of tragedy that will most likely leave you satisfied. Despite not being deeply dramatic/psychological as similar looking shows tend to try it's still original.  Also unlike some other adaptations done without regarding the newcomers ZOE Dolores doesn't require you to be familiar with the original source material. Everything is explained and some of the events even expand on the subject matter present in the games.  It's sort of a hidden gem. I really suggest you to check it out if you just want to have a good time.;Recommended
0;Zone of the Enders: 2167 Idolo;5hreddy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/5hreddy;7;Well, as the synopsis would imply, the story for Idolo occurs before the events of the ZOE game. If you've played any of the games you'll immediately recognise the main protagonists of the series, i.e that related to the development of Orbital Frames. Anyway on with the review:  Story (7/10): I gave the story a seven as I think it flows nicely but as you can imagine for a 55 min story, it does lack the breadth of a full movie. However, the story is believable and really gets into the emotions of the characters. It also lends some understanding to the background of Viola's character and you can get to see why Viola is so bitter in the ZOE game.  Art (6/10): Nothing particularly groundbreaking but does its job effectively enough.  Sound (8/10): The music shares most of the characteristics of the games in terms of style and fits in nicely with much of the action of the film.  Character (6/10): The characters develop quite well considering the length, but perhaps not quite enough to really get to the motivations of the characters.  Enjoyment (8/10): A quick astute dose of good quality anime, so I would say the enjoyment level was quite high.  Overall (7/10): If you're a fan of the ZOE game series then I would highly recommend this if you want to get the background into the origins of the Orbital Frame. Even if you've never the played the games, it's still a highly enjoyable OVA.;Recommended
0;Zombieland Saga Revenge;KANLen09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KANLen09;9;"Zombieland Saga is a show that you wouldn't think twice about girls that have passed away in one form or another, and then given the Jesus Christ ""resurrection on the Third Day"" treatment as zombies to save a land that's largely been purged and disappeared since time millenia...by being an idol show with much of the hysterity. And look how far we've come into the 2nd season of the show, dubbed ""Revenge"", because literally, it's that and much more.  With that said, GOOOOOOOODA MORNIN' ZOMBIES, LET'S BEAT THE LIVING **** OUTTA THE **** WACK TO SAVE OUR ****ING MOTHERLAND, SAGA! GODDAMMIT YOU FRIGGIN MAGGOTS!  To come back almost 2.5 years since Season 1 that slowly usurped the throne as the dark horse of Fall 2018, director Munehisa Sakai and his production team at MAPPA have been slowly concocting another marvellous follow-up season to continue where the story of SAGA is left behind with the epic bomb and failure that is the less-than-desirable 10,000-people concert crowd at the huge EFS stadium arena...and carry on IT DID. Other than the attention-grabbing promo poster of Kotarou along the seabed with his signature move, as is with kickstarting this year right with Season 2's main PV on January 1st, 2021 (in Japan), if you've watched Season 1 back in the day, you know that this series is anything but typical. And with the in-your-face ""Revenge"" theme being a centralized topic, this journey to exact revenge will be a tough one for the zombie girls of Franchouchou and their wack manager Kotarou (God I still LOVE Mamoru Miyano's voice).  As is of the story (or most appropriately character-driven) narrative of Zombieland Saga, each girl has their own story to tell, and since Season 1 covered the biker girl Saki, the Truck-kun-ed Sakura and the LGBT representative Lily's backstories, Season 2 tops that up with the rest of the girls that haven't had their backstories foretold...plus even down to Kotarou himself, and how and why Saga is a place that should be left preserved and brought back to its former glory: TO SAVE SAGA. Not gonna spoil anything, because secrets are the charm to this magnificent and tightly-paced show! This time, nothing was left untouched, and to that effect, Season 2 ups the ante of which Season 1 had already solidified its foundations with, and with a huge impact (just like how Kotarou becomes a cussing Eren *WHOOPS*). Franchouchou has largely stayed the same from Season 1, so you can easily expect a lot of the usual enjoyable and hilarious hijinks that this show has to offer up from these zombie girls that the general public hasn't caught onto them being legit zombies (close, but not close enough). This is a family bond so strong that as time passes, SAGA becomes all the more important, more than just an ingrained dream for the girls of Franchouchou and wacky Kotarou to see the light of day in saving SAGA. Glory, glory to SAGA!  Everything else is what you should expect and more coming out of Season 1: from story and characters (that are given a HUGE upgrade), and even right down to the visuals and music, which are still the *chef's kiss* excellente pairing of Franchouchou songs with MAPPA's constant and consistent greatness. While the OST this time isn't as bedazzling and bombarding as the prequel, it's still great to hear the comeback of this fully zombie girls idol group that immediately raises nostalgia for how much time has passed since then.  BLOODY HELL, if you made it all the way through this review, I should raise the question: ""Have you watched Season 1? If not, then WHY THE **** are you reading this review!? Go back to Season 1, finish that, then come back here to experience somemore, you friggin' maggot!""  This is one fine outstanding sequel in the world of zombie girls and idol music of a big-brain mish-mash-ing potato.";Recommended
1;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Marinate1016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marinate1016;10;The highly anticipated sequel to Zombieland Saga not only lived up to the hype, it exceeded all expectations. Cementing itself among the best idol series in recent memory.  The original Zombieland saga made waves with its unique ensemble premise and cast, promotion of a somewhat unknown area(to foreigners) of Japan, and incredibly well executed humour. Season 2 does a great job of building upon the already established characters. As with any idol series, Zombieland Saga Revenge dedicates several episodes to each character’s development, bringing us even closer to the girls we know and love. In contrast with season 1, however, Revenge takes a darker approach to storytelling. While there are definitely still plenty of hilarious moments throughout, there’s much more of a focus on genuine serious issues this time around. Several episodes had me genuinely in my feelings because of how well they were pulled off, particularly Saki, Junko and Ai’s backstories. While we got introduced to all the girls in season 1, we didn’t really get a whole lot of development. Season 2 solves that issue and by the end, you can’t help but feel that you’ve been right there along with the girls.  The more mature story combined with good old humour and ridiculousness we’ve come to expect from Zombieland Saga, made Revenge an absolute blast to watch. As with any idol show, however, it’ll be judged on the quality of the music produced. I personally think Franchuchu’s music this time around was even better than season 1. I would’ve liked for the girls to get some more solo songs a la love live, but the group performances and finale were phenomenal.  The CGI for the performances was about what you’d expect from an idol show. Definitely noticeable, but didn’t negate my experience overall. For the rest of the series, you’ve got the usual MAPPA quality art and animation.  Overall, Zombieland Saga Revenge takes everything that made season one such a fun and unique time, and improves it by adding a more mature story, improved character dynamics and development as well as offering a satisfactory conclusion to the cast’s story arc. While I’m not sure if we’ll get more of these girls in the future, I definitely think Zombieland Saga has the potential to expand into a legitimate idol project with a wide variety of cast members. Only time will tell.  Zombieland Saga Revenge gets 10 Mics out of 10.;Recommended
2;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;This review contains some spoilers.  If you were around during Anime Expo back in 2018, then you might remember a strange franchise introduced to the world. It's Zombieland Saga, and at the time, most of us didn't know what it was. The producers and staff were very secretive about the project until it's revelation. And that is...Zombieland Saga is comedic horror anime about idols. Flash a year later and we got announcement of the sequel. Now here we are in 2021 with the return of zombie idols who takes...revenge?  No, that's not quite right. If you remember this show for what it was at all, then you'll know that Zombieland Saga isn't your typical horror. Or in fact, this is hardly horror at at all given the lighthearted context. Franchouchou, the iconic idol group, returns again with its familiar cast and is still a sensation. Why? That's because these girls have shown that even as zombies, they are a talented group. Organized by their ultra flameboyant producer, Zombieland Saga knew what it wanted to show us.  Let's start and say that even after the 2 year break, the sequel still retains a vibrant energy with the colorful personalities of the cast. From Sakura to Saki, or the famous Tae Yamada, every single member of Franchouchou is an important part of the group. Unfortunately, their group has a rocky start at the beginning of the sequel. They have a debt and even Kotaro, their producer has lost hope to regain their former glory. It isn't until a series of events that convinces him to reorganize and give the idols a chance at their careers. Speaking of which, these idols are no longer the newbies we've known before. They have professional experience now but the sequel also explores some of their personal issues. This includes but not limited to Saki dealing with a relationship, Junko's insecurities, or Lily struggling to maintain her idol image. While this anime throws common sense out the window, some of these personal issues can be relatable in real life. In a more lighthearted way, this sequel shows that being an idol always has its challenges, both for its individual members or the group as a whole. And let's not mention, financial issue remained a major problem until Tae Yamada made the save.  Despite the seemingly recurring elements and cartoonish comedy, Zombieland Saga Revenge contains a short arc that stands out differently than any other episodes in the franchise. The Saga Incident (episodes 8-9) throws the characters into the Meiji Era as it explores the life of Yugiri. Not only do we get to see her character origins but also learn about the ancestry of various character altogether. The arc was memorable for its time setting but also with how it presented itself. You'll have to see it for yourself but let's just say that the Saga Incident can make us really understand Yugiri for who she is. Indeed, Zombieland Saga has always been about showcasing its cast without leaving everyone in the dark. It always remembers that Franchouchou is about more than just the group.  Like the previous season, Zombieland Saga Revenge doesn't hold back with its comedy and humor. After all, this is advertised as a comedic horror show with elements of idol performance and drama. Watching this sequel reminds me to enjoy the overall popcorn entertainment just like the first season. With our colorful cast, there's an immense amount of character chemistry with everyone. Thanks to the personalities of certain characters such as Tae Yamada, you'll rarely run out of moments without laughter. In essence, this sequel proved itself to be able to do what it's best at: entertain.  Are you entertained? That's for me to know and you to find out. But as a fan of the first season, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Zombieland Saga Revenge is worth waiting for. Franchouchou is here and isn't holding back again to show the talents of its cast. With every episode, we see the way this show entertain us just as it once did before. Bless MAPPA for creating this franchise because the anime industry needs more zombie idols.;Recommended
3;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Creissonino;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Creissonino;9;Zombieland Saga is not about Zombies. Zombieland Saga is not about moe. Zombieland Saga is not about idols. Zombieland Saga is not about music. Zombieland Saga is not (only) about selling merchandise.  Zombieland Saga is about gentrification, persistence of historical memory and a very light touch of Sentai (you can see all the archetypes there). It's about people doing good together and how we're strong when we're united, being able to face and defeat all adversities in our paths. It's about love, any kind of love. It's about believing in other people.  Zombieland Saga is the food you love, but hate all its ingredients.  Watch it, please.;Recommended
4;Zombieland Saga Revenge;SanaeK10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SanaeK10;7;"From its humble beginnings as a bunch of losers trying to get some attention from a street to becoming the biggest idols of the prefecture, Franchouchou certainly has been through a lot to reach where they are. Now that the novelty from S1 has worn off, how does S2 fare without threading the same ground?  Fairly well actually. It satisfyingly resolves a lot of the foreshadowing a buildup from S1 regarding Joufuku, as well as give neglected members Yuugiri and Tae their own special spotlight episodes. You'd never expect a prefecture-shilling idol anime to have some decent lore, let alone actual payoff for teasing that from the first season, but S2 delivers and then some. Even up to justifying the very name of the series, ""Zombieland"", for Saga itself is a zombie.  Character wise there's not much in terms of development since S1 has already exhausted most of the cast apart from Yuugiri. Kotaro is still by far the best character and the supporting pillar of the whole show, and his antics never tire me. S2 focuses instead more on Saga's denizens and their interactions with Franchouchou, be it individual members or as a group. Some scenarios prove quite fun, like a fakeout new member or exploring Reporter-kun's attempts to expose the zombies, but the status quo being what it is, it all resets to the team being more or less the same at the end of each episode.  The plot has never been a focal point of the series, or for many other idol anime in fact, but it does attempt to do something different from S1 and does swerve in some interesting directions. The comedy feels like it has been improved, and unlike S1 there are no real down times or moments dragged out by needless drama. There aren't any weak episodes to sour the experience, and that's a marked improvement over the first season's weak Junko/Ai episodes. I do wish Kotaro's and Sakura's relationship would be given more focus, but hey, they gotta save something for the inevitable S3 I suppose. And speaking of S3, what the fuck was that ending. (old) Gainax would be proud.  I suppose one of the bigger disappointments for me would be the song selection, especially compared to S1's stellar vocal collection. It's not a good thing in your group idol show that the best songs are 3 solos, one by White Ryu, one by Junko, and the other by Kotaro of all people. Seriously, these 3 songs are the only ones that, for me, either match or excel the previous season's in quality, with the rest being mostly just okay. Nothing particularly bad mind you, just unmemorable. I mean, they even reused Mezame Return a few times in this! The OP's a ton of fun though.  For better for worse, it's still more ZLS. The humor is still strong, the characters still lovable, and man, they better pay off that ending come S3.  7/10";Recommended
5;Zombieland Saga Revenge;ThatOneGG06;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatOneGG06;9;(this is a review of both Zombieland saga and revenge as I watched both very close to each other)  I came to Zombieland Saga because I heard it had some trans rep in Lily (number 6) and as a trans woman I want more of that in my shows and media that I am consuming. What I got was meh trans rep and a new show to add to the list of my favorite anime. This is first and foremost an idol show, think K-on, every single plot point and character arc is related to the fact they are idols. because you know thats what the show is about I am going to shift this review to be about Lily and the trans rep in her because that is a very specific part of the show I came to it for and that I am sure other people like me will as well. Lily is a kind of representation where by her words and by the story she is trans but it doesn't really effect her character in any meaningful way. because her character is so young we never see her deal with her dysphoria in a major way (the one time it is addressed its sort of treated as a joke, but not really I cant really tell the tone of the scene). And outside of her one episode in season one the fact she is trans is never brought up again. Don't take this wrong Lily is awesome, her episode in revenge is one of my favorite episodes in the show. It really lets her shine, unfortunately she gets noticeably less lines then a lot of the other cast, she is a character I desperately want more from but they way they have written her so far is disappointing in that I font think there is much else to get from her transness. I hope the movie and any possible future seasons proves me wrong with this (I have not read any manga or other material that this might be based on so i font know if this is the end or not, from the show it doesn't feel like it wants to end yet but who knows.);Recommended

The show is hilarious, it has quality music and has a subjectively good story line.  The anime which are categorized as ""original"" are on a roll this year.

7;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Shinkuo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shinkuo;10;"If you are reading this chances are you either either looking for validation for your own feelings about the show or are looking for reasons to continue after Season 1.  Either way I will give you what you want--- this show is easily one of the best shows I have seen in the last half a decade, including Attack on Titan.  Where to start, there is so much right about this show that summarizing it in a relatively short review is fairly difficult. Zombieland Saga: Revenge builds upon the foundation of the 1st season and makes everything significantly better.  From the characters to the music to the visuals, you can tell every little detail of this show has been finely tuned and detailed to the point where subsequent watches will let you notice other smaller details and tidbits you didn't notice before. For example, in one scene when all of the characters are leaving the house you can spot the main character peaking her head out of the front gate and checking both ways on the street before leaving because in Season 1 she was hit by a truck after running out of the house without looking. This is such an insignificant detail, but the fact that they are willing to put this little bit of characterization into an short 3 second scene just goes to show the level they will go to for detail.  Even considering how there are only 24 episodes thus far in the series, the characters and world are so well fleshed out that is hard to believe that this is an original anime with no source material. Little idiosyncracies that even minor characters have are consistent and have relevance to the story or lore in some way that it is impressive they were able to Chekhov's gun in so many details without bloating the visuals or stories.  Going a layer deeper too, yes it has all of the bells and whistles of a typical idol show, but considering that the characters are all dead it poses thoughts, questions and answers on a level that are slightly different from your typical ""work hard and you'll be rewarded"" message these kinds of shows tend to convey. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but with all of them being dead the struggle of them becoming idols has more weight because realistically if they don't become idols, what do they become? Without overtly stating it... too much, the show conveys that if they don't achieve their goals they become what they actually are: zombies. I feel like it is conveying to its audience that if you give up on what matters to you, even if you have life you are a zombie only existing for the sake of existing, and considering many people spent the last 2 years in COVID times doing just this, this sentiment resonates even more. This show essentially says that life is meant to be used existing for what you want to become, and trying to figure that out is a blessing for those who are able to do so. Then it also posits just motivation and enthusiasm aren't enough to be successful, and that even if things are going well, what is required to make a change, an impact, and be successful is to put the time, thought, and care in to prepare and ensure it works out.  I could keep going on about how cool the themes of the show are, both musical and other, but I would be rambling more than I already have. This show resonates in a way that is rare and more weighty than what should be possible for a trashy idol show, and quite frankly whether you watch this show with your brain on or off, it is a really good time. It just oozes character, love, and care from the people who produced it, yet at the same time I can fully believe it is just a paid ad to get more people to visit and move to the Saga prefecture.  I cannot recommend this show more than I already have; And quite frankly I hope in the future we get more original animes that are of this quality and caliber.";Recommended
8;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Edenharley;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Edenharley;10;It's safe to say that Zombieland Saga Revenge absolutely blew season 1 out of the water. The art, animation, soundtrack, character moments just EVERYTHING was such an improvement - considering season 1 was so good this is truly a feat. Really just everything about this season was fantastic, I'll get into specifics later but this season really knew when to be serious and when not to be - some moments I'd be dying with laughter, others tensed up on the edge of my seat and others damn near crying, it was such a rollercoaster in the best way possible.  First of all I want to talk about the soundtrack, my god did this season have some FANTASTIC music. The OP itself is already one of my favourites in recent memory, and on a slight tangent probably my all time favourite in terms of animation. I've really never seen another OP like it, I actually can't find any flaws it's just so perfectly arranged. But anyway pretty much every song in this show stood out to me, the VAs put so much effort into singing them and you can really tell, they also thematically fit so perfectly and are overall just very very well written songs.  The art and animation this season was really quite incredible, my own and a lot of other people's main issue with the last season was the CGI of the characters performing on stage, but this season improves this by an insane margin - the CGI actually looks really good now. The art as well in general is really pretty, I really like how the girls all look a bit more zombie-like and overall how they're redrawn.  This season features some REALLY great side characters too aside from our ever-amazing main cast, there is really never a dull moment and each side character introduced even if just for an episode is always a ton of fun. Back to the main cast though, each girl has a decent amount of focus this season and it's great to see how far they've all come since the start of season 1. I also have to mention Koutarou the man himself, he has some BRILLIANT moments this season - not only in terms of comedy (at which he is better than ever) but also in some serious and really quite heavy-hitting scenes which honestly made me really view his character differently, without spoiling anything it was eye opening to see how much effort he's actually putting in and how much he cares.  Overall Zombieland Saga Revenge is a near perfect sequel that absolutely improves upon the first already brilliant season in just about every aspect, upholding the franchise's ever-amazing comedy but also introducing some really introspective moments with the main cast and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack. Absolute must watch if you've seen season 1 - which I also highly recommend.;Recommended
9;Zombieland Saga Revenge;CyberXane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CyberXane;9;Should you watch this?: Sure, the second season has very interesting plot points an progresses very well. I'd even say it's a show to at least watch once or more if you want.  Story: Well without giving away much of the later stuff. At first it could be kinda confusing on where it left off, but quickly tells you what happened. Throughout the season you see multiple situation that actually slowly add to the grander story which makes it that much more likable. And trust me when I say making it to the episodes around the end of the season has been worth it as the story is very interesting, and kinda gets you on your toes a bit.  Art: I love the art style. Fitted for an idol anime. I feel that CGI catches me off guard. Maybe it's me but it's a little weird, as in it doesn't seem to fit. But there are times when it's implemented well  Sound: Can Jam to all of their songs even the op and Ed lol. Though that shikadebopbop or whatever is probably the only song that didn't really sound right. But other than that the music is great.  Character: The majority of the idols all have a purpose to play, and tells their story well. They all have their backgrounds and all are important role to play.  Enjoyment: The story has definitely made me come back time and time again, though to be honest some idol performances felt like they were just put in there just because they wanted it at the end of the episode when it didn't really have a purpose. Other than that I really enjoyed Zombie land Saga. Seems like a possible season 3 could be happening.  Overall: I'd give it like a 8.5 because the way everything is put into place from the story telling, to catchy tunes, and more. It ended up worth watching.;Recommended
10;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Reviewholic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Reviewholic;10;I'm sorry I'm illiterate. I love Zombieland Saga very much. The absurd chaotic storyline, the good ol' friendly setting of Saga that warms my heart, the overdramatic voice acting, the overly optimistic and unstable attitude of the zombie girls, their amazing songs, everything. Zombieland Saga (including Revenge) for me is hard to review, it's a mixed bag of candy that contains too many good stuff that clouds my judgement, and even if I do get a hard cringe from a lot of its childish and forced moments, they were still meant to be pleasant or inspiring, and I am willing to forgive and accept those cringe. Because of how irrational I forgive those flaws, I think it's pointless for me to review the whole anime properly. Revenge is a huge step up in terms of quality. The art and animation are so much better now. The dancing and expressions are more natural and detailed. The promotional artworks are beautiful too. It really does feel like Franchouchou made it as top idol, makes me happy as a fan. I'm Reviewholic, I am illiterate due to yesterday's brain damage, and I love #4.;Recommended
11;Zombieland Saga Revenge;PixelB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PixelB;7;"Zombieland Saga is the only idol group anime I like. True, I don't particularly like idol group anime at all honestly, but I've given a few a shot. Idoly pride, Love live, Show by Rock, 22/7, and a few others. But, most of them run into a problem. Compared to the traditional music genre shows where it's just focused on a single band with <4 members like Beck for example, Idol groups tend to be humungous. Like, 5 or more, and Zombieland Saga is no different. As such, it's practically impossible to go from a grassroots idol group with 5+ people and have characterization for all of these idol members as well as have relevant plot of them struggling to improve and succeed. Either, the idol members just magically improve with some crappy training montages, or they're already Mary Sues and climb to stardom without any failure. There's a constant lack of any realistic character development or plot.  Well, Zombieland Saga, despite it's ridiculous but also extremely unique premise, manages to cram good character design and relevant plot into a 1 season series, and continue off that momentum into season 2. Come on, zombies becoming an idol group? Plus, I really like how this premise is not just a gimmick. It gets mentioned constantly, and it's always relevant to the plot. Zero never gaining human consciousness and staying as a zombie really makes this plot premise solidified as a core part of the story rather than just a unique starting point. Of course, the character development also is extremely relevant to the zombies. While other idol group shows fail to have any meaningful connections to the viewers, there are clear connections that are easily made in Zombieland Saga since well, these are all young girls that died at an early age. Clearly, they must have regrets, and Zombieland Saga plays off that theme very well. In season 1, each arc is essentially each idol group character facing their past and moving forward to becoming idols. Not only does this show realistic character development, it also shows their backstories in a good way, rather than just some stupid insertion of a series of flashbacks that shows LOVE to do when they have no real method of fleshing out a character. Of course, there's always some sort of song that they sing related to their past, and it's cleverly done. Zombieland Saga also excels in plot development, at least in season 1. Franchouchou clearly has a unique array of characters, each with their own types of skillsets and abilities that make them either a complete newbie to singing and dancing, or a veteran. However, despite the skill disparity, Franchouchou is still a grassroots idol group that are trying to make it big, and it's clearly seen in the publicity that they try to generate, whether it be advertisement campaigns or doing competitions that gets their clothes dirty. They also get their taste of bitter defeat a few times as well. Of course, while there are quite a few times where members of the group get torn up inside because they don't know if they can make it mentally, there does not seem to ever be a roadblock that they seem to face in terms of coordination, singing ability, lyric writing, or dancing choreography. The fact that Franchouchou is not up to top idol standard is a clear theme in both seasons, yet you never actually see any ways the group get together to get better at a certain skill, or have trouble making songs. They kind of just ""train in the background"" and gradually get better. Zombieland Saga manages to capture the grassroots vibe as well as manages to incorporate good characters, but fails to really show any of the training portion of the group, which I have to imagine is due to time constraints, which is sad. Another thing to really note is that the dancing is mostly done in CGI. Ew...gross. It's anime CGi we're talking here, so it's obviously bad. Season 2 definitely is a visible improvement from season 1, but we're talking a 3$ budget for the dancing rather than a 1$ budget. There's definitely a few scenes where 2D and CGI converge to make for a decent performance, but more often than not, it's a clear let down. It's sad, considering how there are really bad shows that have surprisingly average or even just good animation, and yet, something like Zombieland Saga gets zero budget. I mean, 22/7 actually looks well animated. Sad. When the singing and dancing portion of Zombieland Saga is the least thrilling and also the time where I'm glancing at my phone, you know that's a problem. Of course, the songs themselves are not super great. There are a few songs that are nice and all, but most of them are below average. The last problem I have with Zombieland Saga is some parts of season 2. Mainly really, just 3 episodes covering Maimai and TYuguri's backstory. These three episodes take everything good about Zombieland Saga and throw it out the window. For example, the episodes focused on Zero and Liliy are quite nice. They highlight character traits in a meaningful way while also having them develop themselves as idols. Maimai's episode is a disaster. This completely new character gets introduced and there's no investment or attachment at all to this character. Just like other idol group shows, Maimai is kind of just shoved in as a new character and viewers are expected to care about her all the sudden when there's nothing interesting about her and she starts from a beginning to practiced enough to lead a performance in the spa n of a single episodes. It's quite clear that this episode is filler though, but it's just so bad. Same thing with Yuguri's arc. While it's nice and all to have a sort of reason why the idol group was able to turn into zombies, it was wholly unnecessary. Having a complete genre change and blast into the past about some boring rebellion in Saga with of course, Yuguri being near the center of it is a complete waste of two episodes. Did you think viewers actually cared about the ""origin story"" of the zombies? Hell no. We care more about Tatsumi, which of course, does not have much of his past shown. I do have to give credit for the last arc. It was not particularly amazing, but it wrapped up the show in a nice conclusion. So yes, Zombieland Saga is enjoyable, but has a decent host of flaws as well. I haven't mentioned either how convenient the opportunities the group gets, like the radio show, but I think that's to be expected from a show about idols going from nothing to popular idols";Recommended
12;Zombieland Saga Revenge;AN_IME_lovers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AN_IME_lovers;10;I think this is the best idol anime. I've never liked idol anime before except Zombieland Zaga revenge. In terms of story, this anime has a good story. Even the story in the Zombieland Zaga Revenge anime, in my opinion, is better than the previous season. Because in this anime all past idols have been explained and I was made curious about Kotaro's past and the ufo that appears at the last second. For the opening song and ending theme in this anime, I really like it because it has a song that is pleasant to hear and has very colorful and stunning animations. I think the songs in this anime are better than the previous season. I hope this anime still has a third season. There is no better idol anime than ZOMBIELAND SAGA!!!!!!;Recommended
13;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Zorgy211;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zorgy211;10;10 OUT OF 10, season2 is as great as i hoped, the closer looks into the girls relationship is great, and especially ep 4 is so greatttt the relationship between Ai chan and Junko made me tear up, and the singing part is amazing in ep 4, overall i rate this show 10/10 and now im just waiting for a season 3 right now, i rate it and i recommend this to all those who haven't made up their mind to watch or not, ah even if you're not an idol fan like me you'll still feel really fulfilled watching this show it's a guranteed heartwarmer;Recommended
14;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Mic7ch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mic7ch;9;A newbie here! If you're looking for a serious review put less consideration into mine! The story left off at the end of season one was picked up but with a little time-skip which is very understandable and in this season we get to see a character's lore which we didn't see for the last season. Unfortunately, it kinda ended with a cliffhanger and left us waiting for season 3 Art increased since the last season and many in the fandom would agree dance scenes got even smoother! The sound is improved over time and the songs have landed a spot in my playlist, so far my favourite is 50 and 4 Things Left Behind. We inherit the same cast from season 1 which didn't disappoint further character development with additions of special guest characters that further improve the current's cast story. I watched the 2 seasons back to back and it felt connected and this season had many references to the last season which further improved continuity making it feel like a single season. safe to say I enjoyed this one Overall recommend continuing if you're watching season 2 you're likely to be a person who watched season 1 and if you liked it this won't disappoint.;Recommended
15;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Yuri_NakamuraAB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yuri_NakamuraAB;10;Well where to start? This review is for those who have watched Season 1 aswell so if you have not then GET THE **** OUT OF HERE AND WATCH IT! you will not regret it. (slight spoilers ahead) (and grammar nazis stay out)  Now to start with, the franchucise (yes i went there) that i hope this becomes becuase i seriusly hope this gets another season (i think its gettting a movie at least judging from hints on twitter and that ending which i wont spoil) This franchicise is probably among the top 10 animes released in recent years in my opinion, its charming and cute it has great sound and music and amazing character development and stories just look at Yugiri's episodes in this season.  The pace of this season is a little bit faster but also slower at the same time compared to last season, i really did enjoy the Tae focused episode it was so funny and also the little scare with Mr reporter at the end there.  The sound of this show is just on par with great musical works like Hibike Euphonium from KyoAni and also in terms of impact like A silent Voice (look at season 1 for that, in the Lily focused episode i cried during that one) The music is catchy and works great with the characters and i absolutley LOVE the way they take many diffrent genres of music instead of doing what other Idol shows do (looking at you Love live) where they go for the cutsey or general Jpop vibe to the music, here we get everything from Rap, rock, pop and classical with a modern twist or modern witha classical twist if i may (Yugiri's song). my favorite songs from this season are Gekkou Survive (junkos rock song) and 50と4つの忘れ物 (50 and 4 things left behind) which i REALLY hope they release a full version of because my god Junkos voice is angelic! regardless of aht music she sings (case and point the rock song she plays XD)  Something i am kind of annoyed at is only getting a small glimps of kotaros backstory/reaction to how his love interest Sakura died (yes not sure if its confirmed that he was in love with her but i do remember it mentioned somewhere and like come on? it should be obvious!)  Now alstly the overall artstyle is deffinantly the best to come out in recent years and that goes for all anime in the last 7 or 8 years it mixes glum and dull colours with very bright and cheeary ones so well its hard to believe this is an Idol anime at all the CGI is noticable yes but it is mixed in so well it is not a problem at all its tastefull not horrible like the second season of Bang dream (a full on CGI anime is just kinda weird to me) well tobe fair the second season of bang dream isnt unwatchable at all its just weird. But overall the artstyle is amazing and again on par with KyoAni work.  My overall rating of this show is a solid 10/10 but honestly id rate it higher if i could.;Recommended
16;Zombieland Saga Revenge;TheJoedanimal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheJoedanimal;7;"Zombieland Saga, although obviously not particularly long lived, has a bit of a special place for me. Having only gotten into anime much a couple of years ago, Zombieland Saga S1 was the first show I watched as it was premiering, and it was a wonderful time. Obviously not perfect, as that's about a 7-8/10 for me, but it was wildly entertaining and different, an audacious concept with solid emotional grounding and good characters. As such, ever since then ZLSR has been one of my most anticipated watches. Does it meet the hype then? Well.... yes and no. ZLSR has a problem kinda integral to its run, that being its structure. The whole show is based on a revenge show. Revenge for what? A concert that we don't get to see till the last half of the season, was never alluded to happening in S1, and ultimately feels a bit manufactured to produce a finale. In fact, while I appreciate a lot of the legwork that went into Revenge to produce the finale show, it doesn't come off to me as genuine as much of the work in S1 does, it feels like its placed there specifically for the result, rather than the progression of the girls and their status as idols. Not to get ahead of myself (and there's certainly something to get ahead when it comes to the end), but the lengths they go to to produce a big time finale end up making the overall goal of ""revenge"" a bit trite and contrived, given the gravity of the situation at that point for Saga as a whole. But I digress, ZLS is about wacky zombie idol antics, and ZLSR mostly delivers on that front.  Story: 5  ZLS is built on the strength of its concept, and honestly as a whole it could be described as a sort of revenge. The first series relied heavily on its character backstories, and set the tone for a sort of cosmic misfortune that the girls, and consequently the prefecture, would overcome. ZLSR undercuts that from the very get go with its basic premise, the off screen disaster that resets Franchouchou's finances, popularity, and status. Which then sets up some fine episodes to claw their way back into the hearts of the populace, and earn respect from their rivals, but at the end of the day its not a necessary development. Furthermore, to make the decision to show the full context only in the final few episodes, to create a final arc feels very strange, and honestly even when watching it it took a few minutes to fully understand that the concert sequence was a flashback and not another failure at the same venue. Past the overall structure, ZLSR also gives Yuugiri her long awaited backstory arc. And..... its the worst one. I'm not the biggest Yuugiri stan, but this was also just a very strange decision, we don't get to see Yuugiri's rise into becoming a legendary courtesan, at the time of the flashback she is already what we know her as. Hell, she's not even the main character in her own backstory, the proto-Producer is. The tone is even all out of wack for that arc, they try to go hyper dramatic against the standard ZLS audacity, and it really doesn't work. For all the good that the story does, I feel like it pretty consistently treads water, and the overall conflict just isn't natural.  Art: 8  ZLS always had good character designs, and that doesn't change here. The most marked change is the improvement on the idol show 3D, and it looks quite good. As far as I know that is the biggest thing that put people off from S1, and its really no longer an issue. Past that, there aren't a ton of new characters, but if I did have a problem, it would be that Maimai is just Sakurai 2.0.  Sound: 8  If you're into an idol show, you gotta be down with the music. ZLS is no different, and the music is great. There are new songs performed, old favorites finally given light in the show, and its all great stuff, I would even argue saga jihen at the end of the Yuugiri arc saved that whole episode. The only real out of the box performances are Lily's broadway remix and the rock concert, and those are great as well.  Character: 8  The groundwork has already been set, and while there isn't particularly much development on top of it, its pretty nice. Tae is always my favorite part of the series, and while bringing her up in terms of character development is a bit backwards, as she's a bit of an anti character, her spotlight episode actually retroactively saves Saki's entire backstory from S1. There isn't much development on the grounds that, y'know, the girls are zombies, but one of the early episodes actually produces a really strong development for Saki on the grounds that she is a zombie, and can no longer follow her own idols as she did in life. Again, I'd say Maimai is a downside, as she's really just a tool to help engineer the finale, but most everywhere else is pretty strong. If you liked the crew before, you'll like them again, they're as charming as usual.  Enjoyment: 7  The good thing about ZLS is that at its core its just a really good time, whenever its following its formula. The problem is, I feel like it doesn't follow it enough this season. I wanted more antics, more goofy Tae moments, more ridiculous Tatsumi monologues, but they're really all just clumped into the middle of the season. But nevertheless, ZLSR does produce the goods. Whenever it goes into a performance after a long, dramatic episode, its enough to lift my spirits and get excited for the next. The OP is a bop, although maybe not as much as S1's, and the performances are more hype now than ever, now that you don't have to get over some visual discomfort. There's always much to like in Zombieland Saga.  So to cap off, there is another point of order to talk about, but to what extent I don't know. There is a lore to Zombieland Saga, bread crumbs to the mystical nature of zombie idols, the calamity that Franchouchou is there to quell, the pre-death connections between the girls and Tatsumi. Its a slow drip, but an interesting one. Circumstantially. The ending ending may have blown all of that out of proportion, but I can't really determine how much I need to reevaluate the show through the lens of 5 second long post credits scene. But in any case.......... I don't know what to think there. To keep things grounded, ZLSR is fun. I'm not sure its as good as season 1, and it introduces problems it doesn't need to, but at the same time it does not mess with its winning formula. If you liked seeing zombie idols fight through adversity and struggle to break into the big time idol scene while hiding their identity in Season 1, not only will you enjoy Revenge, but you'll probably get some closure in it. But if you're hoping the series would really kick it up a notch, other than on scale of idoldom, I'm not sure you'll be satisfied.";Recommended
17;Zombieland Saga Revenge;undamoth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/undamoth;9;I was openly critical of the first season of Zombieland Saga, citing the second half to have been too dramatic in comparison to the zany first half which i felt jarring especially after the masterpiece of Season 1's fifth episode. It is very important ofcourse and Sakura's story was good though i felt it could have been done better. Likewise my strongest complaint was the use of 3d animation during the idol scenes which looked unpleasant because of their lower framerate and stiff limbs. I was hesitant to go to season 2 because of it. To my surprise, my issues were actually addressed and were essentially obliterated and i believe that Zombieland Saga Revenge is one of the very best sequel season to ever exist in anime.  The story this time around was ironed better, with its comedic and dramatic bits better and evenly scattered throughout its runtime and it felt natural compared to the prior season. The title's 'revenge' is later on elaborated and comes to a satisfying resolution. I have watched season 2 twice already and i say, it was even better the second time. Seriously, with a better mix of drama and comedy, this season is so good.  The fear of the 3D idols are now gone. MAPPA apparently honed and perfected their 3D skills now and it shows. There are no more stiff movements, the characters now show actual expressions while dancing, and they genuinely feel like a group in their performances. All around improvements in terms of art.  The songs are much better as well. Yugiri's jazzy song, Saki's glamourous biker-era serenade, Sakura's revenge song, and the finale song are genuinely great J-music and worth putting in your library. The opening is unskippable and very fun to listen to. The downside is that i think the ED is less memorable than season 1's graduationesque somber song. Voice work remains amazing, with special attention to Kotaro and Saki's actors.  Most importantly, the cast are now equally well-developed, with special props to Yugiri who overtook Lily's backstory as my favorite. I shit you not, i could watch a full season of Yugiri's story. Despite Saki being my favorite of the group, i still think that her death was kinda stupid and avoidable and her episode this season, despite being good, was the weakest in my opinion. Sakura is back as her lovable self, Tae having an episode dedicated for her, and the ever bold Kotaro having a shine in the spotlight as well. The writers have done a great job in showing love to the series and they should get a raise. With that in mind, I did feel that Saki got the short end of the stick again though she still remains my favorite, alongside Yugiri. There are still questions that remained unanswered, notably due to that stinger at the very end of the season which was a massive wtf which kinda lowered my opinion of the show but the season was nothing short of great. It was strong in the beginning, the middle and a great half-episode climax that even referenced Queen.  Zombieland Saga is my favorite for 2021 currently just because of how well done it was. So if you find season 1 lacking, season 2 improved just about everything. This was such a redemption, and a revenge for season 1's criticisms. More heart, more love, more music from the grave.  Watch first season and prepare for some incongruent CG for that one, then cleanse your eyes with the graphical improvements of season 2.;Recommended
18;Zombieland Saga Revenge;KeelaKween23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KeelaKween23;9;"Whew... what an entertaining show. If you left the first season feeling kind of like, ""Oh, it was alright,"" then prepare to be satisfied in this season.  I don't watch many idol anime, if at all... I'm not even sure if you call this series an idol anime, but basically, it's one of those shows starring cute girls (or zombie-girls) doing cute girl (zombie-girl) things. It was entertaining and funny to watch. The plot would go up and down and sideways and I just had no clue where the story was going at some points, but I still enjoyed the story that was packed into each episode regardless of how irrelevant or 'filler-esque' it might have been. Don't even get me started on the Yugiri backstory episodes... it had almost nothing to do with the overall story of this season, but damn, I loved watching those episodes.  If you did watch the first season, you already know this doesn't have your typical character development. The character personalities do develop still, it's just somewhat forgettable and only important for like, maybe an episode, but then the story quickly moves along. It's not my favorite and the only saving grace is just the fact that the show is still somehow funny and enjoyable.  The music is pretty good too, especially the opening... what a bop... I will never get used to the characters suddenly going to CG whenever they sing on stage though. Yes... that still happens in this season... just focus on the song and you can look past the uncanniness of their bodies. Unless you watched RWBY so therefore it doesn't bother you...  So if you like idols, (cute) zombies, some good music, and an entertaining story (or if you finished season one and are continuing along)... then this anime is a watch for you.";Recommended
19;Zombieland Saga Revenge;annie_hinamori;https://myanimelist.net/profile/annie_hinamori;9;I didn't made a review for Zombieland Saga first season but I feel like the second season is necessary. Just to save you time, I put it an 8, but for this season they took what they had and made it even better.  Story 9/10 In the first season we had more of a slice of life episodes, sometimes having a more serious/emotional backstory of the the majority of girls, but since we established their characters and the humour of the anime in the last season, this season focused more on a concrete backstory. The scenes of this season were more emotional and heartwarming but still had the comedic/random scenes thanks to Koutaro. Zombieland Saga didn't lost their touch but expanded it and made it better.  Art 7.5/10 Pretty much the same as last season but we had some very beautiful scenes in certain episodes, so it got a little better.  Sound 8/10 The opening AGAIN a banger and the ending was really cute, besides that, the instrumentals are pretty nice, reminiscing past songs and obviously a piano version for the opening.  Characters 8/10 We got new development from characters we didn't got a chance to learn about (Yuugiri, Koutaro) and more development for already developed characters (Sakura, Saki, Junko, Lily, Ai).  Enjoyment 10/10 I really loved this second season, the first one was good but this played with my feels an now is my favorite anime ever. I have high expectations for the third season (which I hope we get xd)  Overall 9/10 Obviously if you watched the second season you like the first season but would recommend to continue watching.;Recommended
0;Zombieland Saga Revenge;ren0080;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ren0080;5;Alright, so to start with, I like Zombieland Saga's 1st season as much as the next guy. So I had high expectations from the 2nd season... which unfortunately never met after watching this second season. The 1st season, although it's very low quality with it's animation, had the heart and soul without stooping as low as copying the generic idol-anime formula. It had the general theme of being able to do the regrets that people had when they died. It was a great premise that was executed very well. But what does the second season did that I didn't like? Well, nothing much really. They just continued to where they left off. But that's my problem. They didn't do anything outside of that. They took a much safer route that is too safe that it's boring. They only did the things that already worked in the 1st season without taking too much risk. It had new addition and new background stories for Saga and some of the characters, but it was introduced so late to the season that the first half of this season seems like it's a waste of time imo.  The story, just like I said, was pretty lackluster. It took what worked before and didn't risk new things. It's decent at best.  The characters are decent. They are likable and memorable, but I really don't like some of them as well as the side characters. It's not like they are bad, just a bit inconsistent at times. jk, they are also pretty bad lmao Let's talk about the main characters. Their developments are pretty much non-existent. It's not them that develops, it's the one-off side characters that gets barely develop because of them. That's not bad, but it's really cheapens them as characters because of how focus they get, yet they don't really do anything. I probably worded that wrong, but it's really hard to explain. It's not that they are bad, but just really lackluster and probably one of the weaker main cast in the recent times.  The animation is pretty disappointing. The 1st season is pretty low budget but it still managed to be interesting in direction-wise. But here, there's really no stand-out scenes. And the CG models are abominable. It's just not something that should exist in 2021 (as well as coming from MAPPA).  The music is also quite a letdown. The 1st season had so many bangers that I expected some bangers in this season... but sadly, there wasn't that much bangers in this season. It had some great ost and insert songs, but that's about it.  Overall, just a disappointing sequel for a series that I actually cared about. (4.6/10);Mixed Feelings
1;Zombieland Saga Revenge;ftvdeadmark;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ftvdeadmark;5;Zombieland Saga, as a whole, is a series I find to be wasted potential. Tell me, with a premise such as “zombies turned idols to save the prefecture of Saga with their borderline psychotic manager,” would you expect to see the show would a large dose of melodrama to go with such an absurd premise. Now, before I go into Revenge, I wanna summarize my thoughts on Season 1 since this is my first time talking about this anime. For season 1, the first two episodes were some of the most fun of the whole season, they completely use their premise to its fullest with silly shenanigans, changing up the “idol anime” genre, and having fun. But, when the third episode hit, it kinda just became a self-aware idol anime with all the over the top melodrama of wanting to become the next big idol group. It was a big disappointment for me, so I was not expecting this season to really surprised me at all. I was somewhat proven right, and somewhat proven wrong.  Story: The story seems like a fitting way to start of the second season as the crew of Franchouchou are in huge debt from the awful failure of their concert at the EFS. Which was stupid how they got themselves into this mess when given extra context 10 episodes later in a quasi-filler episode. This would have been fine as a bit for a joke, but both the first and tenth episodes play it completely straight. While Franchouchou are saving up money, they grow more as an idol group and as zombies. Most episodes are little bottle episodes that focuses on most of the cast members, giving us a little more context to their characters and normally doesn’t effect them all that much throughout the course of the story and go back to being the same cheerful charismatic zombies. Most of these episodes can be fun but usually don’t hit as hard as I would like them to. I’ll at least give season 1 credit, where there was at least some inner conflict to be had to keep the story more interesting.  Art: Art is a little on the rough side with this series, though it looks the best in this season compared to the previous. Both do have their moments of fun and energetic animation, but they also have moments of static shots with lackluster artwork in places. The character design is probably the best part of this series as each character has their own unique look to them and give off their personalities pretty well. But that opening is a real banger and kinda tops the first season, IMO.  Sound: Sound design wasn’t really all that special to give much praise as it sounded like most of it was just royalty free sound effects half the time. The music is really well done and catchy to the point that I would tap my foot to some of their melodies. Although, I think catchy music in an idol anime is pretty much expected to be there. Not to mention, it doesn’t really have too much of its own personality to the lyrics as it sounds like the kinda songs you would get from the usual idol groups.  Characters: I will say that the strongest part is the characters for the most part. Aside from Sakura, who feels more like a wet blanket than a good character, most of the other characters have enough of a dynamic and personality that you’ll be sure to like at least one. While some don’t really gel with me completely for reasons that’ll make this review longer than it is, I can’t really say I hate any of them. I will make note to finally including a backstory to the member, Yuugiri, as she felt painfully underutilized in season 1 and mostly used for jokes. Her story arc were some of my favorite episodes as it was a nice change of pace from the anime’s usual antiques, it felt like a breath of fresh air. It also helped me to fully understand Koutarou’s quest to save Saga as his late ancestor(?) and gives him a lot of charm with his chemistry with Yuugiri. It also helped to accept Koutarou’s screeching autism that was sometimes getting to me.  Enjoyment: It’s a bit mixed for me as I wasn’t really annoyed by this series, but I wished it really took the show to more absurd levels and actually did a little more with its zombie premise besides “we can’t let everyone know we’re zombies” shtick. And only after the last episode, we get a tease for [REDACTED] and ONLY NOW YOU DECIDE TO COMMIT TO THE ABSURD?!?!  Overall: Those first two episodes of season 1 and Yuugiri’s arc were some of the best this series had to offer. Maybe one I can think of that was cute was Saki getting to meet her idol who made her who she was and filling in his shoes. But, I guess this show was mostly ruined for me because I expected too much from it that I lost interest along the way. If you want something to turn your brain off to and maybe laugh (though jokes can be hit or miss at times), check it out if you want. Time to go back into my cave.;Mixed Feelings
2;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Nostalgiamancer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nostalgiamancer;6;A very big let-down in comparison with season one, with a few great episodes sprinkled in.  If you are a fan of the first season, I am sorry, but don't expect the quality, spirit, and drive of those episodes. I still think you should watch season 2, but its very average and generic. Its almost as if the success of zombie land drew the attention of higher-ups and crushed its soul. No idea if that is the case or not, but season two was pretty stultifying.  That said, episodes 8 and 9 are absolute gems. 10/10 imo. Don't miss out on those.;Mixed Feelings
3;Zombieland Saga Revenge;DrAkiMakura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DrAkiMakura;5;Zombieland Saga Revenge is a disappointment to say the least. After a very solid first season, this season doesn't do anything special, and fails to answer the questions presented in the first.  The overall pacing is rather bad, it either lingers on nothing, or speeds through events. Out of nowhere, two episodes are interspersed between a slight cliff hanger— the kicker being these two episodes don't actually explain the specific things you'd want to know from the first season— it focuses on the historical background about couple of characters, one who barely has a personality during these episodes. There's no character development of any kind throughout this season, nor any conflicts from their past lives— which was a big reason why the first season was so enjoyable.  Animation has taken an utter nosedive— the first show by no means had amazing animation, but when you don't have story or characterization to draw away attention, it just looks that much worse. Music isn't very good this season either. Everything is very same-y, with the first song in the first episode being by far the best (and it's not even from Franchouchou).  All in all, it just makes me confused that people are rating this as highly as the first season. Did we watch the same thing?;Mixed Feelings
0;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Inosenso;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Inosenso;3;Very poorly executed and lost sight of itself.  Season 2 of ZLS attempts to make more plot without committing and more spotlight on new supporting characters.  After a very strong start ZLS 2's episodes lose structure and meander constantly while taking out the main characters almost completely. A great example is the biker gang episode with Yamada where she kind of just shows up around the supporting characters and doesn't do anything. Compared to the yakitori episode from season 1 the execution is devoid of stakes, compelling characterization, humor, setup+payoff and the horror references they liked to play around with. The only reason the episode even feels like it was worth it was a throwaway scene showing a grave with possibly Yamada's ancestor that goes on to mean nothing. This goes double for the Yuugiri flashback two parter where they spend two episodes shoving a plot you don't care about down your throat but making her completely passive. As the most underutilized character in the show, for 40 minutes of anime to do nothing for the character both moving forward and in hindsight is unacceptable.  Artwise ZLS 2 is also a big downgrade from its predecessor. The opening is Mappa saving budget with minimalist premiere pro graphics and again we pretty much never get extensive horror segments like the bathhouse section of season 1. The animation gets choppy and the CG doesn't innovate much either. As for music we also downgrade to poppy crap. The season 1 rap wasn't even attempted to be topped as ZLSR settled into a comfortable bubble.  This is a great show if you have no experience with good idol shows like Idolmaster and Idolmaster Cinderella Girls or Super Sonico and can tolerate the CG but if you have the time just rewatch season 1.;Not Recommended
1;Zombieland Saga Revenge;Easy_2013;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Easy_2013;4;I watched this for 2 reasons. 1. Coming off of JJK and AOT, I thought why the hell not. Lets watch another Mappa show. 2. Idol culture is something that I have a certain distain for, but also would like to know whats going on. Its an odd infatuation based on hate.  Now I know I know, Anime isnt real life. An idol anime does not reflect the real idol culture, at least not completly  This show's story is what I'd call mediocre, and that's the worst you can be. You can be either so shit that its memorable and hilarious. Like Domestic Na Kanojo. (but keep it between us, I enjoyed the shit outta domestic na kanojo cuz it was so fucking shit it reached gold status)  Or you can be fucking 10/10 masterpiece amazing, looking at you, violet evergarden.  This show, although plot wise and character wise is not as bland as shiba fucking tatsuya from that one magic anime, its still pretty fucking bland  The concert scenes failed to stur up any joy or excitement when I saw it, it was just kinda well. meh.  The songs were obnoxious, the CGI used in the stage scenes were horrendous, there were some good moments like when they smashed a guitar on stage. That I'll admit. Was pretty badass.  But overall, I didn't like the show, and certainly wasn't what I was expecting from MAPPA after JJK and AOT blew me away. I just hope CSM doesnt suck fuck;Not Recommended
0;Zombieland Saga;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;9;Doesn't it feel like in today’s world, there’s way too many horror media that does same things over and over again? I’m not solely talking about anime alone but the horror genre has gotten to a point where it feels like we’ve seen just about anything. One of the most iconic type of horror is the dead coming back to life. In this case, I’m referring to zombies. Franchises like Resident Evil and The Walking Dead are among just a few well-known ones that comes to mind. But what if I told you that Zombieland Saga manages to revitalize a bit of the horror genre instead of falling to common cliches?  To be honest, Zombieland Saga isn’t really a horror show at all although the first episode’s opening suggests so with a cliché setting and a young girl facing a crisis between life and death. It manages to trick viewers through its opening and does a 180 degree turn after revealing the series’ real concept – a horror comedy that satirze Japanese idols with an absurd character cast. As a collaboration project by Cygames and Avex pictures (with studio MAPPA), they managed to keep this show a secret from the start.  Now that we got that out of the way, it’s time to realize what Zombieland Saga really offers. I watched plenty of zombie shows in the past and most of it attempts to do the same things over and over again – evoke a sense of fear. Zombieland Saga does the opposite and creates a sensation of genuine entertainment with its comedy elements. In fact, I’d say the show is self-aware enough to satirize the idol industry. In the first few episodes, protagonist Sakura Minamoto ends up dead after being hit a trick. But rather than awakening in some fantasy world, she is reborn as a zombie. It doesn’t take long for her to join a group with other zombie girls together. This group collectively is formed by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi with the purpose to save the Saga Prefecture. Say hello to Franchoucou.  Ideally, a show like this sounds like it took a big risk as it sounds like a dumb joke of itself. Watching Zombieland Saga does feel like the show plays with itself a bit too much but it didn’t take long for me to accept and grow attached to the main characters. That’s because each of them have a life of their own with colorful personalities. As an inspiring idol, Sakura’s dream became a reality when she steps onto the stage. Sakura’s friendly personality enables her to easily get along with everyone. That’s the opposite of delinquent yankee, Saki Nikaido. Unlike Sakura, she is difficult to get along with because of her tough personality. Deep down though, Saki isn’t a malevolent character and in fact manages to develop some deeper bonds with her idol comrades. We also meet Ai Mizuno, a girl who desire to make the best of her current life. Junko Konno, Lily Hoshikawa, and Tae Yamada make up the rest of the group after being reborn. Despite dying under different circumstances, they all serve the same purpose and that’s to make their group into a sensation.  You’re probably asking yourself if Franchoucou really is a sensation in their world. They didn’t start out with popularity and instead had to work their way up. Through hard work and motivation, the group does gain popularity as Sakura leads them to stardom. My interest for the show grew more and more as I wanted to see this group succeed. It also helped that the show constantly got me feel attached to the characters through effective storytelling. We learn of their past, their motivations, and what they hope to accomplish in the present. There are also some episodes that throws in some surprising plot twists and bittersweet ending moments. I’m not going to spoil it but it manages to become even emotional at times so prepare for some tissues.  As a horror/idol comedy, the show contains countless amount of humorous gags. Most of the humor revolves around the concept of zombies. Characters retain personalities from their past lives but sometimes finds themselves surprised by unnatural events. This often includes body parts coming off unintentionally that’s played with absurdity. The guiltiest member of the group that people will point fingers at would be Tae Yamada, the legendary title-less girl. Unlike the rest, she has yet to regain her personality and behaves like a zombie. She has an unhealthy appetite that seems to have a personality of a kid stuck in an adult’s body. The show constantly pokes fun at her character by showing what zombies can do. It’s the type of satirical humor that is aware of its intentions and seeks to make the audience laugh. And to be honest, it works.  So now what? Is this just a show of humor nonsense or is there something bigger that meets the eye? It honestly depends on how you approach this show. The more I watched Zombieland Saga, the more I felt compelled to see how different this anime is compared to other genres of similar nature. In fact, I’d say that Zombieland Saga offers an experience that is refreshing by mixing in comedy with musical themes. It’s not often you get to see these two mixed together in today’s world. The project creators managed to effectively create a fakeout of the show from the first episode while ultimately making this into a parody. Don’t get me wrong though. You’ll still occasionally see some “horror” content pop up but it satirizes to make it absurd as possible.  It should also be said that the voicing cast of this show deserves recognition for their talent. In particular, voice actress veteran Kotono Mitsuishi plays her role as Tae Yamada flawlessly. She’s able to step into the shoes of her character with the mindset of a zombie. Others such as Asami Tano is able to take on their character role as a yankee and her accent proves it. As a show about idols, you should also expect tons of catchy songs. While most of them relates to J-pop, there are occasional times when the show throws in a surprise or two such as a battle rap in one particular episode. The bottom line is, this is so much more than just a horror-idol comedy as it also manages to embrace its music culture.  Studio MAPPA did it again. They managed to create a show that not only surprised me but also give the zombie concept a breath of fresh air. Zombieland Saga manages to reinvent itself by stepping out of the comfort zone. It satirizes the idol industry by combining its self-aware humor and absurd character cast. Yet, it manages to deliver effective storytelling that is important for the overall direction of the show. As I learned more and more about the characters, it felt hard to let them to go when everything concluded. By accomplishing such a feat, this anime is definitely a sensation to take attention to. The secret is out now and it’s easy to say that I need more anime like Zombieland Saga in my life.;Recommended
1;Zombieland Saga;HellLyter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HellLyter;9;"Zombieland Saga is unironically the best anime of 2018.  Let me tell you a little story. Once Upon a Time, I got hooked on the idol genre, and descended into what is commonly referred to as idol hell. However, contrary to popular belief, I was able to snap out of my zombie like trance and escape from idol hell, and I can happily say that I’ve been clean for over two years. No longer having an interest in idol anime, I had no inclination to watch Zombieland Saga, and had planned on skipping it. What a sad, misguided fool the me before watching this anime was…anyway, I eventually got around to watching it thanks to my weak mind being influenced by Youtube videos that told me to give this anime a shot. In this review, I’ll explain to you why Zombieland Saga isn’t just great for it’s drop-dead hilarity and entertainment value, but for its unexpected complexity that you might just miss out on if you just skim the surface of this surprisingly great anime.  That’s right, this is actually going to be a somewhat intricate review since Zombieland Saga is totally worth analyzing. So if you don’t have much time and have to Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!, here’s a little tl;dr for you: I came for the quirky idol shenanigans + zombies combo, stayed for the amazing comedy, and left absolutely loving the diverse and both figuratively and literally fleshed out characters (Get it? Cuz they’re zombies?)  This anime really hits like a truck in how quickly it transitions from a seemingly typical idol anime opening sequence what with our heroine Sakura’s upbeat and energetic disposition to an intense and hilarious death scene backed by heavy metal music after like 30 seconds into the first episode. I was instantly hooked after this unique beginning, and the anime just got better from there.  It’s no spoiler to say that our protagonist is as dead as someone who, well, died. However, she is revived via necromancy by a sunglasses wearing manager dude named Koutarou who also brought back six other SUPER LEGENDARY girls from the dead all for the purpose of them forming an idol group with the monumental goal of saving a declining Saga.  If that sentence long synopsis doesn’t get you to tingle with excitement in anticipation to see where the heck this anime goes, then I don’t know what will.  It’s no secret to say that I didn’t watch this anime hoping to find something with a compelling narrative and developed characters and was instead looking for something that would make me smile in amusement. And I can happily say that Zombieland Saga made me die of laughter (Don’t worry about me though, I was brought back to life…Though sadly not as a LEGENDARY zombie idol) This is the funniest anime that I’ve seen all year. Each episode contains a plethora of comedic moments, and there was always something new and creative so it never felt like I was watching the same routine with each passing episode. Now if the good comedy was all Zombieland Saga had, I would have been perfectly content with the anime and left satisfied. However, there is so much more to this anime than that, and its greatest strengths revolve around the cast.  You really can’t go wrong when your characters are a bunch of LEGENDARY girls in an idol group called FranChouChou. Outside of Sakura, who suffers from memory loss, a typical anime trope that Zombieland Saga actually executes better than literally every other anime that utilizes memory loss, our girls include my personal favorite, the LEGENDARY Saki Nikaidou, a fiery, outgoing girl whose voice and character design are so hot that they make me catch on fire. Plus she’s a rapping biker girl who likes chicken and goes down in a blaze of glory TWICE. I guess the perfect girl does exist. We also have Ai Mizuno, a girl who was a successful idol in life who had a simply LEGENDARY death after giving one last electrifying performance. Let’s not forget the soft spoken yet powerhouse vocalist Junko Konno, whose LEGENDARY rise to stardom may have been cut short by an unexpected crash and burn, but she lives on in our hearts…and as a zombie. Lily Hoshikawa is a kawaii girl who was a LEGENDARY child actress who unfortunately ended up in a hairy situation that her little heart just couldn’t take. Still, she’s a true star, and her cuteness is infectious. Next, we have the ever enticing and LEGENDARY Yuugiri, who is the most experienced of the girls in more ways than one~  Finally, we have THE LEGENDARY TAE YAMADA, and thanks to her inclusion as the star of the show, I was practically mandated by the animu gods to bump up my score for this anime by a full point. So yeah, the girls in this anime are just so…Illustrious.  You’ll notice that the girls all lived in different eras, so they obviously were exposed to different cultures based on the times that they lived in. A lesser anime would have glazed over this fact, but not Zombieland Saga, and this was the point that I realized that this anime was something special. Junko and Ai were to first to go through compelling character arcs, and their stories were pretty engaging, and set the stage for the upcoming character arcs. The episode dedicated to Lily was, to put it bluntly, LEGENDARY. Zombieland Saga had done it. It became the first anime I’ve ever seen to make me laugh hysterically AND be brought to the verge of tears thanks to an incredibly well produced character driven episode. I didn’t think anything could top the epicness of the rap battle, but the emotions I felt thanks to Lily’s story certainly did. I was trapped in a sea of emotions throughout the entire episode, and I could probably write an entire review just dedicated to that episode alone. Seriously though, I have never seen an anime handle Lily’s character type nearly as well as Zombieland Saga did, and at the end of the day, Lily is Lily.  And of course, it goes without saying that Saki’s episode was pure greatness. Saki is just that good.  A strong demonstration of camaraderie between characters is something that I rarely see sufficiently executed in anime. So imagine my shock when I realized that Zombieland Saga of all things was able to pull it off. The bonds that these characters have with each other grew from constant arguments and not being on the same page in the first few episodes into an in sync family who would do anything to help each other out. This is demonstrated the clearest near the end of the anime. I won’t spoil exactly what, but something happens to Sakura that causes a rift between her and her fellow zombies. The way that all of the girls try to get her back to her old self is extremely heartwarming, and it really goes to show how far these girls have come. And thanks to their positive relationship with one other, they’re able to put on some spectacular performances. And now we get to the other great part about this anime.  Its music is hella good.  For the past several weeks I’ve been listening to the opening theme song, Adabana Necromancy, constantly. I play it when I eat. I play it when I sleep. I’m playing it as I’m writing this review. It’s a pretty damn good song. And you know what else is good? Literally every insert song in this anime. I’ve already mentioned the rap battle, which was pretty off the chain. Lily’s song and Saki’s song are two personal favorites of mine, and every musical number in this show is just really catchy. If FranChouChou ever put on a show irl, you better believe I’d buy tickets to go and see them, and I would be screaming and crying at the awesomeness alongside those two heavy metal guys who’ve attended every show that the girls have put on. Seriously though, those two guys really are the unsung MVPs of this anime.  When it comes to the voice acting, as Phil from Hercules would say, I’ve got two words for ya: Frickin Miyano Mamoru! This boi is my favorite male seiyuu, and his performance as Koutarou is simply LEGENDARY. Some of the best comedy from this anime comes from the combination of Koutarou’s absurd lines plus Mamoru’s expert delivery of them. And of course, the ladies voicing our lovely zombie idols do an exceptional job. And they even got the LEGENDARY voice actress of Usagi from Sailor Moon to voice the LEGENDARY Tae Yamada. I didn't expect anything less.  Visually speaking, this anime is animated quite well. I love the character designs, and the fluidity of their movements during scenes like the rap battle and Lily’s song is very impressive. But there’s one glaring issue with the visuals, and I’m sure you know exactly what I’m referring to. You guessed it, I’m talking about none other than the CGI.  Which is an acronym that I made for Cute Girl Idols.  That’s right, as I said before, these cute girl idols are drawn to look pretty attractive, but they’re, you know, rotting corpses, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not into necrophilia. Yet the girls’ cutesy designs have consistently tempted me throughout the anime’s run time, which has been problematic since it’s called into question my morality and…Oh wait, you thought by CGI I meant the Computer Generated Imagery that this anime scarcely deploys? The CGI implemented during some of the dance sequences that is literally used for less then ten minutes of the entire anime’s run time and doesn’t look nearly as bad as people make it out to be? Well personally, I have absolutely no qualms with the CGI. There’s definitely worse out there, trust me.  Zombieland Saga impressed me. It put a fun twist on the idol genre that not only made it incredibly entertaining to watch, but also allowed it to develop some truly great and unique characters. I haven’t enjoyed watching an anime this much in a long time. And if you haven’t watched this anime yet, you really should Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! and watch it as soon as possible. It just isn’t right to miss out on such a LEGENDARY anime.";Recommended
2;Zombieland Saga;CodeBlazeFate;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CodeBlazeFate;7;"It’s pretty clear that in today’s society, anime seems to be churned out in droves. You bare witness to the regurgitation of carbon copies, causing the medium you hold dear to fade into the bleakest grey...  And then Zombieland Saga busts in through the fucking window in a speeding minivan going 156 mph, shouting “FUCK YOU; GET IN” before flooring it faster than you can say “The Legendary TAE YAMADA!” It’s fun, it’s quirky, it’s loud as all hell, and most importantly, it’s as vivid as a sunset. Sure, your weeaboo mancave of a room is busted and your waifu collection is in pieces, but we all know you’ll replace that with a shrine dedicated to a bunch of zombie idols in no time. You’ll get used to it anyway.  We should probably get the most colorful, charming parts of this show out of the way. These visuals pop. The colors strike like God’s lightning, especially in both the opening and ending. These character designs are as bombastic as the personalities of the girls when they’re off doing weird hijinks. Their facial expressions and clothes are so glorious that it’s easy to forget that you only give a shit about like half the characters until their pasts get revealed. Sure, there are some fugly CGI idol models in a couple of dance sequences early on, but then we get oil paintings for menus and real-life footage. Studio MAPPA poured their blood, sweat, and tears into injecting nothing but style into this show.  Speaking of hijinks, there’s a ton of variety in these spectacles. Horror movie/game parodying, playing hot potato with Tae’s severed head, fucking chicken performances and rap battles?! How can anyone object to this?! This is a perfect venue for vibrant character chemistry, as evidenced by the two best characters in the show, Saki and The Legendary Tae Yamada! These two embody the best aspects of the show, with them getting a majority of the best gags. Saki’s loud and abrasive personality makes for perfect chemistry fodder with the rest of the cast, and the inner machinations of Tae Yamada’s mind are an enigma. She is a joy to witness.  The rest of the characters took a while to become even remotely interesting, and this is for a few reasons. For one, several of the main characters are often more drama focused. While this isn’t a bad thing on its own, not only are the personalities of characters such as Junko and Ai not very interesting, but given the limited time spent on drama in comparison to everything else in the first 4 episodes, the drama often feels like a detour. Admittedly, very few of these characters are that great when they aren’t dealing with absurd scenarios, but some are especially dull early on. The latter half thankfully has episodes designed around fleshing out the characters and giving them an emotional arc, but not every character gets this luxury. Granted, none of the main 7 idols are as grating as their manager Kotaro (cuz that guy can get fucked by a cactus more than half the time) but the show still has a hard time giving everyone the spotlight. Thankfully some of the side characters introduced in some of these character-centric mini-stories are written and explored efficiently. Without them, the drama-centered focus of the second half would have felt like an agonizing shift considering how lackluster the more serious portions of the show felt beforehand.  The only thing left to touch on is the music. The background tracks are catchy, with neat jingles to compliment the lighthearted and comedic moments. However, the real meat comes in the form of the songs by everyone in this idol group: Franchouchou. The OP ""Adabana Necromancy” is as vivid as the visuals that it plays over, and the watercolor visuals really help sell the emotional ED ""Hikari e”. As for the insert idol tracks, several of them are pretty nice to listen to as well, with the only real exception being the ear-piercing Vocaloid-esque song that plays at the end of the 7th episode. It would be rather ghastly if these performances sounded dead, so thank the maker this ain’t the case.  It’s refreshing to have an anime run you over, screaming. It calms down, and there are some growing pains, but I’m happy to see some life here. There’s a vivid pulse to this one, a wild and unique expression so charming and sincere that I nearly overlook how uneven and easy to break this show can be. With this performance now over, it’s your turn to take part in the saga. What are you waiting for? Do it while you’re still alive!    Also, Tae Yamada dabs in episode 7, so that’s an Easter egg to look out for.  Written/Edited by: CodeBlazeFate Proofread by: Peregrine";Recommended
3;Zombieland Saga;Snapshot426;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Snapshot426;9;"Zombies and idols. Both are oversaturated in their respective parts of the world with zombies in the west and idols in the east. I'm pretty sure that we are fed up of both and don't take interest in watching them and just look for something else to watch. I imagine it is going to take a lot to get people into watching an idol or zombie show. But along comes this show. This show which combines these two together into one caught many people off guard and provided us with something we did not expect. So why, I ask, did I keep watching this show to the end while knowing what kind of show it is?  Sit back, relax and bow down to THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! as I present to you the anime review for Zombieland Saga. Lets begin.    Story: 8/10  Our story begins with Sakura Minamoto looking forward to what she thinks will be the best day of life. She gets dressed; rushes down the stairs; out the front door; looking into the sun with a smile on her face and then gets immediately hit by a truck (that's right, TRUCK-KUN STRIKES AGAIN!). She finds herself awakening in a seemly abandoned old mansion crawling with Zombies. She then finds out she is also a zombie and has been for 10 years. Under their charismatic but self-absorbed leader Koutaro Tatsumi, she joins several other girls who are considered legendary in their own time with one goal in mind. To become the ultimate idol group in order to save Saga, the location where these girls will perform and revive the idol industry there.  The way this show was built up before its airing was interesting. We pretty much had no idea what it was going to be. Going from the trailer and the poster, it looked like it was going to be an over the top, zombie slaying action series. When the show aired its first few episodes, I think the show just went ahead and said:  ""Oh you thought this was a zombie action series? Well PSYKE, it's an idol show. Except PSYKE, it's not really an idol show but rather a parody of the idol industry. Except PSYKE, it's an genuine idol show but you don't care because you are already invested.""  And you know what? I was invested. The way this show is structured is very well done. It starts off with something so abrupt, it is absolutely hilarious and sets the tone pretty well. It follows up with some unconventional music that doesn't really associate with idols. It then gives us actual idol s**t when we are invested into the show and when we get invested into the characters, we learn more about them. The show knows when it is a good time to change the focus of the show and then develop on it in order to keep it fresh, making the show's pace very well executed.  Now, since this show's idols are also zombies. It leaves a question that it asks us. Does the zombie aspect add anything to Zombielad saga or are they mainly used for comedy? Well yes, they do add something. Considering that these girls have all been resurrected from different time periods, they also bring their backgrounds, ideals and personalities from that time period with them. This creates some conflict between the characters as their ideals are different from one another. Creating tension and also character building. Of course, them being zombies also means that some people will start catching on that these girls who are supposed to be dead have started to walk around again and are performing as an idol group.   Characters: 8.5/10  Each of our main cast of female characters are rather distinct from one another and each have their own personality. It is important that each character has their own personality in this case in order to stand out in their own way. Whether it is Saki's brash nature or lily's love for everything cute, they all have their own quirks that all make them stand out in their own way. Sakura is the only character I have some gripes with due to being a blank slate character due to her having amnesia. But I can forgive that because she really comes into her own near the end of the show.  Each get some development as well and and we get some insight of what their lives were like before they became zombies. Well maybe except Yuugiri and THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! They don't get as fair of development than the rest of the cast. I can forgive THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE!!! due to her actions speaking for herself. But Yuugiri, not so much. Either way, the characters are enjoyable, likeable and their deaths are hilarious.  However, the best character in this show is definitely their manager, Koutaro Tatsumi. Basically, he's as if Houoiun Kyouma decided to ditch the mad scientist gimmick and decided to become a manager instead. He's loud, he's brash, he has no sense of personal space, loves the sound of his own voice and is a complete idiot. He's basically a parody of the standard idol manager considering he has little interest in the girls' feelings or health whatsoever and will do his own thing while the girls have to practice. He's pretty much is looking to advance his own fame rather than the girls because they are zombies and everyone would want to kill them if they find out. Thankfully, he does get his s**t kicked in at times by Saki and Ai at different points of the show due to his idiocy. He is where the comedy is at its best due to Mamoru Miyano's performance and delivery (and we will get to that) but he is genuinely funny and is definitely the highlight of the show.   Animation: 9.5/10  MAAPA has done a good job here animating this show. Everything about the animation of this show feels vibrant with the colour especially feeling lively or when the cinematography changes like whenever Koutaro shouts at people or saying ""MUSIC, COME ON!!!"" It really is a nice treat for the eyes. The character designs as well are well done, especially with the girls' zombie aspects. Each character is designed in correlation to how they died. This includes bandages, stitches and scars. It's that nice attention to detail that makes the animation quality that much better. Also, those faces. Whether it is from getting shocked, their scary zombie face or Saki's smug face on episode 4, they add to the comedy which is especially important as body language can also make the scene more humorous.  Now there is also CGI used in this show when the girls start performing actual idol performances. At this point I've come to the belief that CGI is to anime what microtransactions are to video games. You don't want it to be there, but you'll know it will be there. Thankfully, it doesn't look bad as the CGI doesn't look stiff and doesn't look too out of place.   Sound: 9.5/10  This being an idol show, the music must take high priority. Otherwise, what's the point? The soundtrack used is very catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Very diverse as well with different types of songs and music across the entire show to hammer it home that this is an unconventional idol anime. The rap battle sequence from episode 2 ALONE deserves a point as it is so well done, so catchy and so f***ing funny that it was the highlight of the show for me. Of course it can take itself seriously as well. The song played at the end of episode 8 is a heartwrencher that made me shed one single tear when I watched it.  The opening ""Adabana Necromancy"" that is performed by the main cast of girls is also very well done. It just has so much style and character to it as it looks like the opening is just trying to have some fun. Power ranger idols, a zombie dance number and Koutaro showing off his moves. It just relates to the unconventional nature of the show. The music as well is done well with bombastic trumpets and trombones combining well with the drums and violins. Combine this with the sound effects to make a fast paced, well done opening altogether. In fact, the sound effects are so crucial that when I listened to a version of the opening without the sound effects. It felt off as if the opening lost a key part to it.  The ending sequence is a standard calm down ending where after the events of the episode, you need to listen to something that will calm you down and make you feel relaxed as you reflect upon the episode you just saw. So yeah, pretty standard.  Now I was curious as to how the english dub would be handled. Mamoru Miyano's performance as Koutaro Tatsumi is absolutely brilliant with him constantly changing the tone of his voice and shouting at the top of his lungs. It was like Koutaro was made specifically for him. It sounded like he was having so much fun with the role. So I was interested to see how the English dub would compare. And you know what? Ricco Fajardo did a damn good job as Koutaro as he also brings a charismatic and bombastic performance that is also enjoyable. The rest of the cast also does a good job with each of their respective roles. But considering Mamoru Miyano's performance and the fact that the idol performances have not been dubbed and are still in Japanese. I would still choose the sub over the dub. But if you want to watch the dub, go right ahead.   Conclusion:  I didn't know what to expect from Zombieland Saga and after watching the entire series, I was surprised as to how I managed to watch an idol show without considering on dropping it altogether. But I would say it earns that right of being an idol show by giving us something different to start with before giving us all that idol crap while still realising its roots. Its characters are likeable and enjoyable for the most part, its animation is great and the opening is something I will remember for years. It has cute zombie girls, Truck-Kun, Mamoru Miyano, a rap battle, more Truck-Kun and a whole lot of comedy. I would even call this the surprise show of the season. Some people may argue Bunny Girl Sempai or that Isekai slime show, but at least you got some idea of what you were getting. This being many peoples' first idol show that they have watched (myself included), it caught everyone off guard as to how enjoyable it was.  If you are looking for your first idol to watch, this is a great starting point as it does something different before it does the idol stuff and is a show I highly recommend you watch.   My personal enjoyment: 10/10   Overall score: 9.1/10 Recommendation: Go f***ing watch it";Recommended
4;Zombieland Saga;Raggadish;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Raggadish;9;"MAPPA, you genius. Had someone told me a year ago that I would watch an idol show featuring zombie girls nonetheless, and whole heartedly enjoy it, I would´ve laughed said person straight up in the face. Honestly, I´ve never seen an idol anime before Zombieland Saga (ZS) and will probably never see one again. Because ZS came and rocked my world (yes, pun intended), with what doubtlessly is mostly a great grand parody of the idol genre. MAPPA has gone and done it again, and this time with genres that I for my life never thought I would ever appreciate. So why is ZS the only idol anime you ever need to watch? I will tell you right now.  And since the synopsis nowhere near doing the show justice, I will elaborate it a bit.  The fabulous and self-proclaimed zombie girl idol producer Koutarou Tatsumi has a mission, and one mission only - to save the district Saga. Saga´s population is declining; especially young people is leaving to find their luck elsewhere. Koutarou-kun want to fix this ASAP, and what better way to do it then with a Saga idol group, right? And if you can´t find living young girls who´s up for the task, what better way is there than revive a bunch of dead ones and create an idol group of zombie girls?!  You might wonder how the hell Koutarou-kun made them into zombies? To cite the grand man himself when asked; “A little bit of this, a little bit of that and bang, you´re out of the grave, right?! Isn´t that all you really need for zombies?!” So, there you have it.  Sakura were in her teenage prime, with big dreams of becoming an idol. But one day when she is running in excitement with her song-CD to the mail-box, a truck hits her and bang! Sakura is dead, and no more idol dreams for her. At least until Koutarou-kun revives her 10 years later and informs her that she now is Zombie nr 1 and is going to be an idol together his little group of zombie girls to save Saga. Only one problem for Sakura though, she has lost her memories!  What follows is the groups hilarious strive to be THE idol group everyone talks about to save Saga, in an era where the concept of idols is almost extinct. As you can guess, they have to start at the bottom, with all kinds of odd jobs. And all the while they have to hide the fact that they are zombies, which often leads up to violently comical situations. Even if I haven´t watched any idol/music anime, I expected an endless succession of disgustingly sweet love songs and girly group dances. Boy was I wrong. Ok, there are such later on, but the texts and songs actually have personal meaning for the girls, which made it kind of cool, but let´s get to the point. Their first gig is on a local freaking heavy metal event. Has Koutarou-kun prepared his zombie girls for such an event. Hell no. That scene set the bar for the rest of the show for me, and it did not disappoint. I laughed my ass of multiple times during most episode, and I´m no easy to entertain with comedy. Brilliant.  Sure, there is a little more serious moments with what I only can guess is the classic idol show concepts of a striving group towards success and for filling a dream, and of course the girls’ personal issues. But such scenes didn´t ruin the all over mood of the show at all, they just gave more filling to the story and the characters.  Speaking of the characters, such a great bunch of zombie girls!❤️Saki the hardcore ex biker gang boss, Yuugiri the elegant ex courtesan, Lily the sweet little ex child actress, Sakura the kind and positive ex idol-dreamer, Ai and Junko the only revived ex-idols, and let us not forget the LENGEDARY Tae Yamada! No ex- before legendary here, Tae were and is the one and only legendary Tae Yamada. No explanations needed. All the girls get some nice backgrounds and episodes dedicated to them, which explores there past, cause of death and personalities, which often was really entertaining. Koutarou-kun is the best producer, often screaming in the girls faces when asked stupid questions (or often highly relevant questions, but whatever), throwing the group into situations they have no clue how to handle, and is a master at body make-up. He also has a super awesome seductive move, which works on women and men, both living and the dead. Who could´ve asked for more! It´s music on its own to hear him screaming “Ohayōgozaimasu!!!”, “GO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!!”, “YOU STUPID ASS ZOMBIES!!!” or “COME ON!!!” on the top of his lungs.  As expected by MAPPA at this point, they have put their unique touch to ZS. Their trade mark is, unlike many other studies that make all their works looks similar, giving each project their own exclusive look and feeling. In ZS case they used bright and vivid colours, with lots of red, yellow, orange, pink and purple. Great and memorable character designs, with Saki being extra cool. Per usual they play with alternative angles, facial expressions and motion pacing’s, and per usual hit the jackpot. I even found their use of CG pretty inventive.  Since it actually is an idol show, of course it’s a lot of music. As I said mentioned before, the music they performed was a very mixed bag with everything from heavy metal, rap to ridiculous commercial songs. I´m freaking loved the rap battle, Sakura & Co owned it! If not watch the show, I highly recommend you to look up at least that part. Even if the music performance goes more toward what maybe I would´ve expected from a regular idol anime along the way, most of the songs and dances have clever texts and choreography. And the OP is in a league on its own -> LOOK IT UP. The VA´s (Japanese) very all more than perfect for the roles, so arigato gozaimasu!  Since I´ve never ventured into the genre only anime could come up with before, I had almost no expectations. And I was blown away. MAPPA once again has proven that they can do something different, and not only get away with it, but shining while doing it. I had a blast this fall watching the legendary Zombieland Saga and is proud to say that this is and likely will be my only idol anime. Because this is probably completely different from your regular idol show. I can highly recommend ZS to all you good and fine people out there. Take part of the legend!";Recommended

6;Zombieland Saga;Discord02;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Discord02;10;I'm really impressed by the quality standard of this anime season, really good works, Zombie Land Saga stands out for its simplicity of story, in a genre that is not very well known for quality overall. delivering a good story, with charismatic characters even in the background, great songs and a design quite colorful and beautiful to accompany, with a simple enough humor that still captivates. This anime will make you confused not knowing if you laugh or cry about the girls' deaths, it's just incredible. Maybe I'm just pretty excited after a great final, but for me it's a 10.;Recommended
7;Zombieland Saga;frachma99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/frachma99;9;"I've never seen any idol anime before.  Quite great, and worth-it to watch! the graphic is quite great tho, and i love its story; fun, light, colorful but still, have its own drama; and 'safe' (no sexual and harem comedy detected as far as i see). But, one thing that makes me sad : the story is hanging. is there any second season for this anime? no information about that :'( oh man!  I love all of its character's development. they have strong and different background among others. Minamoto Sakura, who always unlucky in entire her life and a fan of Mizuno Ai because she is inspired by her. Mizuno Ai, legendary heisei idol, inspiring Sakura, and always thinks that showing mistakes is a good part -of an idol- to make us developed. Junko Konno, legendary showa idol who has an opposite thoughts through Mizuno Ai. Junko, with her conservative thoughts that ""idol is always perfect. makes mistake is strongly prohibited"" (you know that Junko and Ai is from the different era) gives a little drama for this story. I love Junko. if i am a man, i will make her as my waifu lol  Saki Nikaido, is a legendary boss from motorcycle gang who become an Idol with Franchouchou (hey, why she is becoming an idol, tho? but i admire her character; cool!). Yugiri, a legendary courtesan who looks graceful and being onee-san of Franchouchou. Lily Hoshikawa, a cutie imouto who dead silly caused by a piece of hair grown on her chin (or cheek? or between them??). she didn't want to grow older, and that grown hair makes her afraid if she will become older.  And.... the last character : Tae Yamada! an unawakened zombie who always impulsively acting. she is caring about Sakura at the end. Ah.. I love Tae's Seiyuu : Mitsuishi Kotono who is being a Senior Seiyuu among five of them. (actually, the zombie dog's seiyuu is a senior too). Oh yeah.. i'm a big fan of Mitsuishi Kotono!";Recommended
8;Zombieland Saga;KANLen09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KANLen09;9;"Ah...Zombieland Saga. The one idol anime series that pays omages to past idol series and whacks them out of proportion with parodies and such, AND I LOVE IT. I'm not into idol anime, but much like Revue Starlight, this is super entertaining, at least to opinionated agreement.  Going into this series, MAPPA is telling us: ""If you think we're here to create some generic idol anime, Truck-kun will deal you heavy damage and subvert your expectations to the insane degree!"" And that's what they did, and whether you feel it succeeded or failed is up to debates, but none can deny that for what it was going for: Zombieland Saga cuts to the chase, make some questionable decisions, and then hands down (what I think) deliver on its originality.  Let us start with the bad, and we can end this on a good note, starting with the art and animation. MAPPA has been known for creating a lot of slick animation to boot, but the character designs, original as they may be and easy to differentiate the cast of Franchouchou as a whole, it leaves a lot to be desired. Even more is the very subjective animation, which I assume is for pretty much the parody of idol anime. Weird 3D models and whatnot, and I get it, the fact that this model exists is just for show, and many people will feel off-putting. As for myself, it's plentiful and does its job, decent at best.  The good-but-not-great part, the music. Created by the one and only Yasuharu Takanashi of Naruto: Shippuden and Fairy Tail fame, this was honestly the biggest standout to me, as the OST contained within this series is truly another great work that adds to his name. The next-level OP visuals with sound effects (something that's ultra rare in anime) that always pulls off excellently, to the calm ED, both songs sang by none other than Franchouchou. Simply just brilliant.  For most people however, its the simple story and backgrounds of the characters themselves that will earn praise over why this series is super popular now. Let's start with the man in question: Franchouchou's agent-cum-director/driver/counsellor AIO Kotarou Tatsumi. He has been the male elicit of the girls in whatever situations, and has outgrown and outshined himself as the main go-to parody, not caring what the girls' opinions are (until it gets serious like Sakura's). But like them, he has a dream to make Franchouchou known around the dead city that is Saga.  Now, with the girls. Sakura Minamoto has been always looked upon as the MC girl ever since the beginning and recurrence of Truck-kun, and is always the person of ridicule when faced with Kotarou's whims, but ever since Day 1 when she wanted to be an idol, in a snap, she lost all hope as she not only got smashed dead by Truck-kun, but questions her intent and place in the unit, only to have these worries recitified to enjoy what has the new zombie life has in store for her.  Saki Nikaidou, the group's bad-ass leader and former gang leader. Nothing short of the finest in life. She has that bad-ass attitude, and doesn't even spare that to Kotarou and his crazy antics, making sure that everything goes her way, and doesn't back out of a fight...that is until her untimely death when facing off another rival gang. For reference, please refer to Episode 2's crazily awesome rap. A gung-ho girl that everyone relies on heavily to get things going, I'd say she is someone you wouldn't try to mess with her wrong side.  Lily Hoshikawa, the youngest in the group, and an established idol well in her early years. Her dead-come-alive story is simple: transgender, died after that simple growing of puberty adolescence. But nonetheless, she has what she always had from the beginning: the support from her father-cum-former manager (And it's not easy for parents to guide their own children who have become idols, so to speak).  Ai Mizuno and Junko Konno are two separate humans, yet two separate entities which has come alive through lightning exposure and death from a plane crash. It's easy to see how both Ai and Junko are similar to one another, yet have different views when it comes to interaction with their own idols. Granted, Ai is modern (Iron Frill, 2008) and Junko is traditional (80s Showa era), but despite their bickering, sometimes (or much rather) they come together as one to give the performances that people need, and it is well worth it.  It's sad that Yuugiri and ""legendary"" BEST GIRL Tae Yamada hasn't has their backstories, but given the time frame of the series, they could have done much more into expanding on these two characters, best of the best and legendary status' girls. *ah-chou* Franchouchou is born! And come on, even the calefare Policeman had his moments!  Zombieland Saga is parody, satirical, and a slap in the face to the archetypes we've come to know and love/hate, and how it manages to do all that, it does so brilliantly at its very best. All we know, there'll never be anything like it ever again on the face of this Earth, and so I must and shall say, it's a ""die, die must watch"" kinda feeling. It puts a smile on my face every episode whether good or hilariously bad, and farewell, hasta la vista to these zombie-fied girls which punch a good heartbeat into this series. Well done, MAPPA, CyGames and Avex Pictures (which this series is a collab! Suckerpunch!)!";Recommended
9;Zombieland Saga;Ethan_07;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ethan_07;9;Zombieland Saga is entertaining. And that's a fact.  Zombieland Saga, preys on your attention with its well-timed editing. It feeds on it. Whenever there are events unraveling, you'll notice how one action can completely flip the mood of the situations. These comedic moments can envelop the show because of the reaction shots on the characters whenever something came up. A look at their facial expressions and another look at the situation. That's all you need to evoke emotions. The right pace.  The art is also done so well that it can mimic the reactions that can make you laugh. Of course, no one can forget the various role-playing and voice intonation switching by the voice actor of the manager. He can light up the mood, tense up the situation and pretty much do anything with the silliness bestowed on his character. A close-up on his face and high-pitched voice are his charm and a precious gem that blend well the show.  By still keeping his absurdity going, little by little, the studio pulls you in closer to the characters. It hooks you back to reality, taking you face to face to see what they are looking at. As it goes on, more and more little stories unravel to tickle your bone and warm your heart. Rolling heads, undead bodies, awkward CGI dancing animation are all its embodiment that take you a step closer into their zombie world.  In the end, Zombieland Saga has introduced an idol group known as Franchouchou to the world. A group of zombie girls fighting to take every chance and every breath they can, to save Saga and tell the world that they are - alive.;Recommended
10;Zombieland Saga;AngeVGC;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AngeVGC;8;"Zombieland Saga is your stereotypical horror show with zombies.Nah,of course not,I'm just pulling a leg here.But,that is actually what MAL portrayed the show to be in its initial stage and with very little information,low expectations were immediately setted for the show.However,those very expectations will soon be exceeded.Let's start the actual review.Zombieland Saga is an anime about a group of undead zombies forming an idol group under the brilliant leadership of their manager,Kotarou,in their quest to accomplish Kotarou's goal of saving the Japanese prefacture,Saga.(I feel like this may be the show's way ofmaking a parody of idol anime settings like Love Live that requires the group to save the school.)This general plot was whipped straight at the viewers after the 1st episode which disguised itself as the stereotypical zombie horror show that it isn't.I got to say that it was pretty good publicity as this is the first ""horror"" anime that anime fans will see in Fall 2018 and will watch this show purely to see whether this ""horror anime"" will turn out great.To generally summarise this anime,this is a comedy idol show that throws a lot of ridiculous moments and a huge meme on its own while it is also able to get serious when the show requires it to be.Now,I'll start discussing on the various parts of the anime that made me give it a score of 8.(There will be spoilers in this review as examples to substantiate certain points.)  The story in its own is of course,ridiculously simple.Our main protagonist,Sakura,gets whacked by a van,just normal everyday problems,and became a zombie,gets pulled in the idol group under Kotarou and the story continues to show the exploits of our zombie friends.The story is not particularly amazing but it is pretty good as compared to other ""idol"" shows due to its innovative ways of presenting the idol genre through the funny and interesting perspective of our zombie friends.  The Art of this show is not particularly noteworthy in general.But,there are a few instances where the aesthetics of the show shines.For example,the show uses CGI during the earlier episodes to highlight how awkward and bad our Zombie idol group was when it comes to performing while simultaneously making a joke out of how other idol anime uses the CGI effect on a daily basis.The show then contrast this with using 2D animation when the group starts improving to show the visual improvement of the group,something that is lacking in most idol anime.The animation is also pretty fluid when the characters make over the top actions which made the scene extra hilarious.Therefore,although the general artstyle is mediocre,the way they animated the show is brilliant and innovative and is something other idol anime can learn from.  Let us move on to the audio aspect of the show.The OST is ok,nothing praiseworthy but good noneoftheless.The idol songs are surprisingly good,I enjoyed every single one of them.They are generally on par with other idol anime in terms of its good quality.However,the most noteworthy thing about the audio of this show is the intro.The way the absolutely mind-boggling visuals were complemented by the equally ridiculous intro song made the intro a must-watch,this brilliant masterpiece should not be skipped.Lastly,the ending isn't as good as the opening but it is a good reminder that the show is not pure comedy and does have serious elements to it.(Backstory of some of our zombie friends and their respective arcs)  Let us talk about the characters now.With a huge of 7 zombie girls and our godly manager,there will definitely be good and bad points about the characters of the show.On one hand,characters like Yugiri(lily to a smaller extent,outside her own arc) are certaintly neglected and feels like the cast may have expanded too much and have filler characters.But,the show still manages to add colour to the rest of the main cast,even though some of these characters have little screen time.Firstly,THE LEGENARY YAMADA TAE,an all-time favourite among fans of the show,certaintly lives up to her legendary status.Even though Tae doesn't talk in the show and little is known about her past self,she still manages to captivate the hearts of the viewers with her hilarious and insane stunts.Next,out idol pair,Ai and Junko,although not as amazing as Tae,are still essential to the show as a whole in providing serious analysis on the generation gap and their conflicting ideals on how an idol should act.Lily,although a weak character outside her arc,has shed light on how someone could lose their initial vision after acquiring fame and fortune,hurting their child unknowingly.Her arc is pretty good and is one of the most emotional episodes of the anime.Sakura,our main main girl,is actually not particularly amazing but is often the ""sane"" one of the group,though this is not the case for some of the episodes.The last of the zombie girls,Saki,is a reckless biker gangster whose own undoing is her own recklessness,she is also the leader of the group though she does not act like one well,which actually adds to the comedy aspect of the show.Lastly,we have the wise yet most ridiculous character of the show,Kotarou.Do I even need to spell it out?This man's weird antics never fails to make me laugh and on top of that,he is like a father figure of the group who is helping the zombie girls during difficult times under the guise of his crazy persona,this man is a godsend,best character of the show easily.  Overall,this show is pretty enjoyable,there will be WTF moments initially but once the show gets going after their whole publicity stunt,it gets really good and will sure to bring smiles to you.If you expect a horror anime,this is not the show for you,but if you want to watch a comedy show that will help you get through tough times and bring you a smile after your busy day at work,then this is the show for you.This show,in my opinion,is a revolutionary idol anime that brings a whole new option to the idol genre,therefore,this show is also easily one of the top idol anime out there and imo,is better than even Love Live and the other top idol anime.";Recommended

Everything down to the voice acting, style, and writing is so amazing and filled with so much love. And those who are worried for the songs, DON'T YOU WORRY MY HOMIE MAPPA HAS YOU COVERED! MAPPA time and time again has proven themselves to be a wonderful studio, from hajime no ippo to kakegururi to banana fish. The studio behind this masterpiece of comedy, drama, and idol love really hit it out of the ball park again. Every character is truly someone to love in some shape or form, and heck the god himself KOTARO TASUMI (the manager of the idol group) must be an elder god from the sheer amount of personality he exudes...the man is the true legend (sorry Tae fans). I would highly recommend anyone from non-idol fans to idol fangirls/boys to sit down and dedicate time to watch this show. To quote a friend- ""I trust MAPPA with my life"" and you should to...

12;Zombieland Saga;Its-Maki-kun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Its-Maki-kun;10;First, let me make myself clear. I am never invested into any idol anime. Never. And for an idol anime managed to make me drowned into idol anime for the first time, it is a very great achievement for that anime and a proof of how good that anime concept to make me invest myself to this particular genre. This anime took a concept that seemed won't work but work anyway and made a fresh breath of air into the genre of idols. So, grab your light sticks and prepare a towel to wipe away your sweats after enjoying undead girls reviving your heart with their songs and stories. This is an original anime by MAPPA, this is Zombieland Saga.  Like I said before, this anime excels in dragging many audiences by its absurd yet interesting concept that is zombies becoming idols. It might be very simple if you hear it but from that alone, we could already get very interesting back stories from each of the member particularly how they ended up die. And from there, Zombieland Saga easily built character developments from how they overcome their past and keep living (ironically). This is why every member of Franchouchou has a very great character development including the one who can't speak any word, the Legendary Tae Yamada. Yes, I think Tae-chan is the embodiment of how much Franchouchou grow overtime. The other girls were the ones who taught her how to be more human and while she still could not speak until the very end, she is shown to treasure her relationship with Franchouchou by trying her best to snap Sakura just like the others.  Then the music, the most important component of the idols. I must say, I love the songs very much. I don't know why but every song they sang made this feeling of hype and happiness in my heart. It made me want to chant along their song and I think it is very important for any idol anime to make us feeling that way. Not just that, I love how every singer (or seiyuu in this case) have their own vibe of voices and made their songs colorful. From the high pitch girlish voice of Lily to the more adult voice of Yugiri. And to add more, I actually have a special love for the voice of Junko Konno in their songs. Her voice is very strong and I kinda have a soft spot for strong voices. So yeah, I am kinda Yon-Go stan.  Not just the music, I probably want to make Zombieland Saga as the best opening sequence of this season. The opening sequence is very greatly animated with the song that actually very catchy. And from what we learned from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure, opening with sound effects are better and Zombieland Saga used that fact made the opening unskipable.  But yeah, from all of that goodness, I must say that the CG section which happened in every of Franchouchou idol performance could be annoying at first. But I am giving kudos for the CG animation department as their CG sequences are getting better along with the episode counts. It might saying that they are getting used to use the 3D models more and more. Aside from CG animation, the other animation is pretty good with how beautiful their backgrounds which is taken from actual Saga prefecture and redrawed beautifully and as precise as they could. I just love those comparison photos circulating in the internet.  Overall, this anime is a solid candidate for the best anime of this season (along with Bunny Girl Senpai) with its revolutionary concept in the idol anime genre. Great character developments, great musics and opening sequence, beautifully drawn backgrounds, and of course, a perfect gateaway for someone who never invested themselves into idol anime. In the end, I think Kotaro really did save Saga after all.;Recommended
13;Zombieland Saga;shizuido;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shizuido;9;You gotta watch it, at least once.  note: this review is short.  Zombieland Saga is well, not what you'd first expect, without reading the synopsis (duh). After going through certain idol animes, I've never really liked the entire purpose of an idol genre. Which led to me not expecting much from it, ZS pretty much surprised me. At first, the only reason I watched this anime was because of the comedic aspects.  In full complete honesty, plot and storyline are pretty basic. Nothing really to look forward to and nothing really to extremely surprise you. The entire plot is based upon the girls and their feelings, cliche, but what isn't nowadays? Finding the purpose of why to become idols, blah blah, blah. However, it suits what I believe the creators were trying to bring out a horror-comedy-idol-anime. It's enough for the audience to be engaged and want to watch the show.  The animation for the show was great, don't get me wrong, but the animation during the actual performances...it's just it. I completely understand the reason for the animation decision, but just wow. It kind of just jumps out at you. The actual performances (excusing the animation) was amazing. You can tell that the entire cast put effort into it. Hell, I'm still humming the tune today.  But does that matter?  That's up to you, still, give it a few episodes and see what you think.;Recommended
14;Zombieland Saga;Moomochi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moomochi;7;Out of 100 Nobles watching... 75 were impressed! 10 were the same CG critics that leave every time in the modern anime era. 10 Would like a more unified tone and desired more coherent explanations. 5 don't like the premise.  Zombieland Saga is a show with an ambiguous title that makes perfect sense once you actually find out what the premise of the show is. Zombie girl pop idols in Saga prefecture Japan. Ohhhh I get it now (I don’t get it). In all seriousness I don’t want to give away too much of how this show starts as it has some great first episodes that serve to hook you in.  The show is essentially an Idol anime with a Zombie flavor, but first and foremost the show is a black comedy. It’s been fairly standard practice these last few seasons as seen with Uma Musume that it’s necessary to put an extra twist onto an Idol anime for it to stand out and get noticed and Zombieland has quirk in spades.  The story follows aspiring Zombie-girl idol group Franchouchou in their quest to revitalize the prefecture of Saga, Japan with their music. The various members are all “Idols” of sorts from their own time period spanning decades to centuries (in the case of one member who is a feudal era Courtesan). The show uses a mix of comedic situations, dark humor, and fast paced scene transitions to present what I would have called an extremely bizarre experience as a whole if I hadn’t watched Pop Team Epic already. The girl’s designs are all unique and they mostly have their own qualities to spur proper best girl debates (although everyone knows Tae Yamada is best).  What seemed to keep the show down was trying to deal with its own premise. Episodes never seemed to settle on exactly what kind of tone they wanted to take with characters later in the show tackling issues unique to being undead such as being a performer when you were alive, someone might recognize you as a performer now or how about dealing with the trauma of everyone you know having grown old?  Even in the episodes where the show decides it’s going to tackle these sorts of issues, we get a very Japanese payoff. “My father thought I was dead all these years and seeing me on stage yesterday is really messing with him because I look just like his dead daughter, but I can’t just TELL him I’m a zombie because…uhh…hrm…Oh well he’s accepted my passing.” No sir I don’t like it. Not one bit. I need closure, but maybe that’s just me?  The songs from the performances in the show were quite good. I would say they’re a solid level of enjoyment over what comes to mind when thinking of typical idol songs. The OP however is absolutely fire. Grade A stuff. It’s going right into the mix list. Unfortunately, about 3/4ths of the dancing performances in the show were the same low-grade CG garbage that’s typical of the genre. I get it, it’s cheap, but having portions of the dances in the show be gorgeous and others flip back and forth to stiff 3d models is painfully jarring. The rest of the show was very visually appealing for the most part. The show had a very nice light palette, great stylistic choices, and certainly produced some fine memes for the anime community.   Overall, I’d say Zombieland Saga was an enjoyable experience that’s worth a watch and deserves a second course. I felt a genuine joy at some of the inspiring moments and empathy during the sad moments. It definitely had some loose bits that could use better stitching together, but the power of comedy and genki charm goes a long way to make a show worthy of being in someone’s anime collection.;Recommended
15;Zombieland Saga;JiangHaoyi1979;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JiangHaoyi1979;7;"OOOOOHAYOOOOO!!!!!!  REVIEW NO JIKAN DAYOOOOOOO!!!!!!!  Ok, another idol theme anime has ended as usual it has a rather cliche story plot in it , where is never goes out of style , cu'z it is only secondary , in fact the plot always center around the relationships of the group members and as usual there will always be some drama and all kinds of things that seemingly were just added to simply just force it, but in all aspect it was just simply about the songs that them anisong fanatics would pirate it in any downloadable song sites leaving them composer with little or close to nothing when it comes to profits. But, if I were to be asked if this was a good anime????? Well , I'd say that it was but not that good in terms of how the story goes, so here are my ratings:  Story-mediocre 5: Ok so them girls were Zombies , they died and were resurrected by some loud mouth nut case Tatsumi Kotaru or Inui since he and Sakura knew each other from before, when Sakura was still alive, since series composer, Murakoshi, Shigeru and anime director , Sakai, Munehisa didn't bother tell us audience how he did it, they basically they just focus on the usual drama found in any idol related anime and just bank on the usual eyecandy and the songs.  Art- Mediocre 5: Just like any idol related anime, the art was just all about those fancy dresses or outfits that makes the characters look hot for the girls and cool for the guys.  Sound- Mediocre 5: It's just the songs guys, I just don;t get what a lotta people find anything soooo special about this and why should this category be given a high rating, in fact I pity more about those song writers and composer whose works would be downloaded by a lotta otaku freaks out there from any sites or dark web out there, leavening them song writers and composers out of the blue with less of the profits from their works.  Character- Mediocre 5: In any idol them anime, like the usual, there will always be the lead and the 2nd lead so on and so forth and then adds some force drama on them them you have usual stuff. Ok so them girls have a backstory and we're show how each girls died before being turn into zombies like Junko who died tragically, Ai and Liliy both died bizarrely, Sakura died stupidly, given that she got hit by truck kun twice, Saki dies carelessly , Yuugiri and Tae's deads were unknown since this anime's director didn't even bother to include it, which is UNFORTUNATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Enjoyment - fair 6: I would have like this anime very much despite of the mediocre it has with the usual idol themed anime , but I kinda find it disgusting that the anime at the last few episodes decide to go back to the part of how Sakura got hit by truck kun for the 2nd time, where in my opinion the drama that she feels down should have been used in the 1st or in the mid episode.   Overall-good 7: That's for the song that I find it good, and don't even think about another season of this thing. unless we get to know the backstories of Yuugiri and Tae chan.  THAT'S IT FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";Recommended
16;Zombieland Saga;AbnerA;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AbnerA;8;What is Zombieland Saga? A horror in a zombie apocalypse? A saga in a land full of zombies? Well, none of that. It is actually an idol anime with zombies as the idols. Why the Saga part then, you ask? Because it is set in the Saga Prefecture, Japan.  This is an anime that doesn't take itself seriously. Keep that in mind if you want to watch this show. Most of the early episodes are just comedic episodes with little story progression. You will recognize this immediately at episode 1. With the first scene that may shock you while also being a joke. However, without forgetting to be silly, the later episodes get more serious by showing the stories of each characters in turn.  We have a handful of characters in this anime, I won't talk about all of them in detail but will describe them to some extent. Sakura is our main protagonist. She is an enthusiastic girl who aspired to become an idol. For the others, we have Saki, Lily, Ai, Junko, Yuugiri, and Yamada Tae. Saki was a girl biker. She has a rash personality and has quirks she kept from being in a biker gang. Lily was a child actress. She is the youngest in the cast and has some story involving her father. Ai and Junko was an idol when they were alive, but in different periods of time. Ai has a trauma involving the end of her career, while Junko at first is not content with how much idols have changed. Yuugiri was from the 19th century. She retains a lot of behaviour from that period of time. And last but not least, THE LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE. Basically, she doesn't speak.  Outside of those casts, we have one more character, who is the producer of this idol group. He is Tatsumi Koutarou. He has a wild and manic personality. He speaks in wittily and tends to brush off things he deems unimportant. He constitutes quite a big part of the comedy of the show. In spite all that, he knows what he should do to solve various problems and how to help the group move forward.  Now, this anime being an idol anime, the music is something that needs to be talked about. There are quite a few songs aside from the opening and ending. Some of them are dedicated to its respective characters in their respective episodes. In my opinion, some songs are nice, but the others are just not that good, notably the insert song for Lily's episode. However, as peoples taste in music are different, you can judge the songs yourself.  The animation is nothing amazing. During dance scenes, CG animation is used. I don't know if it's just the source I'm watching or it is the actual quality, but the CG animation is laggy and has just little amount of frames.  All that said, this anime gives a good amount of enjoyment. The comedic aspects are a big part of it. The comedy is most prominent during the early episodes, but not forgotten on the later ones. The comedy might be a bit cringy at times, but it usually succeeds in making you chuckle.  Later episodes focus more on each characters in turn. These are great stories which tell the girls' past before the became zombies and how they deal with it now. I argue that this may be a better part of the anime than the comedy. It successfully captures each characters' personalities and how they develop.  All in all, Zombieland Saga is an idol anime with zombies as their cast, that is filled with comedy, but also doesn't forget their characters. It shows about the past and present of its characters, before and after becoming a zombie. Although the songs and dances might not be spectacular, it is worth watching for the comedy and characters.;Recommended
17;Zombieland Saga;Shinohebi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shinohebi;9;"Idol anime are somewhat of a hit or miss for a lot of people. Whether its the corny story-lines or the janky CG animation of the dancing, there is plenty to complain about in the idol genre. However this is not that kind of review.  Zombieland saga is an out of this world crazy take on the Idol genre as a whole. From its visuals, music and story-telling to its music and character interaction, this anime is a complete other level from other Idol anime (at least in my opinion). The way the anime deals with the harsh realities of death while presenting it alongside a cheery success story of a local startup idol group is a thing to behold.  A zombie idol group, I doubt I could make this stuff up if I tried, and somehow its one of my favourite anime of all time. The meaningful relationships of the characters and the treatment of death and the past as a plot device is a genius move. Never have I cried at a song quite like ""To my Dearest"".  The characters are unique, each one filling the cliche idol roles in unique ways. They have their own arcs and issues to overcome and their designs are indicative of the years they were born (Since most of the girls are from different time periods). The girls also develop songs for the conclusions of their arcs, to help them express their feelings. If you have the time, its more than worth checking out the full bonus album that was released on Spotify.  The music is of course a big focus of Idol shows and it certainly doesn't disappoint here. There are plenty of songs that convey a unique flavor for every character, and despite the use of CG in the dance scenes, one can forgive that when watching glowing lightning zombies...  Its absurd, its colorful, its wacky, Its genuine and its meaningful. An out there entry to Idol genre and one truly worthy of anyone's time, even if you are not that into Idol Anime all that much.";Recommended

It was different and kinda ""revolutionary"" and the ending left you with more questions than answers and that's what I like about it... I would say this was worth a watch ꒰ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ꒱  Story 9/10 The story centers around a group of zombie girls being forced into becoming an idol group by an overzealous manager. Does it sound crazy? Yes. but it's also a new and fresh kind of plot given that this is an Idol anime. It also really good that you have so much mystery to unwrap with it and each episode is just not enough. I also love it that they also put comedy in each episode and that always cracks me up ~  Art 9/10 I really like the art so much, they made all the characters so cute and pretty! Their dance costumes also are so well-thought and so nice to look at it ^^ Don't forget our best boi, Kotaru ~ he is kinda handsome for someone who we never saw his face...  Sound 10/10 The music the group makes in the show is absolutely amazing and every time I hear it, it gives me goosebumps. It is so very catchy and upbeat and it really brings our positive vibes which I myself find singing along to. Lastly, the VAs voices are also good and I have no problem with it  Character 10/10 The characters in the show all have their own personalities and mannerisms and that what makes them unique. I love the diversity each character has and that each of them has different struggles and problems that we watch them overcome and grow as a person..  Enjoyment 10/10 I enjoyed very much to binge it in a day. That's it.  Overall 10/10";Recommended
19;Zombieland Saga;Yves_1943;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yves_1943;8;My first review of an anime called Zombieland Saga. Being a fan of real idols for almost two years now. I initially held no expectations whatsoever when I was first going to watch this show because I have essentially desensitized myself with anything related to the idol industry.  With that in mind, the show pleasantly surprised me when it used a unique concept while sticking to the strengths of an idol concept show. The idea of zombies trying to become competent idols does seem gimmicky personally but the show does well in portraying the characters as all of them are given shown enough for a viewer to slowly start liking them and how they interact with others. We even get to see how most of them died which became part of the reason that the characters start striving towards becoming idols that they can be proud to be. Some having regrets because of the things that have happened in the past as a reason to continue even though they are technically already dead and at the end of the line.  The show also does well with its portrayal of the comedy, even becoming a parody of the idol genre itself sometimes. With the use of cliché moments. A minor spoiler of dialogue here between the characters but I found it funny that the manager used the idol group, Tatsumi Kotarou used the excuse of his group being zombies to overwork them which genuinely gave me a laugh. Poking fun at an industry that is infamous for overworking their idols gave me a bit of an excuse to laugh aloud as I sympathize with the girls. The show itself contains many jokes like that portrayed wonderfully, which part of the reason is because of the wonderful voice actors in this show.  The development of the plot itself is also a good factor. We have a ragtag group of zombies trying to become idols that seemed initially impossible but as you slowly start to see them improve, it rather grows on you. I find that aspect of the show heartwarming since I have experienced loving a group wholeheartedly as they slowly improve from rookies to something that you can be proud of. This may seem fake to some but the actions portrayed in the show and how the characters overcome their struggles genuinely attracted me in a way reminiscent of how I once was attracted to the real thing.  Another aspect of the show I liked a lot is the music surprisingly, as each member has it owns impression of it or a solo song that describes their character surprising well that also spans different genres of music to Vocaloid all the way to jazz. The portrayal of their own story, the group of Franchouchou through the music is also done uniquely, with their struggles, being emphasized a lot more than normal because of harder circumstances but also shows the passion of said group to continue and achieve greater heights.  Overall, if you are looking for a show that will give you a great time watching while also having great characters I would recommend this show, though it does have its flaws they are minor for me and did not inhibit my overall enjoyment of the anime itself.;Recommended
0;Zombieland Saga;TakaCode;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TakaCode;6;"If there was a word to describe Studio MAPPA it would be disappointing. Being the spiritual successor for Studio Madhouse many of the shows least, in my opinion, fell flat in they face mainly because MAPPA loves the play the field spell card called style over substance where the writing for these shows seemed to fall by the side in favour of pretty colours and flashing scenes. Because of that I grown to dislike MAPPA as a whole as they seem to prioritised flashing visuals over storytelling. Zombieland Saga is, unfortunately, no exception to this as despite the show being advertised as a parody idol anime that had a lot of potential to be good. Unfortunately it the end it ended being another generic seasonal anime that you will easily forget once the anime season is over.  If I had two words to describe the story of Zombieland Saga it would be missed potential as the series had potential to be this fun parody of the idol genre as a whole would made me laugh for days. Unfortunately as the series progresses the series starts falling apart as it eventually showed it's true itself where it ended up being a generic idol anime that barely doesn't do anything different apart from the zombie-idol gimmick. Before I talk about the problems with Zombieland Saga I'm going to talk to quickly talk about the things that I liked about Zomebieland Saga.  The one thing that sold me watching Zombieland Saga is that it was a nice parody of the idol genre as it showcases all the tropes and elements that were using in the idol anime genre and no surprise the first 4 episodes actually did just that as it never took itself too seriously.  The best and most memorable part of Zombieland Saga was the rap battle in episode 2. Not only the rap battle was very hilarious and entertaining to watch from start to finish, but it was very well set up and timed narrative and visually  If only the rest of the series was as consistently good as the rap battle in episode 2 and with that said it's times to dive into this show problems.  Remember when I said that Zombieland is a nice parody of the idol genre. Well the second half did something that it should have not done and that is devolved into a generic copy and paste idol anime where not even the zombie idol gimmick can fully save it. Many character drama aspects in this show were copied and pasted from other anime of it's generic and the dialogue just became trying. It did have some story moments with Saki and Sakura but other than that the show complete loss of what it made it unique in the first as it sadly devolved into a generic idol anime.  The worst thing about Zombieland Saga is that simply not all that funny as many of the comedy comes in the form of characters doing dumb things and screaming. The comedy timing was terrible for the most part and many of the jokes ended up becoming forced and boring. Overall, despite the show being a decent parody of the idol genre that has an interesting zombie gimmick it ultimately ended falling apart into this generic style over substance anime that lost a lot of charm.  The characters in Zombieland Saga were just okay. Not memorable but at the same time they are not bad.  This may come off as an unpopular opinion, but I don't like the producer Tasumi all that much. Yes, he had some cool moments every now and then but a lot of the time I found him pretty irritating especially when most of his dialogue is consistent screaming and screeching at set idol. As for the zombie-idol girls themselves well I thought there was one note. Yes, there was 2 expectations being Saki and Sakura (which I will talk about in a bit) but other than that the zombie idol girls are nothing more but idol cliches on screen.  Saki was by far my favourite character in Zombieland Saga as well being the most entertaining. She may appear to a typical badass jerk at first especially to Sakura as the series progresses she slowly starts open up to Sakura after proving that she isn't as completely gutless. I really liked her character development in the series and it really shows in episode 9 where she meets up with her old best friend and biker gang.  She proves to Reiko daughter that if she contiines acting the way that Saki did when she was alive then she would end up falling in the same fate that caused Saki to die.  What really made Saki my favourite character happens in episode 2 during the rap battle with Sakura "" Who cares if you've got memories"" ""you won't get to see your friends and your Tamagotchi's long dead"" We're done got it?!  Sakura herself was a pretty good character. She as this typical idol protagonist archetype at first however as the series progresses she becomes more of an interesting and somewhat relatable character that we can relate. Her backstory in episode 11 was the prime example of this as perfectly showcases of what Sakura would have been as a person if she didn't get hit by truck kun and as a result, she starts going into heroic BSoD.  The visuals in Zombieland Saga are a mixed bag. While it had a solid colour art-style that fits well with the setting of the series I feel the animation especially the CGI moments hold the visuals back from being great. The models both the human, and zombies are nicely drawn appealing to look at. The background scenery was decent, and lighting was solid.  The animation itself ranged from pretty good to okay. That's about it really.  The only thing left I say about the show visuals is the use of CGI which was horrendous. I understand the show was meant to parody CGI in idol anime but there's a difference between actually parodying the CGI and actually making worse than thing that your parodying.  For a show that mainly focus of music I thought the soundtrack for Zombieland Saga to be underwhelming at best. It's not a soundtrack I consider to be awful, but it failed to impress me especially when many of the tracks in Zombleland Saga just comes off as generic background idol noise. While the soundtrack was lacking the insert songs completely make it up because they are actually pretty damm good. My favourite insert songs in the show would be Mezame Returner and Dance.  The opening theme Adabana Necromancy sung by zombie idols was a decent opening theme. While I really liked the opening visuals for it, I cannot say the same thing for the song itself which I found to be pretty forgetful.  The ending theme Hikari e sung by the zombie idols was a pretty enjoyable ending that has a nice clamming song that contained good-looking visuals art.  The Seiyuus in the sub did a pretty good job with the roles that they were given. As much I don't like Tatsumi I thought Mamoru Miyano did a fantastic job voicing the character. Asami Tano as Saki was a also another great performance as she really made this hot headed badass girl come to life. The dub, on the other hand, was pretty bad as it's filled with mediocre to bad performances that actually ruins key scenes in the anime. Not only that but the comedy in the dub version is pretty insufferable to listen. Also let's not forget how Funimation was incredibly lazy when they decided to do the rap battle episode 2 because frankly they didn't bother to dub at all.  Zombieland Saga is a bizarre series to judge. There were some strong areas that I really liked like Saki and Sakura, the rap battle in episode 2 and the idol parody stuff unfortunately the flaws in Zombieland Saga outweigh the good. Not only that but the same the series got to the second half the series devolved into this generic flashy idol anime that has a zombie gimmick that contains repetitive/forced comedy and underwhelming characters.  If the series actually stocked to of idol parody routes than this show would have been one of the better animes of 2018 but we ultimately didn't get that and what we got instead is a typical idol anime that could have been a lot better.  It's not a bad series by any means but at the same time it's not all that memorable outside the rap battle and Saki's character development.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zombieland Saga;MagicalMahou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MagicalMahou;5;Zombieland Saga is a comedy about a group of zombie girls being marketed as idols by a red suit-toting weirdo through unconventional and sometimes embarrassing means of gaining popularity.  Zombieland Saga is an idol drama about a group of zombie girls on a quest to become idols but are held back the the implications of their deaths, their past traumas, their memories and the era they lived in.   Zombieland Saga works great as either show.   Zombieland Saga doesn't work at all as both.   By trying to juggle these two ideas, it becomes a tangled up and comes short of fulfilling either of those premises satisfyingly. It's not that the show transitioning between these ideas are jarring (in fact, it does that just fine), but rather, by trying to keep the first half of episodes comedy then leaving all the heavier stuff for later kind of chokes the pacing of those. As a result, character arcs and story threads, while fine, leave so much to be desired, especially with regards to Sakura.  The animation is fine. I enjoyed a lot of the comedic storyboarding, the hilarious character acting and expressions in early episode (1-5), as well entire sequences of Tatsumi Kotarou's screentime and dialogue.  Music is kinda shit. I didn't remember a single track, much less the BGM, so not much comment there other than forgettable.  The voice actors did a splendid job and, again, a ton of the script from the comedy episodes were fantastic and the did a good job with those.  Overall, it's a fine show. It's freaking hilarious when it wants to be and the writing is pretty alright, if not really unsatisfying. I recommend it if you have the time. (6/10);Mixed Feelings
2;Zombieland Saga;MainstreamBean;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MainstreamBean;5;"This is my first review, so please bear with me.  Although having not watched much if not any idol anime, it was intriguing to see a spin on this conventional genre. With a synopsis such as ""The peace these seven girls experience will suddenly be destroyed. By the living dead... zombies,"" I couldn't help but check the show out. Unfortunately, by the end of it all, it just felt like it fell flat.  To get straight to the point and not waste any time, let's look at the positives of this show. Firstly, I'll admit that it was quite enjoyable for what it was at times. For example, our main girl getting hit by truck-kun was a nice addition to the amount of destruction he has already done throughout the entire history of anime, and he may never stop... Events such as the infamous rap battle, and the general interactions between the idols could be pretty funny at times.  Next, the character designs like of Saki and the rest of the group gave a unique style to each of the characters (exceptions being Junko and Ai, they look like copies of one another to an extent). Facial expressions were pretty nice, and to each of their own had a distinct sense of personality. The aforementioned Saki with her rough and daring ways of going about things, Lily being very ecstatic, and Yuugiri with her calm and collected tone made for characters that could stand on their own. It all may have felt pretty generic I might add, but for me it's at least worth mentioning as something it didn't completely fail on. However, it's nothing to write home about.  The opening theme was pretty cool with the visuals I guess.  However, the negatives of this show made for the biggest gripes.  The art was mixed. I had mentioned the character designs before as being fine, and the backgrounds and style of the show were pretty good and felt appropriate , but the consistent use of CGI dances however were absolutely horrendous.  The story, obviously being a parody, wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. This isn't a negative in in of itself, and is actually completely fine, however it seemed as if it couldn't hold that mentality together. Character development is fine and all, but serious overtones and unneeded drama was apparent throughout multiple parts of the story, and it almost felt like it was straying away from it's own purpose that it established from the beginning, as being a fun comedical straight forward show.  The music didn't catch on with me, and wasn't really engaging, just sounded pretty meh.  The manager could not manage himself. His loud and obnoxious yelling was not funny, and only set himself up as a failed comedian. Loud does not equal funny, and he should have either stuck to being mature as shown occasionally, or just a running gag. Combining the two just doesn't sit well (even if being voiced by Miyano Mamoru).  Talking about running gags, the whole policeman and sudden interaction between the Idols was just as equally as bad, but thankfully it wasn't so repetitive and recurring that I had to sit through it constantly like the manager.  Lastly, possible spoilers or not, but it was hinted at several times where a couple of guys were interested in finding more about these idols and their true identity so to say. However, absolutely nothing happened with this, and only seemed to waste time, falsely leading the viewer to expect something interesting and dramatic to happen.  Overall, this anime could have been better. If it had only stuck with what it set out to do, it could have been a pretty decent, or even good show. If you like the show and enjoy it despite my personal criticisms, that's totally fine, to each of their own. It was alright while it lasted, but again, ended falling flat with the issues I had with it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, and if their is anything I can improve on, feel free to let me know!";Mixed Feelings
3;Zombieland Saga;Buuubbblesss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Buuubbblesss;6;"[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ONE PUNCH MAN, FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST, ZOMBIELAND SAGA, AND YOUR LIE IN APRIL]  Yes, I know everyone and their dementia-ridden grandma has already reviewed this. So rather than just talking about what it is, we’re going to attempt to fix Zombieland Saga. This show had way too much potential to simply accept its failures and move on. That section will be at the very end before the conclusion.   Few things are more frustrating than wasted potential, and that phrase to me is quickly becoming synonymous with Zombieland Saga. This show had serious potential. From a parody perspective, ZLS had the potential to reach the holy grounds of One Punch Man. Its premise is THAT GOOD. But you can see the rating I gave it. You know how this is gonna go.  ~Story/Writing~ (Contains light spoilers for One Punch Man and BIG SPOILERS for Zombieland Saga)  The premise of Zombieland Saga is simple: an absolute mad lad resurrects dead girls and turns them into zombie idols. Right off the bat, it’s important to note how that sentence makes you feel as an audience member. The premise should lead you to a single conclusion about what you’d expect: this will be a comedy/parody. However, the reason ZLS is so disappointing is because that assumption is correct. ZLS’ premise is that of a comedy or parody/satire. But ZLS the anime adaptation is only partially a comedy. At its heart, its an attempt at drama. And it fails spectacularly at being a drama.  The first 2-5 episodes are indeed based around comedy, and they are powder kegs of canned comedy. Seriously, the first 2 episodes of ZLS are incredible. They’re funny, satirical, and built entirely around the comedic structure of its premise. Here’s what I mean: (This will spoil episodes 1, 2, 4, and 5)  Episode 1- They win over the crowd due to a mental hiccup that occurs in the zombies that looks like headbanging. This hiccup was setup in the scene prior. Set-up and payoff!  Episode 2- They win over the crowd because Tae's limbs keep popping off. This was set-up by the scene prior, when Mizuno's arms popped off when she tried to climb the fence. Set-up and payoff!  In episode 4, Yuugiri makes a comment about the girls getting the opportunity to ""wash away the decay from Franchouchou"", prompting the other girls to check themselves to make sure they don't stink. This is not random, as the previous episode had a scene where they talked about how zombies smelled bad. Set-up and payoff!  Also in episode 4, the introduction sequence implies that it's going to be a hot springs episode. Once you as a viewer have settled into that fact, they change it up and tell the girls that none of them are going to the hot springs because they can't go outside without their make-up on. So that's a subversion based on the genre they’re parodying and the logic that forms the premise of the show! They do end up going later, but that ends when Sakura’s head pops off and floats to the surface of the water like a zombie movie. That’s funny! Plus, it was set-up in episode 2 that their heads popped off. Set-up and payoff!  Episode 5- The set-up here is they're going to compete in a mud race thing. So they do, but the twist on it is that once they're muddy, they can't rinse off because that would remove their makeup and everyone would see they're zombies. So, they have to stay muddy the entire time. That's funny! Then when they get Tae to tear off her muddy shirt to reveal the group t-shirt, she's still wearing the drive-in shirt from the first half of the episode. Set-up and payoff!  All throughout this, Mamoru Miyano’s performance as Koutarou drives the rest of the comedy. For the first 5 or so episodes, he is a firecracker of performance comedy that never failed to make me giggle when he’s on screen. It sounds like Miyano is dicking around in the studio and the outcome is glorious. It’s also paced out nicely, as him yelling in every scene would get old really fast.  There also good situational comedy like when they're in Ushino (spelling?) and they have Tae hold onto the rope at the shrine, which of course she mindlessly thrashes around which rings the bell! That's funny!  Unfortunately for me (because I loved the first 5 episodes) and everyone else, ZLS implodes after episode 5. It stops trying to be funny and parodical and settles for drama. And it DOES NOT WORK. Story/Writing 5/10  ~Characters~ (Contains spoilers for Zombieland Saga, Fullmetal Alchemist, and maybe spoilers for Your Lie in April?)  The first misstep that kicks it in motion is the introduction of character backstories. Now before I say anything else, I have no problem with the writers including these backstories. They’re plenty funny and would be great sources of satirical comedy. The problem is, the writers don’t seem to understand that they’re satirical.  Mizuno's backstory is played to be sad but having her die by getting struck by lightning on-stage is a really silly death to attach to a sad subplot. This is especially true after they show her burnt, crispy body still standing there on stage with her finger in the air, covered in black. That’s a comedic set-up (like the ones I mentioned above) that’s played straight, which cannot work because it's just too over-the-top to function as a serious plot point.  The same goes for all the other backstories too. Part of Sakura’s backstory is that she was delayed getting to her big exam because she had to help too many grannies. Lily died because she had a heart attack that was a result of her finding a wayward hair on her chin. She’s also revealed to be male in the scene. You see what I mean? Those are comedy set-ups. But they play it straight, and it makes no sense. If you're going for comedy or satire there, you play the ensuing scene where Lily and her dad meet for laughs. You don't make it a tear-jerker. That doesn't make any sense because the way Lily died was so stupid and absurd it cannot be played straight. ZLS seems to want to have its cake and eat it too. In that, I mean it wants to have stupid silly deaths the audience will laugh it but still try to make them tragic too. It doesn't work, it's too silly to work as tragedy.  Ultimately, mixing comedy and tragedy is a risky move. In most cases, it backfires or doesn't have a good balance, resulting in a murky grey area between comedy and drama that just doesn't mix well enough to function as either. On one end of that spectrum, you could have a really good drama that's weighed down by ill-advised attempts at comedy. We'll call this the ""Your Lie in April"" tier. The biggest mistake you can make in this tier is placing the comedy in scenes they aren't appropriate in, which ruins the drama and the mood. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a good example of how to do this right, as its comedy was not only good, but placed in narrative openings that would work with comedy. At the end of the reveal about what the dog/human chimera is, Winry doesn't bust in and throw a wrench at someone's head. Because obviously, that would be stupid and ruin the moment. Your Lie in April apparently missed the memo on that because it tries to be funny at the end of fantastic character moments.  On the other end of that spectrum, you have Zombieland Saga. There's a bit too much drama that isn't interesting in ZLS, but its comedy scenes (first 5 episodes) are hilarious. They would have been better served scaling back the boring drama and focusing on comedy, because that's what ZLS is good at. It isn't good at being dramatic or sad. Its attempts at that are boring. That's what makes the shift in tone after episode 5 so disappointing. The first 5 episodes are powder kegs of comedy, yet for some reason they decide to shove in drama and it just doesn't work. It's important to have a nice mix of comedy and drama if you're going to try to mix the 2, but ZLS blows it by banking too much on its weak drama when it would function perfectly as a pure comedy. Zombies + idols is a set-up that screams comedy! That should be the focus!   Getting back to characters; as it turns out, Miyano's schtick wears off about half way through the show, mostly because they stopped mixing up his antics. Him yelling wasn't going to work on its own as a comedy pillar through the whole season and they should've known that. The real reason Miyano's schitck grows tired though is because they stop building comedic scenes around the other aspects of the show, which leaves Miyano as the main source of comedy. That was never going to work; it was a guarantee to get old once the other sources of comedy dried up.  And then there’s the pacing debacle that occurs during episodes 10 and 11. They go back to the initial incident where Sakura was hit by a car and turned into a zombie, which is just as confusing in the show as it sounds. Initially, I thought she got hit by ANOTHER car. I couldn’t believe they were going back to the events of the first episode right before the finale. For anyone who doesn’t know, it is generally not a good idea to stop everything that’s happening and introduce a new sub-plot right before the finale. The episodes leading up to a finale are supposed to be putting all the pieces the plot has introduced into place and building tension for the final episode. Going back to episode 1 and going “hey actually this happened so now Sakura is feeling this” is garbage writing. But the real problem is where in the story its placed. Why is it placed near the finale? This is a confused mess. These events take place at the very start of the show. Why isn't it placed there? I'll tell you why. Because the writers were like ""wait we need to focus on Sakura right before the last episode so it seems like we're adhering to the second act of the 3-arc story structure where the main character is at their lowest"". It's so transparent it's despicable. Characters 4/10  ~Music/Sound~  All the vocal performances are great, too. Obviously Mamoru steals the show, but all of the idol characters are voiced well, too. Every character sounds like what you would expect them to sound like, with enough personal flair to make them feel memorable. You might think that is rather useless praise, but I just finished Naruto Shipudden and they used the same adult actors for characters like Shino and Shikamaru during flashbacks. That means 7-year old Shino has the same voice as 17-year old Shino. So yeah, good voice work is something to be appreciated and this is some good shit. Sound 9/10  ~Art/Animation~  Visually, ZLS is solid. In terms of hand-drawn animation, art, color palette, character designs, and background art, it’s great. The character designs in particular are extremely well done. If you look at any one character without context, you could probably determine what they’re like based off their appearance and how they’re drawn. To me, that’s the mark of great character designs.  The real problem with ZLS visually is the CG idol performances. The frame rate on their dancing is too slow and makes it look choppy. It was somewhat distracting when Love Live did it, but in those shows it was pretty smooth. Here, it’s too rough to not be distracting. Art/Animation 8/10  ~Enjoyment~  I don’t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox. I will leave this score blank.   ~FIXING ZOMBIE LAND SAGA~  There are 2 routes you could take to fix ZLS:  1. Make it a pure comedy. That means cutting out the bland drama and focusing on creative ways to build scenes around the characters being zombie idols. This is what the first 2 episodes were.  2. Go for parody/satire. That means keeping the goofy backstories, but keeping the tongue planted firmly in cheek. One Punch Man is a great example of sincere satire, in that One Punch Man parodied the dumber aspects of superpower shounens while embracing what makes them fun. Take for example the scene where Mumen Rider is fighting the Deep Sea King in OPM season 1. The dialogue and structure of the scene indicate it's doing that ""the people believe in me and that gives me the strength to win!"" bullshit that runs rampant in a lot of other shounens. But instead of that actually giving Mumen Rider the ability to defeat the Deep Sea King, he just keeps getting annihilated. This is hilarious, as they keep building up to the moment where you expect Rider to win out, but instead he keeps getting knocked on his ass. It's a bait-and-switch based on the genre, and it's what made One Punch Man season 1 work as a comedy. This comedic structure is a good foundation to build a sincere satire with given ZLS' premise.  The source material already appears to be satirizing idol and zombie tropes, so flipping the switch from drama to satire would be the easiest path to fixing it.  Outside of those 2 options, there are ways to improve it if you wanted to keep it a drama (I don’t know why you would but I digress):  3. You could go for more of a gray area approach, although it wouldn’t work as well for a comedic premise. You’d still have to sprinkle in light bits of character drama, but I think it could still work. I’d also want to iron out the cliché narrative items for the plot, as they would drag the show down regardless of approach.  The ""we need each other”, and ""the group isn't the same without you"" tropes became clichés right around when Love Live came out, so that particular plot point should have been avoided. Instead, it comes in during episode 3 and it is just lame as it always is.  They could've gone in a much more interesting direction by having one or both girls that were having doubts actually leave for good. Maybe they could have instead made one of them proficient in their past life at something else, making them able to go out on their own and try their hand at whatever that thing is. They could've done a Perfect Blue thing where they end up questioning their decision to pursue other interests and it drives them insane while the group takes off without them. That would have been the more career-oriented twist they could have done.  They also could have gone the Mawaru Penguindrum route and have the same thing happen, but make the girl feel guilty for abandoning their friends, even though the group in question has become massively popular. Or they could have gone gray area and shown her doing whatever she thinks is her purpose in her second life at certain parts of the story, and then maybe she shows up at the final concert to root them on? Anything other than the cliché ""oh yay they came back!"".  Those routes would work well to fix 2 big problems that reared their heads as soon as they went the drama route: the girls go along with becoming zombie idols far too easily, and no one suffers severe emotional distress from realizing they’re dead. For some of them, everyone they’ve ever known is dead. Don't you think it might mess someone up pretty bad if they woke up and you told them everyone they know has been dead for decades? But ZLS elects to ignore that. This isn’t an issue if it’s a comedy because it doesn’t impact the narrative that much and it wouldn’t be compatible with comedy. After all, it’s hard to write good comedy if you insist on explaining every single detail of what’s happening. But if you’re going to make it a drama, that issue has to be addressed. The more seriously you take your story, the more seriously your plot will be looked it and examined, as the story is what drives any drama.  The other issue that could be solved by having a character branch off on their own path is motivation. It’s odd that none of the girls already have dreams and aspirations they still wanted to pursue. If they did, it wouldn’t necessarily be impossible to achieve just because they’re zombies. Could none of those dreams be similarly reached using make-up and maybe perfume? It isn't a big deal but it annoys me considering the plot shifts to drama and then ignores the obvious dramatic conflicts that would arise from its premise. Even worse, it ignores these so it can indulge in the trappings of idol anime.  Lastly, if they wanted to keep this a drama, they should have made Saga more of a focus in the narrative. If it had jettisoned the silly backstories and used those 3-4 episodes to expand on Saga and why Koutarou wanted to revitalize it, it could’ve done wonders to flesh out his characters as well as give the audience more reason to care. As it stands, Koutarou is a purely comedic character with little to humanize him. Again, that works in a comedy but it’s strange in a drama. If you want to make a good drama, you have to give the audience a reason to care about the drama. Zombie Land Saga failed to do that.  ~CONCLUSION~  Everything that’s wrong with ZLS can be traced back to one problem: it is a comedy/parody that’s played like a drama. You just can’t take a parody and force it to be a drama. If they wanted this to be a drama, the characters' motivations to revitalize Saga as idols would have to be expanded far more. That detail literally doesn't matter at all if it's a comedy or satire. It would be a detriment. But you can't change a comedy into a drama and keep the same story structure! That makes no sense!  The comedy side of this show is fantastic, but the drama-based idol aspect of this show sucks. It's good in the first 2 episodes because it's driven by the premise, but after that it starts falling into all the trappings of Love Live. When it tries, the comedy is gold. So how do you grade something that's half good, half bland, and a general mishandling of a premise with great potential? That's a textbook 6.  Zombieland Saga gets a 6/10.";Mixed Feelings

BANG, dead, death metal, house of horrors, zombies, Saga, stage, ""Music, COME ON!!!!"".  Episode 1: Story - 10 Art - 10 Sound - 10 Character - 10 Enjoyment - 10  The rest: Story - 4 Art - 8 Sound - 8 Character - 7 Enjoyment - 6  This anime has the most hilarious first episode ever. If you think you will not like the anime, go watch the first episode only. It is hilarious, ridiculous and the best parody there is. First 2 minutes and I was already amazed and laughing out over the black humor development. It is WTF?! all the way in. The pace is amazing and keeps you amazed, so I will not spoil anything about the first episode in this review.  Well, if all episode were like the first, we would have the best parody, the most ridiculous and funny idol anime out there. The change of environment, the self-irony of how small the Saga prefecture is (I do not know if that's true, it is what the anime makes fun of) are superb. But then someone from the staff decided that this won't be a parody, but rather comedic idol anime... When the anime take the more serious tone of how the life (or in this case the zombie life) of an idol can be, it lost its appeal and become fairly average anime. There is a glimpse of zombie jokes here and there, but now it gets a little bit boring from time to time. Instead of addressing problems of the small prefecture, the idol life and the difficulties in ironic way, it addresses them literally in the story as a slice of life (or slice of zombie life) in this case.  What kills the anime though, is the fact that it seriously include in the story the result of the ridiculous events in the first episode. If those idols weren't zombies the story will go in different direction. This means, that the story the anime tells, when serious, is supposed to imagine how difficult is to be an idol, but only if you are zombie. Sorry, it seems the living audience might not have a chance to properly relate to that...  Art: The art is what you can expect from 2018. It is not outstanding, though. Anime like ""Sound! Euphonium"" easily beat the art within the same year.  Music: Well, the music is definitely not bad. Some songs are even amazing, and it is rarely to hear death metal genre in anime. While I am not a fan of death metal, it was hilarious choice for the first episode OP. The situation combined with the music clearly stated, that you cannot take what you see seriously. The other songs are catchy, but not so amazing, except maybe ""Mezame returner"", which kind of have proper rhythm and rhyme to enjoy, even when you do not understand the text at all (although some parts are strange). If you watch this for the music, episode 3, 7, and 12 near the end are worth it.  Characters: In the first episode Tatsumi is pretty funny, and during all episodes the quirks of each characters will make some funny situations, which will cause occasional laugh of otherwise the boring story. The police officer (apparently the only one in the whole Saga prefecture) scenes are the craziest one, he is my favorite side character. Otherwise, the stories of each individual past is kind of BORING, except maybe Saki, which is super cool.  Enjoyment: I do not feel I have wasted my time watching this. It is fairly enjoyable and forgettable lighthearted show. The only thing I am regretting is that it take so much time to realize only the first episode was worth it. I feel like I clicked a click-bait. Something can be ridiculously funny and good at the same time (see KonoSuba). This anime had this potential, but I have no idea what happened. At least it has happy semi-ending, suggesting possibility of second season.";Mixed Feelings
5;Zombieland Saga;Strat2005;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Strat2005;7;Zombieland saga is a unique parody of an idol show with zombies instead of high school girls as the main group of idols. It excels at certain parts, but also fails at certain parts, though it was still an enjoyable watch nonetheless.  Let's start with the good parts. The show has a great focus on its characters, which is something you rarely see in shows with a huge female cast, such as idol, CGDCT, SOL shows etc. The first few episodes introduces us to the bizarre cast of characters, all with different backgrounds and even from different time periods. The best character though is hands down the manager of the group of idols. From the first few episodes I was already in love with the chaotic energy from him, yet you can still feel his strong determination to help the idol group achieve success. The first few episodes did a great job introducing the characters, and later on during the show there are also individual episodes focusing on the episodes, adding a lot more depth to the characters in a genre full of copy and paste cute girls with no personality. Zombieland saga does a great job at being a parody, while still keeping the soul of this girls-support-girls genre.  However, while this show does a good job at exploring its characters, it is also lacking in one of the most important elements in idol anime - the dance scenes/performances. The 3d animation is more than just rough around the edges and I was honestly surprised it was made by MAPPA. The 3d models look very different from the actual 2d characters, which accentuated the problem when they decided to keep switching from 2d and 3d during the performances. The dance sequences and performances were also quite repetitive and didn't really stand out to me, which was quite disappointing. Still, this is the only huge flaw I can think of for this show.  Overall, this show was still a fun watch and a solid 7/10;Mixed Feelings
6;Zombieland Saga;Thedude3445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thedude3445;6;"Zombieland Saga is a pretty entertaining mid-tier anime effort that doesn't quite hit any notable marks, but is a solid time throughout. The kind of show that, if you know enough Japanese, is a really good anime to half-pay-attention to while you're doing the dishes or something.  The whole thing veers pretty wildly between a ridiculous satire of idol culture, literally resurrecting dead people to churn out a new idol group for some publicity, and then a legitimately emotional and sappy idol zero-to-hero series. The two sides don't mesh that well and the whole show ends up being a bit schizophrenic as a result, but there'll be something for you to latch on no matter your sensibilities, unless your sensibilities include realistic characters with good character arcs.  The characters are all very strong, though only about half of them get much of a story arc and none of them change personality much through the series (besides some spoiler elements). You'll probably end up really liking one or two of them, but overall it's a pretty standard lineup of quirky characters.  Lots of funny moments throughout the series, even if the plot sticks to exactly what you'd expect out of a series featuring an idol group starting in the middle of the boonies. The zombie element allows for a lot more brutal violence against already-undead people, and the hijinks of hiding their zombie nature creates some really good moments. The comedy is by far the best part of the show.  However, the idol stuff is pretty middling. All of the idol performances, except for one, are rendered in terrible CGI. I thought that was part of the joke at first, but by the end it was pretty clear it was a cost-saving measure and a really ugly one at that. None of the songs were memorable either, definitely not compared to the very good OP and ED. There aren't that many performances in the show, maybe six or seven, but you'll usually be spacing out when they happen because they take away from the comedic elements.  Of course, there's also some drama and sappy teambuilding efforts. The drama, ramped up in a couple key episodes in the second half, is generally very good, dealing with some sensitive topics and delving deep into a couple of these undead characters in ways that hit hard-- one specific episode actually got me tearing up and it was a bit embarrassing. But the drama is always undercut by the formulaic ""Let's Ganbatte!"" stuff with the idol group working together as a team to pass the obstacles before them. Because of the parody elements, and because of the legitimate dramatic elements, the idol teamwork stuff is really boring and takes away from the rest.  So Zombieland Saga is a real mixed bag. Chances are, there's something in there for you to enjoy, no matter your taste. However, there'll also be plenty of things for you to dislike as well. It won't stand the test of time, but it was a good enough show that I'd say I enjoyed watching it. Which is good enough for me.";Mixed Feelings
7;Zombieland Saga;AmericanSomnium;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AmericanSomnium;6;"I really toiled with the rating for this show. I've been in a slump with work, and so I only was able to watch about 4 shows at a time rather than my usual 8 that I whittle down. As a result, I dropped less shows but kept with ones that I would have dropped otherwise. Overall, I'm not sure if it was a show I would have dropped or not, and I'm torn enough I wish I could give it a 6.5.  Off the bat I have to admit my bias. I've never watched an idol show before this. I've been aware of them and their effect on merchandising, but I've never participated in them. For me, that's the strength in this show. It's the first idol show that's grasped me and kept me interested, even if only as a minor participant. I'll just organize this into story, animation, character, and sound.  Story: The story is pretty simplistic in itself. Not many answers are given as to why they're brought back, but I have a heavy feeling that this is because it's a ""go read the manga"" type of show. This isn't bad in itself (I'm waiting with baited breath for the Kaguya anime, but I'm expecting the same treatment), however, the story then had to revolve around a minor arc for each of the starts of the show. I'll be honest, this was the strongest part of the show. A lot of these girls arcs are heartfelt and honest, and give a great insight to who they were before they died and who they are now. Almost everyone dies with regrets, and they were some of the lucky few who got to try and rectify these regrets on their own. There is obviously and overarching story related to the manager, however it's unclear if a S2 will come to carry this along.  Animation: I'll be blunt, the animation/art will get a fair rating from me due to the use of CGI. Honestly, if this anime just had the story going for it, it would be a non-issue. However the non-CGI animations of this show were absolutely phenomenal. I could only top it this year with the animations I saw from Slow Start for a fairly mundane show about ""cute girls doing cute things"". These crisp animations were then brought down by most of the performances they did when CGI was brought into the picture. It's sad too, because in and idol show I feel the actual performances are a crucial part to nail. If they do a S2 and remove that portion, it could easily be a 7 or 8 overall ranking for me. The CGI was the biggest turn off for me in the show, because once you reach these crucial crux's of each characters arc you have to deal with these lumbering and unnatural movements of animation that completely takes you out of the show.  Character: This intertwines with story, but, I really enjoyed most of the characters of this show. I don't want to go into too much detail due to spoilers, however each character has a fleshed out personality, voice, and even time period from which they hail. Some seem there for comic relief, but then show they are very dedicated to the group as a whole. Others are consistently the ""rocks"" of the group that many go to for support. Even the accents and dialogue they put forth are related to their identity as idols.  Sound: This will be the part where I'm the least knowledgeable. I thought the songs were decent (from what I can tell from subtitles), yet I am also not an idol follower. The songs might have also been tainted for me from the CGI animations (another gripe at it), which brings what could have been very emotional scenes down for me. Still, I did find them somewhat catchy, and I enjoyed when they delved into other styles that weren't really ""pop"" music.  Overall, this show is probably worth the time for someone who does watch idol shows. However, I'm not confident in all aspects I've put forth. As far as character development and animation, I can confidently say the majority is great and worth your time. To say the entire show is perfect though, would overlook many issues I had with the CGI and the pretty shoestring story which seems like an obvious manga advertisement.";Mixed Feelings
8;Zombieland Saga;tamagolord;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tamagolord;6;"Gonna try to make this as spoiler-free as possible!  After finishing Zombie Land Saga, I'm pretty disappointed. What had potential to be a fun, well-paced chaotic comedy show parodying the idol genre completely did a 180 and ended up turning into the shows it was trying to parody in the first place. The beginning of this show had me pretty hooked, which hasn't really happened for me with many shows from the last couple of years, and I was really excited to see where it was going. In early high school I was a pretty big fan of the idol genre, especially Love Live, and the way that this show made silly jokes about idol tropes was really entertaining, especially because they aren't really taking themselves seriously. I really liked that they weren't trying too hard to throw in ""inspirational"" moments because there's only so many times you can watch an idol MC give an impassioned speech about doing your best and still feel effected by it. It felt like a breath of fresh air that this show put the comedy at the forefront, but sadly, by the halfway point, Zombie Land Saga falls right into the same tired idol clichés that it's poking fun at other shows for having.  The first couple of concerts are really funny and manage to throw off your expectations, putting more thought into comedic moments and trying to flip idol tropes on their head. The first half of this show is about attempting to get their idol group off the ground by taking odd jobs, doing street performances, rap battles, and local commercials. This was when I was really enjoying the show the most. The jokes were hitting pretty well for me with some laugh out loud moments, and the energy felt like a faster paced chaotic comedy. Tatsumi may have been grating for some people but I honestly thought he was hilarious and that his VA did such a good job. I don't know why you would even want to watch the dub for this when you could watch the original seiyuu scream in awkward english. The girls worked off each other well and it was okay that they were the same idol archetypes that we see all the time because it still felt like a parody. Plus, Tae Yamada. It was around when the individual girls started getting their own episodes & the group started gaining popularity that I felt like it started to fall off and lean too heavily into idol melodrama and by the last couple of episodes it feels like there is no comedy to be found really. Just crying angsty idol girls. Pretty much becoming a cookie cutter idol show aside, this show sets you up to not take anything too seriously and then by the end expects you to be invested wholeheartedly in the overdramatic and extremely predictable idol plot. What a let down.  The music was nothing to write home about, both the ost and the idol music. In the first episode they really had me thinking that they were going to be a metal idol group before I realized that they were just going to be singing generic idol songs, which was kind of disappointing. Like, zombie idols that sing metal but are also cute? They had the potential to reach both the idol crowd and people that are into metal or dark comedy. I think that's my biggest problem with the show, that this anime had so much potential to be a zany idol comedy with interesting elements that made it unique, and instead of delivering it just fell flat, like they ran out of jokes to tell and just decided to cop out and write a boring safe idol drama.  Still, if you're a fan of the idol genre, you may be into this one. I would be lying if I said that this show didn't have some heart, so I wouldn't say avoid it entirely, but if you get to the midway point and are just waiting to see if it gets funny again, you'll probably be just as disappointed by the ending as I was.";Mixed Feelings
9;Zombieland Saga;HahaGraphsGoBrrr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HahaGraphsGoBrrr;6;"The show embraces its macabre premise by infusing typical anime humor and lightheartedness, though it doesn't shy away from more emotional or heartfelt episodes dedicated to individual struggles that the members of the pop group may have.The protagonist has an interesting development in the eleventh hour given what her role in the group is until that point, and the lives of the other characters loan themselves to speculation fairly well.  Given the premise of the show, it was very important to have music that was believably pop enough to sell that this group took off. What I was pleasantly surprised by was how much they dabbled in different genres. On the subject of sound, there were small details in the sound design that stood out; when zombies turned their necks, for example, there would be small ""cricks"" that would be audible, and it showed an attentiveness to detail.  No life-changing revelations will likely come out of watching this, though that's not to say this isn't a worthwhile watch. The show is fairly engaging and it does not cater too much to fanservice or anime nonsense.  The only true mark against it are the characters Ai and Junko, whom I really can't differentiate between and forget constantly, mentally cordoning them off as just ""those other two"" while all the others have a gimmick or distinct personality that sets them apart.";Mixed Feelings

0;Zombieland Saga;Dante012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dante012;4;"Zombieland Saga was a huge disappointment to me. What started off as a brillant slap in japanimation clichés quickly became a huge cliché itself: an average idol anime.   STORY A guy who somehow can revive people decides to use dead girls to make an idol group and make his town popular. Now that's an awesome plot! They try to mix up zombie stuff with idol stuff. What could possibly go wrong? Well, here is what could go wrong: - the series could try to take itself too seriously. - Or it could simply give up on that inappropriate mix to become a classic idol series as there are plenty others. - Or it could also fall into flat comedy.  All that did happen. They did try to put up a serious story with a plot about ZOMBIES BECOMING IDOLS. The idea itself is stupid as hell! They did give up a lot on the zombie side to make it an average idol story. And they did fall into dumb comedy, while it started off brillantly.  I am no fan of idol series. I watched Zombieland Saga because the very first scene was a brillant slap into japanimation industry, as it takes a cliché introduction and turns it upside down. Then, the story quickly became about teenage girls doing their best to become famous and doing cute stuff. Basically, this series is a trap. It makes the viewer believe it will see something uncommon (mixing two genres that could not possibly go together), and then makes it an average idol series. In this series, the protagonists try to make idols famous again. Maybe that's actually what the writers try to do: make the idols popular by reaching a new public. It certainly didn't work for me...   ART I am no fan of cutesy art. It's not badly done, it's just that bright shining eyes and pinky stuff everywhere is not really my stuff.  As every idol series nowadays (yes, this IS an idol series, there's no denying), the dance scenes are made in CGI. And as every idol series, the CGI is horrendous and doesn't go well with the other scenes (drawn, in 2D).  Then, there is the opening. Now, that's something to watch. It is badly drawn, it is a huge mindfuck... and all that makes it so funny! We may say it is badly drawn, but I think it is on purpose: the kind of stuff that is ""so bad it's actually good"".   SOUND The music didn't really catch my ears, but at least it didn't ruin the series to me. It blends in the scenes very well. The opening is catchy.   CHARACTER First of all, Hououin Kyouma is in that series. Yes, I am talking about Stein's Gate protagonist. A character in Zombieland has his seiyuu, his character, his ways of doing stuff (shouting everywhere, giving dumb nicknames, naming stuff with ""temporary name"" in it, ...). And that was just awesome to discover, it really surprised me!  Then, there is the LEGENDARY YAMADA TAE! I don't really like the character itself, but she is indeed legendary for no f*cking reason xD.  For the rest, they're just average characters that can be found everywhere else: the cute MC, the rebellious rival, the lolita, the way-too-serious girl, ...  Nothing really memorable here, except YAMADA TAE!   ENJOYMENT This anime is a trap. It tries to catch people with zombie stuff and make them watch an idol anime. And they did catch me, well done. Sadly, it barely has anything else to offer. I really liked the first two episodes, some of their jokes are hilarious, but I didn't really spend a good time in front of the rest of the series...";Not Recommended

All of the idol characters annoyed me and none of them were that interesting to me  Now let's get to the comedy part. Now I understand that comedy wasn't really the main goal of the show but it was pretty obvious that they were trying to land jokes and just failed miserably. I spoke about Kotaro's jokes but ""The Legendary Yamada Tae's"" jokes through some of the show were just her making noises and OMG ZOMBIE GIRL ISNT AWAKE YET AHAHAHAHAHAHA and it just really got on my nerves that they would sink to such low levels of comedy.  Now to the infamous episode 3 where they used atrocious CG to ""make fun of"" other idol shows but it just came across as them using horrible CG. It made it look worse than the stuff they were trying to make fun of.  All in all, I gave it a 4 just because I wanted to get it done but it felt like such a chore watching the next episode, purely because of how much I didn't enjoy it.";Not Recommended
2;Zombieland Saga;toastalchemist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/toastalchemist;4;At first, I really liked Zombie Land Saga, but my affection for it became lower and lower as the series went on. Very little was done to differentiate the girls from each other. I liked the episode that focused on the transgender idol. I just wish the others got that extra bit of characterization she did. That does not mean they all had to be transgender or had to have a secret, but the other idols did not get much development beyond, “she’s from a long time ago” or “the angry one.” The novelty of the girls being zombies faded as it went on. It seemed as though the production team used up all of the best zombie jokes early on. The last three episodes were the worst for me. Without spoiling anything, the main character went backwards just go to back to where she was before the last arc. It was so counterproductive, like going back to episode one. You’ll know what I mean if you’ve seen the show. The last arc was too schmaltzy and, “all you have to do is believe in yourself” for me. Overall, having the girls be zombies was a nice gimmick and it did make me laugh a few times, but it was nothing special. I was done with the show long before the last episode.;Not Recommended
3;Zombieland Saga;BlondeFox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlondeFox;4;While in the beginning it was interesting and the more character focused episodes were intriguing, the show felt quite boring and disjointed. I almost dropped it a little under halfway through.  While it feels like it is trying to be a satire of the idol genre, it doesn't do much to distinguish from them and just plays into it outside of a few gags and design choices.  Also the lack of cohesion in the music is really strange as they're supposed to be a music group. First you think it is going to be some form of metal, then rap, but it eventually devolves into the normal idol songs but without any of the goodness that comes from it.;Not Recommended
4;Zombieland Saga;WyattWordWeaver;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WyattWordWeaver;4;"""Zombieland Saga"" brings to the table one of the most electric group dynamics i've ever experienced in anime. It's a shame it offers little else.  If you're here for spastic comedy with a fun group dynamic of half a dozen or so characters this is a show for you. Every character brings something to the table and much of the show is light and fun. As episodes wear on however the show begins to run out of luster as it fails to make any of its characters truly interesting. There's some slight changes; some intrigue, but for the most part the show failed to truly endear me to much of the cast.  The humor is good but not great. Group dynamics are fun but characters don't really grow or evolve with each other and as the show goes on you begin to see the cracks: rancid CGI for dance sequences, heavily varied song quality and a ""plot"" that is mostly shoehorned into the last three episodes, making character arcs feel rushed and emotional moments fall short.  ""Zombieland Saga"" is fun and fine (i do love the character designs) but it fails to truly be hilarious before bungling a long form story. Things do improve in the 2nd season but unless you are a big fan of light comedies with a female group dynamic this first season might not worth sitting through. 4/10";Not Recommended
5;Zombieland Saga;nic016;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nic016;3;Man, call me a hater, but this anime doesn't live up the praise I was reading about. The story doesn't exactly go anywhere, and I was disappointed about that. It's pretty flat the whole time, and I found the manager annoying to the point I wanted to just mute or skip through the scene until he was gone. I probably wouldn't be too picky about the show if it was moving along, but it didn't. Also, it does take some getting used to if you're watching the dub, since all the singing/rapping is done in japanese and isn't translated, so all the voices change. Mind you the songs themselves are pretty alright, and are enjoyable. However, the 3D animation during the dance scenes are really out of place. If season 2 ever drops, they should stop that. Unless the season 2 trailer looks really good and different than what I saw in season 1, I won't be looking to continue the series. Personally not worth watching.;Not Recommended
0;Zombie-Loan Specials;Rah_Tilt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rah_Tilt;10;"*2 little notes:  1. I'll not only write a review for this OVA, but for all Zombie-Loan episodes that have been aired so far, including the anime because this OVA continues where the last anime episode stops.  2. I'll not stick to the story/art/sound/character/enjoyment format but write down what I have on my mind and hope that people will find this review a bit helpful.  ~ I apologize in advance if I make some mistakes with spelling or grammar, 'cause I'm not a native English speaker~  Now after saying this, it's time to write down what I think. It's only my opinion and you don't have to agree with it of course.   I don't really remember how I got Zombie-Loan anime in my ""plan to watch"" list (yeah probably I put it there but don't remember how I found it lol) but after watching it, I'm so glad that it was there. Zombie-Loan is a really great serie that every horror/mystery/comedy lover must see.  After reading a few reviews about this anime, I can see that many people didn't like the fact that there were so little episodes. I didn't like that of course but I don't see why that should play a role in my rating. Someone also said that there are many holes in the plot, but don't forget that this anime is not finished (at least it doesn't look like finished) and it's full with things that will be discovered later.Zombie-Loan has a very original plot, at least in my opinion and it has a great potential to become one of the most amazing stories in anime/manga world.  If you are dead in this moment, and there's someone by your side who says that you can continue to live but you must work for them to pay the loan, what would you do? In this story , there are many different characters who must learn to live and fight together because they share the same faith, they'll all die if they don't continue to fight. That leads us to Zombie-Loan's two male main characters, Chika Akatsuki and Shito Tachibana who hate each other but because of the play of destiny they can't fight and live without each other. One day, Michiru Kita, a girl from their school runs into them (or is it better to say steps on Chika's hand lol) while she's coming back from buying everyone's lunch. When they bring her the lunch she didn't collect, her friends tell her that those two are the only survivors from the accident that happened 6 months ago. Michiru has a secret, she is the owner of shinigami eyes and can see the ring around those people that are going to die in near future. The ring starts as gray and when it's black that mean that the person will die very soon. She sees that those two have black rings around their necks. Michiru goes unconsciousness while in school and stays in nursing room until evening. When she tries to leave she sees Chika and Shito switching hands and freaks out. They want to kill her but suddenly they are attacked by something so they decide to take care of the monster first. After that they point their weapons at her and she discovers what she knows..or think she knows. She tells them that they both are going to die very soon. Instead of killing her those two decide that it's the best if she helps them with her eyes to find the zombie that hunts on school's territory. Michiru doesn't want to be a part of this, but after she finds out that her friend disappeared she joins them for a hunt in her school. While she's protecting her friend, she end's being badly hurt...when she wakes up..well that's where the real adventure begins so you must watch it by yourself ;) The characters are so different and they are all so funny so you can't do anything else but love them :D The soundtrack is nice. I love the opening and especially the ending theme. I also like the art...and wow there's also blood :D  I really enjoyed this anime. It's sad that it's not finished and it really needs to have more episodes and seasons. The manga is still on-going so I hope that we'll see more of Zombie-Loan. OH GOD!! Please, please let them do more!! It's sad that lame series like Naruto, Pokemon etc. have so many episodes and something great like Zombie-Loan and Ghost Hunt ends unfinished..it's breaking my heart really. What happened with people that actually adore good stories and what happened with people that actually were making them -_-'  Overall, if you like anime with dark feeling, mysteries, blood, adventure and humor you'll love this one and you'll be sad when you'll finish the second episode of this OVA. If you like Ghost Hunt or D.Gray-Man (I can find huge similarities between these two and Zombie-Loan) you can try this one as well and be sure that you will not end up watching some lame show. Some people say that it's similar to Death Note, but no, it's not..the only thing these two have in common are the shinigami eyes and nothing more, which doesn't mean that if you like one of them you won't like the other one. I personally like them both ;)  Hope you'll have fun as much as I did :)";Recommended
0;Zombie-Loan;Monkey_D_Luffy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Monkey_D_Luffy;7;"Story Quite a unique storyline, much different than most out there. Although the story could have probably developed even more and a lot better if there were more than 11 episodes. That just cut the story too short, which was kinda disappointing.  Art Personally, I don't like this type of art style that was used in Z-Loan too much. Usually I'd prefer artwork more like that of Death Note. However, I think the art fit this particular series well, however it isn't the best art out there.  Sound Usually I like loud songs and metal songs, but the opening song was just horrendous. I couldn't stand listening to it. The ending theme was fine though. The background music fit the scenes it was used in well, so they did that good. Nothing else really so say about the music work. It was overall good.  Character Very good characters. The tension between Chika and Shito was great for the story, especially because no matter what, they were stuck together because of their hands. All of the characters were pretty interesting themselves. Michiru had a good background story. Koyomi was my probably favorite, with her energetic normal self, and then becoming the lesbian Yomi, her alter-ego. Then there's all the others like Yuuta, with her &quot;talking&quot; hands, Bekkou (or ferryman), who's the leader of Z-loan, even though he appears like somebody you wouldn't really expect to be in charge, Chika's father, who looks like a girl, Chika's sister, who does nothing but text message on her phone, Shimotsuki, who's a younger girl, yet a chairsperson, Shiba, who at first appears to be a good guy, and the Shinigami, who becomes a like a small creature after losing his core. The cast is all very interesting, however, since the series is too short, it didn't allow for too much development, so that's why I give a 8, and not 9.  Enjoyment Definitely a great series if you're bored one day and just wanna watch a whole series, packed with parts of action, comedy, and horror. I watched it all in one day, since it's only 11 episodes, and I think it's best viewed like that. Very enjoyable series overall, even if it is very short.  Overall Overall, as you can see, I give it a 7. For reasons I've already explained above. I'm pretty sure an OVA will be coming out, so at least maybe we'll get to see a better ending in that.";Recommended
1;Zombie-Loan;Bondius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bondius;8;"Zombie-Loan was quite a fun anime even though it was too short for my liking. Eleven episodes is just too short for a series, considering most have at least 12 episodes.  Story It's an interesting story, very original if you ask me, and it has it's good and bad parts. It's somewhat predictable from time to time and there aren't many plot-twists that could surprise you. Plus, I really would have liked more action in it, sometimes it just takes too long for the fighting to start even though it would look like an action anime first. Aside from that, it was pretty good. The worst part is that it ended abruptly in episode 11, just when the REAL action seemed like it would start. Just the producer's way to say &quot;read the manga if you wanna know what happens&quot;.  Art I really liked the art, it was quite new to my eyes. The characters are each drawn in their own style and it was interesting to see how the male leads were tall and athletic, with almost no muscles on them and so on. Considering their &quot;status&quot; it suits them well. For the fans, it has some chibi scenes and stick-art scenes some fo the time to add to the fun. The art for the combat scenes was good but not the best, I enjoyed it nevertheless.  Sound Well, the soundtrack was good, nothing much to say about it, each song was fit for the scene. The only thing that bothered my ears was the opening song. Sure, the off-vocal was totally awesome, I really liked the guitar sounds, but when the singer started &quot;screaming&quot; in I would immediately skip forward. Ending song was fine, though not the best, with a great off-vocal.  Character The characters were very well made, though most didn't have such a detailed background. Each had it's own unique personality and you could easily start liking one of them. Too bad some characters didn't have enough screen time (even though I liked them more than the main characters) and some had more than they really needed.  Overall I enjoyed this (too) short series. I'd give it a 7.8 as a grand total (but I rounded up to 8). If you're into action, comedy, zombie related things and some drama here and there, watch Zombie Loan. Even though it's not one of the greatest anime out there, it's not a waste of time either.";Recommended
2;Zombie-Loan;asch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/asch;8;First,this anime is way better than I thought.It's very funny and bloody (good combination) but it's too short 11 episodes.So it's seems that the manga is needed to read.  Story It has a good story.Zombies having they're organization for chasing an killing other bad zombies.A spooky story with zombies,death gods,reapers other related things.For this too short it had a nice plot but it changed a lot it rather seemed like the episode were all mini stories.But it's tooo funny really it had some awesome moments on which I laughed a lot.It didn't failed action beside the last episode where the producers clearly wanted to stop the anime.Just when I thought the action was going to start they bet the ''final boss'' in a simple and not long way.8/10  Animation Really awesome everything was well animated.Especially the character I liked they're style the male character are drown a bit in a shoujo anime style.So it's a unique style and it also didn't lacked in the fighting scenes.The funny scenes are also good made with some simple drawings but it was original.9/10  Sound It was good,nice rock songs with a lot of instrumental which I liked.The ending song is one of my favorites really nice and it suits it well.The opening was a good instrumental with some nice guitar playing but the vocals weren't too good a screaming voice.I'm just sick of them I'm remembering Maximum the Hormone.It was like a bad copy.The ost is awesome you should check it out.So in the end the songs were good.All rock/metal songs during fights.9/10  Character This surely the best aspect of the anime.Every one is unique and they have good personalities.You will one of them probably.They had were good personalities and had a lot of funny scenes with them.There were some minor characters that I liked but they hadn't have any screen time.Anyway they were all funny a well drawn.It would be better if some had more screen time but I hope that they have better roles in the manga.9/10  Enjoyment It enjoyed this toooo short anime.It had some awesome moments.There were some too boring episodes but also some really awesome (like the hot spring ep.).So all in all it's a awesome anime but too short.Everyone should watch it but possible read the manga.8/10;Recommended
3;Zombie-Loan;Silent_Follower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Silent_Follower;8;"Everything that you've borrowed must be paid back properly; that includes human life. If you loaned your life to extend it, then you have to pay for it, no matter how long it takes. And that's what Zombie-Loan is about.  Story: (8/10) Not a lot of people see it, but this anime has a thick plot and has a lot of substantial themes. It's really interesting. It tackles upon complex issues such as the value of human life, the nature of life and death, the circle of life and even the value of friendship. Those aside, the story development wasn't so bad either. It's downfall lies on the fast paced episodes and the shortness of the series itself. Viewers were not able to enjoy this series long enough. Though I have to say, the cliff hanger ending was good. Makes viewers thirsting for some more. It would be a lot better if this had a sequel.  Art: (8/10) Graphics is fine. Blood scenes are realistic enough. Female characters were cute. Male characters were bishies. I'm not picky when it comes to art. Their proportions were more than decent. But then again, there was really nothing special about the art.  Sound: (6/10) The sounds are so-so. The dubbing was done well. But that aside, the OP and ED weren't that enjoyable. The first time I heard the OP, my head began to throb in pain. I have nothing against rock, but I think that was too much. The sounds are decent enough, but wasn't really special.  Characters: (10/10) Each of the characters has their own characteristics, their own attitudes, their own past and are capable of standing as an individual character. I think that this is the most important trait that each characters should have. That aside, each characters are interesting in their own way. They have their own story to tell. It's really fun watching them develop as the series goes on.  Enjoyment: (9/10) This anime is really enjoyable. While dealing with serious themes, the anime has a light and comical atmosphere. The action scenes were also decent enough. It also gives off some mysterious aura that leaves the viewers wanting for more. I would have given it a 10 if the series wasn't so short.  Overall: (8/10) A thick plot, good art, interesting characters... this anime would have been better if only it had a longer series. But despite that, the story development was fine and they tackled about interesting issues.";Recommended
4;Zombie-Loan;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;7;Keep in mind, this review covers the main series and two episode special.  Welcome, My Friends, to the final review of horror anime month. Zombie Loan was a manga written by the duo, Peach-Pit, also responsible for Shugo Chara, Rozen Maiden, DearS and some other stuff I have never seen nor read. It was published by Square Enix. The anime version was handled by Xebec in 2007 with eleven episodes airing two more being released only on the DVD. Let's delve into the series and see what awaits us.  Story:  Kita Michiru can see something that no one else can when she takes off her glasses, a dark ring around the neck of a person who's fated to die shortly. One day, she spots a pure black ring around the necks of two classmates, Chika and Shito, who had shortly before survived a bridge accident that had killed everyone else involved. Following the two to warn them, Michiru discovers a secret. They didn't survive the crash. They died and were given a loan that allows them to keep going. To pay off this “zombie” loan, they fight mindless and illegal zombies for bounties. At first, Chika and Shito plan to kill Michiru to keep her quiet, but once they learn of her ability to see the rings they decide to put her to work. She just has to use her shinigami eyes to help them in their endeavours, but it won't be easy. There's a rise in zombies like Chika and Shito, except these zombies operate without authorization and they turn both animals and people into the mindless variety of zombie.  There are two significant problems with the narrative. The first is that the series has an issue with continuity. There's a major retcon that comes out of absolutely nowhere because... the plot needed it to work. The series also establishes that zombies start to lose their emotions, outright states that it's happening with a specific character and then proceeds to show us that character experiencing anger, distress, and all manner of other emotions in subsequent episodes. There are also some real contrivances for the plot to work. The biggest one being the reason why Chika and Shito are working together.  Those complaints aside, there are some positive aspects to the story as well. The premise is interesting and the tension is developed very organically. The series is also very good in terms of progression. There's always something compelling happening and the stopping points for the individual episodes are very well chosen. The series proper ends at a good point as well, with the completion of a major arc. Although the extra episodes start a new story arc, but only do the basic introduction for it, which didn't bother me since they are added episodes, but I can see why it might bother someone else. The series also excels at emotional investment. There are some really strong tragic scenes, some good triumphant moments, some touching scenes and amusing comedic moments. That isn't to say that all of the emotional moments work, there are certainly some that don't, but the majority of them do hit the mark.  Characters:  There are some really interesting characters in this. Initially, it looks like Shito, Chika and Michiru are all going to be pretty archetypical, but all of them develop beyond that fairly quickly and grow into fairly complex characters. The same is true for a lot of the side characters. Even if I'm not sure whether they're using a pseudo-scientific understanding of dissociative identity disorder with Koyomi or there's something else going on with her. It's probably explained in the manga at some point, but the anime either leaves it out or doesn't get to it.  Really, the only weakness is in the familial dynamics. Chika's interactions with his father and sister are questionable at best. There are also some disturbing implications involved in Shito's back-story. Really, the most natural family relationship is Michiru's dynamic with her aunt and uncle and they barely appear in the anime, act like jerks and are banished from the story.  Art:  The art is a bit odd. Most of the time it does look really good with some strong character designs, action sequences and backgrounds. However, there are quite a few more light-hearted scenes where the art style switches to a very lazy, minimalistic style. I'm not certain whether they thought stick figure drawings were funny or they just decided that they didn't need to put an effort into drawing those particular scenes. Either way, it looks pretty bad.  Sound:  They got some great actors for this series. Chika is voiced by Suzumura Kenichi (also the voice of KnK's Mikiya Kokutou) Kuwashima Houko (Kurumi 2's Nako) voices Michiru. Shito is voiced by Sakurai Takahiro, the actor known for his work as Cloud Strife. Although he plays against character a bit since he doesn't cross dress or chase after a childhood love interest in this one. The music is decent enough except for the stuff with lyrics. The stuff with lyrics is a cacophonous mess.  Ho-yay:  There's a fair amount of ho-yay in this. Shiba gets some homo-erotic moments with both Chika and Shito and they also get some with each other. During the extra episodes Shito even asks another guy if he can kiss him. It does, however, have more les-yay. Koyomi's second personality, Yomi does quite a few things with Michiru. Things which she really should have asked before doing, but to be fair she does stop when Michiru tells her she doesn't like what she's doing. Although, even with that scene it's hard to call it a one-sided thing. Since, during the two extra episodes, Michiru does demonstrate some feelings for Koyomi. So, there is some pretty blatant stuff both between men and between women but none of it amounts to a full fledged romantic relationship, at least not in the anime. It might in the manga, but I haven't read through it yet so I don't know. So, the ho-yay factor for the anime is going to be a 6/10.  Final Thoughts:  Zombie Loan is a good action adventure series with an interesting premise, compelling build up, strong acting, and good characters. Unfortunately, it also has some serious drawbacks in terms of narrative continuity and character dynamics. So, it is good but not great. My final rating is going to be a solid 7/10. If it sounds interesting to you, check it out. It's only eleven episodes, thirteen if you get into the specials, so it's a pretty fast watch. Well, that's another horror anime month complete. Next week we'll open November with a requested review, Claymore.;Recommended
5;Zombie-Loan;digiboy123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/digiboy123;10;"Anyone out there like horror, comedy and action? If so, I believe you'll enjoy this series.  Story: Zombie-Loan's story... well, to be honest, I haven't seen any animes that really focus on zombies, so this was definitely a first for me, so if anyone says this is a rip-off, don't believe them. The story centers mainly around 3 people, Michiru, who has Shinigami eyes, and can see if someone will do soon by seeing a black ring around their neck; and then Chika and Shito. I won't go into detail about their story, because it could spoil everyone, but let's just say that they hunt for zombies for a living... in the meantime. The goal is to hunt down zombies, or those that should have passed on but did not, and destroy them and give them a proper funeral. But that;s just the beginning. The story gets much better near the end.  Art: Well, the art is good, if you ask me. Especially when it goes into those comedic moments. It made me laugh countless times, that's for sure. The art is suitable.  Sound: The sound was GREAT! I heard everything crystal clear and the music and score was great also. Awesome ending theme, eh?  Overall: Just watch this series. It is good, I had to keep watching it because I just had to see what happened. It's a shame that the studio cut this series short, because it was scheduled for 20+ episodes. But hey, there's a 2 episode OVA afterward and who knows, there may be more in the future.  I recommend this series to any hardcore anime fan.";Recommended
6;Zombie-Loan;randompadley;https://myanimelist.net/profile/randompadley;7;Well, having just finished this series, I can actually say that I found this to be a really enjoyable short series (IMO too short but I will mention this as I go through the review)  Story: Well my whole reason for starting the show was because I thought the plot was so unique and instantly grabbed me from the few lines, the idea of somebody being able to know when someone is about to die was an instant appeal, throw in some already dead zombies and I was set. Unfortunately as i stated, the show was only 11 episodes long, and for me that was just waaay too short, and as a result left quite a few questions to be answered at the end. An example being that it is never explained why the two male characters have to switch hands in order to summon their weapons, it says WHAT will happen if they dont switch, and WHAT will happen if they didn't switch back. There are many other little plotholes and things that I would like to have been answered but I shant bother you with them all, because tbh if your going to give this series a try (which I think you should) then you will realise what im saying, it is said that this series was originally going to be 20+ episodes... why did it not?! I really think the story could have had so much more depth and so many of these 'unanswered questions' actually answered, and us not craving a second series. But the actualy storyline was great, and I was thurally gripped from beggining to end, I just wish that it had more time to develop and go into detail but I think that was impossible in just 11 episodes, so theres no suprise as to how many plotholes there was.  Art: Well I'm not a big expert an Art, but on this series I really enjoyed the artwork used, I loved the style of the female characters (they were very cute... especially Michiru) the males... I liked, although Chika's hair was mental and spikey as hell! I felt they semt a tad plain and scruffy compared but still nothing too bad, and there personalities and everything else made up for it IMO, I must say i'm easily pleased when it comes to art, I will hardly ever come out and say 'god that art was pathetic' or 'I hated that artwork' but thats just me.  Sound: Well there wasn't much music throughout the episodes (or none that I can really re-call) so if there was, then obviously nothing really spectacular if I can't even remember there being any, as for the opening and end themes. The opening was... neither good nor bad for me, after reading some reviews and everyone saying how bad the screaming was, I was expecting it to be proper death metal screamo style. But it wasn't although yes the man was screaming/shouting, I would not say it was heavy.. If anything I found the scappy guitar to sound a little like libertines but obviously just much heavier vocals. The ending theme.. I actually had to go back to have a couple of listens, which tbh says it all, again.. neither good nor bad, it goes well with the whole them of the series, and nice still shots of the characters and even had a catchy verse. But yeah.. nothing that really stood out for me.  Character: I pretty much liked all the characters.. even the villains, with it only being 11 episodes I found Chika and Shito's relationship to be the most intresting, they were both total....well...... you get the idea, yet at times they semt to really respect each other and come together as a team. But at times they were just hilarious, and I thought they were too very intresting characters (again if more episodes were made, I think they could have been made into even better characters). Michiru played the shy, coy character very well, I especially found her hilarious towards the end, especially the last episodes.. and well her relationship with Koyomo is really quite outstanding, and even though it was fan service stuff, I found more hilarious than anything, and really had me laughing. I also thought there was a couple of useless characters who didn't really bring anything to the series such as Momoka (Chika's younger sister) who.. well did notthing but text on her phone, and also Yuuta who I thought was actually an intresting character whenever she popped up, and I personally would've liked to have seen her in abit more, but unfortunately didn't really think she brought much to the show.  Enjoyment: Thurally enjoyed seeing this series, from the reviews I saw, they were pretty much spot on in that it had a great concept, but unfortunately was let down by there only being 11 episodes, therefore major plotholes etc etc. But nevertheless for what it is, and for what you are given its a great short horror series, with great and likeable characters, an overall very good plot. Also very funny, with it being a horror I expect minimal laughter and gags. But quite a few times I was actually left in stitches from some of the scenes/comments made by characters, and I found that to be a really nice touch seeing as it was something I wasn't really expecting. One thing that I might have wanted to see for more enjoyment was better fight scenes, none of them felt action packed and long enough. Although some of the villains were kinda creepy, they didn't put up much of a fight.  Overall: Unfortunately (without trying to repeat myself over and over which I know I am doing) due to the shortness of the series the story/plot left a lot unanswered and major plotholes revealed, not really giving it time to sink in, and also for some of the characters to develop fully. But on the other hand for what the story is, its a very good idea, and I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Enjoyable characters, humour, zombies. An anime I am not regretting seeing.;Recommended
7;Zombie-Loan;digitaldude999;https://myanimelist.net/profile/digitaldude999;7;What drew me to this anime was the fact that it was a zombie anime, I mean you dont see an anime with zombies too often usualy its just demons and vampires.the zombies are not the typical zombies you see in movies, they are quite intelligent and capable and arn't rotting corpses which puts some originality to this anime.  Well, lets start with the characters Kita Michiru is a girl who has the gift of shinigami eyes, but starts to hate it when she sees black rings on her parents, when they die she starts using glasses to negate the effect of the shinigami eyes. she has no goals or any aspirations and does not even care if she dies.Kita usualy has a hard time speaking her mind and always does what people tell her to do no question(no backbone whatsover!).Chika and Shito are the zombies who work to repay there debt to zombie loan office(some sort of office that leases life instead of money)which saved them from a tragic accident that happened prior to the series.Chika is lively and out-going kinda, but he has a short temper, he uses a katana! Shito is the more calm one, while Chika is cocky and impulsive one, although Shito can be cold at times. Along the way we meet some more wacky and weird characters in this 11 episode anime although most of them are quite forgettable. The art in this anime is excellent and stylish, while the animation is pretty bad and dont even get me started on the opening theme, which is the worst opening theme I have heard, of course the horrible vocals dont help, ending is only a LITTLE bit better.One of the bad things about this anime is that its way too short, I read somewhere that the manga had 9 volumes, they could have made at least 26 episodes from that. I GIVE THIS ANIME A 7/10 its pretty good, but I wish it was longer.  Yeah, this is one of my old reviews I did for a site about 3-4 years ago, hope you enjoyed reading it.;Recommended
8;Zombie-Loan;Kid2daKrazx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kid2daKrazx;8;It had what I expected for a series that was around since like early 2000's.  I was kind of expecting a buttload of fanservice and an arrogant protagonist (two things I don't like in anything I watch) but in the case of this series. I didn't have too much of that.  Shito seems to throw off that air of arrogance but since he gets an equal amount of punishment in the series, it seems balanced.  The story was a tad confusing but the arcs are pretty easy to figure out, from what I can understand it's about two dead guys that have to kill zombies in order to come alive again using the main character girl as help for it. Seems pretty straightforward to me and that's what I enjoy.  Once I ignored the fanservice and the occasional mood switch of Shito (a prime offender because he pingpongs between being nice and arrogant in less than an episode) and Chika, this series was pretty fun to watch.  As for the artwork, I expected some skinny bishounens simply because I mean, let's face it, the manga was made in '02.  And I can't lie, I didn't like the opening but I loved the ending theme song.  My overall enjoyment is simply that I liked it, personally. The simple storyline, the cool ending theme, the different characters. I just wish that there were a few more episodes to explain some more stuff but it was a nice little series for what it was.  I recommend it just to get some kicks out of an old school supernatural series.;Recommended
9;Zombie-Loan;hannechan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hannechan;9;"Zombie-Loan.. EEH? It is a really great Anime.

And Chito, who is the lively little &quot;kid&quot;. And when you put those together, it is just funny all the way.Enjoyment, I enjoy this anime. It is really funny and has kind of a serious plot.

10;Zombie-Loan;unforgetableme;https://myanimelist.net/profile/unforgetableme;9;Hmm... Overall, I thought this was a pretty good anime. It had a well developed storyline, but I was hoping that it'd be longer, because of its outstanding and creative characters. It's kind of like the other animes, where theres a kiddsh guy and a cold guy and a girl in the middle, but it's a little different, too. I mean each character has their own kind of way to react in a different situation. Like, all the characters in this anime are different from each other, yet the are similar, too. I just like it, because it's a lot of personalities and action all mixed together into a great anime!;Recommended
11;Zombie-Loan;lolz123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lolz123;9;Zombie Loan was a very short anime, but partly I think that's a good thing. If it had continued for an extra 50 episodes it probably would have become a series full of fillers and other rubbish things still managing to cut a lot of things from the manga. But as the manga is still ongoing I think hope for a second series is good, but it will probably be short too (a lot like Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty).  Overall it is a good anime and you should watch it if you have a day spare.;Recommended
12;Zombie-Loan;docalion;https://myanimelist.net/profile/docalion;9;Zombie Loan doesn't have any new things to offer. Well, I guess just like any other animes because their stories had just been recycled over and over again. But, as an otaku, you never get bored watching them especially if you're really massively entertained!  Well, of course, the heroes here save lives and benefit from it. And because there are two male leads here, you cannot avoid some Uhmmm..moments here and there..well, good thing there's no special Uhmmm between them. Kinda cute the petty fightings here and there but i'm kinda not into Uhmmm moments between two maleszz..Hek Hek. ^_^ Especially with the Uhmmmm moments between two girls...Hek Hek ^ _^ Please, not with this one. Michiru is so cute with any of the male leads, so let us leave it like that.. Hek Hek ^ _^  You know what I'm saying if you, of course, have seen the series.  Well, anyways...  The characters are really likable. Sure there are clichez all over the place, but I never get tired of it. I never thought that Michiru would be a likable character. Coz you know, I'm always into strong-willed females with great personalities that could absolutely make womanhood proud. Hek Hek ^_^ Luckily she changed but her weakness is still adorable. I really really like cut li'l moments between her and Chika! Wow, I get his name right. Chika,Shito, Michiru. Chika, Shito, Michiru. Chika, Shito, Michiru... Hek Hek. I'm getting tongue twisted with their names...^_^  Sadly, the theme songs weren't that great. Well, not even good either. They are so upbeat and kinda crazy. I'm not getting it. But there's one insert song which I liked, and I'm gonna search for it.  What can I say more? Well, it had been a short trip. It, of course, needs to add more episodes. It left you hanging. I would love to see more of the trio and their eventual romantic affairs..Hek Hek ^_^ I WANT TO SEE MORE ZOMBIE LOAN  From a Believer that says this anime deserves a shot!, Me ^_^;Recommended
13;Zombie-Loan;nolifenocares;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nolifenocares;7;"Maybe some spoilers. This anime is about a young girl who can see a black line around a persons neck the darker it is the sooner they are going to die. Story: 7, I gave this story line a 7, it's a really cool concept, however the zombies aren't really the whole infectious- destroy their brains to kill them. They're just people who died and are still living. I think what would have made this story better is if here was more episodes, the lack of episodes did make this anime have less of a plot to grow. Art: 7, there is nothing particularly special about the art, the characters are quite lanky though. Sound: 4, I watched this a few months ago and the music hasn't really stuck with me; not very memorable. Character: 6, There was bit of a backstory to some of the characters but there was no real development of them which happens in longer animes. (You can see a common negative theme here) Enjoyment: 7, I watched it, it was okay, could have been much better, but it wasn't particularly bad; the fact the story was quite interesting made it enjoyable. Overall I give it a 7, technically the average is nearer to 6 but still, I'm nice- the main improvement is for there to be more episodes.";Recommended
14;Zombie-Loan;Aysel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aysel;8;"Zombie Loan is a fantastic, albeit short, anime that revolves around Tachibana Shito (Boy A) and Akatsuki Chika (Boy B) who were rumoured to have died in an accident six months before the story begins. Thanks to one of seven ferrymen (Bekko) from the World Fate Organization, the boys have been ""brought back to life"" through a contract known as a Zombie-Loan. Bekko runs a business (also known as Zombie-Loan, or Z-Loan for short) based on these contracts. Tachibana and Shito are now indebted to the ferryman and they must hunt zombies to earn the funds to pay off their debt within a year, or it's game over, and there will be no coming back a second time. A great series with lots of action and supernatural references. I love how different mythologies and religious ideas were infused in this anime, allowing a wide audience to be able to enjoy it without to offensive feeling that some animes invoke when they play the religion card. The character development in this series was absolutely great and the overall animation was pretty good, too. I have to rate the sound low, though, for one reason: the opening theme song was utterly horrific. I listened to maybe thirty seconds of it, determined to give it a chance, before quickly skipping ahead to the actual episode. I found this series to be a little too short, but I think the original plan was to have it go for over twenty episodes, so I can't complain about it too much. The action sequences and storyline made this anime one of the greatest I've seen in a while, and I most certainly do recommend it to anyone who likes a good taste of action. Character relationships were well balanced in this particular series, including the surly Tachibana and the reckless Akatsuki (our main zombie-hunting boys). The bit characters were also pretty interesting in their own ways, though some of the lesser characters could have been brought out a bit more, such as the Chairperson of the Academy and her ""pet,"" Lyca. This series doesn't put too much out there for the shojou crowds, but it came across to me as something rather refreshing; finally there is an anime that includes guys, girls, action, sharp-tongues, a little taste of yuri, but not a whole lot of gushy confessions and lovey-dovey smooching. Actually, there were virtually no confessions or smooching. :D All in all, an excellent series that left me begging for more.";Recommended
15;Zombie-Loan;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;7;"It's a bit of a shame that Zombie-Loan had to end as abruptly as it did considering I did find it quite entertaining to look into. The premise itself was quite original where Chika and Shito are being loaned life as zombies in exchange for hunting evil ""illegal"" zombies. The show effectively mixes serious and comedic moments as it looks into the various dealings that Shito, Chika and the other members of Zombie Loan deal with, particularly the chemistry between Shito and Chika as they don't exactly get along much of the time in the series. The show does do well enough in fleshing out the backgrounds of the two boys and Michiru and what led them to become clients to Zombie Loan thus it is easy to get some sort of connection with their characters. It also does well enough at covering the exact details surrounding zombies in the world of the series and the conditions surrounding Shito and Chika's deal in still being alive.  However with the anime being based on ongoing source material, Zombie-Loan definitely leaves the feel of being incomplete. Some characters have their backgrounds hinted upon yet are never explored and there are some lingering plot developments left hanging such as the presence of several groups serving as adversaries to the Zombie Loan group.  The presentation to Zombie-Loan does come across as a bit subpar. While scenery and character designs do have a decent amount of detail with subdued colors that fit in well with the supernatural feel the series gives off, the animation noticeably takes shortcuts and the series is nowhere as fluid and vivid as titles like Death Note and Moribito that aired in the same year. While the soundtrack does its part with having insert music tracks that fit in with the mood of specific scenes, none of it really sticks out. Not to mention that the OP and ED musical choices can be quite grating to the ears and are best to skip through.  Overall, Zombie-Loan proved to be enjoyable for me thanks to its original premise and chemistry between Shito, Chika and Michiru. However, it was quite clear this series had a bigger story that it didn't have the time to tell thus unless another season of Zombie-Loan comes out, the viewer is left to try continuing the series through the manga source material. It makes for a worthwhile watch, as long as you go into it knowing that you are only being exposed to one part of the series.";Recommended
16;Zombie-Loan;ShiroKuran3812;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShiroKuran3812;8;First up I wish to let everyone know there isn't just 12 episodes of this anime, there is technically more than 12 Episodes. There is actually 13 episodes. Proof of this is found on this website if you wish to confirm it for yourselves: http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Zombie-Loan please copy and paste and look at the information on the site (sorry to the writers of the summary of the series but maybe have a look at it too and or check your resource material. I just want to make sure everyone is receiving the correct information is all)  Story: 8  For a anime with 13 episodes it is quite a weird anime right from the word go. Girl has the ability to see who is going to die and see rings around their necks, before long she comes across the zombie guys who have a contract with a guy who is the caretaker and someone who guides people to the other realm be it heaven or hell. Overall the story isn't what made me curious or interested in this anime, but rather the characters.  Art: 7  It is pretty average in most circumstances, why do I say this is well for a anime released in 2007, I would have thought that it would have looked a little better. As art can often set the tone of a anime. Overall they at least did their best and in a way I like the feel the art style gives off to help make us all understand where and when this anime is set in. It also helps us understand that most of the events seem to happen after dark.  Sound: 5  For a anime released in 2007, the voices a clear and easy to understand what is said. It could however have used a Original Soundtrack of it's own to help give viewers a clear understanding as to how each character feels. Otherwise the opening just seems like a scream band of sorts and the words are hard to understand as to what is being sung.  Character: 8  As I was watching the anime I noticed that gradually we get to see a different side to each of the characters that we didn't see originally when the anime first started or when we started to watch it. And whilst Kita starts of as a obedient, well behaved average school girl who can see the rings around people's necks which are a sign that they are going to die. She starts off afraid of it but over a period of time she seems to gradually accept that it is apart of her and wo she is. Overall I liked that about her, cause it isn't often that a anime character starts off as somewhat of a weak personality. As of yet I haven't found any characters that I disliked or hated, be it their personality or not.  Enjoyment: 6  Right now I am up to episode 10 out of 13. Normally once I start a anime I will watch it to the very end cause I want to know if they achieve their goals or what they set out to do. But as I stated in the character section of my review, I honestly can't say I am finding it hard to follow or even anything that I honestly dislike as of yet. But it is defiantly interesting enough to make me want to sit down and watch it from start to finish.  Overall: 8  Look this anime has it's flaws much the same as a few others and sure there could be things they could fix to make more and more people watch this and become hooked on it but overall really can't pick out what I dislike or like exactly as of yet. But it is a different storyline in comparrasson to a few others to do with the dead or even spirits such as the anime xxXHolicXxx, but it is a anime that is worth seeing. After all you might like it. I think it really will depend on the individual as to if they would like it for sure. But do give it a go for yourself.;Recommended

18;Zombie-Loan;PhaiaFox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PhaiaFox;7;Zombie-Loan is overall a good anime. It consists of 11 episodes. The storyline is quite clear, although the ending didn't really end the story for me. Maybe there will be a second season, or the makers just decided to let the viewer decide for themselves how the story would end. The art is very nice and detailed, and the sound and music was very appropriate in each situation. The characters have a clear personality, but they aren't all flat characters because some of them change a little throughout the story. In every episode there is humour, and that makes it enjoyable too! When a funny moment occurs, the characters are drawn differently: more simple and that enhances the funny moments a lot, at least that's what I thought XD! Overall, and 8 because the story is good but I have seen better ones, too. There could have been some improvement to the story, in my opinion. But still, I would recommend watching Zombie-Loan: it is worthwhile!;Recommended

0;Zombie-Loan;Tsira;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsira;5;"Story: The basics of the story were actually not to bad. Two boys who are bound to each other, a girl with some special powers who starts to help them. Nothing I wouldn't like there. The story is short, but though I like short, this one was just too short. There is a big open ending, and when you are finished you have the feeling you still don't know anything.  Art: The series are drawn pretty good. I thought the boys where a bit to skinny, but overall the drawings never annoyed me.  Sound: The opening and ending theme never appealed me, but I guess that especially the opening theme fitted the story. What I really hated was the voice of Michiru (Japanese). In all the animes I watched I never had a voice I really didn't like, so it was quite a surprise for me it was possible.  Character: You only get to know a little of the characters. I guess the story was to short to take a deeper look in there pasts. Michiru was a very annoying character. Perhaps if you like extremely dumb girls, who scream a lot, cry a lot about nothing, get used by others, and have no guts at all, this series is something you should definitely see.  Enjoyment: I was glad the serie was short, because otherwise I wouldn&acute;t have watched the whole thing. The episodes I liked a bit better where the lasts ones with the grim reaper. He was kind of cute :P.  Overall: I rarely give a bad mark to a anim&eacute; series, but this is an exception. If they had changed the character and voice of Michiru and developed the story better this series could have easily had a 7. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and it's really a shame.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zombie-Loan;Reira_chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Reira_chan;6;Zombie Loan is the first zombie anime I've seen and I don't know if that's a good thing or not. I highly doubt it is though. I overall liked this anime but it did lack some good qualities.  For starters, Zombie Loan is only 11 episodes long so the storyline lacks depth and moves way too fast. The concept is a good but really you need more episodes in order for it to work.  The animation was good. I'm a sucker for hot anime guys and this anime gave me 2 more. XD I also like that they brought a little humor to the anime with the characters when they were irritated or happy and their heads and eyes would get big and they'd start waving their arms around. I do think that the colors could have been brighter and the zombies could have been more rotted and gross looking.  The music I have mixed feelings about. The opening music I liked up until the singing. The background music was sometimes good but I did notice that sometimes it was saxaphones and that made me go wth?? Zombies + Saxaphones= Epic Fail.  I liked the characters a lot and the voice actors did a very good job I think. And I love how the same guy that did the voice of Hikaru in Ouran High School Host Club was Chika because in a way, those 2 characters are similar.  I did enjoy watching this anime for the most part but when I got down to the last few episodes I got bored with it because as I said before, the storyline moved way to fast. I give this a low rewatch value.  So overall, it was a good anime. Not the best I've seen but good. Now if they came out with a second season, I might be happier because I really didn't want it to end so fast.;Mixed Feelings
2;Zombie-Loan;Deadman1709;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deadman1709;5;"This anime, along with Claymore may be the most disappointed anime of 2007. I found many similiarities between them.  Story: much like Claymore, it started pretty good: a unique, not very cliched story, though the monster theme is not very uncommon; anyway, it was good. And it was excited untill 5 minutes before the ending... The anime did not even end; it just started! It was not even an open end like Jigoku Shoujo (which many people do not like but I do). Since the story did not end, it's only 4/10. And not to mention, we got yuri actions around. No good!  Art: The animation was pretty good. The colour looked a little dull and unlively but it fit the theme of the anime. The motion was fluid. Generally, there is not much to complain about the animation.  Sound: decent but not impressive. Both the opening and ending theme were not particularly good it it sounds OK. 7/10 for sound.  Characters: my criteria for good characters is: not cliched. And Zombie loan made it. It was not cliched. It was quite unique and good. The only thing that held the character point back was the girl with &quot;yuri&quot; personality.  Enjoyment: yet another similiarity to Claymore. The story was enough for you to enjoy until the 5 minutes before the ending. Once it hit the ending, it made you feel disappointed and think &quot;what the hell the show was all about? Did it end, or just started?&quot;. The anime were supposed to be a stand-alone or promotion for the manga. So bad that I had to give it a 5 for enjoyment.  Overall: this show is just scarely above average. I burned the whole thing to DVD and locked it up forever, never to watch again. Unless they made it the way it should be.";Mixed Feelings
3;Zombie-Loan;Roulettex3;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Roulettex3;6;The concept of the story is what drawn me to this particular anime. It seemed so unique! If only they could have actually put in some more effort in to making it live up to it's full potential, this anime could have been really amazing.  This anime leaves a lot to be desired, it sorta follows the vague description to the dot, I found myself lacking any kind of emotion while watching this. It made me smile and let out a small chuckle hear and there but nothing at all like I expected. It just makes you wish they would've done 'this' or 'that' to improve....  Though the concept was interesting, they failed to actually deliver it which I found fairly disappointing  As for art, I couldn't say it was bad, It was pretty decent actually. I didn't have much issues looking at it, nothing was particularly 'amazing' about it but in the end I actually liked all the visuals giving the art category a 7.  Starting off I'd like to say I actually thoroughly enjoyed the theme to this anime, aside from that though I don't have much to say about the sound. To describe it I'd just have to say it was kinda just....there. Very forgettable.  Characters were pretty stereotypical. Hot-headed, cocky boy teamed up with cool-headed, equally cocky boy and a spazz of a girl thrown into the middle. Nothing really special in this category. If you don't mind the traditional set-up, you probably wouldn't have much to complain about.  This anime I would suggest for a day you really have nothing better to do. Admittedly, I struggled at points to finish it-I had to really push myself to get through the last 3-4 episodes or so. It had it's enjoyable parts and I can see it being perfect just to pass time. Otherwise, I'd just hold it off. Overall though, I'd give this anime a 6.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zombie-Loan;WithTheSky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WithTheSky;5;Good for rainy days I guess. Every one I knew was telling me that this was a pretty good anime, so I sat down and made myself watch all 11 episodes.  First off I almost quit halfway into the first episode because I personally HATED the art style. And still do to this day. And I'm normally not super picky about these things (I can usually get into a style like 2 episodes in), so me not liking an art style ALL the way through the anime is pretty weird. But you know-the quality of the art wasn't bad, it was just the style so I managed to get myself through this.  The story line seemed a bit cliché at first, but it gets better. The only thing I didn't really like was how short each arc was, but hey, it's 11 episodes. What do you expect.  Overall, other than a couple of things here and there, it's not that bad of a series.;Mixed Feelings
5;Zombie-Loan;HattiewithSugar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HattiewithSugar;6;"Ok, Zombie Loan isn't really a, say, ""popular"" anime. It hasn't gotten noticeable reviews and doesn't really stand out as a ""special"" anime. It fits in with the common theme of resurrecting the undead and fighting Zombies and demons, which so hasn't been done before... *Cough* High School of the Dead *Cough* D. Gray Man *Cough* Blood Lad...  Story: 6; This is why  The plot line for Zombie Loan is pretty creative, seeking resurrection for individual reasons after dying in a sad accident. There are just too many familiar plot elements that are seen everywhere in all undead demonic zombie anime... Also, the plot is all over the place. Where does it even start?!! The transition from arc-to-arc is so confusing sometimes with a whole bunch of added elements to keep track of! I had to watch that ""Crushed Butterfly Code"" part 4 times to understand it, and I still see it as a whole shitload of unnecessary elements. It's like the author thought of this one day and wanted to show off his ""cleverness"" and just added it, cause, ""who gives a fuck anyway right?"" But seriously, elements were added at the last moment and when they weren't even needed and that just turned the anime into one big clusterfuck of unrelated SHIT! And the ending was the worst out of every anime I've ever watched, y'know, I'm actually gonna switch the plot to a 5, cause I just realized how terrible it is.  Art: 8  Its kind of like a mixture between a lazy Death Note and a lazy Code Geass. It's alright, compared to stuff like Lucky Star and the dark colors really set the mood. No one was wearing bright colors in the whole anime. The brightest color I saw was Michiru's hair. And I LOVED IT!  Sound: 7  There are actually pretty good moments in the transitional soundtrack of this anime. The action scenes seemed to be pretty well recorded and matched with the right music, and the opening sounded a lot like Trigun, which I sort of like b/c I LOVED the Trigun opening! But its really nothing special if you think about it...  Character: 5  I'm sorry, there were way too many characters for such a short anime. It was a SIN! Every episode, a new character came in, like that red-haired dick in episode, like, 9. Like, wtf? And those three characters at the end! You didn't even need them! They were the reason the ending sucked! omg, this anime did not know it's limits when it came to character! It was overwhelming! Michiru once again plays that archetypical girl who can't do shit for herself and always gets in the way! That's pathetic! And then she follow them around for the rest of the anime! (It doesn't make sense, I know, just watch it for yourself and you'll see)  Enjoyment: 7  B/w the clusterfuck rushed plot, and annoying, superfluous characters, I actually might've enjoyed just a little. I mean, I liked some of the action scenes and the antagonists. But that's really all I have to say about that... Not enough for redemption though... sorry Zombie Loan.  Overall: 6";Mixed Feelings
6;Zombie-Loan;Sleepy_Hallow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sleepy_Hallow;6;"Zombie-Loan is easily one of the most unorthodox zombie shows, I've ever watched, and trust me, I've seen a lot. (cap)  ------NO SPOILERS-----  PLOT 6.5/10  So basically, Michiru Kita (the main character) has the ability to take notice of these invisible rings on certain people, if the ring is darker it indicates that the person is closer to death or already dead(a zombie obviously). The ability is ""totally original"" because it is titled the name Shinigami Eyes. Long story short, she quickly makes friends and discovers a Loan agency that allows the person who pays a certain amount of money to come back to life and basically become immortal.

7;Zombie-Loan;Umaru-H;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Umaru-H;6;I watched the anime on watchanime.info and there were 13 episodes and not 11.  the storyline is quite basic, but overall it was amusing. if your are looking for something just to pass time, and give you some enjoyment it is a good anime. But it is not something I would rewatch though, since it is quite basic. But the intruduction of A-loan did make it more interesting in the end.  the characthers are not that intriguing exept for shiito and his backstory. when the main character Michiru turned out to be the only one able to understand the reaper Mr. Zarame, i was hoping she would prove to be a more strong charachter, but she does not untill the very end. and up untill then she basically just follow shito and chika around.;Mixed Feelings
8;Zombie-Loan;dreamofthewild;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dreamofthewild;6;I made it my goal to watch more obscure animes this year, and I definitely hadn't even heard of this one since it came out so long ago. This isn't the greatest anime ever made, but it did keep my attention throughout the whole thing.  I recommend this, not because it's good, but just for those who like to experiment with the shows they watch. The art style is a little strange but you do get used to it over time, I like it since it's kind of a break for me from all the big buff men of the shonen genre. This would have been really good if the story was planned out better, the concept had a lot of potential but it really just wasn't executed very well, and a few of the 'plot twists' are easy to guess beforehand.  I'll give this a 6/10, because although its not great, I did actually enjoy watching it.  Also: On MAL there are only 11 episodes, but if you go over to the Crunchyroll site there are actually 13, however the other 2 don't really do much except set up for the 2nd season (which we never got).;Mixed Feelings

10;Zombie-Loan;Patrxaa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Patrxaa;6;"Zombie Loan is one anime that made me question if it is better for a manga to have a bad anime adaption or just better not have an adaption at all because seriously, the Zombie Loan anime is not really good if we are being honest.  However I wouldn't call this anime bad because of the story. The story is really good, it's not just your everyday ""We need to kill Zombies to survive"" - series, it's way deeper than that (The main characters still kill Zombies in order to survive but it's different lol). The idea of how everything works in Zombie Loan with Zombies, why they exist, etc. is pretty refreshing and I've never came across anything similar so far. That's why I was pretty sad when I found out that the anime isn't complete.  I also wouldn't call this anime bad because of how it adapted the manga. I may have not read the manga but I was able to follow through the anime very nicely and the pacing was really really good. Apart from 2 episodes I can't remember any filler episodes so I like to think that the adaption was pretty well done even if I haven't read the manga myself.  Furthermore I also don't call this anime bad because of it's characters, though they are pretty basic. Nothing special to say here really except for that Michiru can be a bit annoying as she an absolute people pleaser to an extreme extend that she can get on your nerves for apologizing for the 100th time at some point.  I call this anime ""bad"" because it's clearly had issues with budget. Bland backgrounds, partially too simple / boring animation in an anime that partially focusses on fights with zombies / action and I also feel that the art style is something to get used to. It's just not pleasant to look at.  But I am still glad I found and watched this anime because I would have never ever started to read the manga just like that. And thats why (to answer my question from the start) I am happy that this anime exists. The manga is probably way better but without this adaption I would've never considered reading the manga. Well I do now.  To conclude, I would recommend you to read the manga or start watching the anime and then read the rest of the story. All I can give you is a warning that this anime is not completed.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zombie-Loan;Ranivus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ranivus;4;"I have noticed that I haven't written any reviews on bad anime lately so I'm definitely going to try.  Zombie Loan is quite a lame excuse for a zombie anime that contains more plot holes and inconsistencies than a George Romero movie (look him up)     Story (Poor) The story is quite laughable in every sense of the word. It is a mix of fan service, action, and comedy. Of course there are ways to execute a combo like this well, but it doesn't pull it off at all. They do well to suck you into the show with the first few episodes, but further down the road, you will notice it gets more and more ridiculous to even an open-minded person such as me to accept. The enemies are also pretty unimpressive. When I expect brutal zombie fights, the least I would expect would be puppies, nuns, and otakus. To give the story some credit though, it does get fairly decent towards the end after all the characters have established themselves. Also, don't forget the fan service as they try to hit all points of fan service from bishoujo to loli to bishonen. It's all there.  Art (Mediocre) Theres nothing wrong with the art, but theres nothing great about it either. It's obvious from the start that the main aspect of the characters are their sex appeal and their HAIR. Yes their hair, its noticeably more detailed than an average anime, and pointy. I'm surprised no ones eyes gets poked out from all the pointy hair flying around. Suffice to say, they drew most of the men in a bishounen style whereas the women were drawn with a cute moe style (again with the fan service). Girls who love that style will like the boys and the same goes to the boys who love the girls. As for me (being a guy), I loved how all the girls were drawn and even their characteristics weren't bad at all. Aside from favoritism, everything else from backgrounds to static objects and stand ins were just average in my book. Nothing to write home about.  Sound (Decent) The sound is also not very stellar for such a short anime. A lot of MAL users didn't seem to appreciate the opening theme song (ref: MAL forums). As for me, the OP was average it seems like they were trying to steal a page from Death Note with a hard j-rock theme with no real relevance to the show. The sound effects throughout the show are also average. You'll encounter more comedy sounds than anything else. Also, theres a lot of music in the show, but in the same token, theres a lot of 'dead air' (like a faint wind blowing). But for the most part you will wish they lightened up on the background music. It's only saving grace from a &quot;Pathetic&quot; score (1 point), is the voice casting. Well you can tell the girls are all voiced in a cute or 'typical' manner but some of the guys didn't sound too good in my opinion. One of the main characters even has a nasally tone to his ranting and raving which was quite irritating at times.  Characters (Decent) Although it's very hard to take an anime like this serious when ALL THREE main characters special abilities are horrible from the start. One can see a band on their neck showing if that person is alive or dead. That ability is fine, but the other two have to switch hands with each other in order to call forth a sword or gun. Which begs the question... why not just keep your own hands to yourself (the reason is also pretty lame IMO). Now I could understand if there was a decent explanation, but its lame. Theres holes like this throughout this show as you would expect from an 11 episode show. Some of the holes are big, like how did they get so good at fighting, or why even bother going to school when your dead and broke. I'm sure you'll find your own issues to pick on throughout your viewing. A good point of the characters though is the fan service aspect as they again cover as many aspects as they can, but even that can help the score that much.   Overall, it's an all right anime that looks like it tries too hard to please a broad audience in such a small time. Even the manga felt to ambitious as well. I believed if Peach-Pit focused more on the story rather than the fan service, it would have been a much better show. Its a shame that such a bad story came from the same person that made Rozen Maiden, Shugo Chara, and Di Gi Charat.   Verdict (4.4)";Not Recommended

Man, I think this is actually the first time I put 1 to an anime and I can't believe myself cause I really don't like to put a 1 in something I invested time...  I'm gonna put a 3/10 to art cause there's definitively worst art than this and sound could be a 2 or a 10 but idk and don't care either.  I'm not gonna talk about this anime cause I seriously can't remember anything about it other than being so so so soooo appalling bad, so you can skip my review and read another one with technical details on it. I will base my review on another aspect which I consider it's the most important while making a production of any sort: resistance.  Ok, for me, anything that's considered good has to resist in time and this surely didn't: I can't recall ANYTHING from this other than the title. No chara, no story... anything. I had to read the summary just to check! And I was sure I did watch it! And if this anime would have engaged me in any way, I surely would remember even if it passed a million years ago, like I still and always will do with my beloved 20th Century Boys masterpiece. That's the difference between good and bad execution.  I highly recommend to everyone on planet Earth NOT to watch this!!! It's a total waste of your time you should be investing on studying or watching another anime which is actually good. Those 13 episode-time in your like are never gonna be back again.  Go watch FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood instead, or read 20th Century Boys. Do yourselves a favor ;) and if you did watch/read them, go watch/read again.

Similar to getting ready for school but in animation form.  Art For clay animation it was quite well. The animation it made was smooth.  Sound Sound levels for some of the effects and voices were a tad off putting level wise. Some of the sound effects were terrible. Either to loud or did not make a good match. For example there was a truck sound for a regular car.  Character A lot of detail is missed. You start on day 3 but as for day 1 and 2 what happened? What is the character's personality? Is the location his? A lot of questions remain a mystery. He had as much background as a cardboard cutout.  Enjoyment I do not recommend watching this.

0;Zoku Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru;Skejven;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skejven;8;Second season of Hanamaru delivers probably everything you could expect from a sequel to the first season. More Japanese swords and polearms transformed into either cute or handsome B O I S and their wholesome slice of life type adventures. Getting to the point, if you're a fan of either Touken Ranbu, or just the TR anime, it's a must watch.  Art style is pretty generic, but it's still enjoyable to look at, animation is fluid and overall it's doing it's job. Can't seem to recall any music that stood out other than the opening.  Moving from the audiovisual stuff, lets talk about the most important aspect of this series. Characters. If you're looking for psychological anime with a lot of character development and moral questions, you won't find it here. And that's good. Those are really straightforward characters and I need to say, it's hard to dislike any of them, especially if you played the TR game. In this show you will find a lot of lighthearted, heartwarming situations, some small dramas here and there with a lot of comedy thrown into it. Just seeing your favourite swords (or naginatas or yari or whatever) in the action really gives you a big smile on your face.  So if you're looking for a wholesome show about really likable male characters, their lifes, interactions between them, struggles and histories, you should give Zoku a go!;Recommended
1;Zoku Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru;4561236;https://myanimelist.net/profile/4561236;7;Where Touken Ranbu Hanamaru fell short, It's sequel made sure to make up for it in ways I honestly did not expect from this kind of slice of life series.  A common issue with the previous season that is a MASSIVE improvement on Zoku, is the fact that now we do actually get time to see the rest of the huge cast do their daily activities or just be silly dudes doing silly stuff when not having action packed scenes.  Speaking of those scenes, I was pleasantly surprised to see an improvement in there as well. While the animation itself is on the cheap side, the animators knew how make good action with the available tools. Which, again, is nice for a series that is not mainly about the fighting.  Character wise I would say It stayed truthful to the source material to the point It was hilarious in my opinion.  Music was the same as the art, honestly. Nothing bad, nothing particularly impressive either. Just did the job when It needed to be done. Personally some of the handful scenes where the characters start to sing just because weren't really to my liking since I felt It wouldn't make a huge difference whether or not they were there.  Overall this isn't a extremely complex anime and is clearly aimed at fans of the game or people with a certain level of knowledge on the series as well (I compare It to Fate in that sense. Lots of characters), yet is a nice show to pass the time.;Recommended
0;Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei;Tenchio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tenchio;9;"This is a comedy/satire anime and the jokes are generally based on the problems and absurdities of society and humanity as a whole. It's full of references to the anime industry: both to series, producers, voice actors, character stereotypes etc. To understand many of the jokes, you have to have watched a lot of different animes and know your terminology, otherwise you will instead of laughing end up with a question mark on your face. A lot of jabs are also aimed at recent and old happenings in Japan and are thusly hard to understand for viewers without a profound knowledge of Japanese culture and history. This is not that big of an issue, and of course not a flaw of the show, but it deserves to be mentioned as it might affect your viewing experience. It should also be noted that the the comedy in Zoku often ventures into the completely absurd, even more so than in the first season.  The ""story"" revolves around a high-school class full of different, crazy students and their mentally unstable techer: Itoshiki Nozomu, Zetsubou Sensei. He sees everything in a negative light and always falls into despair when he thinks about all the everyday trials one has to face and endure. Together with his students and many other wacky characters, he drives all the issues to their extreme and the end result is often hilarious. Some reoccuring jokes, like panty shots, become annoying after a while, but the diversity is still very good.  Often, there are so many things on-screen that you have to pause to see them all, since the pacing is very high. This is one of the few actual flaws this anime has. There are very few new characters introduced, but there isn't a really a pressing need for any, because the cast is already big enough. This also prevents Zoku from taking up too much time with character introductions, which was the major problem of the first season.  Zoku sports the same innovative aestethics as the first season and the quality of art and animation hasn't improved noticably. It's hard to describe the visual style accurately, but it's generally simple and 2D-ish, with some interesting special effects. Throughout the series, there are however many different art styles utilized, enhancing the relative ""drama"" and sheer randomness of particular scenes.  The BGM is used nicely, and while not being particularily memorable, it does a great job of helping the jokes hit home. As for the OPs and EDs, they're all great and suit the series perfectly. Kuusou Runba is undoubtedly one of the best OPs I've ever had the pleasure to hear and it fits the intro flawlessly.  To summarize, Zoku is an excellent second season that surpasses the first season in all ways possible. While the episodes differ in terms of qualitative - and understandable - jokes, they're generally ingeniously executed and highly entertaining. However, this series does demand that you as a spectator has a decent knowledge of the anime industry and Japanese culture; if you don't, you will miss out on a lot of the fun. So if you for this - or some other - reason didn't like the first season, there's no reason for you to bother trying this. And vice versa, of course.";Recommended
1;Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei;daisy-chains;https://myanimelist.net/profile/daisy-chains;8;"My friend asked me what this anime was about and I looked her right in the eye and asked, “Do you know what a dank meme is?” Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, the second season of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, is a satirical comedy that pokes fun at our everyday behaviour whilst simultaneously bringing to light the more serious issues in modern society.  The protagonist of this anime is Nozomu Itoshiki, a seemingly depressed young man whose name literally spells out “despair” when written horizontally. Itoshiki likes to portray himself as being pessimistic and suicidal, although upon closer inspection, one would notice that he is neither. In direct contrast to him, is Kafuka Fuura, a cheerful optimist (though again, the genuineness of her persona is questionable). Itoshiki lands himself a job as the homeroom teacher of Fuura’s eccentric class and soon embarks upon several adventures alongside his students.  The art is unique but not especially breath-taking. However, it is clear that the hues are carefully chosen to set the mood. The soundtrack, again, is nothing special. The opening and ending songs are great but the lyrics are somewhat nonsensical (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing).  The characters are definitely what give Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei its flavour. The new characters introduced in this season include: Manami Ookusa, an okusama-nami (married person); Ikkyu, an “old friend” of Itoshiki who is obsessed with all old things; Kuniya Kino, a student of 2-H with an unconventional taste in clothes; and Marui who has a crush on Kuniya but is appalled by his sense of fashion.  Personally, I found Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei to be extremely enjoyable and I highly recommend it. This anime does seem to be targeted towards the more cynical individuals of society. That being said, it isn’t overwhelmingly deep/philosophical so even if you’re just looking for a good laugh after a hard day’s work, you’ll find this anime pleasurable.";Recommended
2;Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei;hexashadow13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hexashadow13;7;"tl;dr: A continuation of the formula from the first season, and though one that is starting to get more random and a bit repetitive, one that still holds up reasonably well.  This season continues the despair filled stories of the strange Nozomu Itoshiki and his just as strange class. In many ways its simply a continuation of the previous season, however I feel that it was different in a number of ways.  In terms of the structure of the show, just like before its a series of short episodes. However, I feel that in this season they have even less plot to them than the previous season. The first season was used mostly to introduce characters, and though it didn't do much with them beyond that, since it was introducing the large cast of characters it didn't feel like an issue at the time. This season continues using those characters with a few added in, but also doesn't do much with them either. This is further exasperated due to how the show seems to be adapting the manga in a completely random order. I get that the first season did that as well, but it didn't seem as much of an issue then, while in this season it actually felt like there were instances where it felt off having shown something before something else. As a result of these two things, this season is simply gags and pessimistic social commentary without any sort of overarching narrative or character progression. Furthermore, it felt like it was moving through a lot of this too fast and hence I wasn't a fan of the pacing. As for the gags themselves, they were pretty solid just like the first season. The core of dark comedy heavily based on social commentary was still really interesting and worked incredibly well. However, it felt like it veered from that quite a bit into gags that were purely random. Now the first season had a bunch of random gags as well, and I'm not opposed to them in general, in that I actually like them from time to time. But here it felt like it was used too much and often in ways that didn't seem to have any sort of point other than being random for the sake of randomness, which got kind of old as it went on.  The art was still really bizarre, but it tried to do a bunch of things to make it more interesting like changing styles and such, which was hit and miss. The OP was fine audio wise, but bizarre visually, though how it changed was pretty cool. EDs were pretty good.";Recommended

This is among the first anime that directed studio Shaft towards their unique directing, and the unconventional directing styles fits this equally odd anime with a whole bunch of entertaining eccentrics like a glove. This show was also among the few who pioneered the names of characters being their personalities much like Komi-san. The music reflects the absurd nature of the show; self aware and constant yet never tiring self-deprecation.

4;Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei;Akira-S;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Akira-S;6;"＊My mother tongue is not English, so I use a translator.  While gags are fired off one after another, there's a prevalent impression of many Japan-specific jokes. It seems highly regarded overseas as well, and I'm amazed that anime fans are familiar with Japanese culture to such an extent. Right from the start, even the protagonist's name becomes a clever wordplay - Itoshiki Nozomu (糸色望). The characters '糸' means 'thread,' '色' means 'colour,' and '望' means 'hope.' When you place these characters side by side, it forms 糸色望, which reads as '絶望(Zetsubou),' meaning 'hopeless.' Thus, 'Itoshiki Nozomu' translates to 'Hopeless Teacher.' Moreover, the sound '(糸色)Itoshiki' can also be interpreted as 'beloved,' resulting in 'Beloved Teacher.' Such wordplay appears throughout. By the way, my favourite moment is the reference to Gaban/Gavan in the fourth episode. I couldn't stop laughing. ""Jouchaku!""  I thought the humor sense of the original author, Kouji Kumeta, is similar to that of the comedy duo ""Rahmens,"" but interestingly, there are panels in the original manga that mock Rahmens. I wonder if this is a form of self-deprecating humor.  Either way, the anime is even more crude, and it's all about constant silliness, which is great. However, the unnecessary and excessive insertion of panty shots, as seen in some scenes, would be open to criticism in today's Japan.  The Japanese-style and flat screen composition are techniques that were later inherited in the ""Monogatari"" series. It's a brilliant approach by Akiyuki Shinbo and Shaft, which both reduces animation effort and maintains a stylish presentation.  The anime is a delightful mix of logical gags, nonsense, wordplay, and parody. Truly an entertaining work!  If it had been on television, it would have been a delight to watch every week. Base score 5/10; add one point to give it a 6/10, as its energetic silliness and outstanding voice-over performances are still present in the second season.";Recommended
0;Zoku Owarimonogatari;Boxwithcola;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Boxwithcola;9;"Edit: Just changed some bits after having watched Zoku for a second time  Note: Watched this in Japanese cinemas. Japanese is not my native language and the monogatari series is quite complex to say the least. Therefore I might not have understood everything to the fullest extent. Luckily the BD release is just around the corner! Anyhow, this is still one of the best parts of the monogatari series in my opinion though.  So how you do you make a sequel to the end? Well, Nishio Ishin managed to it again! In my opinion, Zoku Owarimonogatari was not really needed to wrap up the main story. However, it is a neat little extra storyline for those who wanted to know what happened with Araragi after his graduation.  As I hinted at before, this story is about Araragi. Even though the main story line is practically finished, Araragi's mind and thoughts has not reached the conclusion he wants. Araragi is kind of stuck in one place, he just finished high school but has yet to start college nor got any job, he became a nobody despite all the adventures he has experienced so far. Suddenly, a little bathroom mirror incident quite literally turns his reality backwards or ""inverts"" it if you'd like. The story is just as bizarre as one would expect from Ishin-sensei by now. All I will say is that as for someone who has been in the same shoes as Araragi regarding regrets in life and anxiety for the future, I can really appreciate this story. I really hope you will as well!  I won't say more story-wise for those who are really looking forward to watch this, but I really want to talk a little about how Shaft's anime adaptation of the novel is so splendid. Apart from the excellent story and the great characters we have come to love from the monogatari series (albeit a bit different this time), I really must talk about the animation and the effects in this movie. The animation and effects happen to be one of the best parts of this film, since they are in a sense so well adapted from the novel (Which makes no sense because novels do not have animation and effects). But hear me out! For those who has read the novel know the setting of this story, and the way shaft uses reflections to enhance the visuals and make the setting more trustworthy really blew my mind because it is something, I have never personally seen myself before in an anime. The amount of detail shaft has put into the ""inverted/mirrored"" reality, environment and characters really makes you further respect the love and effort Shaft has put into the monogatari series. I can’t wait to inspect the environment when I watch the film again.  The only thing that I think could have been slightly better is the background music, it is a slight step-down from earlier entries. It is worth to note that the music is still very good, but I expected much more depth from something like monogatari.  Overall, I really love this film, it is definitely one of the best monogatari entries but it's kind of sad that the main story has come to an end. The monogatari series will remain one of the best series I have ever watched, and I am glad it has gone on for this long. Now, we just have to wait and see which monogatari novel is the next to get an anime adaptation. ¡ᴉɹɐʇɐƃouoɯᴉɹɐʍO-nʞoZ ʎoɾuǝ ǝsɐǝld  PS: Sodachi is great freaking waifu material in this one. 終わり";Recommended
1;Zoku Owarimonogatari;The-Observer95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The-Observer95;10;Let me say this from the start that I like the opening and ending of this movie so much. Studio Shaft has done a phenomenal job once again , specially now because it was theatrical release, our man Akiyuki Shinbo has done a great job, I will say even that overall its an improvement on the previous seasons. I liked those numbers that showed that how many cuts have been shown from the movie but this time the cuts were reversed because that right Araragi was in the mirror world (by the way this not a spoiler, its right there in the description). It was also delight to see characters acting different in the mirror world, I liked this take on the characters. When its comes to animation on this movie, well how could I describe it in a one sentences because it pays homage to many different animation styles and characters that its hard to keep up, but I will say that animation is darn good and pure eye candy. This is the kind of animation I will take screenshot of and hang it on the wall of my house as art-piece, because look at those colors my man and tell me that its not art, yes you can not. Background art is something that so many studio's not give much thought to it and in many anime's it lacks the polish it truly deserves but Shafts is the exception because by the trickery of CGI it makes them look so beautiful. I wish series will get a new season in the future because I like this anime so much, if you are going to watch this, just watch it because you will not regret watching this movie.;Recommended

Waking up one day, Araragi ponders about this when he suddenly notices his reflection in the bathroom mirror to be somewhat disjointed to his person. Touching the mirror pulls him in inexplicably into it. He wokes up naturally in a world like his own where everything is inverted, even the other characters are different to their real world counterparts. Now, before we go ""Through the looking glass"" kind of thing of a simple total inversion of this world to the other, there's more to it than just a simple reflection of our workd. Anyway, Araragi must work his way around this delimma.  I like the look of movie in the openning part. It mimics the style of the book illustration of the series. Sadly it reverted back it's default look throughout the rest of it. The Monogatari series is well known for it's nonsensical exercise of visual display and shifting shots, Zuko is no different. It's like the Airplane movie of visuals ""Don't like that graphics?! Dont worry we have 100 different more.""  Watching the movie with a limited Japanese is a trial of forbearance, especially it running at 2 and a half so running time. Most of the film are static talking heads, so I do suggest to those language impaired to wait for a good translation of the film to come out. There are a lot of delightful moments to be sure, but not enough throughout the film to keep out the monotony of the long languid moments.  In the end I find it an intriguing film. The looking glass aspect is sure present, but not in a superficial sense, more of a personal and introspective one to Araragi. We never get to see our true selves when we look at a mirror, only a skewed and dim version of what others can see. At the very end, the reflection Araragi see is right in front of him in the beginning.  Intriguing, yes. Fun, somewhat. Perplexing, most definitely, .... as it should be.";Recommended
3;Zoku Owarimonogatari;veemon23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/veemon23;10;Did we really need this movie? Honestly I would say no, but as a fan of this series, I am glad it happened! I was wondering how would they continue after such a amazing conclusion to the series? But man... they pulled it off with a brilliant idea. Worth a watch for fan of the series and just wanted to see more.  It doesn't really add anything to the main story beside just little things here and there. Mainly adding to their character development and relationship... especially to emphasize why Senjougahara is the best girl for our main boy. Not saying she's best girl overall, that still belongs to our Vampire Queen.  As for this story, it adds a unique element to it. Can't really review this without spoiler because it would make no sense at all how this will continue the series or add anything to the series? This movie basically takes place in a alternative reality or we should say, a mirror world... or at least that's what it wants us to think? It presents a unique idea of the characters in a different light as if you know, mirror reflect light which is why we can see our reflection, though not 100% accurate. This too is basically portraying that concept and it had a unique idea going for it. For the most part you'll be left wondering what the heck is going on? But it explains itself pretty well as you follow along. I say the first time you watch this, just let it explain itself and don't try to analyze stuff. I would do that on the second time so you can enjoy it better this way.  There's not much to talk about the characters beside a unique twist to their characters. How none of them are as they seem at all. Okay I probably get hated for this but dude I love the adult version of Hachikuji more! I enjoyed seeing her since I saw her in the second season one. So to see her in here again, I was glad to see her. But yeah I can't really say much for characters as you can see how they all have different personality or unique changes to them. And we also see a character who we have not seen before who freaking was awesome! I won't spoil this one...  Overall, I love that this happened though it doesn't add anything to the overall plot. It's kind of like a OVA and movies that's just there to add more enjoyment but not really canon as they kind of poke fun of it in the movie itself. So it was pretty self-aware. Worth a watch for fan of the series.;Recommended
4;Zoku Owarimonogatari;tosnorm;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tosnorm;7;I was more than happy with the ending of Owarimonogatari, so why continue the ending? I feel as though it wrapped Araragi's story near perfectly and is the clear endpoint for his character. Well, it's Monogatari, so the answer is always fanservice. The premise is quite intriguing to me, and the story itself turned out to be somewhat fascinating. There's only one problem: it's way too long. Does it need to be that long? No. Why is it that long? Constant exposition and recaps of the story and of course, fanservice. I do not know if this is only a problem in the episodic format (the one I watched), but almost every episode has long exposition or recap scenes. I actually usually enjoy when all the characters explain what is happening from their viewpoint to Araragi, but there are just too many of these scenes in Zoku. He really did not need to travel around and hear nearly every girls' opinion, because ultimately, they all had little impact on the story. Their opinions are certainly all interesting and give an insight into the characters, but they just don't stop. These scenes unfortunately just feel like an excuse to see all the different versions of characters that we probably won't see again, and end up hurting the overall quality and viewing experience of the show. This is not to say that the fanservice is bad, because a lot of it is really good, even for Monogatari standards. Mayoi Onee-chan is a top tier waifu, my life feels fulfilled after seeing smug Ononoki, and the scene with Senjougahar almost makes up for her absence from the rest of the season, but when all these turn what should have been a 4 episode arc into 6 episodes, there is a problem. Zoku Owarimonogatari ultimately falls onto the same level as Nisemonogatari: just a vessel to deliver more fanservice. Zoku is less hollow and better executed than Nise, but just not great. Although it did provide some context for Hanamonogatari and made Hana more interesting, it did little to change my perception of the season it is a part of, Owarimonogatari. Of course, you'll you like it if you like Monogatari, but it really does just feel like a bland and forgettable Monogatari arc. All that said, the good easily outweighs the bad. 7/10;Recommended
5;Zoku Owarimonogatari;hvdi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hvdi;10;"!!! ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW IS NOT AS IN DEPTH AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEAVE OUT ANY SPOILERS. !!!  Before getting into this review, I think you need to understand something. That something is: that a majority of the love for this film comes from a love of the series. It comes from a love of the directing style, the character dynamics, and the eccentric plot. If you don't love these things about Monogatari, then you won't love Zoku Owari, the ultimate Monogatari.  Zoku Owari is the ultimate Monogatari. Why is it the ultimate Monogatari? Because it's the most Monogatari, Monogatari. Everything from the wacky artistic direction down to the stupid mannerisms is exactly what Monogatari is to me.  In my personal experience, watching any Monogatari just once is never enough. I feel as if I have to watch each Monogatari at least twice or even three times to truly digest everything. There is so much to marvel at from the perfect dialogue, to background art, to character designs, to the wide array of artistic styles within seconds of one another.  But on top of all that complexity is a deeply intertwined story that requires your full attention for the entirety of the series. It requires you to invest yourself in Araragi Koyomi's world and to devote yourself to seeing his story play out. Although Owari is the, ""end,"" we get to see Araragi finally close the last chapter of his high school life in Zoku.  So now to specifically get into Zuko, I'll start off with possibly my favorite part of the entire film: the stupidity.  The stupidity of this film is completely overwhelming. I would, in most cases, criticize films for bringing up plot holes but then dismissing them as if they didn't exist but actually in Monogatari, I don't care. The story has set itself up as one which can just plainly excuse anything that might be seen as questionable and to be honest, that's fine with me. I think that I am most fine with this because it fits perfectly into the artistic, comedic, and storytelling direction that I have fell so much in love with.  But on top of the usual eccentric direction the story explores, it felt as if Zoku maximized the potential of this artistic style without being too overwhelming. I would normally insert an example here but I can't give mine because it would simply ruin this scene and spoil it for anyone who wants to watch the film. But, what I can say is that it uses something set up as a precedent in Owari, and completely flips it on it's head. Just like you may think you know what's going to happen then you don't as Owari does, Zoku uses an exactly opposite technique but achieves the exact same effect.  This is Monogatari. It sets up your expectations, then undermines them. And you know what? That's the beauty of it. That's what makes it so great to me.  For example, I had questions that were raised in my mind from recent seasons of Monogatari, as anyone would. Shortly after the beginning of the film, an energetic Ononoki Yotsugi appears and directly mentions my questions. But guess what? She doesn't answer my questions at all. She basically says, ""Who cares?"" and you know what? She's right. Who cares? This IS Monogatari, not some proper, rule-following film that's looking for critical acclaim, it's a film created simply to enjoy. So that's exactly what I did.  I enjoyed it and I think you should too.  Notes: Honestly, I wasn't quite sure what to write about for the entirety of this review since I could ramble on and on about character dynamics and plot but instead I'd rather just give you what I enjoy about Zoku specifically. Every Monogatari has the character dynamics and plot (obviously, that's what makes it a great series and most enjoyable to me) but there really is only one Zoku, just like there really is only one Bake. So I do hope you enjoyed this review and I would love if you could leave a little, ""this was helpful."" Thanks and hope you read my future reviews. :)  Ratings- Story: 10 Art: 10 Sound: 10 Character: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Overall: 10!!!";Recommended
6;Zoku Owarimonogatari;FrozenCappucino;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FrozenCappucino;10;"Realizing the fact that the main story has ended feels really weird because i didnt feel fulfilled (in the first place). what i mean by that is i've been watching monogatari the same way as how i watch the simpson or family guy, i have this sense of ""safetiness"" from knowing that one day the show will ends, you watch one episode, u enjoy it, and then u go back to ur daily routine while thinking ""i can't wait for the next 100 episodes"". I dont read the LN, so i didn't really get how close the series months ago from ending, aside from the soon gonna be released title obviously. But when the reality kicks in and the show really ends with such a beautiful scene, i found myself dumbfounded while asking ""dafuq, dont u have another 100 oddities to meet?"". Then i realize how small the appreciation i've been giving to this amazing series, thus i made this MAL account not to review, but simply to give my first step of appreciation of how much this simple ordinary office worker enjoyed every single episode of the series. While writing this ""review"" i finally feel fulfilled. I know there will be off seasons to be animated and released, but i'm sure it will not feel the same since it's no longer the main story. The series may came with lots of flaws but in the end it comes to how much one enjoys it. And for this series to be able to entertain me through the years of my ordinary life, that in itself deserves my 100 out of 10.

7;Zoku Owarimonogatari;hexashadow13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hexashadow13;9;"tl;dr: An epilogue that’s mostly just having fun but that manages to end on a pretty powerful note.  Zoku Owarimonogatari is an epilogue to Araragi’s story, and thus all of Monogatari so far really. I know that there are quite a few novels after this, but they’re unlikely to get an adaptation, and it isn’t completely clear whether the novels will be translated either, so for now I’m just going to consider this as the ending of Monogatari. Everything that had been building up it had been resolved in the previous arc, and there was no necessity to build up things for the future either, so this arc is pretty much just a self contained arc that’s playing around.  The premise is simply Araragi in a mirrored world where character’s are very different from how they normally are and Araragi exploring this world looking for a way to return to his world. Thus, the majority of this season is simply him interacting with strange versions of common characters. This is quite a lot of fun because characters were beginning to start feeling overtly familiar and so an arc that changes things up completely was exactly what was needed to keep things interesting. The writing for the majority of the arc is kind of stupid, in that it doesn’t even try to write around plot holes or inconsistencies. Rather, it just sets up the narrative such that such issues are simply allowed to exist and then goes full throttle in just rolling with them. Still, it’s not supposed to be all that deep, and it results in a lot of great humor and comedy, so overall I’d say it was quite enjoyable.  The exception to that is the last episode where it gets to the root of everything and the writing turns out to not be as stupid as it originally seemed, though still kind of stupid, and ultimately it does leave off on a really solid note. The final message isn’t all that complex or deep either, basically being that in the aftermath of the story there will always be regrets, and that’s fine, just keep moving forward. But it’s a message that I think is the perfect thing to end the series on, and the heavy handed way that it was delivered in the end felt absolutely perfect and got me quite a bit more emotional than the ending of the previous arc did. To be honest, I was somewhat disappointed with the previous arc as an ending, but this is a solid enough epilogue to make my final impressions on the series quite positive.  The art and animation aren’t too different from the previous seasons, but it makes good use of the mirror aspect for some interesting effects. The OP is kind of insane and one of those OPs that are trying to be more interesting and artistic than actually good, which I usually hate, but that I thought was pulled off pretty well here. The ED is pretty standard Monogatari and is decently solid but at this point not particularly memorable. The soundtrack was decent enough but also not particularly memorable.";Recommended
8;Zoku Owarimonogatari;Hydra_no_Mago;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hydra_no_Mago;9;"Overall: (9/10) Usually I would not rate an anime too high since nitpicking is a given past time of various viewers, but ""Zoku Owarimonogatari"" is a fitting end to the ""Monogatari Series"" which began airing in 2009. After a decade of Araragi and his companions' misadventures, this final installation (airing date wise) finally fills in any lacunas left in ""Hanamonogatari"" and leaves audiences with a bittersweet note.  Story: (9/10) Although I was largely skeptical at first due to what seemed like a simple premise, the plot surged ahead at the very end, revealing hidden cards and tying all loose ends neatly with a bow. Senjougahara mentioned that ""the message [of the story] was too strong"", but personally I feel that this is one of the exemplary ways to show the ending of high school life. (No, it is not a spoiler, we figure everything out in ""Hanamonogatari anyway.) Many other animes end it with tearful goodbyes and bright shots against falling sakura, but in true Nishio fashion, Zoku Owarimonogatari takes a supernatural yet rational approach: time moves forward, and though we may be unsure of ""which foot to start walking on"" once the traffic life turns green, all we have to do is take a leap of faith with the people we love. Not as big of a cliche as anyone would have guessed it to be, with the proper pace and storytelling methods which are employed to great emotional effect in this anime. With puzzling incidents and a ticking time bomb situation (which never felt oppressive), the story will surely rivet inquisitive viewers to the end.  Art: (8/10) In true ""Monogatari Series"" style, the art is close to perfect. Not in terms of fluidity as in most modern shōnen anime or detail as in the architecture of ""Ao no Exorcist"", but the mash of typography, surrealism and even pop culture references (see if you notice the Marilyn Monroe one). The art style is snappy and comical, either made cartoonish or realistic depending on the situation. As expected of this series too, the art enhances the story yet never overpowers it, toeing the line like a talented trapeze artist.  Sound: (7/10) While it may not live up to the soundtracks in ""Bakemonogatari"", ""Zoku Owarimonogatari"" has a larger repertoire of sound compared to most others in the ""Monogatari Series"". The sound was more carefully selected this time, with emphasis on highlighting several climatic scenes and wrenching questions in the show. They could have done better with it, but personally I am happy with how it turned out.  Character: (8/10) As all our favourite characters take some twists in this particular show while retaining their loveable characteristics, the award for character development goes to none other than the titular character, Araragi Koyomi himself. It was refreshing to see Araragi facing down his problems and admitting his remaining regrets as he graduates high school. Instead of him running around trying his best to fix everyone else's problems, and with the exception of ""Owarimonogatari"", this is the time for his character to shine. With Araragi's self-realisation, it certainly lends that finality to this series, and show that everyone should be saved, even the ones doing said saving. Although due to the amount of characters, most of them had limited screen time, though it is understandable, especially since this arc basically focuses on the theme of: [Moving Forward].  Enjoyment: (9/10) As a viewer who was utterly awed by the first instalment, I have been following the ""Monogatari Series"" for a long time now. To similar viewers, this is the sense of catharsis we have been waiting for, the final moment which is not the end of everything; just the end of the beginning. To new viewers, though you may be skeptical about starting this series, fear not, for I guarantee that while you may be of the camp that does not prefer it, you would surely experience something different in this now saturated world of anime.";Recommended
9;Zoku Owarimonogatari;captain_101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/captain_101;10;The Monogatari Series is a wild ride that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a series to really get invested in. It is full of deep character development and fantastic dialogue that makes you really attached to each an every character and their stories and problems. Sure, the series has its slow points, but it always seems to pull me back in when I am starting to feel bored. Each character has an extremely unique story to tell, making them all enjoyable characters to watch. Throughout the story Araragi goes through a massive amount of problems and issues that he must solve, and I think that Zoku Owarimonogatari is a fantastic end to his story. It is the perfect way for him to move on from his life in high School and the regrets that he has accumulated throughout the series. In my opinion, there was no better way to end this story and I am glad that I was able to watch it.;Recommended
10;Zoku Owarimonogatari;VeiledEdge;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VeiledEdge;7;Zoku Owarimonogatari is an unseemingly fitting epilogue to Owarimonogatari Second Season. Whereas Owarimonogatari Second Season focused on wrapping up the plot of the Monogatari Series, Zoku Owarimonogatari focused on wrapping up the themes and feelings of the Monogatari Series.  From a visual standpoint, do not expect Kizumonogatari visuals even though Zoku Owarimonogatari is a movie. Zoku Owarimonogatari looks and sounds just like a regular, high-quality Monogatari Series Arc. The notable thing missing is the sporadic flashing walls of text. I don’t know for sure if no other arc has completely taken them out like this, but this is the first time I’m noticing it. Before I get any angry comments about the flashing walls of text at the end, I wouldn’t count those. Fight me.  Zoku Owarimonogatari is a mystery arc much like the Sodachi Arc. Both arcs start with a hazy premise surrounded by mystery. This mystery then slowly and climactically resolves ending in an epiphany. Given, Zoku Owarimonogatari’s epiphany is actually wholesome, unlike the dark and gruesome Sodachi Arc epiphany. Surprisingly, both are a coming of age piece about coming to peace with the past but in completely different contexts.  Having said that, I believe Zoku Owarimonogatari is the first actual coming of age arc of the series. A few arcs feature a coming of age theme, but none are solely about it. This is a fitting theme to end the Monogatari Series on. Zoku Owarimonogatari, despite its name, is not a shallow sequel or cash grab. Zoku Owarimonogatari has as much of what I’d call plot and character orchestration and conviction as something like Owarimonogatari Second Season. Every part, every detail, every line is so well thought out and makes perfect sense not only within itself but within the entire Monogatari Series universe. This unique cohesiveness that is found in Kizumonogatari, Owarimonogatari Series Second Season, and now Zoku Owarimonogatari is truly the hallmark of the Monogatari Series. There’s an indistinguishable feeling of belonging and nostalgia the Monogatari Series provides that I value very highly. I can count on one hand the number of series I’ve enjoyed as much as the Monogatari Series.  Zoku Owarimonogatari is an absolute must-watch. It does a better job of giving us insight into the Monogatari Series world and characters than even Owarimonogatari Second Season. Zoku Owarimonogatari is the definitive epilogue we needed but did not deserve.  InB4: There’s actually more Monogatari. Bet.  A passing thought: I need to rewatch Hanamonogatari. Why is that the end and not this? It just spoils the ending to this telling us he did get accepted into the college. Tsk tsk. Much confused.  Ending thoughts: I will write these in my review of Bakemonogatari because that’s a more fitting place to attempt to encourage people to watch the series.;Recommended
11;Zoku Owarimonogatari;Yeetomfg2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yeetomfg2;8;"*THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS*  The monogatari series has always delivered on everything: action, comedy, shock; it pretty much has everything you could ever ask for. You would think that after 11 TV shows that it would drop in quality but i would actually say that the last few shows (including this one) are better than Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari on certain aspects.  STORY:  The story of the monogatari series is like a big sea and the different stories are like rivers flowing into it, slowly making it bigger and more beautiful. Long story short, the story is an amazing because it sets the stage for the different characters to be different and express themselves. But ,like some of the characters say: ""This is a silly premise"". That is true, we have seen the character going into a (basically) opposite dimension or world before, but it always seem to happen in something like specials because everyone knows its a pretty silly premise but that is the exact reason Zoku Owarimonogatari can use it in a serious way to actually reaveal stuff about the story. In my opinion the concept is a great one and it fits with the Monogatari series but its not the most creative thing ever. 8/10  ART:  Im gonna keep it short here: It's the Monogatari series art (The SHAFT art if you will) that we know and love. Some people might say that the art hasnt changed for 14 years and see that as a bad thing but when you have your own style i dont see a reason to change it. 9/10  SOUND:  This is where the recent entries in the Monogatari series have dropped the ball recently in my opinion. It might be because over the years this series has given us some of the best OP's and music in general so i might have rally high expectations but the Zoku Owarimonogatari OP is bad and the music is so loud sometimes that it covers the dilogue. What saves the sound, ironically enough is the amazing dialogue that has become an big part of this show. I applaud the voice actors for their amazing work. 6/10  CHARACTERS:  I am going to keep it short again: I'ts the Monogatari series, of course the characters are amazing, they pretty much are the most entertaining thing about the show, but even more so now because the all are exaggerated versions of themselves so we (kinda) get to see a new side of all of them. (And we also get introduced to a new character that we have been waiting to see for a very long time) 10/10  ENJOYMENT:  This is another part of the Monogatari series that has kinda declined. Of course the show has funny moments (as always) but in a Monogatari style move 70% of the show it just characters talking to each other and 20% of that is just dialogue filter (for example araragi meeting Shinobu was kinda useless since she tells him the exact same thing Black Hanekawa tells him). I think the ending was really cute and i loved it (HITAGI BEST GIRL, FIGHT ME) 7/10   In conclusion this was just a standard Monogatari series entry, it isnt as good as Owarimonogatari season 1 and 2 or The monogatari series season 2, but it is better than Koyomimonogatari and Nisemonogatari. I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON.  OVERALL RATING: 8/10";Recommended
12;Zoku Owarimonogatari;Thedude3445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thedude3445;8;"Zoku Owarimonogatari is a mindbending filler-yet-not-filler, psychological-yet-not-psychological mystery that serves as an endcap, and an excellent one, to the 94 episodes and 3 movies that came before it. And, before you even think about watching this one, yes, you DO have to watch all of those to follow what's going on here; aside from the three prequel movies (which you should watch anyway; they're great), every single bit of the Monogatari series preceding this builds towards this one conclusion, this one story that really doesn't change a single thing, and yet is still an essential watch.  The story is simple-- Koyomi Araragi falls into a mirror world that looks and sounds like his own, with all the same familiar (entirely female) faces, but with each of them being altered in bizarre ways. It's an ontological, yet pointless adventure that'll have you scrounging around trying to find the secrets behind this mysterious world, but laughing the whole way through. It's silly, the tension is minimal, and we get one more appearance by a whole host of great characters. I'd say, despite the massive cast, almost everyone gets their chance to shine with one last bit of character development, though Kanbaru is reduced to a (nearly) non-speaking role since, chronologically, she doesn't get her character resolution until after this takes place, despite this being the finale... this series is weird, okay...  In terms of the metafictional self-aware questioning of its story's own existence, Zoku Owarimonogatari is essentially this series's equivalent to Madoka Magica: The Rebellion, which was not-coincidentally also made by Studio SHAFT. As superfluous as a Fun Mirror World Finale is, it encapsulates everything we've come to love and appreciate about the Monogatari series so far, and it's great!  Also, this is one of the longest animated movies I've ever watched, just under two and a half hours. It was long enough that when they made a series out of it, they were able to split it into SIX episodes. Do we ever really need to live in a world where animated movies are this long? Please, I loved this, but do not make this a model for success.  Also also, this appears to have been directed, like actually directed-directed, by Akiyuki Shinbo, something that hasn't happened for a SHAFT production in ages; he's the chief director for the whole studio so he gets co-director credit for most every SHAFT work, but he is usually not directly involved in the productions beyond that chief role. But I scoured the credits and couldn't find anyone at the top but him... How strange!";Recommended
13;Zoku Owarimonogatari;BabyGirl06301;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BabyGirl06301;9;I mean, if you're going to write what is, essentially, an epilogue to the Monogatari series, this is a pretty genius way to do it. The presentation of this final push into Araragi's adulthood was, I thought, pretty amazing. The concept of this film (Araragi getting trapped in an inverted world) is such a powerful medium to explain Araragi's feelings about his past and his future, and within that, every character gets a tiny bit of development. In fact, Araragi's relationship with himself and Senjougahara also get a bit of development throughout this story. As a bookend to this massive series (even considering the post-series, like the Off and Monster seasons), I don't think Zoku Owarimonogatari could have done much better than touching on everything that Araragi went through throughout his adolescence.  I won't get too into the message of this film because that's not really what a review is supposed to do, but I will say that I was impressed with how Araragi was made to realize what was going on with himself by the end of it. The structure of Monogatari is usually good for revealing new or shocking information, and Zoku Owarimonogatari was no exception. The breakdown of the phenomena and what that meant for Araragi was, for whatever reason, especially engaging for this specific storyline. Maybe that's because this is an epilogue of sorts or maybe it's because I've come to love Monogatari that much--I don't know. The bottom line is: this final (but not really) story was told brilliantly. If you want a better review of each element of this film, you won't find it here--I'm not a good enough reviewer for that--but I definitely felt like Owarimonogatari as a whole (and Zoku Owarimonogatari especially) brought a special quality to Monogatari. This film solidified it for me: I couldn't help but love this series in the end.;Recommended

It took me a good few months of pretty regular watching, but I did it. Zoku Owarimonogatari is a little epilogue that continues the story after Araragi faces, and then saves, himself. It was mostly just a small little story without any super amazing parts, but it was still a nice little continuation.  The arc for Zoku Owarimonogatari was one of the weaker ones in my opinion, it didn't have the depth or intrigue that the other arcs had. It was still fairly enjoyable, and it had a nice message when all was said and done.  The sort of ""mirror world"" take on the characters of Monogatari were sort of interesting, but it wasn't anything really crazy. Most of the things revealed by these characters was stuff I had already known or inferred. It was still pretty fine nonetheless.  Art and sound were as good as any other part of the series, I will say that the OP was definitely one of my least favorite though.  So yeah, pretty fine final chapter of Monogatari. And now, much like Araragi said, I'm ready to move on.";Recommended
15;Zoku Owarimonogatari;techmo77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/techmo77;8;8/10. I already treated Owari S2 as the finale and it was an extremely apt epilogue. I’d treat Zoku Owari as an extra side story that adds to the fantastic end of the main series. If you’ve already watched most of the monogatari series, then definitely watch this too, and if you haven’t, what’re you doing?! Go search up the latest watch order and come back after you’re done with Owari.  Zoku Owari still shines with the classically innovative Ishin style to tell stories in a fun and original way and will not fail to intrigue and entertain. Araragi is given further development from his hopeful conclusion in Owari S2, and we see him leap to the next step in his life during an awkward phase of title-less-ness? - between high school and college. You’ll see what I mean.  The themes are optimistic, and there’s a less morose feel instead swapped by a more nostalgic comedy. Music wasn’t as distinctly memorable as previous instalments, but it had some decent moments.  Mayoi Onee-san. That should be enough to get you to watch it.;Recommended
16;Zoku Owarimonogatari;JyrKing;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JyrKing;9;"Even though the main story of this series have come to an conclusion nisioisin managed to write a story on par with his previous best works in my opinion. I will never be able to give any of the monogatari seasons/movies a complete 5/5 because of the amount of sexualisation and weird stuff that is totally unnecessary and only makes the story for some unbearable to watch, I don't have a huge problem with it in this movie as it was mostly in the beginning and did not ruin the big moments or conclusions like it did with a certain other arc of the series.  I won't either be going into the story or how the writing in this is as I think that one of the most enjoyable parts is to experience this for yourself and form your own opinions.  I will probably never get tired from watching any of the monogatari series even with this series totally different approuch of story telling. The monogatari series is very heavy on words and have little to no actions in it. This might turn some people off from watching it if they already did not get turned off from the weird stuff in it. I can see why some people might get turned off from the way they present the story but I just think that this shows how good of and writer that nisioisin truely is if he can keep our attention through just dialogue.  Dialogue is obviously not the only contributing factor to why this show manages to keep the viewers attention on the screen without being bored but I think it really shows that you don't always need ""show not tell"" when it comes to crafting an intriguing story.  One of the big contributing factors to why this show is able to keep us so engaged besides the writing is because of the studio behind this, SHAFT. With this series being very dialogue heavy SHAFT had a lot of freedom on how they wanted to animate this and the way they went and did it is like no other series and makes this stand out compared to all other animated movies/series. The music and voice acting is also on point and there is a lot to break down in the dialogues.  4,5/5 This could really have been a 5/5 if it wasn't for the sexualisation, I had no other gripes with this movie, one of the best from the monogatari series. I do hope we get more of the off stories and all that animated as I need more of this.";Recommended

The art style remains surrealistic, varied, and befitting to several purposes, be it decent fanservice, reference to other famous franchise, comedy, etc. Overall, the story managed to show the audience a more mature Araragi who has come to acceptance and moved forward in a more light-hearted manner yet not less brightly hopeful.;Recommended

0;Zoku Owarimonogatari;petalferrous;https://myanimelist.net/profile/petalferrous;5;I've seen enough anime with great setup and no payoff by now to not get my hopes up, but I'm still sorry to say that my biggest initial response to Zoku Owarimonogatari is disappointment, the gradual revelation that there was nothing behind the curtain. I suppose the theme that youth is full of disappointments and loose ends that will never truly be resolved isn't totally uninteresting, but that point was already made more succinctly and elegantly in Nisemonogatari.  As always, I find myself tempted to give Nisio more credit than he probably deserves by positing that the fact that there's nothing behind the curtain is part of the point, but...why spend three hours on it, then? Just to troll the audience? (And why bother finally introducing one of the most important and consequential characters in the series for...basically no reason?) If this were actually the end of the series it would be extremely unfulfilling, but given that Nisio did apparently have the post-high school arcs planned all along maybe there's still something there in Off Season and Monster Season? I guess we'll find out in 2030 or so.  I liked seeing Koyomi terrified and embarrassed by Mayoi and the spoiler character, because it's actually not a side of him we've really seen before. The Tsukihi face-washing scene feels like a de-sexualized, humiliating inversion of Nisemonogatari's famous toothbrush scene and is actually pretty disturbing, but...like so much else here, it doesn't seem to have really had a point.  Also I know Nisio loves giving Hitagi no screentime but couldn't we at least get some more Hanekawa??? Please?;Mixed Feelings
1;Zoku Owarimonogatari;Kararagi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kararagi;6;Zoku Owarimonogatari is the unnecessary yet enjoyable enough epilogue to the Monogatari series. The story concerns Koyomi entering a strange mirror world where all of his friends are 'reversed'. Or that's how it appears at first anyway, but there might be a little more to it. Personally I thought that the ending of Owarimonogatari Second Season was the perfect way to end the series, but Zoku kept my interest until the end either way. At the very least it did not go and ruin anything.  But like I said, this epilogue feels largely pointless. Many of the revelations that Koyomi has in the mirror world are things that could have easily been already inferred just based on the previous seasons. This feels like an author trying to over-explain their own work rather than letting the reader interpret it on their own.  Zoku also lacks the emotional impact of Owarimonogatari or even the seasons preceding that. The part in Owarimonogatari when Koyomi re-stated his desire to share his fate, whether it's to live or to die, with Shinobu made me tear up and would have been such a perfect way to wrap up the story as it ties back nicely to Kizumonogatari where it all began chronologically. Nothing in Zoku comes even close to something as moving as that scene, which is a shame. I was ready for another story to play on my heartstrings, but all I got was a somewhat entertaining arc that did not really strike me as all that dramatic.  If you're a fan of the Monogatari series you will probably be entertained by this epilogue. It will most likely not make you cry, but you likely won't be bored or terribly disappointed either. The gags, visuals and fanservice are still there. Also, the ending theme is fantastic. Zoku Owarimonogatari is a decent enough conclusion to a great series.  Edit: Upon further reflection, I decided to drop my rating from 7 to 6, because Zoku left me wanting more than what it delivered. I have not yet read the original light novel for this particular entry, so I'm not sure whether these complaints apply to the source material. I will detail my story gripes below with minor spoilers:  [SPOILER WARNING]  - Not seeing Princess Shinobu was such a tease. If they had initially hid her behind the veil, then shown her later on, the payoff would have been much more satisfying after all the build-up. Shinobu is the most important character in the entire series, so reducing her to a voice behind a curtain is a letdown to say the least. - Both Black Hanekawa and Loli Hanekawa are under-utilized. Even if they were not central to the main story it would have been appropriate to give them more screentime. For example, it would have been amusing to see Koyomi's reaction to drunk Loli Hanekawa. - The whole plot point of Koyomi trying to enter Kanbaru's bath to get in touch with the Shinobu of his world was pointless. This would have been a good way to tie to the Koyomi Water episode from Koyomimonogatari, but since this plan turned out to not work, that makes the Koyomi Water episode completely pointless. - Grown-up Hachikuji was cute, but I would have liked to see Koyomi interact with the Hachikuji of his own world after he comes back from the mirror world (kind of like the ending of Kabukimonogatari). The same applies to all the other 'reversed' characters. The whole point of the mirror world was to present a different reality and contrast it with the actual reality, but we never see Koyomi interact with the 'real' versions of his friends in this story arc. Isn't the point of presenting us with a different reality that when he sees his old friends again, he feels like he's back home? Wouldn't it be more satisfying if he shared his experiences with the people whose alternate versions he actually met in that parallel world? Instead, all we get is a pretty lame epilogue with Hitagi, who wasn't even relevant to this particular story arc as she was not present in the mirror world. If the epilogue had involved all the relevant characters reflecting on Koyomi's adventure with him, this ending would have been much more memorable.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zoku Owarimonogatari;AestheticOnion;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AestheticOnion;4;"“I feel thin… stretched. Like butter spread over too much bread.” - Bilbo Baggins, Lord of the Rings  Every good thing must come to an end, or at least that’s how the saying goes. Not that it’s too good to continue on forever, but because it should end while it’s still doing well. If not, however, it is doomed to milk its already-explored ideas until it drenches all the quality from its previous work. Thus is the fate of the once beloved Monogatari series.  Promise of the Premise: Zoku Owarimonogatari, captures the events that took place after the Second Season of Owarimonogatari, and before the epilogue to the series, Hanamonogatari. We are, yet again, tossed into another strange story that begins with a seemingly unfortunate series of supernatural events; Arraragi Koyomi, who is dealing with an identity crisis upon graduating high school, and is now having problems with moving on with his life, somehow finds himself trapped inside what he refers to as “the mirror world.” In this inside-out version of reality, he encounters all the people important to him, who are now fundamentally changed. We soon learn that the nature of the characters in “the mirror world” is to serve as the polar opposites of the ones in the “our” reality; they reflect all the characteristics that the characters in our reality tried to shut in. For the most part of the show, we are left to explore the mirrored reality through Araragi’s lenses, as he spends most of the runtime interacting with altered characters as he tries to figure out the nature of the world he is stuck in. He quickly realizes that not only are the characters changed, but their very position in the world is off. And as the story moves on, there seems to be a bigger mystery hiding behind the scenes. The setting seems to offer a lot of insight, both regarding the characters and regarding the story of the franchise looking from the grand scheme of things, now that the franchise has reached its conclusion in the previous entry. However, the show does none of that.  Toll of Redundancy: The main problem of every milked continuation is its inability to cohesively add new ideas without contradicting itself in the process. Zoku Owarimonogatari, however, dodges this problem by having no new ideas whatsoever. To observe the characters from the inside-out perspective would generally be a great move, and a useful tool when it comes to character development. The problem is, however, that every information about the characters that this introspection gained us was something we already knew and were aware of. Throughout the franchise we followed the characters as they all went through a similar path of development: they were introduced along with their demonic apparition, representing their negative sides and the parts of themselves they want to reject and deny, and then we see them as they overcome their flaws, or simply accept them and move along. Having that transformation inverted inside-out is nothing more but going back to the stage of development the characters were in when they were first introduced. Nothing new was gained in the process. So to cover-up for such lack of progression, the show goes for a solution that I like to refer to as “madlibs storytelling.” Instead of actually providing progress in character dynamics, the characters are given a bunch of random traits that are supposed to fit in with the setting, but add nothing of substance aside from gimmick. And instead of using that to explore characters on any deeper level, now that we are given the opportunity to see the mutual interactions of their inverted personas, we are provided with nothing but a charade of randomized Monogatari characters, self-referencing series’ previous works. It’s filled to the brim with beating-‘round-the-bush philosophy, horribly timed comedy and general lack of direction. What we are left with is a thin idea that tries to present itself as a gigantic one by hopelessly connecting to everything that the series previously built. A story that pays more attention to browsing its own catalogue of characters than it does trying to write or develop itself.  The Pay-off: Through-out the runtime of 6 episodes, or a 2-hour long movie depending on which version you’ve seen, Zoku Owarimonogatari has constant trouble keeping up the pace, and balancing out it’s weak story and its unspeakable urge to fill in with as many redundant characters that were most likely put into the story for a mere self-reference. However, the worst part about this redundancy, as I said, is the fact that after those 6 episodes (or one movie) we are at the exact same place as we were before watching the show. Not only is all the information provided one we already know, but all the progress done in the mean time turns out to be inconsequential, if there ever was one. Zoku Owarimonogatari feels more like an alternative spin-off of a sort, with value of an average Christmas special: it serves no purpose except for you to indulge yourself in the known universe once again. And the worst part about it is that it doesn’t use said universe as a platform for exploring ideas, but rather as a playground for already-explored ones. I won’t dive too deep into the spoiler section on this one, even though I don’t think this is an entry that deserves to be watched. However, I have to mention that the “explanation” of the story-wise elements might be the most disappointing thing that the franchise ever did. It all boils down to “everything that pointed to a bigger story underneath was a cover-up by a mastermind X,” which itself isn’t too far from the madlibs storytelling I mentioned before. The problem with this Aizen-like ass-pull is that it not only makes a fool out of you, the audience, for trying to figure out the answers, but it also makes all the build-up up until this point just a bunch of cool tension-building ideas that were put for the sake of it. The show forcefully asks of you to follow its plot, and then punishes you for doing so.  Thematic Punchline: It doesn’t happen very often that a continuation shows no understanding of its predecessors aside from the surface-level analysis. Zoku Owarimonogatari is not only failing to understand the main motif of the series, “people save themselves. No one could ever save anyone else,” but it straight-up contradicts it. What was once a self-centered story about overcoming your own flaws and accepting yourself, is now a one-man Messiah story. And this severe contradiction is not only subtly implied throughout the show, but is presented as the very conclusion, slapped across our screens through an overly-sentimental closing montage. There seems to be an ongoing misconception where people think adding another ending to the ending is what makes the conclusion stronger. However, not only is that not the case, but doing so actually takes value away from the ending. After all, if the ending isn’t complete, it’s not an ending at all. If a character needs five “moving on” stages to actually move on, it makes all the previous 4 stages completely redundant and stripped off of value. This matter is discussed in the final sequence of the show, where Araragi states that he is always unsure whether he should step onto the road with his left or right foot, and is advised by Senjougahara to instead carelessly jump ahead instead of thinking about the next move. Not only a very flawed idea with barely any thematic weight, but also a hilariously cheesy, out-of-place symbol. A fitting conclusion for the messy, incoherent story that this apparition of a show rightfully deserved.  Technical Merits: Nothing much to say here, as the audio and visual style remained the same as the rest of the franchise, which is ironically enough, the only coherent part about it. However, I do have a few complaints. While the animation quality sure is great, the visual narrative was oddly off. Framing is rather more concerned about looking goofy and looking somewhat visually appealing than it does trying to actually say something, which is not common for a Monogatari show. What bothered me the most about it is the downright awkward use of certain visual tools, such as using the frame dividers to capture character’s breasts in the main plan of the shot. It is vaguely pointed out that the shot may be constructed like that for a reason, since that would exactly be the thing that would occupy Araragi’s attention, but it’s still a very dull way of using it. The audio was hardly even noticeable, and featured no iconic tracks of the franchise, not even the character themes which would be the most fitting considering the direction of the story.  Conclusion: Zoku Owarimonogatari is a painful exercise in redundancy, that serves as a great example of “stop while you’re still worth something.” It tries its hardest to keep the series alive by cramping as much memory of it as possible, but with little to no idea what is to be done with them. From a long-loving fan, a somber goodbye to the franchise.";Not Recommended

The problem is that: 1. they miss the whole thing that made Monogatari a cult anime: the mystery, the puzzle, the interesting interjections. There is none of that. It is all so boring that you feel the dread and want for it to be over 2. All the ""reveals"" are already well known by both us and Araragi from the previous installments but he seems to have forgotten them for no reason 3. The ending made absolutely no sense and made Araragi way too powerful  In a word the show looks like a bad fanfic . There are times when story tellers lack inspiration and try to fake it. They produce a lot of low quality material like this one. A similar thing can be said for Stephen King recent novels.  Basically if you are the person that accepts a show only because it has you favorite characters and is created by the same creators as the previous work you may like this. But if you are someone that cares for quality and asks questions and wants something actually interesting you will find it as a way too long filler. If this would have been one episode 20-30 minutes I would have been ok with it. But stretching it to 6 20 min episodes is way too much for a filler.";Not Recommended

I had really enjoyed the first season, and this one was even better.  Like it's prequel Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou has a very gentle feel to it. It's heavy focus on loneliness and longing, is evened out with cheerfulness of love and friendship that Natsume experiences not only with the youkai he encounters but with his foster parents, school friends, and other humans.  You can see Natsume growing stronger bonds with characters introduced in the first season. It's enjoyable to see the almost sibling love between Natsume and Madara, along with a growing friendship with Natori.  More characters are introduced and the human characters have a stronger role as well. Natsume is growing into someone very different from the first season, and it is very noticeable that it is because of what he experiences with his fellow cast and the problems that he helps the youkai solve along the way.  Madara of course is the main source of humor, be it his comments and bad habits, or bantering with Natsume, he sometimes steals the show. It is also interesting to see how this season changes his relationship with Natsume, definitely not disappointing.  And the most pleasing is the better look into the past and character of Reiko; Natsume's grandmother. However, there is still a lot of mystery surrounding her, leading to fans hoping for the series continuation, if only to have the biggest questions about Reiko answered.  The show could only go so far with it's fascinating characters and heart catching stories. The art and music really help to pull everything together. With the light colors and almost paint brush feel of the scenery, along with the gentle soundtrack playing in the background, it just helps cement the feeling that the creators tried to create and pull off.  Sadly, one of the last episodes got a little sloppy,'little' being the key word as it is barely noticeable. Other than that the animation is smooth and pleasing to the eyes.  The opening and ending really complement the over all feel and message of the show. I especially liked the ending 'Aishiteru' by Kourin, her voice gave the lyrics a lonely but hopeful feel, it is very nostalgic.  Some might say that this show is boring because of how mellow it can be. This is not true, and the reason is that most of the series is focused more on 'themes' as the main plot, with one story episodes; rarely does a story or conflict go on for more then one episode.  The ending of the season is especially pleasing. While it clearly shows some bridges have been crossed as far as story development, it was left open for either the viewer's interpretation or a third season.  Over all, this series really makes one think about the workings of the heart, friendship, and trust. I recommend that everyone give this series a try, there is so much that it offers, and it would be sad to miss out on it.  ---PS. This is my first review on MAL.

1;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;apolloisfine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/apolloisfine;10;"~~Show completed as of March 30, 2009.  Story - 8.8/10 (B+) At first glance, i thought the whole ""defeating spirits"" element was overused, but the way Natsume Yuujinchou does it is much different. Natsume's grandmother, Reiko collected the names of spirits she defeated in battles until the day she died, and Natsume wants to return all the names, even though he could risk his life in the process. It really flows well, especially how Natsume punches the spirits like it's no big deal, kinda funny there. Then we have Madara, or as we know him as Nyanko-sensei, the spirit who seeks the Book of Friends only to be told by Natsume that he will get it when Natsume dies. I'm surprised that Nyanko-sensei hasn't came up with a plan to kill Natsume, but then again, the pacing of this show is different. When i watched the first episode, i felt like it was Winter, and i was warm from a fireplace (weird, i know), but this show really makes you feel calm, collected and just mellow. Perhaps all the mecha animes and the shounen animes took a toll on me, and Natsume Yuujinchou is the cure to my pain.  Animation - 10/10 (A+!) The art is spectacular! I can't believe it's so well animated, just blew me away. From the opening sequence, to the ending sequence, and all in between, i really am fond of this show even more. It's so simple that it's perfect, in every way.  Sound -10/10 (A+) i love the OP, and the ED is the most soft, teary, and beautiful song i've ever heard. The voice acting is really tremendous, with Kamiya Hiroshi as Natsume Takashi (Who also voices Tieria Erde in Gundam 00 btw). The voice actors all do a really marvelous job, it makes you feel like you're a part of this as well.  Characters - 10/10 (A+) Many people think of people like Natsume as the ""gay-ish"", femine person. Well, it's better than hearing macho, tough, know-it-all's (Naruto, Ichigo, Black Star) say the same s**t all the time. Natsume is the kind of anime guy i really like, not too femine and not too masculine. Then we have Nyanko-sensei, the lovable kitten who's real form is somewhat dragon-like. Reminds me of Yoruichi's cat form from Bleach, only more enjoyable. Nyanko-sensei always has to say something smart, or pick at Natsume for being weak or too much of a pushover. I can just have these two characters and no other characters appear, and i'd still love this show.  Enjoyment - 10/10 (A+) Something so excellent as Natsume Yuujinchou is easily overlooked by redundant shounen anime, or money-wasting ecchi. Everyone needs to watch this show, whether you're feeling down, feeling stressed or just plain you. This show will not disappoint. Some might view this as too boring, but those people are the ones who survive off of (redundant) animes such as Naruto and Bleach and Soul Eater. As a former Bleach fan, this show really got me off the shounen animes, and i'm thankful. Give this show a try, because you'll be glad you did. -----------------------------------------  The Good: Animation, Characters, OP/ED, Basically Everything  The Bad: Use of spirits (not so much a big deal) as a plot element.

Makes it more enjoyable to watch.  Art: 10/10 The art . . . The art's amazing. It fitted every single moment perfectly. Plus, what I loved about this anime? No awkward animation. At all. Even with creepy Youkai.  Sound: 10/10 The same goes with the sound. They chose the best music for each situation: A battle against the Youkai, times when it's peaceful, the episode breaks . . . Well, you get the point. ;P I especially loved the theme song, which, again, sets the mood for the series  Character: 10/10 There was not one character whom I detested/hated/was disgusted with at all. And even if I was, I got over it quickly. I'm not saying you have to like all the characters, though. What I'm trying to get at is that this anime's characters didn't undergo any moment where they weren't acting like themselves. Each and every character kept with their personalities straight through and didn't alter it because of what somebody said, like many anime characters tend to do.  Enjoyment: 10/10 Geez. If I didn't have so many anime on my planned to watch list, I would re-watch this over and over and over again. I enjoyed each and every episode thoroughly. I never laughed so hard at an anime like this either.  Overall: 10/10 Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou. Simply the best of its kind.

3;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Margixx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Margixx;9;"""Continuing the path that must be done""  As the first series continues, Natsume Takashi learned that many youkai have different powers with different purposes.  The Story...  It’s a continuation of the first series as they made a slightly different way of development because it shows more involvement of youkai and his capability to use his own power. It focuses of using the same method of youkai solving as new tale to tell and to discover as it goes deeper in its arc. The drama and mystery here became more interesting and entertaining than before as they add some twist to cope up viewers on watching.  Definitely a different way of continuing the preceding series as it really goes very well.  Art & Animation...  Beautiful backgrounds, detailed character designs, and impressive scenery just like the preceding. Noticing the difference from before, it’s jibing better and more appropriate in its settings.  The OP and ED theme is just truly wonderful… better than before.  Sound...  The OP and ED song is lively, dramatic, calm. Both of them matched its theme that contains such wonderful and harmonious art and BG sounds adds up the enjoyment through the show.  Character…  Hmmm… Natsume Takashi, he's kind of weak in physical appearance, a compassionate type among youkai, not that free spirited among human beings but reverse among youkai, and improves a lot in this series. As for Madara the other main or the best supporting character on the series that keeps the level of boredom on the bottom became sillier, and more knowledgeable in puns.  And for the other characters who sometimes make an appearance in this series, they help the series to be complete and entertaining.  Enjoyment…  It's quite redundant in its case; it might be an anime that will keep you interested in their arcs, art & animation, sounds, but not quite in the characters. It has a plain and calm feature.  Overall…  Recommended for those who wants a slice of life with different style of maintaining its peaceful feature. A style where people tend to communicate in other species for resolving what must be done to solve its problem.  It is a mixture of drama, supernatural, and slice of life that will give you depth in life.";Recommended
4;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Lindle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lindle;9;NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.  Natsume Yuujinchou covers a familiar kind of story. We are presented with a teenage boy, who is unusually airy and doesn't socialize much, and frequently seems to be looking intently at things that aren't there. As you may have guessed, Natsume sees dead people. Well, not exactly... he can see Youkai, a kind of spirit told of in Japanese folklore.  Many of the Youkai themselves seem to possess an unusual interest in Natsume. One day, as a pair of Youkai are chasing him, he accidentally breaks a seal containing a powerful Youkai... one that knows why Natsume is being chased. You see, his grandmother Reiko had the same gift as him, and used to go around beating up Youkai and making them give away their names to her (which allowed her to command them), which she collected in a book, the titular Yuujinchou (Book of Friends). And now that Reiko is dead, Natsume has to attempt to return the names, but without losing the book in the process. And his new Youkai friend Madara has agreed to help protect him, as long as he is entitled to the book upon Natsume's natural passing.  What is really impressive about Natsume Yuujinchou is that, from that plot summary there, you will mostly likely think of many other series from various different mediums that follow a similar blueprint. And yet Natsume is significantly better than them. Natsume, as a series, takes on this theme with a brilliant level of poignancy. Rather than being a generic shonen action series as it so easily could have been (many of the bare bones of the series show parallels to Bleach, for example), Natsume is more concerned with telling the stories of each of these Youkai. While there is the occasional flash of action, this is never really the point. It's extremely refreshing to see a premise so frequently used for nothing more than cheap kicks done so beautifully. It even strikes something of a contrast with excellent series such as Mushishi and Mononoke, in that while these are focused on the abnormality of the creatures the series is based around, Yuujinchou is far more down to earth and human-feeling.  Plotwise, this series is episodic, with the episodes focusing on individual youkai, with the stories not generally intertwining or crossing more than one episode (though there are exceptions). Almost all of the episodes are excellent, though there's two or three I didn't really care for. The second season in particular ups the quality of these, with the last four standing out as being firmly the best out of both seasons. There's not really anything in the way of an overarching plot or any clear goal, but it's all tied together through the furthering of Natsume's character and the additional insights into Reiko which we see through the Youkai's memories, both of which are excellent features of the series.  The characterisation in this series is truly unique. Every character is very down-to-earth and believable, and yet not quite your everyday average Joe either. They all have distinctive personalities, and yet feel totally natural. The character designs are much the same way: simple-looking, but effective and distinctive. The only characters who are consistently in every episode are Natsume himself, and his Youkai bodyguard Madara A.K.A Nyanko-sensei. Madara is mostly comic relief, but effectively so. In his true form he's much easier to take seriously, which is often used to good effect. Natsume, on the other hand, is definitely the pinnacle of the aforementioned style. He doesn't really have a clear, character-defining moment or trait, which initially makes him seem like an uninteresting character. However, the more you get to know him, the better a character he seems. He is slowly but surely characterised through musings and realizations gathered through his experiences with all the Youkai he meets, painting a subtle yet excellent portrait of his character. In the third season, this reaches it's peak, as he slowly comes to not only accept, but value his unique circumstances and all the friends he's made because of it.  In terms of production, the animation is superb. Oddly, though, it's quite restrained about it. Aside from some really beautiful, picturesque background art, it doesn't attempt to beat you over the head with its visuals, letting them stay in the background but subtly lending a lot to the series. In the second season especially, though, it dishes out quite a few animation bumps in some of the series more excellent moments, when it really needs to be rendered better. With this, combined with an excellent character art style, Natsume Yuujinchou just plain looks beautiful all-round. Musically, the OST does much the same as the art: it is distinct, amazing, perfectly fitting, but not overbearing. The music is invariably perfectly matched to the tone of the scene rather than being used to create the tone. The voice acting is all-round excellent, but my only problem with it is, strangely enough, Natsume himself. Hiroshi Kamiya was, in my opinion, a poor choice of casting. He does, however, put in an excellent performance which is hardly surprising given how good of an actor he is, but his voice seems terribly unfit to the role, and far more suited to more average and highly strung protagonists like those he usually plays, as opposed to the awkward, airy Natsume. Still, it's hardly distracting.  If I have any real complaint about Natsume Yuujinchou, it's that almost every episode's plot is built from a random contrivance. Generally, Natsume encounters something vital to the plot of the episode by sheer coincidence that is not directly tied to the plot at all. It's not terribly distracting, but it's done repeatedly and always seems far too convenient.  Nonetheless, Natsume Yuujinchou is an excellent series. It's a calming, relaxing show that simply does its job well. The second and third seasons are better than the first, with the second having better standalone episodes, along with better art and directing than the other two, and the third contributing more to the overall story and Natsume's development. Which season is the best is really a question of style vs. substance.  Final Words: Something I would solidly recommend to anyone looking for a calming, soothing anime.

5;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;ryuu_zer0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ryuu_zer0;9;"What makes an anime great? Is it purely a mix of great story, well made animation and soundtrack and engaging characters? Or does an anime need something extra to be regarded as truly great? Some kind of x-factor that makes you feel like you’re watching something special? I believe that a great anime needs both; that the x-factor that separates those shows you give 9 or 10 out of 10 from the others is created by having the great story, animation and so on. I used to believe that this mix could only be obtained through complexity, with unexpected twists in the story and flashy animation styles. Natsume Yuujinchou, and more so its sequel, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou, proved that I was very wrong.  Something special about the series struck me as soon as I started watching it. It was based on a very simple concept. We follow the protagonist Natsume, who has been able to see spirits since birth, as he tries to return the names of the spirits obtained by his grandmother, Reiko, to their rightful owners. Whereas this is the premise of the story, the true plot revolves around Natsume’s encounters with various spirits, and how they affect both him and the people around him.  In contrast to the first season, we see Natsume slowly beginning to find his place in the world and become more accepting of both himself and his gift. He is less reserved and has more people around him to support him, but this only increases his concern that his gift will bring his friends and loved ones misfortune. Most of the episodes are self-contained, with a couple of two episode arcs. Objectively speaking each episode follows a simple formula and at times risks becoming a bit repetitive. But don’t let this assessment fool you; never once did I feel bored or uninterested. Despite the simple nature of the story there is undoubtedly a certain charm about it that draws you in. It is incredibly calming to watch, which is in contrast with many anime series around nowadays. It is essentially stripped of anything even resembling flashy or overt, leaving you with a bare but thoroughly interesting tale that you can sit back and enjoy as it plays out before your eyes. Its brilliance lies in its simplicity.  The animation also continues the simple theme. Minimal lines and subtle shading are used in the character designs. The colours are also soft and subtle, using a paintbrush-like style. Where the art really shines is in the landscapes which are striking and brilliantly drawn. Whereas the action and fast moving scenes are not as well animated as many other anime, it is almost unnoticeable. Wide panning shots of the sky or an open field emphasise the laid-back, almost meditative style of the show.  The soundtrack is quite superb, filled with calming melodies and interesting uses of effects. In particular there are a couple of BGM tracks that really capture that mellow feel. The opening and ending songs were also very fitting. The seiyuu do a very good job of capturing their respective characters, though only Kazuhiko Inoue (Madara a.k.a. Nyanko-sensei) and Hiroshi Kamiya (Natsume) get a chance to show their voice-acting prowess. Kamiya particularly portrays Natsume’s inner loneliness and conflict masterfully.  The characters in Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou are quite limited. The spirits come and go, although some of them turn out to be very well constructed characters. There is also a cast of minor human characters, but they do not feature very heavily at all. Of course, there is also Madara who continually provides comic relief and the occasional giant spirit-fight. Despite this, each interaction these spirits and humans have with Natsume has a profound impact on him. The show itself revolves almost solely around Natsume, whose character grows before our eyes through these interactions. Through this we get a real insight into his way of thinking, and also into his own loneliness. Again the recurring theme of simplicity becomes evident again; never have I gained so much enjoyment out of watching a single character’s development, but I would have liked to see the other human characters feature more prominently.  Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is a refreshing break from the norm; a show that doesn’t try to do anything too fancy, but still makes you feel like you’re watching something truly special. Watching this anime is a calming and pensive process, and is thoroughly enjoyable. It’s almost comical how such a simple concept can capture that rare x-factor while other, much more complex anime fail. Perhaps simplicity really is the ultimate sophistication. Overall: 9.2/10 (rounded to 9).";Recommended
6;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;tyrantk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tyrantk;9;"This series is a sequel to ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" which tells the story of a high school boy with the ability to see yokai. The plot revolves around his growing involvement with both the yokai and the people around him.  Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou's story continues the themes of the first series. Maintaining the seasonal style progression of the series we see the characters in autumn and winter and it continues to show us the slice of life style glimpses into Natsume's interactions with both humans and yokai.  The episodes maintain a nice balance between the humour and the more serious, melancholy side of Natsume's life.  This series isn't hugely plot driven and if you want a more in-depth storyline you will need to read the manga but I found the anime really enjoyable in and of itself.  The artwork is just as beautiful as in the first series, that alone made it worth my while to watch it. It is also well voiced, with a soundtrack that catches the mood of the series accurately.  While there are some instances of tension and action in this series I would recommend it more for those who enjoy the fantastic aspects of the series or the 'slice of life' style stories.";Recommended
7;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;trzr23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trzr23;9;Checklist: High school boy with supernatural abilities – Check. Shunned by society due to his powers – Check. Dead Parents – Check. Ancestor with the same power – Check. Funny sidekick – Check.  Sigh…a typical show, huh? … But, wait! I have one more item on my checklist –  Totally awesome anime that manages to break out of its generic setting and blossoms into something absolutely fascinating and surpasses its predecessor in almost every way – Check.  Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is the second season of the show Natsume Yuujinchou. There are no major storyline changes and these 13 episodes are a direct continuation of the first season. Although detailed knowledge of the first season isn’t required, it definitely gives you a better understanding and connection with the characters.  For those who want to give the first season a skip (although I wouldn’t), here is a quick synopsis: You follow Natsume, a high school student and his encounters with youkai. Youkai are basically demons (or ghosts) that are invisible to most humans. Once a youkai gives its name to a human, then it pledges its soul to the human and they can never truly pass on unless they have their names back. Natsume’s grandmother, Reiko, had collected the names of various youkai and recorded them in a book called the “Yuujinchou” or “The Book of Friends”. After her death, this book falls into Natsume’s hands and a never ending stream of spirits come after him. Along with Madara, the demon cat, he sets about dissolving these youkai contracts, while trying not to get killed by them.  While the basic story is pretty straightforward, the actual episodes are not. Each episode contains a lot of elements, each mixed in the right proportion – action, mystery, drama, comedy, supernatural and slice of life. The stories/arcs feel complete and don’t have the half-baked feel that they had last time around. There is an overall consistency. Unlike last season, where you had youkai coming and just getting their names back or trying to steal the Yuujinchou, in Zoku you get youkai that have bizarre requests. And this adds a whole new dimension to the show. The anime now revolves less around the youkai’s names and shifts its focus to the back-stories of these youkai. Each youkai tells a tale that is intriguing and thoughtful. This also makes the anime’s objective clear – to focus on the relationships of humans and not actually the youkai.  Although it retains its episodic format, the anime manages to bring in an overall arching plot. Yes, that means you can’t watch it in any random order and this makes the show far more engaging than the earlier disjoint episodes. You feel that the anime is actually going somewhere and not just dawdling around with half-dead creatures.  But let’s look at Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou as a stand-alone and not as a sequel to Natsume Yuujinchou: Zoku is an entertaining show, to say the least. Not only does it provide you with certain intense situations, but it also puts you in the shoes of Natsume so gently, that you can hardly feel yourself drifting into the world of the characters. And you want to stay there and never leave. This charming handling is proof enough that the show does not lack in the plot. It takes true skill to transport the viewer into a fictional world where the characters aren’t exactly happy. I mean, think about it – Would you go into the world of Harry Potter, knowing that Harry was not yet born and it was still the Dark Ages with Voldemort running around and massacring people?  In case you’re still wondering why I think this anime managed to stand out compared to its counterparts, it’s because of the overlying genre of Slice of Life. How often do you see an anime which has demons, spirit cats, ancestral prodigies and a legendary book, but focuses not only on these, but also on the emotions of the protagonist AND the youkai? Not often.  The animation has improved slightly, but not much to say here - pretty standard stuff for a 2009 anime. Everything looks like it should and the characters designs are pretty detailed. Backgrounds are as gorgeous as ever. Overall, the animation is perfect for this kind of series.  On a side note, (this might sound kinda weird), but if you liked the display picture of Zoku Natusume Yuujinchou on MAL, then chances are, you’ll like the anime. The cover art was the reason why I picked this anime up in the first place.  Although there are no major soundtrack additions, there is a new OP and an ED. The OP is solid and is an upbeat song, with a pretty catchy tune. The ED was the definition of charming and it’s one of the best ballads ever. The vocals were very sweet and the piano playing in the background was played in a gentle and melodious manner. The lyrics of the ED were superb. It’s not often that you see an anime song whose lyrics you remember, but “Aishiteru”’s lyrics is one I will remember for a long time to come (“Hey, just a little longer. Can you listen to me just a little longer? Hey, just a little longer. Can I be selfish just a little longer?”). The BGM is apt.  The characters are what truly made this anime loveable. In NY, Natsume’s plight as a social outcast never really triggered any sort of emotional reaction from me. But, in Zoku, Natsume’s loneliness is highlighted in a much more subtle manner and somehow, this managed to capture my attention. I was finally able to sympathize with him and was genuinely moved by his condition. He finally realizes that he doesn’t need to do this alone and that there are people out there looking out for him. After watching the entire show, I realized how much I liked him. In fact, if you were to meet me in real life, he’s the character I would resemble the most. He is a character that I will hold close to my heart.  Madara is back and this time he steps up his game. His jokes are hilarious and sometimes I found myself literally ROFLing at his silly jokes. His snide remarks are loaded with sarcasm and rival Kyon’s. You can also see him developing, in a fatherly-tsundere way. You have two other characters, whose names I cannot mention, who play an important role in Natsume’s life and you get to see them in about 3 or 4 episodes, which is a lot considering that the first season contained only Tanuma, who appeared for a grand total of twelve minutes in the whole series. Both these characters actually represent the yin and yang of Natsume’s outlook on youkai.  The show also addresses the question that constantly haunts Natsume – Is he or is he not grateful for having the ability to see youkai? To know the answer to that, you just have to watch the show. But I’ll tell you this – Natsume is a more complex character than you think.  Overall, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is the kind of show I would pick up in a couple of years and still feel the same way about it. It’s fast, fun and fresh. And most importantly, it is one of the very few anime out there that is able to distinguish the fine line between Slice of Life and Drama. That being said, this anime does not have universal appeal. If you’ve watched Kino’s Journey, Mushishi, xxxHOLiC or Haibane Renmei, you can’t go wrong with this one. But then again, the fact that not a single reviewer has given this anime a score below 9 even a year after its completion is testament to the fact that this anime truly is, one of a kind.  [ THE WRAP-UP ] Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou succeeds where several anime of its genre fail – providing thought-provoking entertainment. Its emphasis on how life is a journey and how, more than often, you find yourself all alone in it and how it is at that moment, do we find the people that truly matter and who will provide us with the moments that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. Set in an episodic format, each episode/arc is loaded with content that packs a punch so hard, in such a gentle manner, that you are bound to be knocked out by its charm. The animation is smooth and the soundtrack is apt. The ED deserves special credit for its sweet vocals and charming lyrics. ZNY is testament to proof that Slice of Life is a genre that CAN be used successfully alongside action and also illustrates why Drama and Slice of Life are actually two very different genres. If you loved the first four episodes, then you’re going to have a wonderful nine episodes ahead, but if not, then this anime is just not for you. With a great atmosphere and balanced elements, this anime is one that you should sit up and take notice of. Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is the butterfly coming out of the cocoon of its predecessor – beautiful, elegant and something that you will remember for the rest of your life.;Recommended
8;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;CloudsPrince;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CloudsPrince;7;In the first moments of the series, what I automatically enjoyed was the altruistic view of the main character, Natsume Takashi. I had not the feeling of an overwhelming strong, stubborned or desperate human, just a cheerful guy who wants to help any person in danger.  Each episode contains a different story, it brings different aspects of the moral and the relation between humans and youkais. Mostly, Takashi is brought to help and find a solution to coexist with this species, even if he already gets a Youkai living by his side.  Later on, the story continues and you follow the path of this young boy with his fellow companion, Nyanko-sensei. The relationship between those two characters made me laugh a lot. It just brings you a moment of truce in your heart and you would like to see those two arguing again for anything else, to have more fun.  I particularly liked the effervescent colors, along with the gentle soundtrack playing in the background, it just helps cement the feeling that the creators tried to make a memorable background.  The second season of Zoku Natsume made me believe that any kind of creature could live around us, humans, and make us dream that an entire different world is living next to us.  I would surely advise this series to any person, regardless of his age. It brings you harmonious moments and a nice show to enjoy.;Recommended
9;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;khunter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/khunter;8;"Zoku Natsume is an example of a sequel done right. Like the first season, this show has all of the aesthetically pleasing things you cherished. The tone is still light-hearted, and often peaceful and mellow. Many times throughout this season you will feel a sort of familiar peace, and even melancholy. Finishing the season will without a doubt, leave you lonely, which is certainly ironic, considering the entire season, and show for that matter, has the idea of loneliness, and even to an extent, romanticizes it.  The soft nature of the show goes together nicely with the soundtrack, which is just as good as the first, and for me, even better. The melody and transition sounds alone make my heart flutter, and it will be sure to raise some vague emotion within you. The musical pieces are truly wonderful, and though I shy away from the music type of Long Shot Party, it is symbolically meaningful and pairs nicely with the anime, as you will find with the ending as well.  The acting is suburb, especially that of Madara(Natsume's guardian cat/sensei), and of that of Natsume himself. Both lead the show in a wonderful voice cast, the two's banter and conversations unique and entertaining.  The only difference you will find with the two seasons is that the first was episodic, while this one verges on two-episode plot arcs, though only a couple. While the shows episodic arc plot remains largely intact, it is something that differs from the anime Mushishi, as it still involves the same characters, same setting(mostly) and a certain growth in Natsume we don't often see in episodic anime.  This season is a bit more upbeat, whereas the last one was more depressing, and certainly more lonely. This one shows a more positive natsume, a clear indication of his growth. Though he is surrounded by human friends and yokai friends, the theme of loneliness is still present, so much so that it wouldn't be amiss if the writers explored something new. Though to do so, might not work, and if something isn't broke..etc  There are few memorable episodes, but each one is enjoyable and rarely boring, and it will pick up momentum as the series goes on.  The character development, which is that mainly of Natsume is greatly woven throughout, and that of Reiko's background is scattered throughout, though there is more than enough questions left unanswered more than anything. While the side-characters remain good natured and lovable, there exists no real momentous change or development among them. They did however introduce a new female character, Taki, who is rather charming, and often makes good use of her screen time through humour with madara(who she finds cute) and her conversations, often deep ones, with Natsume.  As for Art, and animation, you may take what you will. The art work blends softness with clarity, and often gives way to something colorful, and for that, it is truly wonderful, and memorable. The art itself is nothing to brag about though, and while the animation is fluid it will not stand out to you, if you were to compare it to an anime known for its animation; this, will apply to the art as well. However, regardless, you will find no problems with what this show does with either, and you may even feel bias towards it, as I have.  The series, as it proved in the first season, never made Natsume out to be some strong character with the power to defeat all yokai. Though he gets a bit stronger, this can only be seen in his resolve, and though I am not generally a fan of main characters who have no real gifts, it seems to only work wonders for Natsume, who like the show, is compassionate, emotional, full of heart, and upbeat.";Recommended
10;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Ethan_07;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ethan_07;9;"Loneliness, they are so overrated.  For Natsume, having an ability to see spirits when others can't is both a curse and a gift to him. A curse that caused him shunned by others, and even his parents because of his weird behaviour that frightens others whenever he mentioned of seeing something creepy. This loneliness struck him so deep that he would wake up covered in tears just thinking about it.  But, it's also a gift that resonates his feeling as the spirit's memories with her grandmother and their story behind it flows into his own. Every spirits he met ended up departing from him, leaving only the bittersweet moments behind, sweet at first but with a strong bitter aftertaste.  And yet, it doesn't grab his kindness away.  His interaction with the spirit-like-fat-cat, Nyanko-sensei is truly something else that makes the story much more interesting. They always bickers about trivial stuff but yet is supportive on each other, this love-hate relationship makes the entertaining level of the story just jumps up a few metres. This is simply because they managed to bring out the best of each other.  Additional merit points for the ending with "" Aishiteru "" by Kourin which is one of the greatest OST I've ever heard. Add the bittersweet echoed from the song into the snowy scene where Natsume leaves his footprints on as his friends fade in with their footsteps and you've got a perfect ED portraying loneliness.  Overall, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is one of the sequels that I find better than its predecessor and with a bit more feelings invested, you might get a real taste on bittersweetness.";Recommended
11;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;makoa69;https://myanimelist.net/profile/makoa69;8;Allow me to create a sub-genre of anime in which this particular one fits right in. I'd like to put this anime into the Zoo genre of anime. The Zoo genre is an anime which has some special monster or some unique creature within the show. Each episode introduces and focuses on one particular type of that creature. Shows like Mushishi, Fruits Basket, and Panty and Stocking all qualify for this genre of anime. In Natsume Yuujinchou's case, the monster is the Youkai, the demon-like beings which only Natsume, the main hero, can see. These animes tend to lack any core plot dictating the entire show, and usually consists of episodic exhibits of the monsters. Each episode is good depending on how interesting the featured monster is. Natsume Yuujinchou has a lot of monsters, and usually they're very interesting. This part of the anime is superb, and exactly the kind of thing I wanted to see after having watched Mushishi, which is probably my favorite anime ever. Natsume Yuujinchou has a recurring pattern in its episodes. The episodes fall under two different types: either A) the monster is really nice and has some problem and Natsume helps out or B) the monster is really evil and the main character gets in a pinch, usually life threatening. Yuujinchou works best when it's telling an A-type story. This story really fits with the tone of the show, and really brings out the best episodes. It's during A-type episodes where Yuujinchou shows off its great animation through fantastic visuals such as gorgeous scenery or wondrous images such as a colorful dream. The B-type episodes are also good, but certain reoccurring situations really start to get dry after a while. In every single episode of this type, there's a scene in which Natsume is being chased by the monster, he trips and falls down, and then he gets rescued by somebody. It really starts to get boring watching these episodes when pretty much the same scene happens every single time. These episodes were kind of out of place as well, since most of the time the anime tends to be very peaceful and slow, while these episodes were usually very tense and exciting. This anime is very pretty, and it sounds great as well. Both of the opening songs are really good at setting the tone for the episode to come. The ending songs are both very relaxing, and give good closure for each story. I really like the voice of Madara, the cat sidekick. Natsume's voice is perfect for the show and really helps express the relaxing tone.  The anime is really quite good, so why did I only give it an 8 instead of a 10? Well, I had a problem with Natsume, the main character, several times. Natsume is a nice guy who had a bad childhood. He spends his time helping others and generally puts the well being of others over himself. He keeps his own troubles to himself because he doesn't want to burden the people he cares about. He is quite timid and doesn't speak much. Usually I like this type of character. He's very similar to Honda Tohru from Fruits Basket, Furude Rika from Higurashi, or Nunnaly from Code Geass. The problem is that this anime has those B-type episodes I mentioned earlier and they require that Natsume grow stronger both mentally and physically. What I mean by this is that Natsume doesn't seem to learn anything from his B-type experiences. He'll get tricked by a monster in one episode, and then in the next episode he'll get tricked by another. He gets caught up in so many dangerous situations where he almost dies and he never reflects upon what mistakes he made to get into those situations. He is actually too selfless, to the point where he doesn't even care whether he dies or not. In a particular episode, a Youkai object is absorbing Natsume's life force and gradually making him sicker. Instead of taking any action at all to save his own life, he allows the object to continue to absorb him, all because the object is important to the monster of that episode. the episode reaches a point where it seems that Natsume might actually die. Now come on, doesn't this guy fear death, like every average human being does? Why is he so willing to throw it away for NOTHING AT ALL? These B-type episodes really start to get boring because of this. Why should I care about whether Natsume gets hurt or not if he himself doesn't care?  I thought I would enjoy this anime just as much as I did Mushishi, but I didn't. After all the danger that went through these two seasons, Natsume should really be dead already, but he isn't. It really isn't fun watching him get rescued so many times when he puts zero effort in to keep himself safe. Every time he gets attacked I half hope that he loses an eye or something so that he'll finally reflect upon his poor actions and finally start defending himself. It really is a shame that the whole entire show isn't the A-type episodes, as Natsume isn't cut out for the B-type ones. Don't get me wrong though, this is a really good show, and I'm sure I'll enjoy seasons three and four, which I'll be watching very soon. However, I'll be really disappointed if those seasons continue to have more danger episodes with a main character that never learns from his mistakes.;Recommended
12;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Haxus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Haxus;9;"Im going to try to keep this as simple as possible for all you out there wondering what it's all about!  This is the 2nd season of the Natsume Yuujinchou series. It is following what happend in the 1st season Natsume Yuujinchou.  Art: 9/10 The arts in this series is really beautiful! It is not the same type of arts as for example the Bakemonogatari series had, but it has its charm.. and god, the char is fantastic!  Characters 10/10 Simply loving all of the characters of this series! I especially love Nyanko-sensei, but now.. who wouldn't? All of the characters who are there just for the episode is also wonderful, and many of them come back just as sweet in the coming episodes.  Enjoyment 10/10 Oh god, the laughs! It's quite simple to fall inlove with the show and its simple mindedness, but rhat is not all! It is really enjoyable to watch the connection between Nyanko-sensei and Natsume, but i will have to say that the adaption of Natsume towards his feelings to others has to top it all of. Simply wonderful, can't think of a more feelgood show to watch.  Overall or tl;dr 9/10 Great show so far, the only bits i can complain about is propablya little bit in the sound and story.. but that is also quite great. If you havent seen this series and is now wondering if it's worth it, just do it! I årpmise you a good time, this season was even better then the first one";Recommended
13;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;mrsLEE;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mrsLEE;9;It’s already bad that the first season was very short, so when it ended I was genuinely sad yet irritated. Why can’t they make this amazing series longer! So I am so much grateful that it continues.  Every new story is much more dramatic, inspiring, interesting, exciting and of course, touching. There is more twist to every new story so it is more exciting and anticipating. Some would be funny, some is scary, and most of it is very touching but definitely all of it is very interesting.  Madara is still denying that he cares for Natsume so much that his actually thinking that it will be hard to part ways because human life span is very short compared to his kind which I think is extremely cute. He is as cute and hilarious as ever. Even though he keep on saying his a high level creature, his acting more and more like a cat which is so hilarious and cute. Natsume is treasuring and accepting his abilities even more that he already feels sad with his very short encounters with different supernatural beings. He is still bothered with his past and though his becoming better as a person already after encountering Nyanko-sensei, he still can’t open-up with his very kind family and some close friends about his abilities. But he is actually worried now with the idea of not seeing the supernatural beings. Every encounter with the YOUKAI makes Natsume a better individual. After understanding and supporting each other for quite a while, Natsume and Nyanko-sensei are even closer. It is so great that even though his friends know that he is kind of weird, they still stay with him and accept him.  The animation is not very different from the previous one but you can still see that it is a little bit better. The sounds are getting better and better, especially the ending theme which I absolutely think so beautiful.  Ah! I can’t believe that ended so fast. This is one of the very few series that I am so puzzled why they are making it so short. Come on! At least make 100 episodes per season. I am dying to see more new story. I am just hoping that there would be a sequel. PLEASE!;Recommended
14;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;BabyGirl06301;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BabyGirl06301;8;I find this season so hard to review because it's literally the exact same as the first season. At least where it counts.  Alright, so just like last time, the absolute best part of this anime is the little stories it tells. It's very good at creating complex characters and histories for them within a single episode. It's a very nice, comfortable anime to watch, especially if you're watching the anime hoping for a great story.  The art, while simple, is charming, and the sound compliments the tone of the anime very well. As far as the characters go, I'm glad that this season started to focus in more on Natsume and how lonely he used to feel as a child as well as his relationship strengthening with Nyanko-sensei. Those two things have starting to pave the way to seeing more about Natsume's grandmother and also her relationship to Nyanko-sensei.  I'm pretty sure the narrative is just taking it slow, but I really wanted to see some serious development this season that would turn Natsume into a more dynamic character rather than little changes here and there. There were a few moments this season that turned into continuous stories that lasted longer than an episode, and that was really nice because you got to dig into the story and Natsume's involvement with it. I hope, in the future, we get a more solidified storyline that lasts for a season because I really want to know more about Natsume.  All in all, though, this anime is very good. There's a reason it's beloved by so many, I think you just need to be patient with it. It seems worth it.;Recommended
15;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;lamaraptor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lamaraptor;8;Continuing the themes of the first season, Zoku Natsume Yuukinchou builds more and more upon the growing bonds of it's titular character and his feline companion. We see him grow closer than ever before to his school mates, a first for a boy who had gotten so used to being shunned because he claimed he could see spirits. We also get to see him connect more with his past and the mysterious character of Natsume Reiko, uncovering just a bit more of what kind of person she might have been.  I love watching this show, because it manages to tug on your heart strings in all the right ways and always leaves you feeling warm fuzzy feelings, like everything in your life is going to be okay because it all worked out in the end. It's apparently a whole genre in Japan and usually takes place somewhere in the Japanese countryside like this. In a world that is increasingly loud with constant interruptions of more bad news, it's nice sometimes to just kick back with a nice story with a happy ending, or poignant messages that help us appreciate the bonds we have in our life. For anyone without those bonds at the moment, Natsume helps inspire hope that all of us will one day find our home.  I loved the episode that flashed back to Reiko and her interactions with the much younger Fujiwara, and how that family home was a place she wanted to protect even if she wouldn't be allowed there anymore. It's poetic that Takashi would end up living with that same family and that it would become the first place he could truly be happy. Honestly the Fujiwara's are better than Uncle Ben and Aunt May, anybody would be lucky to have them as guardians.  We get introduced to Taki in this season as well. She becomes one of Natsume's most important friends later on as one of the few people he can confide in about his ability to see youkai. The way she treats Nyanko-sensei is adorable and I'm rooting for Satoru because he obviously made the right choice of best girl.  Can't wait to see what more this series has to offer, I give this entry an 8/10;Recommended
16;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Sahilbaby;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sahilbaby;10;a basic spoiler free review: this is my first so excuse me ion this wasn't appealing enough for u to go watch the series ok first off id like to start by talking about the plot its a simple plot with a lot to explore. its one of those rare slice of life anime that actually show how hard it is to deal with loneliness. I watched the first season and tbh I didn't like it as much as I wanted to like it then I moved on to the second season and boy was I happy that I didn't drop this treasure. this show holds a special place in my hear as I went through the same feeling of loneliness. I was engulfed by the fact that everybody thought I was an outcast because I used to be quiet and not so good looking. this series gave me hope I mean a lot of hope the characters are really good especially Madara theres so much to explore about him.;Recommended
17;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;fadedflowers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fadedflowers;9;"In this season, we see the seasons change from Winter to Spring as it continues to bring us this feel-good, warm fuzzy feeling that leaves you smiling. The change of seasons as if to reflect the shift in character in Natsume as well. It continues to tell us the story of the characters and Natsume fighting their everyday battles, loneliness and trying to gain acceptance from the people around them.  The art is simple, but still well executed, and definitely enough to enjoy this series. Also appreciated that there were longer arcs in this season instead of the one story per episode kind of pacing. My favourite scene everytime is still Natsume returning the name of the youkai- I'll never get sick of it no matter how many times I watched it.  I have always enjoyed the opening and closing songs of Natsume Yuujinchou. The music of this season is also particularly memorable- some parts left me thinking- ""ah, this is suits this scene well doesn't it?""  Personally, what makes this series so special is definitely because it is relatable to everyone at some point- it makes you feel things but never leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Some episodes left me with tears, slight heartaches but never unsatisfied with how things end.  Overall: 9/10";Recommended
0;Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou;Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;5;"Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou  After the disastrous experience I had in the first season, I was already floored to learn that this show has 6 full seasons. I just thought to myself ""what have I gotten myself into here!!!"" But to my surprise, this season was more than twice as good as the first, even if it didn't change much in the content.  Natsume's Book of Friends - is a show that follows the everyday experiences of Natsume, who unlike other people can see Yokai. This complicates his life enough, plus he has to deal with their problems. The problem with this show is that it is very episodic and has little cohesion, so it certainly won't appeal to everyone.  Even though I have to say that the pacing and quality of this show have increased massively since the first season, it's just about average here, which is what I would have expected from the beginning.  Another massive problem with this anime is the pacing, which can be cruelly slow, although most of the cases or stories are so short that you can complete them in 8-12 minutes, they are dragged out to 18 minutes by very questionable scenes or bad dialogue. And while I'm on that point, yes this anime undoubtedly has some of the worst character conversations I've ever seen. If anyone wants to know what an anime with all Skyrim town guards in the lead would be like, here you go.  The only 2 positives why I can still mentally stomach the anime, other than a hope for improvement. Are -. - The cat is a well-done and amusing character, reflecting the personalities of cats very well especially. - The little Yokai stories are interesting from time to time, even if the execution is mostly poor or too much potential is wasted.   [Story 3]  Natsume lives his daily life and encounters new Yokai every day who either want to hug him, want his fist in their face, or simply remove him from their Instagram friend list. This is roughly the entire flow of the show. Later in the course of the third season, something like an actual antagonist is introduced to form the antithesis of Natsume. But in the second season, there is no such thing.  [Characters 4]  Aside from that, the fact that only 3 characters in the entire show have even a rudimentary personality but are unable to have normal dialogue shocks me. Nonetheless, Natsume is a hypocrite, but at least a barely satisfying character. He has a few positive points as negative ones. Nyanko Sensei is what people call a ""best waifu"" in every sense. Even if his dialogue is mostly just running gags, he is entertaining.  The rest of the supporting characters aren't even worth mentioning, if I hadn't started season 3 the day before writing my review, I wouldn't have kept their existence in mind.  [Animation 5 / Music 6]  The osts are still inappropriate, uncreative, and annoying. I would like the anime more without music if this is the result of what my ears get. In a serious scene, they use music like the Pink Panther is just skulking around somewhere.  However, I have to note one thing here, I love the intro. It is one of the best slice-of-life intros I have seen, music included. The outro was also very appealing.  The animations in this season have improved greatly since the first. The backgrounds are more detailed and the characters' faces are less deformed. By the way, it surprised me what happened in episode 10, the budget increased 5 times and it already had movie quality. Then it went back to normal, unfortunately, I didn't find any information about it.   [Conclusion 5]  Natsume's Book of Friends is a show for in-between, it's very hard to watch an episodic anime, especially one where more than half of the Yokai stories are very weak and boring. Combine this with mediocre characters, weak osts, slow pacing, and poor dialogue, and the whole thing becomes all the less enjoyable.  However, it's not that the second season was bad either, as I said, this is a definite step up from its predecessor.  [Enjoyment 4]";Mixed Feelings
0;Zoku Koihime;kerweezyy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kerweezyy;10;No one wrote a review? this has a nice story, looks like people look for hentai just for art work and sex. I don't need to write about the story when there is a syspnosis. This harem has a nice story, aside the sex, a nice and brave to protect his girls making vow to each one and girls staying loyal to him. None of that noterare NTR hentai which gives viewers an empty feeling. This is A Sequel the first one and was in fact good and this one which is even better because now they finally get married and plan to have kids. Hope Pink Pineapple makes another sequel.;Recommended
1;Zoku Koihime;Marquez103;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marquez103;8;Zoku Koihime is a sequel to the original series. It pretty much contains all the same characters from the original, but now includes a new girl called Tomamo and her father Enra. As a sequel, it continues where the story left off and answers some questions.  Story (8): As far as the story goes, its pretty good compared to most hentai as it follows the original storyline. I would write what the plot is about but its probably better I dont so you can watch it yourselves. Theres some comedic and romantic moments and not so much NTR, so most of it is guilt free.  Art (8): The art is the same as the previous Koihime so it isnt top of the line like Bible Black, but it is a little more smooth and detailed. Unfortunately, the censorship is worse than most hentai ive seen and can be really annoying at times. I dont know if theres an uncensored version so unless I see one, the score isnt getting any higher.  Sound (9): The original voice actors are here and the music isnt too loud so the sound is good.  Character (10): The characters are the same which is a plus and the introduction of Tomamo really helped. Personally, Tomamo is my favorite character so i guess its a little biased, but for the most part all the characters are well developed.  Enjoyment (8): I thought it was a good sequel to the story with some pretty good sex scenes including a threesome, but the censorship really killed the mood at times that can be hard to ignore. Once its censorship free, this show will really shine.  Overall I give this hentai an 8. The story is nice and well developed with good sex scenes but the censorship is a heavy anchor. Either way though I recommend watching it since its worth a watch to see how the story end with some good H scenes.;Recommended
2;Zoku Koihime;Hulk10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hulk10;9;This anime is much better than the original, while I don't like the revenge plot or that Musashi and the princesses had to go through that pain. I do like that the ending was so very satisfying. The fact that Musashi defended his girls warms my heart up and makes me feel good.    The sex scenes at the end were great, the girls were as always really sexy, their nipples were not censored so that was nice, although their genitals were and that bothers me. But aside from those gripes I have no real problem with this. Nami, Suzaku, Miyuki and Anzu were all very cute like they were in the original. I also liked that they joined Musashi while he finished high school and they planned to have children.;Recommended

You can tell it was cheaply made not well written and made to just make a quick buck. From top to bottom things did not make much sense and the ending was horribly straight trash.I hate that they took this somewhat well round story with actually good charters with reason behind most of their actions and made them mindless sex dolls.;Not Recommended
0;Zoids Wild;SwordkingX0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SwordkingX0;9;"I just finished Zoids wild and I'll start this review off by saying I am a fan of the Zoids series and wish we had more anime of it as aside from Gundam no other Mecha series was as big as Zoids, but after Genesis it just seemed to vanish.  Then this series appeared in summer of 2018 I was hype, but I originally dropped it as I didn't like it as much as the others, and would come back later.  I moved on didn't hear much about it for ages, and forgot about for a time. Then I saw a couple AMV's of and thought it looked epic and that it should be done by now.  But when I went to watch it, it was only on 7 episodes with people asking ""Where's the next episode?"" Or ""Where's the rest of the series?""  I searched all over for the series but just could not find it, eventually I found it on Daily Motion, now it is in English so keep that in mind when watching.   Now for my actual thoughts on this show, it's hard to really compare this to other Zoids anime as it's so different from the others, as in this series the Zoids are living creatures much like our own world except these ones have bodies made of metal and have mechanical parts to them.  We follow Arashi as he bonds to the king of Zoids Wild Liger, and they travel the world battling Death Metal and making many friends along the way.  Arashi makes many hard choices along his journey and grows as he does so all while searching for the ancient treasure Z and whatever it may hold.    Sound wise for this show is great I love how all the zoids sound specially liger as he sound so commanding which fits perfectly.  Animation I like as much like the original they mix CG on the Zoids with the 2d characters as fit so well together. The Zoids all look and move really well and have great battles.  Character wise we got good and bad, Arash and his friends are fun and the main villain can be quite entertaining with how he pretends to be a goofball but is actually extremly dangerous and sadistic, some of his underlings are kinda weird and had odd names which sound fake imo.  Overall I did enjoy this series it just took awhile to get into it, and the changes to Zoids may turn off fans of the franchise, but I do ask that you give it a chance.   But I give Zoids Wild a 9/10 it's pretty good.";Recommended
0;Zoids Wild;AaronScythe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AaronScythe;3;"I watched this solely for my love of Zoids. If you're trying to introduce a small child to that world, this is perfect. Because that's clearly what this was made for.  The few episodes with actual visible damage that isn't just a deactivated zoid with a light scratch and sparking were genuinely enjoyable. It seems to have been reserved for tense moments, and the last two episodes actually did decent here.  Seeing the exact same recycled animation for the generic enemy fodder for the 15th+ time, you realize this was just churned out for money with no passion behind it. Seeing the exact same recycled animation for powerups, you welcome a moment when multiple occur rapidly. And if reading ""Seeing the exact same"" for a 3rd time here has annoyed you in the slightest, avoid Zoids Wild.  Were it not for the fighting and very few lightly emotionally engaging parts, this would be rated G, not PG.  To summarize: One dimensional characters, Heavily reused filler animations/transformations and an entire filler episode. It's the equivalent of a bad fanfic. 3/10. Because the soundtrack isn't too bad.";Not Recommended
0;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;PrettySammy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PrettySammy;9;"I don't know what it is, but I've been reliving my childhood a lot lately. Maybe, as college approaches, I want to remember all the good times I had as kid. I got into anime in the fourth grade via Sailor Moon (didn't everyone?), and once Toonami started airing anime all the time, I got hooked. I don't know exactly when I discovered the wide world of anime outside my TV, but if it wasn't for Cartoon Network bringing it over, I probably wouldn't be such an avid member of the anime fandom.  One show that Toonami aired was Zoids: New Century Zero, or, as the dubbing company named it, Zoids. I loved watching Zoids after school, it was definitely one of my favorite series. So I picked it up again, torrented the dub, and watched it start to finish. Serious blast from the past.  The plot of the show works rather well, and it's very fun to see the Blitz team pull out one victory after another. The Backdraft group is a little cliche at the beginning with their, &quot;oh ho ho, we're the bad guys and we're going to beat you do-gooders into the ground&quot;, but as the series goes on, the members of the back-draft group get a lot more fleshed out and become interesting villains. Still, some remain stale, with little to no explanation of their motivations except &quot;I wanna be powerful, lol&quot;.  Sometimes, though, I felt Bit and the Liger were too powerful. I can only remember one instance of the Liger losing, and with twenty five plus battles, you start to get annoyed by the Liger's uber skills. In the beginning episodes, the other characters hardly get any action at all, and powerful warriors like Brad and Leena even start to seem like hindrances to Bit and the Liger. However, as the series goes on, this remedies itself, with Brad getting a tricked out Shadow Fox and Leena blasting away opponents with her Gun Sniper. Jamie even gets a share of the action in his flying Raynos.  To tell the honest truth, I think this series needed to be longer. Brad doesn't get his Shadow Fox until Episode 20 out of 26, and Jamie only gets one or two episodes to totally kick butt as the Wild Eagle, his alter ego. The show gets a lot of fleshing out too late, in my opinion.  But what I've written makes it seem like I didn't enjoy the show. Quite the contrary, Zoids is a great series, despite its slow build-up to the uber awesome. Every character is fun to watch, from the fun-loving Bit to the &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; Leena. Brad's misery behavior is very funny, and Jamie shows off more than once that he is the most mature of the team, despite being the youngest. Steve Torros' impulse buying of things that are &quot;big and shiny&quot; is always chuckle-enducing. Harry Champ is also hilarious to watch -- he's desperately in love with Leena, but she refuses his advances (probably due to the fact that he's a total dork).  The writing, I will admit, sometimes dissolves into the classic shonen anime &quot;long stare off into the sky with determined expression&quot; cheese. But some passages of dialogue are very funny. So it's a mixed bag.  The art of this series is actually one of the things that makes it stand out. For 2001, the art is really clean and polished, and the amount of detail is astounding. All the Zoids are animated in full 3D CG, which makes for some pretty stunning battles. Watching the action on this show is hardly a bore -- everything is animated beautifully, and all the Zoids are designed fantastically.  The music is also something that sticks out. In short, it kicks ass. You WILL find yourself bopping up and down to some of the tunes, especially the &quot;uber dramatic action&quot; songs that got me bopping my head. Whoever did the music handled it VERY well. I watched the dub, so I didn't hear the Japanese opening theme/ending theme, but the American ending theme isn't so awful. No singing, just some cool rock music -- a good choice, in my opinion.  As for the dub, I can honestly say that Zoids is probably one of the best dubs I've seen. A few of the lines are little &quot;whut?!&quot; but for the most part, across the board, the acting is good and the voices all fit great. They did a bit of editing (Bit walks in on Leena in the bath -- they disguise it as Leena being mad because Bit took her scheduled time slot) but it really wasn't annoying. I mean, I'm not the sort who goes, &quot;OMFG there shuld b more cursin!!1 lol&quot; so I think whatever edits they did were appropriate and non-obtrusive to the storyline.  Really, I watched around eight episodes of this series in a row. It's that good. Definitely will keep you entertained, and probably get you invested along the way.";Recommended
1;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;Ishida_Sucks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ishida_Sucks;10;I am making these scores based on a standard set by all American Dubbed Anime. I'm talking the abominations that became Bleach and Naruto. The laughable (but cherished) memories of DBZ and Ronin Warriors. All Anime that when aired in America...were utterly ruined by abysmal voice actors and edited scenes all to hell.  When i sit back and look at Zoids for what it is, an American Dubbed anime, i am left in awe of it's prowess. The voice acting was actually something i felt little shame for. The plot was fun and amusing, but it incorporated enough twists, revelations and serious scenes to give it a good blend. A whimsical and light anime, the characters stand out with their sarcastic wit. I had to give it extremely top marks because of the impact it left on me.;Recommended
2;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;middleground4471;https://myanimelist.net/profile/middleground4471;8;Zoids: New Century/Zero, the second series of the Zoids saga that's even better than the original!  As typical for a Shounen there isn't much of a story, every episode is basically just another fight scene and, of course, the heroes always win, but this time the story isn't so serious. In Chaotic Century, Zoids were strictly used as weapons of war, but in New Century Zoids are used for sporting competitions where no one dies and even if you lose you can just get back up and try again. There's much less tension and drama in New Century which I really like because I never took Zoids that seriously, I mean come on when this show was on TV it ran to back with shows like Pokemon.  The character's are also much better is New Century than is Chaotic Century. Bit has a much more carefree attitude than Van did and Leena is a total Tsundere which I just find hilarious. New Century has a lot of funny characters in fact: Leena's dad is just a big kid, Dr. Leyon was such an incompetent villain, and everything Harry says is funny. Of course, don't get the wrong impression, this anime is still packed to the roof with explosions, fight scenes, and cool Sci Fi Mecha stuff so it isn't just a comedy.  New Century does have kind of an over-arching plot like Chaotic Century did, but, kind of like in Chaotic Century, a whole lot of exposition is crammed into last episode and isn't really that important. However, like I said at the beginning, its a Shounen, every episode is basically just another adrenaline fix with a few laughs thrown in for comic relief. A lot of fun to watch, though!;Recommended
3;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;LoveGame;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LoveGame;9;"So get this. Here I am, on a ride home from a local Smash Bros tournament with a fellow weeb friend, and I bring up Zoids, the semi-popular show of our childhood. I bring up the idea of rewatching it and he's like, ""Nah, I know it's gonna be bad if I look at it now"".  To have this mentality toward a show you watched and loved as a child is fully understandable, but it is my humble opinion that no show subverts this stigma better than Zoids New Century/Zero. This review will cover why I firmly believe that.  First, a bit of history. Like the rest of the few people who still remember Zoids, I watched this during Toonami's ""golden era"" in 2001/02, and it was one of those shows I'd rush home to catch, even more so than classics such as DBZ and Gundam. At the time, I wasn't nearly as invested in Chaotic Century (the 6am timeslot didn't do much to sell me either) as I was Zero, so Zoids more or less disappeared off the face of the earth.  Fast forward to early in my senior year of high school, I'm spaced out at my desk and randomly remember the show, so I decide to marathon it over the course of a week. For about two months over that, I had a resurgence of my Zoids obsession. I finished Chaotic Century, played a few of the games... but that more or less faded when there was, simply put, nothing left to do. Fuzors sucked, Genesis was meh (and never got a dub), so Zoids mostly served as a gateway for me to get back into anime.  Now, a few months ago, I decided to rewatch it yet again. So, how's it hold up?  Story:  One major criticism that Zero is constantly hit with (mostly by fans of Chaotic Century) is that it has no plot. While compared to CC, Zero is largely episodic, to say it has none at all would be selling it short. For the uninitiated, Zero revolves around Zoids, a race of biomechanical giant animals (think Gundams, but animals instead of humans) piloted by humans in a competitive sport. Teams of Zoid pilots battle it out under a competitive ruleset to rise up through the ranks and qualify for tournaments. So yeah, the whole show is essentially one big tournament arc.  But it goes so much further than that. While I do consider the story to objectively be Zero's weakest point, it's not nonexistent. So many wildcard factors are thrown in that the Zoids Battle Commission eventually has to step in and intervene. First and foremost we have the Backdraft Group, our main villain faction. These guys essentially go around challenging high-ranking teams to ""unsanctioned battles"" with either no rules, or rules that favor them. They're the typical criminal organization, stealing Zoids, taking over battles, etc. Honestly, these guys are pretty mediocre as far as villains go. They have their moments, like when Altiel drops his facade and has a very humbling experience as soon as the higher-ranking guys show up, and Stoller is a fantastic character, but I was far more invested in Dr. Layon, a half-serious, half-comic relief villain who specifically antagonizes the Blitz team, all over a misunderstanding regarding a romantic endeavor. This guy steals the show by his second appearance.  Other things show up here and there, but it's fairly formulaic in nature until the last few episodes. Nothing was Fuzors-level of dumb, and thank goodness.  While plot armor is occasionally in effect, battles feel strategic in nature, as a competitive battle should. Every battle the Blitz Team wins is earned through coordination and smart moves. The warriors are always thinking on their feet, and even lose a few times, proving they aren't invincible.  Art:  The first thing you'll notice about Zoids is that all the mecha themselves are rendered in cel-shaded CGI. For 2001, this looks very crisp and high-res. Some hate this feature, I personally love it. Models are very accurate to the toys that Zoids were based on. Animations are tight, and they really went all out with the battle scenes.  The characters are drawn in traditional anime style, and I really like what Xebec did here. The first few episodes look somewhat awkward in regards to faces, though. Proportions are really off, especially when the characters turn their heads. Thankfully, this doesn't take long to improve. I have to say, I honestly like how faces are drawn in later episodes. Something I've realized in recent months is my incredible disdain for animation styles that reduce noses to a single black dot that you have to squint to see (read: KyoAni, most overrated studio in existence), and this show definitely forgoes that for more realistically sized eyes, noses, etc.  Sound:  Even if you hate this show, you have to admit they really put their heart into the OST. Few action anime have songs that get me pumped as much as tracks like ""Brad Hunter"" and ""Strike Laser Claw"", and ""Twilight of Planet Zi"" fits the melancholy moments to a T. The ending, ""No Future"" is also fantastic. I don't need to say much else here.  I'm definitely a fan of the voice acting, too. Being the one person on MAL who isn't a whiny sub elitist, I think the dubbing here is pretty great. Fans of InuYasha and Ranma 1/2 will recognize Richard Ian Cox as our main protag, Bit Cloud. Other than him, I haven't heard of a lot of the voice cast, other than Samuel Vincent (Double D) as Brad Hunter, and Scot McNeil (a whole lot of characters) as Stigma Stoller. The screaming does sound a bit silly, but it's also greatly toned down from CC.  Character:  This is the point where I think New Century wins over Chaotic Century... and a lot of other action anime, if I'm being blunt.  To explain why, let me get something out of the way: I don't like kid heroes. As an adult, I just don't enjoy them and I certainly don't identify them. Let's be honest here, it's a played out concept. I recently started watching Hunter x Hunter, and it's barely taken me 5 episodes to realize how much I identify with Leorio rather than the rest of the main cast.  What's my point, you ask? Simple: the majority of Zero's main cast are... what? Fully self-sufficent adults who act like adults?! An unheard-of concept, I know, but it makes the show so much more believable. Our MC, Bit, starts off as a simple junk dealer who wants to build Zoids. We know his career and mindset, which helps set the stage when he sneaks into Blitz Team's hangar and has to explain himself.  A lot of people don't like Leena Toros. ""She's annoying"". Personally as someone who usually despises tsunderes, she's one of the few I actually enjoy. She's a very believable character for the most part, and has a unique design to boot.  Brad Hunter rounds out the trio as a laid-back mercenary who repeatedly claims not to be an ""official"" Blitz Team member. Outside of battle, he rarely raises his voice and frankly, gives no fucks unless money is involved. He's one of those types who cares a lot about his team's safety, despite not projecting this outwardly often.  The dynamic between these characters as well as Steve, Jamie, and the other recurring cast is where this show shines through. Those who pay close attention to the conversations and interactions they have outside of battle will notice how ""real"" it all feels. The lines almost feel improvised at some points. I'm very impressed at this show's ability to realistically present a group of 4 people who have to work as a team despite not exactly the best of friends. Early on, you'll pick up on how often they insult each other or pull childish pranks, and how that happens less and less as the series goes on. When giant mecha cats, wolves, and dinos aren't blowing each other up, character development is happening left and right.  Enjoyment:  I could easily sum up my enjoyment in one sentence: I wish this show was longer.  CC got 67 episodes, Genesis got over 50, Zero was relegated to the standard 26. Can't say I'm a fan of this decision, but at least the show didn't leave a lot of loose ends open, not that I can think of anyway.  This is a show I wholeheartedly enjoyed both as a 9 year old child, and a 23 year old adult. Yeah, it has the typical shonen tropes of characters screaming the names of their attacks and such, but that's the only childish element at work here.  Overall:  Zoids: New Century/Zero is perhaps one of the most criminally underrated and forgotten anime to air. I never hear it mentioned in the slightest outside of actual Zoids communities or comments on videos. What happened? Everyone remembers Dragon Ball, Gundam, Sailor Moon, and the rest of Toonami's old lineup, but not this hidden gem? To be fair, Zoids hasn't been remotely relevant in the US since like, 2004, but this is one franchise in need of a revival.  Behind the guise of ""just another kids show"" is a wonderful cast of three-dimensional characters, great comedy, and of course, action packed CGI mecha battles.";Recommended
4;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;sylvanelite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sylvanelite;9;If you want giant fighting robots, look no further. If you want plot and character development, your out of luck. I've seen many mecha shows, and by far the animation quality of this series is something to behold. With dramatic fights every episode, this series has no short supply of action. However, the plot is very lackluster at best, it makes for an excellent series to just pick up a random episode and start watching.;Recommended
5;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;redmoon_wolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/redmoon_wolf;9;So, if you're thinking about Zoids New Century Zero hopefully this will help you decide. I have only watched Century Zero all the way through, and only the first few episodes of the original. You do not need to watch the others to understand this one. The story is easy to follow. But the thing is, is that it's more for people who want to watch cool battles between giant robot animals controlled by skilled pilots. The dialogue is fairly good, but it gets a bit silly and/or dry at times. But that isn't the purpose of this show. This show is meant to showcase how awesome the Zoids are. It revolves around team battles, and it's kind of like a buffed up version of Pokemon. If you want a version of this that focuses more on character storylines, I suggest watching the original.  But with that being said, I actually really like the main character plot-line with Bit Cloud. I can tell you that you are most likely going to like him best, which is good since he's the main character. You might find the other characters charming in their own ways, or you might not. But that's not why you should watch this show.  If you're going to watch it, it's for the awesome action scenes. And if the idea of giant, piloted, pokemon-like machines with customized weapons battling each other (usually on teams) sounds cool to you, you're probably going to enjoy watching New Century Zero. And I don't want to give anything away, but the main Zoid in this show is pretty epic.;Recommended
0;Zoids Shinseiki/Zero;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;6;Overview:  Time to review a blast from the past! Zoids Zero was a popular show on Cartoon Network's Toonami block in the early 2000s. The show largely existed to sell awesome toy models, much like Hasbro's Transformers from the 1980s, but it was still a decent show and not just a glorified toy commercial.  Plot: 6/10  The plot is that piloting giant robots and fighting in epic team battles is now the most popular sport on Earth, or whatever the hell planet this takes place on. The main team is called the Blitz team and in the tradition of sports movie cliches goes from a bunch of complete losers to being the champs in dramatic fashion. The Blitz team is led by Bit Cloud and the mysterious Liger Zero Zoid. The Liger can transform into several other forms with the help of attachable battle armor including the lighning fast Jager, the heavy fire power Panzer, and the well balanced Schneider. This show had a bizzare fetish for German names. The most powerful Zoid in the whole series is a T-rex called the Berzerk Fuhrer (not kidding). Although they did change the name to the Berzerk Fury in the US and German dubs for censorship reasons. The plot heavily resembles other fighting robot sports series like G-Gundam and Robot Jox. Only instead of fighting to control the world, it is simply a sport for entertainment. The plot honestly isn't as important as the EPIC battle scenes and awesome robots. This was a great little shonen action series that is worth checking out for that reason alone.  Characters: 4/10  The characters are honestly pretty bland and generic. Bit Cloud is funny at times, but doesn't really have any character depth or anything that makes him memorable. The other characters are even less developed. This isn't really a series you watch for the great characters though.  Art: 7/10  Although it looks a tad dated now, the CG was amazing when it first came out. Combining CG with traditional animation was difficult in the late 90s and early 2000s, and often it came out looking like complete horse shit. Zoids is one of the better examples of an anime with heavy CG from this time period.  Sound: 6/10  I wouldn't rush out and buy the soundtrack, but it had some catchy toons and fit the action of the series quite well.  Enjoyment: 7/10  It has been quite a while since I last saw Zoids, so obviously my review is tinted a bit by nostalgia. I did find it quite enjoyable back in the day, and would think that current generation anime fans in their young teens would also probably have some fun with it.  Overall: 6/10  This is a series that really isn't brought up much anymore. This is kind of a shame because it is a LOT better than a lot of current day shit like Rail Wars! I'm not saying that Zoids Zero is a classic in the same vein as Cowboy Bebop or anything, but it was and is a decent little series that deserves a tad more love than it gets.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zoids Genesis;Daniel_mugen25;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daniel_mugen25;10;Zoids Genesis gives a different feeling other than the other Zoid series. The story is well written, animation is good and character development is one of its strong points.  The main character Ruuji, a village kid and at first a bit naive but as the story goes along, his character grows to a point where in he could be a leader. Even though the story is a bit serious, there are times when you will laugh because of how other characters are shown throughout the series.  Brand new zoids are shown which gives it a bit of originality. Murasame liger's transformations are shown with detail (especially the background score used).  All in all, it is a great series, the story isn't always serious and the characters are amusing and unique.;Recommended
1;Zoids Genesis;WrysOfTalys;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WrysOfTalys;8;"Some brave soul at Tomy finally decided to put the Liger Zero to rest. The legendary white Zoid gained a fairly large Western fanbase because of Zoids: New Century and Zoids: New Century Zero, so they probably thought they were stretching it too thin to place the Liger as the main Zoid of another Zoids series (yes, I'm talking to you, Zoids: Fuzors).  I thank that brave soul for what he did; it was a fairly smart move to get a new Zoid to play the lead role. I guess at this point they weren't focused on targeting some Western audience anymore, and just wanted to revive a toy franchise with a new animé tie-in. And so, they introduce Zoids: Genesis.  Knowing about the post-apocalyptic plot setup alone may turn some die-hard Zoids fans away from the show; knowing that such a small set of old Zoid favorites will be returning will be disappointing for others. But I tell you that turning away from this series is a mistake.  The fresh storyline and the new Zoids themselves gives new life to a toy line that was once on the verge of stagnation. Of course, the hero-liger-enemy-dinosaur stereotype staple to the Zoids animé franchise is still present, but any ill feelings towards this stereotype is soon set aside once the plot of the animé kicks in. I personally think that the plot development for this series is by far the best out of all existing Zoids series.  But enough of that; let's move on to the specifics.  Story: 8/10 (Very Good) For a series whose goal is to simply revive an old toy line, the story is surprisingly well-done. Enough time is spent on the main character's background, and each member gets his or her own time on the spotlight every now and then. The plot's driving force (it's the usual resistance-against-oppressive-imperial-force setup) is simple and easy to pick up.  Sound: 6/10 (Fair) Sound for this series, in my opinion, is not exactly the best. Most of the time the music is fitting to the scene, but at other times it gets old and somewhat irritating to the ears.  Art: 9/10 (Great) What this series lacks in sound, it makes up for in art. For an animé series of its type and time, the animation is surprisingly fluid and well-done. 3D animations are reused throughout the show, but it's reasonable. I mean, come on. Animators don't have to make entirely new sequences just to present the same attack combination striking a slightly different spot. What stands out, however, is the protagonist's Zoid's transformation sequences. Both animation and music is fitting and well-done, even if it's just for a few seconds.  Character: 7/10 (Good) Again, the series just beats my expectations. Character development may not be the best when compared to other series, but the series tries hard to depict the pasts of all main characters--and they do it quite well.  Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good) I personally love the Zoids series, and this series is a welcome addition to the existing list. I certainly had a good time watching the episodes.  Overall: 8/10 (Very Good) The show isn't perfect--as is to be expected from a toy-line-based series. But it's this expectation that allows this show to stand out--it goes beyond what is expected from it. From what seems to be a boring toy line tie-in turns into a great mecha series with reasonably good character development, plot development and animation. It's certainly a must-watch for both new and old Zoids fans.";Recommended
2;Zoids Genesis;sylvanelite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sylvanelite;8;A fairly typical mecha show. The plot is much stronger than most of the other Zoids series, which is what makes Genesis worth watching. The removal of basically all the old Zoids may be a turn off for long time Zoids fans, but on the other hand, it's good to have a breath of new life into the series. The battles are interesting, and the animation is very good. It does use CGI-inspired graphics, but it is well polished, and the Zoids have excellent run-cycles.  One of the better mecha shows, although it does suffer from being a tad cliche and typical, a must watch for any Zoids fan.;Recommended
0;Zoids Genesis;CallMeIta;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CallMeIta;6;This is my first review of any anime, so constructive criticism would be welcome. Also, I will try my best not to spoil anything.  Zoids Genesis, or ZG for short, has a fairly good plot, and roughly half of the characters do get developed, though that leaves the other half with little to no development or backstory *cough*Seijurou*cough*. The plot starts off smoothly, with a rather…. “mediocre” goal, however, that goal changes as the plot progresses (and the original goal is never achieved). The change in plot however, makes it seem as though there wasn’t a change in plot, because they were basically doing the same thing (Fighting the enemy army, Digald). The anime starts off slowly, first couple episodes being kind of a bore. However, the later episodes get pretty intense. One let down, is that when you see someone die, you think there dead. Then at the end of the episode, or a later episode, they are perfectly fine. The action in ZG is… what you’d expect of a Zoids anime, with the benefit of a fight in every episode, though unlike Zoids New Century there is a plot, and each fight has purpose. However, some fights have certain twists, which I aren’t “WOW THAT WAS AWESOME” worthy moments, but are enough to keep your interest. There is a tiny bit of humour. I can name maybe 2 episodes that made me laugh (though I admit, it isn’t exactly easy to make me laugh). So some may find humour in episodes I didn’t, but, the jokes weren’t ALL that. Towards the end however, the last 10 episodes to be specific, I was eagerly anticipating what was coming next (partly because I wanted to see what would happen next, and partly because I just wanted to add this to my ‘Completed’ list). However, there are some, “What the hell is that doing in a Zoids anime?” moments, and some even more, “What the hell just happened?” moments. Overall the anime could be better, but it isn’t downright terrible. Personally, because of nostalgia, and my love for Zoids when I was a child, I was generous and gave it an 8/10. For the sake of this review, I am not going to be so generous. 6/10 Still, I encourage you, if you like(d) Zoids, watch ZG.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zoids Fuzors;Daniel_mugen25;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daniel_mugen25;7;Zoids fuzors, just like Zoids new century, have teams who uses Zoids to battle each other for entertainment purposes in my opinion. It has been a good series especially when their Zoids combine with each other.  Unfortunately, the story is a bit cliche. Teams battling each other for no explained reason(I might have missed it in the series though). I have only watched the English dub so far and the voice actors are good. Animation is a bit different from previous Zoids series but then impressive when they combine. All in all, it was a good series.;Recommended
0;Zoids Fuzors;slax;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slax;1;"Ok, I'm a big Zoids fan, and as such, this review focuses on the differences between the styles of this and the preceding series, rather than an more general overview (I won't use Genesis as an example since that is of a vastly different style). Unfortunately, it is very negative.  Firstly, let me start with the Story: Fuzors basically has no story whatsoever for the vast majority of the series. In the final few episodes, a backstory gets fleshed out and some continuity established, but as this only happens very late-on, it feels more like a justification for why the series occurred in the way it did, rather than an actual plot that naturally developed. Furthermore, the story it does eventually manage to establish is rushed, this, along with the generally poor translations, makes it difficult to draw any praise from the story.  Now, this brings me to draw parallels with Zoids Zero, which also had a very skimpy plot at best. However, the biggest difference with the two series is that Zero is built around battles and comedy, and as such tries to give the viewer fluid fights and funny lines rather than a deep plot. Fuzors does not, and as such has no excuse for the lack of story.  To continue with the story theme, I'll next discuss the Characters:  While Zoids shows are not renowned for their characters, the development of the cast is not handled well in Fuzors at all. For instance, in the first episode, the character ""Amy"" walks in to Mach Storm's headquarters and appears to anger some of the main characters. What the show doesn't tell you is that Amy is actually a member of Mach Storm herself. This fact makes it very confusing (to say the least) when she shows up unannounced in later episodes. This is probably the best way of describing the problem with the characters in Fuzors, it simply assumes you know who/what everyone/thing is -rather than actually take the time introduce them.  This is especially true for the Zoids themselves. Many of the Zoids, such as Arosaurers and Gorhecks are totally new Zoids that fans of the previous series would not know anything about -and yet they appear on screen without any kind of introduction at all. To make matters worse, old Zoids that fans would be familiar with from other series are changed abruptly and without reason. For example, the Blade Liger is depicted in the other series as a very rare (if not unique) Zoid. In the first episode of Fuzors, three of them are shown. Another prominent example is the Fuzors variant of Gunsniper, which are all customised to be the same as Leena's heavily modified (and thus unique) Zoid featured in Zero. No explanation for either of these is ever given.  This kind of ""thrust the viewer into the show"" serves to confuse new watchers and disenfranchise fans, and is a great detriment to the series. Toward the end of the series, some of the cast's backstory is explained, however this is done in a very rushed manner and fails to justify the terrible job done in the first three-quarters of the series.  Next up is the artwork.  Well, the most important aspect of a Zoids show is the Zoids themselves, so I'll start with them. The models are all done in 3D, but the style is different to the previous series. The models themselves are very detailed, and try to stick closely to the real toy range, with small things like feathers and antennae being included. While such attention to detail may sound good, this is actually a detriment, as it severs to clutter the screen with needless ""wriggly bits"" that only serve to distract the viewer. Furthermore, the models are all done in a very bland color scheme, with everything appearing ""cloudy"" and dull when compared to the crisp, bright, colors of the previous series.  Compounding this is the fact that most of these included features are simply never used. For example, the Liger Zero Phoenix never fires the bomb or guns that it has on it's back, instead RD usually uses his claws to attack from a distance, which is a big departure from the realism the highly detailed models try to emulate.  While this might be excusable if everything in the series were done in the same style of graphics, this is simply not the case. Bullets and explosions are done in conventional anime style and as such stick out like a sore thumb. They just do not blend at all with the Zoids they are fired from or hit.  But the most noticeable feature of the animation is the movement of the Zoids. The Zoids move in a very awkward and robotic fashion. All of the Zoids featured are extremely rigid and inflexible, thus their movements seem entirely unnatural and unrealistic. This is especially prevalent when the Zoids ""fall over"", wherein they appear to do a backflip on the spot rather than actually collapse or stagger. This is easily the biggest complaint I have with the series, especially when comparing with the extraordinarily fluid animations of Zero.  The backgrounds are bland and uninteresting, with very little stand-out features, and as such, the only positive thing I have to say about Fuzor's artwork is the character's design. However, considering that the characters are very unimportant (as they are usually obscured from view inside Zoids) this is largely a moot point.  Finally, is the sound.  Almost all weapons have high-pitched sounds, regardless of what they are actually shooting. As any mech fan could well appreciate, it sounds a bit ridiculous when super-heavy artillery makes a ""pew"" sound. Furthermore, RD's voice actor has a very high-pitched voice, as do most of the supporting cast (such as Sigma and Sweet). As the viewer's ears are bombarded constantly by all these high-pitched sounds, it honestly gets annoying.  Other: Well, there is no section for this, but the quality of translation is very poor. The names of Zoids are often mispronounced or downright wrong.  Overall: Quite simply Fuzors is a very poorly made anime when taken from the viewpoint of a Zoids fan. The animation is awkward, robotic and dull, the sound effects are annoying and inappropriate, the translations are poor and the story only picks up toward the end of the series, but this simply come along far too late to salvage the series.";Not Recommended

The plot is terrible, and the voice actors are outstandingly bad. The fights are poorly strung together and are terrible to look at. This series was cancelled from US airways for good reason. Although it does get better in the latter half, it's not enough to recover from the terrible first half.;Not Recommended
0;Zoids;VK11;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VK11;8;"Zoids is a mecha anime about people who control beast-like units. Unlike Gundams, they aren\'t really used in space (at least in this particular anime) but are used for purposes such as transportation and of course, battles. This anime was the starting point of the Zoids franchise, and after watching the anime a few times (both in English dubs and Japanese subs), one can point out that it was a great way to start of the Zoids phenomena.  The story, although your simple &quot;country raised kid rises up to the challenge of saving the world from evil,&quot; is very good and has enough plot twists in between to leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting for more. What made this Zoids saga different from the others were the miniature Zoids organoids that were able to fuse with their larger counterparts and in essence, bring the Zoid to life with more power than before. What really makes the story great is the epic battles they have between many Zoids.  These epic battles for the most part, are animated very well. For being an older anime (debuted in 1999) it still holds up to today\'s standards fairly well and really does not disappoint. The characters themselves look a bit bland at times, but it isn\'t to the degree where its unwatchable.  The sound is so-so. Because it\'s been awhile since I saw this anime, I don\'t remember a lot of the scores used, but I do remember for scores used for the battles and they fit just right.  All of the main characters have very distinct personalities and you\'ll come to have your favorites most definitely. Van and Fiona have believable strengths and weaknesses given their environment and always seem to have an enemy, or rival, to go against up with. There really isn\'t a boring moment where you\'ll find that the protagonists are superior to everyone else.  All in all, the anime was a great start to the Zoids saga. Though a lot of the following stories after were not as great, this is still a classic. The stirring romance between Van and Fiona again is something you\'ll fall in love with as the story progresses and is one more reason to give this show a try. To end with, if you\'re one of the younger anime audiences out there and like mecha anime, but haven\'t given the original Zoids a try because of the lackluster performances of the others, I urge you to give this one a shot.";Recommended
1;Zoids;Huntsman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Huntsman;10;Zoids consists of two series. Chaotic Century and The Guardian Force, essentially it's all one series.  The series takes place on the Planet Zi, where living machines called Zoids live. There are wild ones, and ones controlled by humans. There are two major powers on the planet Zi, the Republic and Guylos Empire. Though the war they fought is over, the peace is tenuous and could give way to war at any moment. The story follows Van who lives in a village. He goes out one day and gets chased by bandits into some ancient ruins. The he finds a organoid, and names it Zeke. Zeke reviews a Shield Liger and defeat the bandits. They go back into the ruins and discover Fiona a ancient Zoidian who has lost her memory. The group on a adventure searching for t he Zoid Eve, through bandits, merc's, and war.  STORY: The story is great, it's light, but there are dark undertones. I guess the company did it to attract younger viewers. The violence is toned done, though you see cities being destroyed, and Zoids being destroyed so you know what's happening and doesn't take anything away from the story.  ART: The animation is great done by XEBEC, the same people who did Love Hina, Elemental Gelade, and Buso Renkin, which were all pretty good series.  SOUND: The one flaw I found in this series was the soundtrack. It lacked depth and feel. Was it still good, yes. It just didn't to the series justice.  CHARACTERS: The characters in this series were great. You could feel their pain and see their suffering and joy. The just captivated you and brought you in. The best characters were the two main ones Van and Fiona and their story was just wonderful.  OVERALL: Zoids is 24th favorite anime series out of about 250 series/OVA/movies I've seen. It's a great series, not quite a classic, but still great. A series everyone should watch.;Recommended
2;Zoids;CNS487;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CNS487;10;"*NOTE: This review contains some minor spoilers, but I will do my best to keep it brief, concise, and to the point*  STORY: In the first half of the series, Van Flyheight is a zoid pilot who comes across a mysterious type of zoid known as an Organoid who he names Zeke, as well as a young girl named Fiona in pods found in mysterious ruins. Upon finding the two, Van finds himself the center of attention of bandits and soldiers alike who are after the Organoid's strange powers. Van and Fiona come across other characters and find themselves in the middle of a war, and have to do what they can to help bring peace to land and end this war. Zoids does a relatively decent job of keeping tone shifts frequent without overexaggerating it, often having serious moments albeit with light-hearted comedy when the mood needs to be brought up. The flow of the story feels natural, and feels neither rushed or slow. It has a nice, even pace that the viewer can easily enjoy. 9/10  ART: The art direction that Zoids took was aesthetically pleasing all around. Characters were detailed enough that they didn't stick out too much, but also were not too detailed to the extent that they distracted from the environment. It felt as though environments and characters had about the same effort put into them, so that neither were too distracting. Obviously, the Zoids were what the majority of the focus was put on, most likely being what most of the budget was used for. The zoids were rendered with high quality, and it shows. If anything in particular needed the most focus in terms of art, it was definitely the Zoids, and it shows. That being said, the only real flaw I can see with them is that some animations were clearly recycled throughout the series, but it's not incredibly noticeable so it isn't really that big of an issue. 9/10  SOUND: As much as I personally enjoy the soundtrack, I do have some issues with it; the main problem I have is that the soundtrack can often times sound a little repetitive while other times is a little too scarce. There's nothing wrong with having certain audio tracks be more common than others, but eventually it gets to the point where some tracks sound as though they're heard in almost every episode. I felt that there could have been a little more variety in certain places, and that occasionally, certain tracks did not fully fit the mood. Yet in other situations, the soundtrack did its job very well, helping in creating the particular mood of a scene. I felt that the type of music used did fit the overall environment of the show, using both fast paced action-themed music for fighting, and softer, more melodic music for scenes involving development of characters. 7.5/10  CHARACTER: In Zoids, the characters can really be hit or miss. Some aren't as fleshed out as others, but the main cast is fleshed out enough that the viewer cares about them and wants to see them succeed. Van Flyheight is the most developed character by far, as the second half of the series, Guardian Forces, focuses on how much Van has matured since the first half of the series (there is a small time skip in between), and they really emphasize just how much he's changed, going from often being a jokester kind of character to a more serious character who cares about protecting those dear to him. The show also does a nice job in creating sympathy for certain characters who start off as villains but have a change of heart as the series progresses. Unfortunately, while Zoids does a great job in developing the main protagonists, the show falls a bit short in terms of the main antagonists, who sadly fall into the usual trope of being evil for the sake of being evil. That being said, they are not part of the main focus of development to begin with, and while it would be nice to see them developed more, at the very least the main and supporting cast have enough development to keep the viewer caring for them. 8.5/10  ENJOYMENT: The biggest part of enjoyment typically comes from watching the Zoid battles throughout the series. They have a mix of fast paced action and often strategic ways of fighting, appealing to more than just one audience with the way the battles are handled. There is drama involved, but it is not shoved in the viewer's face. There is a nice, even pacing between the fighting and story elements, so neither feels overdone. Light hearted moments in the show are welcome when they are as the action and serious tone will bring characters back to reality. The show has a nice, enjoyable pace from start to finish, introducing slight changes in the second half so as not to be repetitive. 9.5/10  OVERALL: Zoids: Chaotic Century/Guardian Force gives off the feeling of being along for an adventure. It develops its characters enough to make the viewer care for them, and want to see them get to the end of their journey. You follow them along, and through thick and thin, they keep fighting, and the journey goes through various types of drama and has an adventurous feel. A lot of the series is about the maturity of Van as a character too, and you see him grow from a young boy to a man who fights for what he believes in. You also see the evolution of how the likes of Fiona and several other characters develop throughout the series, and by the end, their relationships feel genuine. The characters feel like those who can be related to by the viewer. It has all the feelings of an adventure, from humble beginnings to the maturity one gains from it.  Final Score: 10/10 : Would recommend to any anime fan.";Recommended
3;Zoids;showandAG;https://myanimelist.net/profile/showandAG;9;Note - This review may be a little biased.  I will start off by saying that Zoids was a big part of my childhood. I grew with this as my favorite TV show, played Zoids Battle Legends for the GameCube, and even had a toy Redhorn (my brother had a toy Liger, he somehow convinced me to get a stupid Redhorn). All of this being said, my review may be somewhat biased.  Story 9/10  Zoids (Chaotic Century/Gaurdian Force are the two halves that make up this series of zoids) takes place on planet Zi, where large robot animals called zoids, which are generally used for combat by humans live. It follows Van, who dreams of following in his father's footsteps and becoming a legendary zoid pilot. He discovers the organoid who he names Zeke, and the girl Fiona, and he sets out with Fiona to help her uncover her past and find the mysterious Zoid Eve. Zoid meets Irvine and Moonbay who accompany him on most of his journey as they overcome various pitfalls on the way to learning about Fiona's past.  Art 8/10  I thought the art/character designs were well done. I think the biggest issue that many people will have with zoids is the mediocre CG used in the fight sequences with the zoids. Because I grew up watching this as a kid I was used to this and always thought it was the coolest thing, but to a person seeing it for the first time today, they probably would think its pretty terrible at some points.  Sound 8/10  The dub themes are pretty bad in my opinion, the original themes are decent. The soundtrack is solid and does a good job setting the mood.  Characters 9/10  Van is a pretty typical character - he starts out weak, but determined, and he eventually becomes great. Fiona is quirky. I found the characters of zoids to be quite enjoyable.  Enjoyment 9/10  I always loved zoids since I was a kid and even in re-watching this series again this year I was still able to enjoy it.  Overall 9/10  If you are into mecha anime, Zoids is definitely worth a try.;Recommended
4;Zoids;sylvanelite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sylvanelite;8;The original, and one of the best Zoids anime. With plenty of plot, this is one of the most well-developed plots of any Zoids series, with perhaps Genesis being second. The voice acting is sometimes a bit sub-par, but the rest of the series is very enjoyable. It's fairly cartoon-ey in nature, but that adds to the quality of the series.  Mecha sizes can vary massively, the scale of Zoids is very inconsistent, but this is one of the few limitations of the series. Overall the animation is very good, especially considering this series is the first Zoids series to be produced.;Recommended

0;Zoids;MrLegitimacy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MrLegitimacy;4;"Seriously, how do I keep coming back to these Studio Xebec shows? They've produced so much over the years, and some of it is actually decent, but not this one. Zoids (Chaotic Century if you're American) had a huge amount of potential, but was completely watered down with flat visuals, a bloated cast of shallow characters, and way too many episodes of what amount to filler.  This show had all the ingredients to be one of my favorites. It follows all of my stupid rules to make a great mecha show: -It keeps the same theme song throughout -There's a robot battle in every episode -The robots are in CG, which is dank as hell! -They play the theme song at the climax of each episode to reinforce the hype  But none of this could keep me from being bored out of my mind within the first 30 episodes.  I started this show on January 1st, and finished on May 6th. That's 126 days, so 67 episodes/127 days gives just over 1/2 an episode as a daily average. Even giving myself the advantage of watching every episode at double speed, I could not bring myself to watch more than that. Let me not understate how bad that is--I have watched far worse shows at a religious one-a-day pace just to end the pain, but I was so disinterested in this show that I couldn't be arsed to spare 12 minutes a day for it.  Let's examine why this might be:  The direction is beyond uninspired. Every shot is framed well enough so the kids at home can keep up with what's happening, but forget about going above and beyond to add any visual intrigue to the show. The standout eyesores for me were the establishing shots which far outstay their welcome, and are almost unbearably slow even at double speed. The art style, which leans towards realistic proportions, does not lend itself to having expressive characters. Sure the characters are on model very consistently, but half the time they look like cardboard cutouts with a terribly drab and muted color palette. This style may have been a choice to fit with the more rigid lines of the Zoid designs, but they really shot themselves in the foot by taking away the one means by which their boring characters might have had a small amount of visual flair.  These boring characters are all pretty one dimensional. At most a character will have one defining trait, and receive little to no character development throughout the entire run of the series. I can recall maybe one or two episodes focused on developing a backstory or exploring character motivations for each of our main cast. That's one or two episodes out of almost 70. A great majority of episodes do nothing to challenge our characters on a personal level, and just involved the aforementioned regularly scheduled robot battle. The antagonists show similar levels of depth, and are really only relevant to the story if they have a powerful Zoid.  What really confounds me is that they had a lot of great ideas to work with and could have told a gripping story. In episode ONE we establish our heroes are looking for an ancient artifact/location called ""Zoid Eve"" that seems like it could drive a long running mystery plot, only to be cast aside and never mentioned for a vast majority of the episodes. There is a planet-wide military conflict that our characters become wrapped up in, but almost no focus on what motivated the war or its repercussions on the people of each nation. Near half way through there is a time skip, and it does nothing significant to grow or change our characters. Don't forget that they're on a planet crawling with giant robot animals that they go out of their way to show are sentient, but never pause to make our characters wonder about the morality of people's relationships with Zoids by taking the Pokemon route.  So who should watch Zoids? If you're looking to commit long term to an easygoing shounen series with abundant robot battles, Zoids is a good candidate for you. Those looking for anything of substance should steer clear.";Not Recommended
0;Zipang;Ovyda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ovyda;9;"I would have never watched this if my internet hadn't had some connection issues. To my huge surprise from the very first episode it already caught my interest and I ended up watching 7 episodes without a break.  I personally want to give title ""Cliffhanger"" to this anime. Like 90% of the episodes ended up with a cliffhanger... Don't get me wrong, I actually loved this. I kind of regret it aired before I started watching anime, because this anime had enormously huge variety of topics to discuss. Every episode was very different from the previous one and many turnarounds happened. I was sometimes even confused so who's right and who's wrong, who's the ally and who's the enemy... Great mind games (not as great as Code Geass and Death note tho) were played during the episodes and it was almost impossible to predict what will be their next move.  Basically this anime starts with 21st century's battle ship leaving the port for some training exercises and encountering some sort of anomaly that sends them back in time to 1942 year (60 years ago). This was the time when Japan were in a war against USA. The next 26 episodes of this anime is how the whole crew struggles to avoid any contact with the people from those years so that they wouldn't change the history.  However, can you actually avoid everyone when you are in the middle of a war? Obviously not...you need food, fuel and other things to survive... and this is were the fun begins... The battle ship from 21st century has such advanced weapons that are enough to destroy the whole USA army (it's realistic, in 60 years weapons do advance that much). Moreover, they know the whole history of this war. In other words they know every movement of both Japan's and USA's armies and what were the turning points of war and just basically they were overpowered. However, they didn't want to participate in this war at all, this was not their war, so this what makes the anime so great... Just how they try to avoid any minimal contact with anyone and what happens when they finally get spotted by both Americans and Japanese people...  The realism of this show was incredible if you don't think about this ""time travelling thing"". Zipang did a good job portraying the moral issues and how they were dealt with within the crew and their opponents/allies. However, those 26 episodes weren't enough to finish the series. They ended up on another big cliffhanger. Of course, there is manga, but... the disappointment of not having a sequel is huge.";Recommended
1;Zipang;oOoOoOo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/oOoOoOo;7;"If you were the captain of a highly advanced Japanese warship sent back in time to the Second World War, would you change history to bring victory to your people, or would you do everything to preserve the way of life you knew in the 21st century? The crew of the Mirai are torn, as they grapple with this very question, watching the legendary Yamato slink by them in the fog. ""Zipang"" is less about time travel and altering history, than it is about accepting the reality around you. While many hold out hope for a return to the ""present"", many others decide that they have no choice but to make the best of their situation, even if that means serving an emperor-worshiping dictatorship. The true drama comes from those characters who try to straddle the line between those extremes, finding that neutrality is a difficult position in history's most devastating total war.  In-between well executed naval battles (who doesn't want to see a modern Japanese warship take out several waves of American fighter planes, followed by their aircraft carrier?) you'll be entertained by the machinations of the Imperial army and navy, as they try to figure out what the Mirai is, and what its mandate is. Is it a secret project of a rival country? Something from another branch of the Imperial military? Seeing 1940s-era warriors (many of them historical figures) grapple with such concepts as guided missles is both amusing and moving. Indeed, these weapons seem like godlike miracles from a fantasy world, and I'm sure we'd be similarly baffled by future technology from the year 2100.  While I can tolerate the merely adequate art, I ultimately found the story the most disappointing, specifically towards the end of the series. I felt a lot of questions were left unanswered (in a rather typical ""life goes on"" sort of way). There was little hint left as to what would happen, leaving the feeling that the series simply ran out of money and just opted to roll credits and pack up.  Ultimately, this is an anime designed for war geeks, although anyone with an appreciation for history will be intrigued by the moral issues dealt with by the cast, a group of characters who are interesting in their own right, but largely serve to fill the roles made by the historical debate. It is a solid concept that carries this series, though I imagine in more capable hands, this could have been a masterpiece.";Recommended
2;Zipang;lisnoire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lisnoire;10;A modern naval destryoer from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force is sent back in time via some sort of quantum anomaly to the battle of Midway. For 26 episodes they struggle with where their loyalty lies, do their best to protect themselves without killing anyone and without doing anything that would change history.  The contrast between modern Japan and that of the 1940's is stunning. It is a critical look Japan's militaristic government at the time, at war in general, and at hard moral questions.  Although I feel the facial character designs could have been a little more realistic, they were refreshing in that they didn't try to make everyone beautiful. The technical drawings of the ships, planes, uniforms, and weaponry is extraordinary. There were have bound to have been errors, but I didn't notice anything glaring.  Its thoughtfulness and realism isn't for everyone but it is one of my all time favorites. One word of warning, the final episode does not tie things up with a bow but leaves you wondering. There is a manga but I haven't taken the time to track it down.;Recommended
3;Zipang;-ryougishiki-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-ryougishiki-;7;Summary:  The story begins as Mirai, a newly constructed improved Kongou class missile destroyer and one of the most advanced ships of the Japanese Self-Defence Force, and its crew of more than 200 people departs from Yokohoma Base to Pearl Harbor. However, a strange phenomenon occurs as they are on their way to the Pearl Harbor and the crew becomes shocked when they see Yamato, the strongest ship of Imperial Japanese Navy from WW2, and other WW2 ships like Nagato,Akagi etc. They realize that they are no longer in post-war Japan of 21st century and they are sent to 1942— to the middle of Battle of Midway no less! So begins their struggle to survive in an era and country that completely foreign to them.  Story (9/10):  The story is the strongest point of Zipang. It is unique and enthralling. First of all let me warn you about one thing. Although nearly all of the series takes place in warships and battlefields, battle scenes are really few albeit satisfying. So if you are expecting battles and bloodshed, Zipang is not anime for you. Story is about the crew of Mirai struggling to get out of this era and searching for a way to survive while not intervening in the war to not alter the history. Yet, it is of course impossible for them to survive without supplies and fuel for their ship and not to be noticed as a strange ship that isn’t ought to exist in WW2 era.  Since the crew of Mirai are the officers of the Self-Defence Force, they basically have never seen war let alone killing someone. The were trained to save lives— not taking them. And they desperately try to do the thing they were trained for while fearing that their actions may change the future and make the future they have come from non-existent. This contradictory feelings and actions are what makes Zipang beautiful. They want to save people, yet who are they going to save? The Japanese soldiers who follows the orders of the military government? Any people they can save? Will the history they know change if they save them? Different people will give different answers to this questions according to their ideals and situation.  spoiler:  The only thing I didn’t like in the story is that it doesn’t end with a clear ending. A lot of things are left unanswered, and nearly nothing in the plot got concluded .  Art (5/10):  The art is the weakest point of Zipang. Characters look really similar. The ships and sea was beautifully drawn but the anime emphasizes the characters and their psychology and not the ships. If it was a show concentrated on naval battles, I would give no less than 8. Yet it is not.  Zipang as it is a historic and realistic anime, doesn’t have the usual colourful hair,eyes and big eyes from the usual anime shows.  Characters (6/10):  Although the crew’s situation and their decisions are really impressive, there are no person that stands out on his own. Kadomatsu Yosuke can be called as protagonist somewhat but even he is very forgettable. The only main character I like is Kusaka because he is a really shrewd opponent and his ideals which are too different from of Kadomatsu’s makes the characters do heating debates. Apart from main characters there are a lot of historic characters like Isoroku Yamamoto or Ishiwara Kanji. I personally liked the historical characters more than main characters (except Kusaka).  Sound (6/10):  Not bad, yet not impressive either. It doesn’t make you feel heated up in battle scenes, or sorrowful in tragic moments.  Enjoyment (8/10):  I finished the anime in a week and never got bored. Each episode makes you curious about what they are going to do next. And historical side-characters who makes great effects on the storyline comes one after another.  Overall (7/10):  Zipang is a good anime and I recommend you to watch it. The story was great except the thing I said in the spoiler above. However, I think it could have been done far more better. I give a 7/10 to Zipang.;Recommended
4;Zipang;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;8;"This original little work offers up an alternate history of events from World War II when modern members of the Japanese SDF find themselves time traveling back to the time period aboard their military's latest destroyer ship, the Mirai. The modern warship's presence in World War II Japan brings about some interesting subjects to explore with the time travel plot device. The members of the Mirai's crew find themselves at odds at points over how much they should intervene in the major naval battles fought between Japanese and American forces as their involvement effects future events in their present timeline, as well as having their moral beliefs challenged as they come at odds with the wartime mentality commonplace with many Japanese soldiers during the war while the SDF's organization is primarily self-defense in modern Japan. The show also explores what one would desire if they came to know of all the major events that shaped their country in the future shown through Kusaka's knowledge of such events when he is brought aboard the Mirai in the earlier episodes of the series and whose actions put him at odds with the ship's commander Kadomatsu, as well as tensions rising between the Mirai crew and prominent members of the Japanese military due to the knowledge and advanced technologies that the ship and its crew have on them.  The series is quite believable in focusing on key details of Showa era Japan and the events faced by Japan's navy during the time period in World War II showing some prominent military and political figures, famous Japanese battle ships, the technologies employed and some of the major battles fought in 1942. It shows as much believability as well in showing off the modern weaponry and technological advances that the Mirai have on them.  The visual presentation to Zipang is a bit of a mixed bag. It offers up some good-looking CG rendered shots of various naval ships and planes though they stick out quite prominently from the regular animation seen within the series. The character designs are a bit below par in quality for a mid 2000s anime as details on them were a bit plain, simple and rough. On the plus end, scenery shots are vast with good details and believable in showing the prominent features of Showa era Japan, as well as having moments of fluid movement in battle scenes coming from missiles being fired and having planes engage enemy ships.  The series does suffer from a couple minor flaws. Zipang isn't too character-driven as the most focus given to the crew of the Mirai comes from Kadomatsu as he adapts to and understands the condition of Japan in World War II, as well as deal with Kusaka's motives. It also lacks a proper ending as some major events with Kadomatsu and the Mirai crew are left hanging in the show's final episode.  Still though, Zipang did do well in engaging me with its original look into a ""what if"" scenario if the modern crew of a Japanese naval ship were to enter World War II and handling the various historical and moral complications faced by the crew of the Mirai and the Japanese military of the time period. It's worth a look if you wish to learn more of Japan's history within the Showa era and World War II, with a small dose of time travel thrown in the mix.";Recommended

A modern JSDF guided missile destroyer gets transported back in time smack in the middle of the Imperial Japanese fleet during the battle of Midway and staring down the battleship Yamato. Though it was just a ""measly"" destroyer, its modern technology could wipe out the WWII Japanese and American Navy combined.  The story is interesting enough with lots of cliffhangers at the end of episodes. Are the JSDF pacifists, not wanting to kill wantonly and trying to avoid the butterfly effect? Or will they aid Imperial Japan to win the war? Or will we see a headline of ""lone modern destroyer destroys entire US-Japanese WWII fleet by itself""?  The art is not so great character-wise, but the accuracy and detail on all WWII era ships, planes, and submarines are through the roof.  Characters are emotionally black or white, not much grey area characters as you would expect of such a complicated and convoluted situation.  This blew my mind when I first saw it, as I haven't seen anything like this before, but I give it an absolute ceiling of 8/10.";Recommended

Would you abuse your superior technology and help your nation, or would you try to save lives? These are just some of the question crew aboard Mirai cruiser come up with after they're sent (through never explained anomaly) back in time to WW2.  Story [9]: -> Perfect, unique and intriguing. What I liked the most is that the story isn't only centered on the crew of Mirai, it also shows how that small cruiser affects the lives of others, how it affects the course of war. Lots of sudden plot twists and events in this show. Really good. Strongest part of the show.  Art [6]: -> Just as story is the strongest, art is weakest point in the show. Blocky faces make characters often very hard to recognize, and that's not good. However, beyond that lies beautiful art of both sea and sky. If you can get past really not so well drawn faces, there lies a sea of beautiful screenshots.  Sound [7]: -> I could go on and on about story and art, but sound is quite a mystery. It's almost unnoticed. Things happening on the screen make sound really secondary, and unfortunately, sometimes during emotional scenes, where sound should ""carry"" events happening, you won't even notice it's there. Pity, because when you actually decide to listen it, it's great. Bad directing I guess.  Character [7]: -> Could have been done way better. They're sometimes well explained, but past the two ""main"" characters nobody gets almost any development. Mark here would have been even worse if not for the variety of characters appearing. They're numerous and act different and ""real"", and kudos for that, but development is again, almost non existent.  Enjoyment [8]: -> Most of the time the premise of the show is enough to carry this show really high and make it enjoyable, but sometimes there's nothing happening for a while, and those parts were boring, TO ME! This category is subjective.  Overall [7]: -> Really fine and quite interesting show which lacked in some areas, but did very well in others. Unfortunately ending left a lot to be desired, but that's not so bad. 7 for this show is just.

7;Zipang;-ShadowClaw-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-ShadowClaw-;8;If you had the ability to go back in time in era where the world was on the brink and entire populations dying would you go back in time to prevent that from occurring even if it means that the future that came after it could be erased forever? That is just one of the Dilemma the crew of the Mirai must tackle in this time-travel/Military Story.  It has been awhile since i wrote a review for anything but since this series left a bit of an impression on me and is extremely under the radar i thought i might give some insight so that others might check it out.  So to give a basis of the story, the story focuses on the crew of the Mirai the Japanese naval force newest and most advanced military vessel and as they were conducted a naval training excersize they encountered and anomaly that displaced the crew to travel back in time by almost 60 years into the middle of the Battle of Midway during World war II and along the way rescue a naval officer who should of perished in that battle and thus a series of events unfold that begins to change the course of history.  Well that is the basic premise, i have to say thought it is an interesting take on the genre and whoever wrote this, knew what he was writing as there is a lot of historical detail despite this being and alternate timeline and the fact that focus on heavily on military and political ethics. The thing i find most fascinating is the writers ability to remain quite impartial as to who is in the right and wrong, there is no clear definition and every individual encountered has there own ideas and goals but there characters are well constructed that you can sympathise with each individuals position and decisions so you can just about root for anyone.  The Military combat action is well done and is the military and political dialogue. The Animation is very good it may be somewhat outdated as this was released nearly 15 years ago but not that much and can still hold on its own. The soundtrack is somewhat weak as there is not much of a diverse amount different tracks but it is fine with what was shown. The Sub dialogue is in tune the Dub is somewhat of a mix bag. The Dub has a lot of dialogue that is more in line with what an American solider would sound like or talk and that might be somewhat off putting to hear a Japanese naval officer speaking in heavy southern american accent, it is aright once you get used to it but i recommend the sub for more authenticity.  Overall this is a great series to watch , especially for someone who has an interest in Military, Naval and Time Travel conflicts and i would recommend just about anyone to give this a try. Keep in mind is that while there is plenty of action the story is also somewhat slow paced and dialogue heavy which is fine if you like that sort of thing but if there are people who might find that a bit boring i would not sit this one trough. Give it a try, it is an almost forgotten classic that should receive a bit more attention. :);Recommended
8;Zipang;RexDraco;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RexDraco;7;For those of you that enjoy WWII, alternate history, and maybe some military action, this is a decent anime. The biggest drawback is the fact it was never finished, they just dropped it on a cliff hanger, forcing you to read the manga.  It's an anime about individuals from the Japanese navy that, for unknown reasons, randomly went back in time during the WWII era. Upon trying to be neutral to avoid changing history, the inevitable happens that escalates to them getting in battle. They rescue a man who was very cooperative and kind, but it was decided to allow him to read history books that essentially predict the future. Upon doing so, he was inspired to create a new future, a new Japan, which the rest of the crew had mixed feelings about. The rest of the show's drama revolves around that and it's incredibly interesting for it.  It's a shame too, because it was really good, but it ends on a nasty cliff hanger that will never be satisfied without research.;Recommended

The characters themselves can be bland, and at times, uninteresting, but its not over the top.

0;Zipang;Illyasviel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Illyasviel;6;"This review will include some spoilers about the 1st few episodes in order to make a constructive criticism of the story and the characters. I precise that i have not read the manga.  Story:  This anime is the japanese counterpart of The Final Countdown movie, instead of an American battleship sent into WWII, this time a Japanese ultra modern cruiser, the Mirai, is transported to the battle of Midway. The 1st turning point is the decision of the crew is to save the life of a Japanese officer, the Lt Kusaka who had drowned in the actual timeline. The anime then focus on the survival of the crew of the ship, since the crew obviously need supply and quickly begun to rise a crucial question: what do the crew of the Mirai should do? Should it avoid to alter the time line of this universe? Should it stay fidel to the Japan?Should it save as many live as possible, and how, should it fasten the end of the war or prevent any more casualties? And what Kusaka will do after discovering the fate of the Japan? We have at first a lot of question raised, and the anime seemed gave us a very encouraging start However the anime just seemed to delay the answer and only partially skimmed over those questions during the whole time, much to my regret. The second part of the anime especially seemed lackluster whereas there is no proper ending given to the anime, since the manga is much longer than the anime. Also one of my regret is that ""Zipang"" skipped the crimes of war committed by the Japanese imperial army whereas it was a major aspect of WWII and it definitely could have been interesting to confront the current Japanese identity and its' past one.  Art: the art was rather OK, especially considering the time this anime was released, the style of the character is rather serious which fit with the tone of the anime through they somewhat look similar, the sea and the imperial navy are really well depicted. The animation was also a good point of the anime and the people passionated by the war of the pacific will enjoy the battle scenes.  Soundtrack: I admit i don't have clear memory of the OST since i've watched this anime quite a long time ago, but the Mirai battle theme is among my favorite anime OST and definitely fit with a particular scene making it really epic.  Characters: The weak point of the story, just like the story they have a rather superficial development which could have been much better. The crew of the Mirai always seems to be without strong personality and their decisions are often childish and lacks proper reflexion from the beginning to the end. Some historical characters are introduced, Isoroku Yamamoto especially which is by far the most interesting character with the lt Kusaka.  To conclude, as a friend of mine said, this anime could really have been a masterpiece, but actually failed to be one primarily because the lack of depth of the anime. While not a bad anime it is just a rather average one and could deserve the curiosity of the watcher since the topic is quite an original one.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zipang;animegorey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animegorey;6;I watched it for the war type battle scenes. Although there weren't many (for a 26 ep series), they were well done and accurate. As one who watched military docudrama growing up, I've seen a few dogfights and bombing flights. Zipang does a good job depicting the ships and planes in combat. I watched subtitled version and did kinda give up on story after a while. It was pretty good from what I did see, but subtitles lost me. Maybe I would score dub version higher, but it was too expensive and this collection was alot cheaper. I was afraid it would get boring and it did. Boredom is boredom in any language. Animation quality was good and characters were good and easy to like.

Story: 6/10 Although the story ends without a proper ending like the Manga, the world of Zipang is large and very detailed. It highlights many different historic figures and locations of interest during World War II. However, the story progress occurs repetitively where the crew of Mirai underestimate how people during World War II would respond to their 21st century destroyer. In the story, Mirai constantly keeps a passive stance which results in several casualties and damages of their own crew and ship - where the general consensus was to ensure safety to the crew. Also, at this point the general consensus was to prevent meddling into historic affairs yet the MC Kadomatsu went ahead and shared historic information with an axis lieutenant and let him walk free despite explicitly saying he'd need to stay on board Mirai. There are many plot holes or change of focus such as preventing historic meddling or ensuring crew safety which makes Mirai's logic redundant. As this occurred the story lost touch and spiraled into a chaotic domino effect as soon as Kusaka left the Mirai. The story is pretty interesting but it was logically challenging.  Art & Sound: 6/10 2004 art style was pretty detailed and surprisingly had nice CGI aircraft and battleship models. The animation wasn't fully there but it's to be expected of an ancient relic of a show. It still somewhat rivals current day equivalent in visuals such as GATE or Outbreak Company.  Sound was ok, I couldn't help but notice the suspenseful music play every time MC gets involved with Kusaka, it's like a foreshadow of him being a ticking time bomb risking everything to prevent war - even spilling historic and military secrets to convince the superiors.  Character: 6/10 The Mirai characters had realistic personalities as people from the 21st century, they have logical approaches but it doesn't help them on board a powerful ship in the middle of war. They are intentionally risky which leads to their demise especially MC Kodamatsu who, in order to develop the plot went against his crew to release an Imperial Japanese soldier back into Imperial Japan. The characters from the historic world are all arrogant, an intentional development as they are all in the midst of a dangerous war. This makes their personalities shallow because we know that they will call all Mirai's attacks bluffs and suffer in the end.  Overall: 6/10 I wish for the series to get a remaster. Watching it in 2021, it does have a sense of nostalgia in terms of tech and historical elements. If this were to get a remaster it could have a better chance at development. Zipang's ending hasn't been adapted but it is a controversial topic if adapted in the current day. The story and characters were pretty basic in development but the visuals was probably the main attraction of the show.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zipang;weeb_me_daddy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/weeb_me_daddy;4;Basically the movie Final Countdown but in anime and worse. Just like final countdown it's just bullshit propaganda. The anime talks about a 21st century's JSDF destroyer leaving the port for training exercises and encountering some sort of anomaly that sends them back in time to 1942 year (Yes it's a copy of the final countdown but the author didn't give the movie any credits). This was when WW2 is still on the way. when Japan were in a war against USA. Some people start saying some bullshit that the single destroyer could change the course of the war which is dumb. Only idiots that know jack shit about military strategy and logistics will say that. If you want to know more check out this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=474RR1ETgyk (and if a supercarrier group struggles to do so, you could imagine what kind of weed this author is smoking thinking that the single aegis destroyer could do much impact).;Not Recommended
0;Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band;DanielaQm;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DanielaQm;6;I really don't understand the other references about this movie, in my opinion it didn't seem like a bad story, in some way it was a fun and interesting story to spend the time. I really liked the design of the characters, the scenery, the animation and especially the music. I didn't know that this movie was made to promote a band, however I think it wasn't bad, they knew how to develop a simple, unfunny, but not boring story, so that's why my score isn't so low. Don't expect to see character development in a one hour promotional story, it's a simple and goofy story and it's okay to watch if you have nothing to do and want to listen to good music.;Recommended
0;Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band;delta5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/delta5;5;While Ziggy isn't exactly good, it deserves attention from those who have a taste for the kind of wild, anything goes type of anime that was easily available in the 80s/early 90s OVA scene. The plot's absurd, the characters are barely developed, and the animation is mediocre, but who cares? You get to watch a Japanese hair metal band run around London, play bad songs, and clear themselves of murder charges! The film contains some unintentional comedy at its finest and deserves a viewing (preferably after a few drinks).  There are a lot of great moments in Ziggy just waiting for well-deserved mockery, like the band playing an impromptu concert while on the run from the police, and a hilariously sexist and clueless scene where the members of an all-female punk-ish band giggle around in the kitchen, happily cooking a big meal for the all-male members of Ziggy and some assorted British punk dudes. You will also learn, again and again and again, about how important it is to never stop rockin'.  To be fair, the people in charge of this production weren't completely deluded into thinking an audience would hail this fiasco as being great art. Once you learn why Ziggy's been framed for murder, it's pretty clear that the whole movie's just meant to be a joke. The big reveal is genuinely hilarious and in the best tradition of campy films featuring rock bands. There's an aerial battle that takes absurdity to new levels, and plenty of other deliberately ludicrous moments leading to the grand finale.  I had a lot of fun watching this little gem and definitely recommend it for a certain kind of anime fan. Ziggy is never dull. You'll be laughing (or at least cringing) all the way through. Just don't expect it to be anything more than what it is: an obscure bit of anime that manages to entertain despite itself.;Mixed Feelings
1;Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band;megafat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megafat;5;"Ziggy: Soreyuke! R&R Band follows Japanese rock Ziggy as they come to London for a recording session, only to find themselves getting attacked by a group of men as the arrive at the hotel. The musicians barely escape with their lives, but soon find out that their producer has been murdered, and they are the suspects. Chased by the police and a mysterious organization who has murdered their producer, they soon find shelter at a local rockers' place.  And that mysterious organization? The Nazis. That's right, the Nazis are back and want to take over over the world, but this time they want to take over the world through popular music. I know that this is technically a spoiler, but would you even be paying attention if not for the twist being that hilariously contrived? And to top it all off, the anime has members of Ziggy working with a cop from Scotland Yard who pilots an old World War II plane to attack a Nazi zeppelin to save another member of the band and to try and stop the Nazis.  Now, to pull it back a bit so that I don't oversell this OVA, you have to approach this with moderate expectations. As awesome as that premise is for something, it's still not as memorably crazy or over-the-top as some other anime is, like Angel Cop or Mad Bull 34, but I'd argue that in some ways that's better. Sometimes being that over the top is tiring, so seeing something like this being a lot more low key can be a bit more enjoyable to some extent.  But considering that the anime's plot is just an excuse to get the whole OVA going and the music being front and center of the whole thing, it's pretty obvious that this was meant to to push the soundtrack that was being heavily featured throughout the whole thing, with the songs being features prominently in the credits.  And that's because this was a promotional piece for the real world Japanese rock band Ziggy. But for those who aren't in the know, who exactly are Ziggy?  Ziggy was and still kinda is (more on that later) a blues rock/hard rock band that was founded in Morishige Juichi in 1984. Throughout the years, the bands line-up has been constantly changing, with multiple members joining, leaving, and rejoining the band.  In the year 2000, they changed their name to ""SNAKE HIP SHAKES"" and released a few albums under than name, but they eventually changed it back to ""ZIGGY"" in 2003. In 2008, the band announced an indefinite hiatus and have only come back for short periods of time in 2010 and 2014, with 2014 being Ziggy's 30th anniversary.  The TL;DR read version of it is that this 70 minute OVA was nothing but a promotional piece to put on store shelves to promote the band that it was designed around.  The band members didn't even voice the characters in the anime, but I suppose that's because either the band was touring at the time, it would have been too expensive, or the band members either couldn't be bothered to do the voices for the anime or knew that actors would have been a better choice.  And this wasn't the only anime to feature the music of Ziggy, with the long-running anime Detective Conan/Case Closed featuring other songs by Ziggy, including ""Happy End"" and ""Step by Step"".  Ziggy is an anime that not only could have been made in the 80s, with it's cheesy ""Take down the man with the power of heart and music"" plot and silly soundtrack, but it could have only been made during the Japanese bubble economy where Japan was having an exponential economic growth, which, coincidentally, would pop the year after the released of this anime.  And while it's nothing more than a way to sell people on the band, it still enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, it's not some hidden classic, but it is a mildly amusing romp with a silly plot solely meant to get people to buy more CDs, but it was fun seeing some random 80s band take down the Nazis.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zi Chuan: Yincang Hudong Ju;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;These episodes are all supplemental to the main story. Other than the first arc (first 2 episodes) almost all the others require the main story to be understood at all. Therefore, instead of a review, I will list when each episode of this supplement should be watched. -Arc 1 (episode 1 + 2): after episode 2. -Arc 2 (episode 3 + 4): after episode 5. -Arc 3 (episode 5): after episode 10. -Arc 4 (episode 6): after episode 12. -Arc 5 (episode 7): after episode 21. -Arc 6 (episode 8): after episode 32. -Arc 7 (episode 9): after episode 41. There is probably no meaning in watching these without the main story. But these episodes do well in expanding on things mentioned in the story and building characters that are not yet important to the story (season 1), but will be important later.;Recommended
0;Zi Chuan;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;"Before I start my review, I want to point out that even though this donghua is tagged as action and fantasy, the fantasy elements stop only at the fact that demons and demi-humans exist (with some wuxia/martial art elements mixed in), and the action is good but not a focus. So if you are here purely to see action or heavy fantasy elements, this is not for you.  Now onto the review: This review will have some spoilers to this and will evaluate this work as an adaptation of its source material (novel). I will give it an adaptation score based on how closely it follows the novel and a score on how well it tells a story through the medium of donghua.  The story of Zichuan follows the life of 3 brothers, Di Lin, Sterling, and Zichuan Xiu (Zichuan Xiu being the main MC of the story), as they fight for the country. The first 1/3 of the story focuses on the attempted coup and its suppression with the help of the three brothers. Because of their philosophies and actions, they are rewarded differently, with 2 rising in power and Zichuan Xiu being ""punished"". The remainder of the covers the wars/battles that are the fallout caused by the attempted coup.  The donghua does a good job with its exposition, so that new viewers can get a good general understanding of the plot. However, it is very difficult to understand many of the intricacies and finer details because it is too difficult to show in animated format. This donghua, in my opinion, is so much more enjoyable if you have read the novel. Another criticism of this donghua is that there seems to be misplaced humor and its somewhat disjointed (tangental) stories. This is because some attempt has been made to include the signature comedy that the novel that made it popular, and introduce characters that are important and relevant in future seasons (but not so currently). This results in some awkward moments and can cause confusion. Last but not least, I recommend reading the ""side story"" review and watching the ""side stories"" since they are important, but not required to enjoy this fully.  As an adaptation, I think this donghua does a good job. There have been quite a few changes, but the overall story is the same. Unfortunately, the story/plot is too pack, complex, and detailed for it the studio to cram it into 42 episodes, so some sacrifices had to be made. There are also changes to introduce more characters, like Liufeng Shuang who is not that important in this season but is very important later in the story, or to give more importance to others, like Zichuang Ning (a side character whose existence many of the MC's decisions revolve around). The comedic side of the novel has also been simplified and cut, since most of it was immersion-breaking. Overall, despite the changes, I think this adaptation did a good job in telling the story to new viewers (those who have never read the novel before), though there are many details that can be understood only if you've read the novel. Having read the novel will definitely boost enjoyment. Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 7/10";Recommended
0;Zhu Xian;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua is an adaptation of a popular web novel that I have read, so I will review this as an individual work and as an adaptation.  General plot summary: The story follows Xiao Fan, an ordinary villager child turned cultivator, due to events in his childhood. Xiao Fan was an ordinary child living in a village close to the leader of the just(or righteous) sects: QingYun Sect. One day, an old monk passes by the village and is attacked by an unknown assailant. Xiao Fan, who was asked to send him food, witnesses the fight and is knocked out. Though the monk successfully forces the assailant to retreat, he is seriously injured and forced to take the ""three day guaranteed death pill""; this pill restores his strength temporarily but he is now guaranteed to die in 3 days. Now on his death bed, he comes up with a crazy idea to fulfill his lifelong dream. He will teach the Buddhist cultivation technique to Xiao Fan and have him join the QingYun Sect so that he can unlock the secrets the monk has been pursuing (cultivation techniques are the most guarded secrets of this world). Xiao Fan after learning the Buddhist technique is knocked out and wakes up to find his village massacred. The survivors (Xiao Fan and another) is taken to QingYun sect as orphans and thus raised as cultivators. Xiao Fan, a stubborn and unyielding to a fault individual, is raised with black & white values regarding justice/righteousness vs evil, until he starts to wander the world. Then he learns that the world is not as morally black & white as he once thought, as he interacts with a variety of different people. This story could be considered Xiao Fan's journey or life story.  The themes of this story revolves around justice/righteousness vs evil and moral ambiguity, brought to life through Xiao Fan's life story. The plot is reasonable paced and the character models are good. The action is a bit hit or miss though, most of the 1v1 scenes are great, the camera angles are just perfect, the choreography is smooth and on-point, but some of the group fights are really bad, feel slow and have a weak impact. However, this donghua is much deeper than what you see on the surface. Another person said that ""the devil is in the details"", to which I agree. The character interactions, mannerisms etc, matter just as much as much of the narration. It is a story where you have to pay attention to subtleties as well. If you do start to watch this, I suggest you at least watch it to the end.  Now as an adaptation(may contain spoilers as I compare novel to donghua): As an adaptation, I felt that it was well-done, though not exactly perfect. I had 3 main complaints about this adaptation: the explanation regarding Xiao Fan's weapon, the removed world building strengthening the theme of moral ambiguity, and Lu Xueqi's presentation/buildup. First, with regards to Xiao Fan's weapon, they never really explained in detail its influence on him. Because he was sentimental, he ended up keeping the Blood-sucking pearl which later got blood refined with the soul-devouring staff to form his weapon. Since these two were extremely evil weapons, they influenced his mind, but because he cultivated the Buddhist technique, the effects were mitigated unless he had emotional swings. Overall not super important, but his use of it for justice/righteousness highlights the moral ambiguity theme and ties into the second point. Second, while the donghua did a decent job showcasing/debating the moral ambiguity between just vs. evil, they left out much of the back story. The just vs evil debate has been around for 100's of years and slowly changed over time. The most obvious examples were Xiao Fan's weapon, a blood-refined weapon created by merging 2 of the most evil weapons to exist now being used by the just faction and the fan being used by an evil faction member (fan was originally a weapon of a renowned neutral-just leaning figure). The final complaint I have is the portrayal of Lu Xueqi. --First, Lu Xueqi was supposed to be extremely beautiful, but her design is very plain, even the Senior Sister Tian Ling'er overshadowed her; I can only attribute this to her way of dress, and hopefully the design shown in the Season 2 concept art shows a more beautiful Lu Xueqi. --Second, Lu Xueqi's development was really weak. She was originally portrayed as cold and aloof, only showing some interest in Xiao Fan after his loss to her. This action confused her sparking her interest in him. Afterward, the most crucial part in building their subtle relationship, the fight against the evil sect in the cave, to falling into the abyss, to the subsequent fight against the serpent were all core events laid the foundation for her love for him, but these were severely simplified or poorly presented so the build up in their relationship has a weak foundation. Lu Xueqi's ""goodwill"" (not yet love) for him stems from her perception/understanding (read: interpreted from her worldview) of his actions; she basically rationalized the reasons for him helping her, you could say she made some wrong assumptions that led to her eventual affection for him. This all started with why she believed he ""voluntarily forfeited"" his match against her; then his ""suicide charge"" to save her when she was captured by the whip-using girl. The final ""nail in the coffin"" for the buildup is after they two were swept into the abyss. This scene was heavily modified by the donghua team. In essence, the two fell down into a pool of water, Xiao Fan wakes up first and pulls her out and stands guard until she wakes up. While Xiao Fan is more injured, his weapon's blood-suck ability helped alleviate his wounds so he's more healthy in a sense. Once she wakes up, they try to leave together; Xiao Fan's weapon is the natural enemy of the vengeful spirits that surround them so they are kept at bay. It's not until he falls unconscious that Lu Xueqi ""realizes"" how much effort he put in to protect her. She comes to the conclusion that Xiao Fan could have abandoned her and survived, but she ended up burdening him, deepening her ""goodwill"" towards him. They also encounter at least two monsters which Xiao Fan does most of the work to defeat, while Lu Xueqi keeps piling on injuries. TLDR, they severely weakened the buildup of Lu Xueqi's ""goodwill""/affection towards Xiao Fan. Her buildup is ""the devil in the details"", but when the details are removed, there isn't much left.  Despite these complaints, the adaptation was very faithful to the source. The last episode was a beautiful climax/portrayal of that scene. Adaptation score (how faithful to the source): 8/10";Recommended

Story progress was very basic with unresolved small tensions and no world building beyond the sect. Characters look promising but again not much character development either except a few developing friendships without much emotions and bonding so far. Cultivation levels and powers/sword skills are not clearly explained and MC's upper hand over others with higher cultivation is not much explained either. MC doesn't use much knowledge from his past lives either or maybe he does but it's not explained. Whole season is lacking in fight scenes even when they happen they are very dissappointing, Sword techniques all look the same, just have different random names to sound cool. I am hoping next season will improve on these things, but so far not really watch worthy. Is a 4/5 rating but giving 6 for good animation quality and future potential.;Mixed Feelings

0;Zhen Hun Jie: Bei Luo Shi Men Pian Part 2;Mnemease;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mnemease;7;Zhen Hun Jie, also known as Rakshasa Street, is an anime adaptation of a manhua by the same name. As with any other adaptation, the producers tread a fine line between taking artistic liberties and staying faithful to the source material.  Preamble: (some background for confused anime watchers)  If you are reading this review, you were likely attracted to this series through the huge success of Season 1, which presented a unique Yin-Yang style of storytelling which showcased the deep bond between two brothers. Season 1 was hugely experimental, but it was successful in that it retained the basic feel of the manhua, while adding more depth of emotion through flashbacks, new characters, and the cutting of some unnecessary details from the manhua. It was successful precisely because it adapted the single weakest arc from the source material (in which the author Xu Chen was still developing his style and trying to gain popularity), and made certain strategic changes that, while being somewhat controversial in the manhua community, were generally well received in light of the anime’s overall success.  It was in this atmosphere of success that Zhen Hun Jie Season 2 Part 1 was announced. Both anime-onlys and manhua-readers had high hopes for the series, and it certainly seemed to be living up to expectations. While the excessive CGI for fight scenes was a little off-putting, I think most watchers would agree that the general flow of the story in the first two episodes was definitely on par with Season 1. The anime-onlys were pleased by the new setting and story, while the manhua-readers were curious to see how the removed details that were supposed to be in Season 1 would be added to enhance Season 2. What nobody expected, however, was an abrupt break after only 5 episodes of the series, and the return of a Remake (or Part 2) that baffled everybody.  This, Zhen Hun Jie: Bei Luo Shi Men Pian Part 2, is that Remake of Part 1. The first three episodes are entirely old content, which presents a condensed version of Part 1. Episode 4 marks the point where the director gave up halfway through his original draft and decided “screw it, I’m out of good story ideas, let’s just go back to faithfully rendering every frame of the original manhua.” Whether that is in response to disillusioned manhua readers who grew displeased with the development of the story in Part 1, or whether it was due to something else entirely, I do not know. In the review below, I will focus on my thoughts on the quality of the remake, and what I personally think could have been done differently.  Body: (actual review starts here)  Story 6/10 - If the first arc of Rakshasa Street showcased the bond between “blood brothers”, then this second arc develops that tension to “found family”. The story is action-packed, with good inclusion of flashback scenes for emotion building and conflict/intrigue to entice the viewer into wanting more. If you look at the first 3 episodes alone or the last 6 episodes alone, they would both be solid 7-8/10. However, the problem arises in that the initial 3 episodes have very little to do with the remaining episodes. Because while the initial episodes showcase anime-original content, the later episodes are entirely verbatim from the manhua, and the resulting plot holes that come out of the discontinuity are TERRIBLY explained.  Art 7/10 - Similar to the story, the art style of the first 3 episodes is very different from the remaining episodes. Personally, I actually enjoyed the later art style better because it is more faithful to the manhua that I originally fell in love with. I also think it was a good choice to ditch the 3D animation, because while it was very flashy, it was overly distracting. The animation suffers a bit from budget limitations, as there is decent proportion of resting/panning shots in which the only thing that distinguishes the anime from a PowerPoint presentation is a single set of moving lips or a few strands of flowing hair. However, I think given the difficulty of the adaptation, the animators did a fairly decent job.  Sound 6/10 - The sound is a bit of hit-and-miss. While there are some moments where I thought “wow, the BGM is an amazing fit for the action”, there are other parts where I cringed at the choice. The producers recycled the original three theme songs from Season 1 to use for Season 2, which I thought was a good choice since they convey the right motifs of “baddassery”, “melancholy”, and “the journey continues”, respectively. I was less impressed by the other musical inserts, because they were a very strange blend of eastern and western music that just don’t go coherently together. In one scene, you would get a cover of “Silent Night”, a classic Christmas carol, while in the following scene you would get an OST taken straight from the 1997 version of the Monkey King. Normally, I would not be so picky about the sound, but since it is the one thing that could easily be changed to unify two otherwise completely disjoint segments of animation and storytelling, I cannot help but be disappointed by the lack of attention to detail in this matter.  Character 7/10 - In terms of main characters, I personally love Bei Luo Shi Men. He’s a great character with a well developed backstory and clearly explained motives. I also like Cao Yan Bing for his bravery and pigheadedness. Xia Ling is the only main character I never felt much for, but she gets some character development here that makes her easier to tolerate. Unfortunately, the character development was not treated well due to the random addition and subtraction of plot points, which means I can’t give more than 7/10 in this category. There’s also the issue of the “Guardian Spirits” not having enough screen time outside of fight scenes which makes them seem more like mecha robots than dead historical figures...but that is another can of worms. Does anybody else feel like this season turned into Three Kingdoms x Evangelion?  Enjoyment 7/10 - Overall, I think I enjoyed this season. While it suffered from numerous problems, it ended on a strong note that makes me hopeful for Season 3. If you are reading this review and have yet to watch the series, I recommend reading chapters 1-26 of the manhua first before starting Part 2. A lot of the abrupt changes will make more sense, and you can get a relatively enjoyable experience.  Overall: (concluding rant)  As a faithful manhua adaptation, the second half of Season 2 is strong and enjoyable. As an anime-original, the first half of Season 2 has its merits. However, blended together, the two halves just DO NOT go well together. The character I feel the most sorry for is Bai Shuier, who was given a horrendous treatment due to having two conflicting backstories that imposed dissociative identity disorder on an individual who already has enough mental trauma on her plate.  I really believe what would have made this season so much stronger was to remake the entirety of the Bei Luo arc. Not too much was changed in Season 1, which the director could have easily explained in half an episode AT THE BEGINNING of the arc. Then they could have gotten away with doing a full faithful manhua adaptation from that point forward with limited problems and I wouldn’t have to write such a huge review just to establish the context of everything I’m talking about.  Hopefully you found this review to be decently informative. Thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts on the matter.;Recommended
0;Zhen Hun Jie;8hachiman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/8hachiman;8;Well this is the first Chinese anime I have watched and I have to say despite of not being used to hearing Chinese I found this anime very intriguing and I’d say any person who loves some good storyline, this feels and action packed anime is worth a shot.  Before getting deeper into the review I would like to clear some points: 1. Yes it is a Chinese anime so getting used to the voice would be difficult. 2. After the first episode the rest are on an average 11 minutes long but don’t let the episode length dissuade you, the anime offers a good quality content.  Now since it’s my first review I’ll be as concise as possible, I would say the story is still a diamond in making, also the plot development and the way the story has been portrayed will keep you intrigued throughout the series. Yes, the Chinese will throw you off a bit or maybe a lot but don’t give up on it because the story will compensate for it. The animation will also need some getting used to as it sometimes dwells into the 3D animation in some of the fight scenes where the CGI doesn’t gel well with the 2D animation. The action sequences might give you a little bit cringe for not being very well detailed but the overall artwork is considerably good. The opening and closing tracks are good with music tracks fitting well with the fight sequences. Also you might find the translations a bit off sometimes but despite the language barrier the story will get through.  To sum it up I’ll say keeping aside the language cringe and bit of disappointment on the animation which might be probably due to not much funding the anime is worth giving a shot as I’m sure you’d find the plot very intriguing and the character development very well done.;Recommended
1;Zhen Hun Jie;Ajay_sachin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ajay_sachin;9;Finding this anime was sheer luck, took a blind call to check it out. being Chinese, the language was hard to follow but nonetheless i was hooked immediately. First time I've tried a chinese anime.  I loved the story telling, the emotions weren't too intense but quite gripping. The animation and the music are superb. I've found something that has great action and a really cool plot. The characters are developed nicely and are quite relate able. After completing it, I was craving for another season as the ending is pretty well balanced leading to such diverse plot moving on. All in all Loved it. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great plot with action and great music.;Recommended
2;Zhen Hun Jie;numbersixes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/numbersixes;8;Zhen Hun Jie (Rakshasa Street) retaught me the meaning of ugly crying. If you have to watch a Chinese/Korean anime series for the Anime Watching Challenge, take a chance on this one, honest.  Story: 8 for Very Good.  As was said, the episodes are short but the story still progresses, with a plot and a sub-plot that are both engaging. Both with twists, both easy to understand with a bit of thought.  Art: 6 for Fair.  Nothing too memorable. The 3D and 2D animation together: that needed some work.  Sound: 8 for Very Good.  Giving this an 8 for the soundtrack. I loved the music, especially through the title sequences. It really makes the anime and the tone.  Character: 7 for Good.  I feel like everyone was pretty three-dimensional. The characters are able to recognize their own flaws and each others'. The brothers shone here: lovely characters, especially Yanbing (I'm pretty sure that's his name.)  I didn't like the design for the evil spirits. They looked like robots and I didn't get that at all.  Enjoyment: 7 for Good.  I did enjoy watching this one. Most of the time, I was engaged.  Overall: 8 for Very Good.  Basically, the story is a good one. The animation needs some work but if they're working on a small budget then that's anticipated. I recommend this series and I'm glad I watched it.;Recommended
3;Zhen Hun Jie;Tyiriel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyiriel;8;"Zhen Hun Jie (Rakshasa Street) is a chinese Anime with its' source material (Manhua) still publishing. Since this show is chinese, the speech can be a letdown due to not understanding ANYTHING other than the subtitles (If you're not a chinese speaker)  Story: 8 A plane of existence where spirits of the dead go before they ...""ascend""? into ""Ghostdom"" exists, and the place where the story takes place in this plane is called Rakshasa Street. The story and plot development in the show are divided into 2 different parts, ""current"" and past, where the past shows the brother-duo's past and struggles to the point where the older brother became the general of Rakshasa Street. The ""current"" part which would be considered to be the actual main plot follows a woman and the 2 brothers, where he woman after an introduction gets hunted by an organization who are after a power hidden within her. The show has 24 episodes, but only about 250 minutes of actual screentime, and this hurts the plot development speed quite a bit, since only about 140+- of those minutes are focused on the ""main plot"" while the rest is backstory, making it feel a bit slow at times. Another problem with the main story is that due to time limitations and the very elaborate explanations given throughout the show, the plot doesn't reach its' end, this is a show that needs a 2nd season in order to flex it's muscles, and the ending hints that it might be produced in the future. Apart from these problems listed above, it's a good and well elaborated plot which actually contains a number of good plot twists and you can't guess exactly what will happen in the end - it keeps you interested as to what will happen.  Art: 7 The art in this show uses both 2d and CGI, and mixes them at times. There are very good moments of quality animation but also quite a bit of letdowns. A good example of the letdowns are the ""generic soldier"" enemies, as well as the hyper sped-up movements at times. Some character expressions are done very well and the show is consistent with both its' good animation as well as bad animation. There is not much more to be said, it's not too generic, it's not too good, but it's certainly not bad.  Sound: 9 Here I have a couple of things to mention, and it's partly BIAS to my preference. The OP/ED track is very catchy, fits the show like a glove. praise. The same can be said about the soundtracks for battle etc. They fit the tone the show sets in the moments they are played. As for voice actors, they have their ups and downs - especially since they are chinese and I have no long previous experience with chinese voice actors. The baby voice in the early stages is despicable, the main characters sound ""normal"" and the baddies have unique voices, fitting for baddies. There is also a small nitpicky problem with our girlie MC at times - there is a bit of static noise that can be heard at certain points with the microphone. I usually say that: Story sets the ""reachable level"" of the series, Art quality with help of good voice acting can make the show reach the level the story sets and a well written character can push the story beyond it's potential. However the sound quality and soundtracks is what you remember of the show after you watch it. This is true when it comes to this show, Both the story, art, character and voice acting are fairly in-line with eachother, but if I hear the first 5 seconds of the OP in a year I will know that it is from this show. I mentioned the word ""Praise"" earlier, and this was not an understatement. The OP/ED only needs a few great catchy seconds in the beginning for you to remember it.  Characters: 8 Without spoilers, some things will get left out. We have a generic superhero MC, a generic weak MC with hidden powers as well as superhero's brother who is quite strong himself. I'm not sure which of these to regard as the real MC, but it doesn't really matter. Our superhero MC acts tough from the start, but we later get to know that he's mostly just acting, and everything he teaches and scolds our lil girl MC for are things that he himself has had to experience or had problems with in the past. The girlie MC has to learn to become strong in her heart and not rely on others for everything, however hard it might be. Good development throughout the show for these characters. Our villains are a bit of a mix, we have our generic villain and his army as well as the more fleshed out backstory villain and his guardian spirit, who actually defies his master in secret due to his master becoming more and more dishonorable and wicked throughout the story.  Enjoyment: 10 I watched this show in just about 5.5 hours, and it was worth the time. The main plot is pretty generic compared to other action/supernatural japanese animations but the execution is done very well, and it remembers its place as to how powerful a character is and the limits to what can be done in terms of villainous scheming. There are no superpowers that are not explained thoroughly and according to the ""laws of the storyworld"" nothing actually breaks them, and nothing is explained a minute before the MC gets some kind of superpower. In other words - It's not a generic shounen where the author had no more ideas and chose to 3rd level Bankai his way to safety. All the objects are already is place (some are obscured) way in advance of the actual events that happen.  Overall 8: Good show, can definitely recommend if you can live with chinese voices.";Recommended
4;Zhen Hun Jie;bloodbird;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bloodbird;8;Rakshasa Street is a Chinese anime that many will consider to be a Shonen and is about a street that serves as a place of residence for spirits of the dead. Each street is protected from evil spirits by a human General that has the power to summon spirit general guardians from Chinese history.  Story: The show is actually split into two parts: Yin and Yang. Yang describes the journey of female protagonist Xia Ling as she discovers Rakshasa Street and finds her spirit guardian with the help of current General Cao Yanbing. The Yin part portrays the backstory of the Cao brothers. The two parts alternate with one another so sometimes the transition can be a bit disruptive. The Yin part does a better job in terms of pacing while the Yang half suffers from repeated dialogue and filler comedy. However, the later episodes does a good job at piecing the two parts together. Unfortunately, because each episode is only around 10 minutes, the show sometimes does not have room to fully flesh out the story. For example, I would have liked to learn more about the world and the backstories of the spirit guardians. Given that there is a second season, it's possible these may be explored more then. Nevertheless, the show is hard to put down due to the excellent character development.  Art: Word on the street is that the show had a relatively small budget and this can sometimes be evident. The animation is not always fluid and there is a good bit of scene recycling or stills. However, there were a few scenes where the animation was superb and shows how much Chinese animation has come along. The 3D fight scenes look a bit out of place and do not mesh well with the usual 2D scenes. The 3D by itself can be bad (sometimes to the point that it's funny) and the transition can be fairly jarring. Character designs, unfortunately, were a bit of a letdown especially when it came to the enemies. While the main characters have distinct enough designs, the enemy minions / evil spirits all share the same design so it's often difficult to tell them apart.  Sound: The soundtrack has a a good number of memorable pieces and the pieces, in general, are very well done. I've really enjoyed the opening piece where flames rampage through the streets to form the title of the show. The background music does a good job of setting the mood for the scene but it does only that. It's not synchronized that well with the scenes so while it's there to amplify the mood, it's not completely one with the scene.  On the other hand, the voice-acting is decent. For the most part, the voices fit the characters. I think Xia Ling's voice is the only one that doesn't quite fit. Sometimes the pitch of her voice fluctuates so you think she's being voiced by multiple people instead. On the other hand, a shoutout needs to be given to the voice actor for Xu Chu, who I think has had the best performance.  Characters: All of the characters undergo a decent amount of character development. Xia Ling goes from someone that always relies on others to someone that can now work towards her goals independently. Meanwhile, Yanbing realizes that his current world is too small and needs to start his journey as well. Everyone is able to recognize their own and each other's flaws and overcome them in their own way.  Overall: The best part of the show is it's attention to detail. Without revealing too much, the show sets itself up for a decent plot twist near the end. However, viewers should be able to figure out the twist if they pay attention to the various hints dropped throughout the show, from the voice acting to the art, and I've enjoyed the thought the writers have put into this. Overall, this show has proved to be an enjoyable ride and I'll be looking forward to the next season.;Recommended
5;Zhen Hun Jie;chase2011;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chase2011;9;I personally loved this show. I would advice this for anyone who is willing to give a chinese anime a chance.  Story: 9 The story was outstanding, not only did it tell two stories but was blended together superbly. One episode was of the present time and as we learn about he characters and what drives them now, we also get another episode of years before and saw them develop to what they are now. It did not feel forced nor did it feel out of place. It was a smooth transition and I was looking forward to each episode to learn more of their past as well as what's happening in the present. Otherwise the story is rather simple, does not get too complex but for sure had a great storytelling aspect to it.  Art: 6 The art was nothing great nor was it displeasing to the eye. It is a chinese anime and today's standards it wont be anything above sub-par. It does have some CGI scenes that I wasnt too thrilled about but, it didnt take away the enjoyment of the show for myself.  Sound: 6 Copy past what I said about the art for the sound. Nothing outstanding, but neither is it bad.  Character: 9 I really liked how they developed the characters the way they had. You get to understand the sibling's feelings due to the way the show paces itself. It took time to develop it's characters splendidly and did not miss a step in doing so. The show really has only a handful of characters that the viewers get to see but they try to really make you understand them. Well mostly with the exception of two people. But I am happy they did not try to go into detail about a couple side characters due to this story being about the hardships of the siblings and really tried to bring them to life to the viewers.  Enjoyment: 10 One of the very few anime's that I actually did not get bored at any moment. i sat here watching and loving every minute of it. When I watch a great anime there are always those filler moments or downtimes that makes me feel like I just need to grind through it. Alas with this show I had not felt any of these moments. Maybe because they were telling two stories at once, or its because they are mostly 13 minute episodes either way I loved it!  Overall:8.5 - 9 Worth a watch for sure, its getting a second season so it did something right. Again though, if you are not into chinese anime dont watch it, if you are able to get by the different language and the lower grade art/sound that we have been having the pleasure in experiencing as of late then you will be in for a treat. Where the show lacks n the eye candy, they make up in the heart of the material. Found this on a chance and happy I did!;Recommended
6;Zhen Hun Jie;mr-mooster;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mr-mooster;8;This was my first Chinese anime. I watched it for my 2018 Anime Watching Challenge and I am glad I picked it.  Rakshasa Street follows two different story lines. On the odd numbered episodes, it follows the story of Xia Ling and Yanbing. Yanbing is a Spirit Host, which means he has a Guardian Spirit protecting him. Xia Ling finds out she is a Spirit Host too, and with the help of Yanbing and his brother, Xiao Liang, she begins to learn how to control her Guardian Spirit.  The even-numbered episodes take place in the past and follow the lives of Yanbing and Xiao Liang when they were children. It tells the story of how Yanbing becomes the Requiem General of their home.  Rakshasa Street has a lot of backstory and world-building involved, but it does a great job of breaking it down into the short 11min episodes. I particularly liked that the storylines alternated. There is a very good twist in the story. I feel that if the episodes were chronological, it would not have gone as well as it did. The story is the strong point of Rakshasa street. It's interesting and compelling in some areas and it can be rather emotional. It covers brotherly love and forgiveness as well.  The characters, however, can be kind of one-dimensional. They cover a few tropes. Yanbing is the cranky teacher. Xia Ling is a stubborn student. Xiao Liang is a wise prodigey. Throughout the show, you will come to understand why Yanbing is so cranky and why Xiao Liang is wise. Xia Ling can be annoying.  The animation shifts between good and alright. There is digital animation and CGI. The CG is usually reserved to large fight scenes when many characters need to be animated. For the most part, it's not CG. The character designs are interesting, but there is a little too much family resemblence between Yanbing and Xiao Liang. They are practically identical, especially during the arc when they are children. A change in hair style would be sufficient. My favorite character designs are all the different Guardian Spritis in the show. Some have very traditional Chinese elements and some look like hideous monsters.  Overall, Rakshasa Street was an interesting show. The ending hints to a second season, which I will definitely be watching.;Recommended
7;Zhen Hun Jie;CrocMagnum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CrocMagnum;8;"I’m almost speechless. It’s been a long time since I last watched such a worthy Shonen. At first glance Rakshasa Street, also known as Zhen Hun Jie, appears to be your basic Supernatural show (a la Bleach or D.Gray-man). But they’re a few quirks that make this anime stand out from the crowd.  Story/Character: The title of the anime, Rakshasa Street, is quite misleading. Indeed in Hindu mythology “Rakshasa” are creatures comparable to demons in Christian beliefs. Thing is: this anime has nothing to do with demons, the show is more about “Spirits” actually. Between The Human World and the Spirit World they’re transition areas where Spirits can wait to be dispatched later on to “Ghostdom”. These transition areas are called Requiem Streets. Each Requiem Street has a watchman guarding it from evil spirits. One of these watchmen, Cao Yan Bing, is the General of Rakshasa Street. To help him in this task he can summon a fearsome guardian spirit: Xu Chu. Cao Yan Bing can also count on his brother, Cao Xiao Liang, to keep Rakshasa Street safe. There is a strong bond between those 2. This is due to their troubled past, the brothers have been through a lot during their childhood. To reflect this Rakshasa Street alternates between Past and Present episodes to unfold its story, a one of a kind story I might add. Despite the fact that the anime is somewhat short (24 Episodes, each one around 10 min length, except for the first and the last one which are standard 25 min) the anime is very hard to put down. This is due to the quality of the story, the succession between Past/Present (known as Yin/Yang Episodes) and the excellent character development. These features will keep you begging for more. Also please note that the first episode is a mixed bag. It’s not bad per se but from Ep 2 and on the anime gets SO MUCH better.  Animation: Well this is the main beef. You see Rakshasa Street is a small-budget anime. As far as I’m concerned the animation is decent (above average that is) except when the animators switch to 3D CGIs! In those rare instances the animation is plain ugly, quite reminiscent of the pathetic inlays that were so common during the early days of Animation (almost 1997 meh-quality to give you an idea). This is the kind of jarring transition that can turn off the casual viewer making him think he’s watching a worthless piece of junk. This is not the case let me assure you. And considering the animators had such a tight budget to work on I can be quite lenient about it. Because the animators still succeeded in making a mesmerizing anime.  Soundtrack: the music of Rakshasa Street is fantastic. This is the kind of OST that grows on you and ends on you music player, 'nuff said. The anime rocks on its own but the music turns it into a real piece of badassery. The memorable music magnifies the epic scenes of the anime (and they are quite a few of these in Rakshasa Street).  Language: Rakshasa Street is the vanguard of these new Chinese animes trying to make a foray worldwide. So the anime is dubbed in Chinese. At first I thought I needed a few episodes to adjust to the new language. Surprisingly only a few minutes were needed before I could get accustomed to these new accents/intonations.  Conclusion: If you look past the few ugly 3D CGIs and the somewhat subpar first episode, Rakshasa Street is a memorable show. The gripping story, the badass soundtrack and the refreshing Chinese historical references thrown into the mix make Rakshasa Street stand out from your random Shonen of the week. Single-handedly this show succeeded in reigniting my passion for Shonens. Highly recommended.  note: a second season has been announced for April 2018. Saying I’m pumped up for this S2 is the understatement of the century. ;D  Edit 2020: So finally 5 episodes are available for Season 2 right now. This delay has apparently nothing to with the current health situation. It's just that they have decided to divide S2 into 2 batches. The second batch has been announced for this Summer. Also ""L² Studio"" plans to improve the first episodes of S2 (better animation probably).";Recommended
8;Zhen Hun Jie;Injenss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Injenss;9;What an unexpectedly fantastic anime! I had never heard of this before, and just decided to randomly watch it and ended up binging the entire thing in one sitting. It's a 3D Chinese anime, so perhaps that's why its not as popular as it should've been, I don't know, but it was absolutely fantastic and should be more well known.  The story surrounds the bond of two brothers who grow up through hardships to fulfill their destiny of protecting Rakshasa Street from evil spirits and outside enemies. In the first half of the anime, they do a fantastic job of making you care about the brothers and the bond they have through it all. In the second half, they are dedicated to swerving the hell out of you as the viewer, and twists are incredible. It goes from tear jerking to jaw dropping throughout the entire series. They add the humor through Xia Ling, a semi-air head who the brother's have to protect for certain reasons.  The story is far and away the best aspect of this anime, which brings humor, drama, and action together in a near perfect blend.  However, the anime isn't without its flaws. Mainly in the 3D animation parts, which is usually where the action was happening. There's no getting around it, the 3D animation here was absolutely atrocious. Like straight out the 90s. Fortunately, the entire anime wasn't created in that style. In addition, due to the events of the anime, one of the brothers becomes a bit annoying, which kind of drags on the later episodes, but the story more than makes up for it in the end.  This anime was an unexpected gem and I definitely think anyone who likes drama and action will enjoy it.  Story: 10 Art: 4 Sound: 7 Character: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Overall: 9;Recommended
9;Zhen Hun Jie;Daoren;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daoren;8;"I've just finished the first season, because I know the second season should be airing now/soon. Well, let's start with the (not too) 'negative' aspects.  CHARACTERS (6/7). Judging the characters is a bit difficult. I think the two brothers, that are the main male leads have a well defined personality; their choices and their opinions are coherent with their psychological evolution. The spirit guardians are also nicely scripted, and they have a sense of loyalty that makes me fell the historical Chinese warrior-lord relationship and which makes them more interesting than some narcissistic/stubborn/selfish servants of the Fate series (but I don't want to compare them cause I love the Fate franchise and they are different things, it's just something I was thinking right now). It would be a 7 for them. What I didn't like is the villain and the female lead. I'm not going to spoiler, let me just say that I think the villain has a bit of a cliche-personality, that could have been more acceptable IF there had been a deeper psychological analysis or development (like their relationship with their guardian spirit). The female lead is also a cliche and she disappointed me. Since in several occasions they pointed out her idea of gender as an obstacle to find her place in society etc, I was expecting a development of the character; instead, in the end she is literally useless. I understand that she is new to this world, but even her dialogue make her seem like a complete idiot. I mean, c'mon, give her something interesting to say...she has only a passive role of running away, being treated as a nanny, being scolded, repeating what others tell her. She literally doesn't have a personality. For these last reasons, I would give 6 to the characters.  ART (7) cannot compete with most recent Japanese productions, but it has nothing to be ashamed of compared to some American and French productions that have been aired on European TV channels. It is not my first donghua and, considering the current stage of development of the Chinese donghua market, this is a full 7 for me. 2D animation is absolutely enjoyable, but some fighting scenes switch to a cheap 3D animation, that kinda ruins the mood. But, again, overall this is a good product.  SOUNDTRACK (9). I want to talk about the ost right after ART because the soundtrack is what made a lot of lower quality scenes enjoyable and powerful. I am really sensitive towards good soundtracks. I have to recognize it: I think I heard only 5 pieces throughout the donghua and they were perfect for the scene and helped setting the pace of many fights. The opening is short and gave me this 'yeah, let's rock and be strong together'-vibe. The ending is also well played and I love the integration of a few traditional opera notes.  STORY (8). I can't say too much, because I want to avoid spoilers, but the last episodes set some turning points and reveal some unexpected truths that bring the plot to the next level, transforming an otherwise good but banal action in something a bit more intriguing.  ENJOYMENT (8). I binge-watched it in three days during my lunch and dinner breaks from studying. It has been really entertaining and 'light' . The episodes are shorter than the usual 20 minutes ep, so you really want to go on to know what happens next. After the first episodes, the pace gets better and the past-present narration keeps your attention and interest high.  OVERALL? I would use a 9 if I were being listening to my personal tastes and to the feelings I have after the last few episodes about the past (who knows will know), as well as to my recent desire to get to know Chinese donghua better, trying to be open-minded with cheap products or ONAs, and to the freshness this anime gave me. But, summing up all the marks I gave before and trying to be more objective, I would say an 8 is a fair grade.  Sorry, that's my first review and I'm not good at being brief...Hope it was helpful! Bye bye!";Recommended
0;Zhen Hun Jie;B-O-D;https://myanimelist.net/profile/B-O-D;6;As much as I had seen generic good v bad, big brother protects little brother animes, etc, hadn't seen an idea in this format.  The idea of an evergrowing set of streets containing unprocessed ghosts with basically nowhere to go. It just felt very strange, very Christian purgatory for me, waiting to be judged.  I hated the way the show unravels itself of showing basically one episode when they were young, then one when older as it spoiled that feel I enjoy when watching an anime, and put me off quite a lot. For those especially who break up how they watch anime even more so.  I also wasn't keen on the idea people could screw around with spirits with no real consequence from some greater body. It felt like the head of the street would keep order but if they never and generated massive problems, nothing happened.  The stories are different, the characters are not the most in-depth, you don't really learn much about the enemies of the requiem streets, You don't even know why some people die is the reality. It just felt like a story with a few holes in it.  I liked the idea though that no matter what in life and death, whichever way you go, someone is trying to take advantage of it, as we know is the way of living. I liked how it was told, and the normal world unless psychic couldn't see. Animation, sound, period drama was great, and i paid attention to watching instead of half turning off like with some animes.;Mixed Feelings

This time it is centered around a different protagonist, who was framed for his father's murder in a conspiracy to wipe out the ""Canal Gang"" which he commands. The story in this movie is good, but not quite as compelling as the previous season. That said, the movie more than makes up for this with the plethora of great fight scenes throughout the film, the entire film is almost nonstop action.  The visuals and animation are as good as the previous season. The fight scenes are all very exciting, with fluid animation and great choreography. Although I generally prefer 2D over CGI, this show does a good job with its CGI. The CGI is really essential for making the fight scenes as good as they are.";Recommended

It has a very smooth animation while fighting but in other scenes, it lacks in some aspects.

1;Zhen Dao Ge;shiroiyume;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shiroiyume;9;I accidentally found this gem donghua and binged it in one sitting. The style of animation is 2.5D (3D cel shaded). The art style take some getting used to due to the coarse drawing style, but if you've seen the likes of The Kingdom S1, Kengan Asura and can adapt to it, you should give this a try. The action scene in this show blew me away.  The story and plot is 'seemingly' simple and straightforward, every episode the MC fights through each opponent as he trace to the mastermind for his final revenge. At the beginning of each episode is a little bit of the past reveal.  The soundtrack, bgm, OP and ED are all very well done and matches the 'Jianghu' theme well.  The reason I call this a gem is because the action is one of the best I've seen in donghua (and anime) in this decade. If you enjoy watching martial arts fight, the choreography, sound effects, and directing will astound you. You can almost feel the blast and impact in every punch and kick, in every clash of weapons. The fight is very fast pace yet every move can be seen clearly. You would think the fight gets boring but each opponent the MC face is different, you have sword fights, spear fights, fist fights, bamboo fights. each one is breathtaking.  Produced by a small animation studio, you can feel the passion and dedication they pour into this project.  I highly recommend this. A kind soul translated it properly in English, so you don't have to worry about nonsensical MTL subtitles. Just google for it.;Recommended
2;Zhen Dao Ge;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;7;"Zhen Dao Ge explores the Chinese idiom ""When you seek revenge dig two graves"". H  He Fangzhi, the son of a government official tries to seek revenge for the massacre of his entire family 13 years ago. His journey begins at his former servant's bar in the Gobi desert where he kills everyone involved.  Story: 6/10 The story has a lot of promise, it sets the story by showing glimpse of He Fangzhi's past and memories from his past instead of dishing it out in the beginning. We see the beginning of his journey at the bar in the Gobi desert. The story is fairly interesting but the fight scenes are a bit boring because He Fangzhi struggles for 5min and then at the end of the fight he kills his enemies and moves on to the next.  Art & Sound: 7/10 The art style and animation during fights is very close to Kengan Ashura. It's not the prettiest or detailed but it does hold well in fast paced action as does the art style in kengan Ashura. However, it does make viewers shy away from this series.  The only memorable sound related aspect in this series was the ending song which was played throughout the sad moments of the series. It is soft yet resilient with the tone of this story.  Character: 7/10 Character design wasn't too bad. The characters fighting against He Fangzhi were mysterious to deepen the significance of his revenge all to build up and come crashing down as he comes to reality with his past. The characters that He Fangzhi leaves behind on his path of revenge also give a sense of growth as we also question the possibility of history repeating itself and a never ending spiral of revenge to ensue in season 2.  Overall: 7/10 It's a pretty decent watch. The characters left a bit to be desired in terms of background and depth of personality instead of killing them and they reveal hints.";Recommended
0;Zhanguo Fan;chacharoux;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chacharoux;5;So, I just finished this anime (if we can call it anime) and I do not know what to think of this anime ... firstly because I do not understand Chinese and it is not translated into English. And I noticed that the episodes were released in record time (1 day for 5 episodes).  Let's start with the story, it goes very slowly ( some key characters are present in episode 10!) and if you succeed in finishing this anime you will be disappointed or surprised by the end.  Then talk about the art, euuh it's interesting,this is in C.G.I but this is really bad... And the opening OMG...They had a promising storyboard until the episode 9 but afer that they put a horrible opening in C.G.I ...  For the characters had no development, nothing. There are characters who appear, disappear and I don't why .  In the end, I enjoyed this anime because of the music (the musique of the opening was really nice) and it is a beginner studio (he has only 2 anime in his library). So if you have time to waste go watch this ! but if you are looking for a real good time don't watch this ...;Mixed Feelings
0;Zhan Qiannian;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;"This donghua is an adaptation of the manhua ZhanGuo QianNian published by Bilibili.  Plot summary: The MC is a gaming streamer, likely a top-player as well, of a wuxia martial arts game. After recieving a bracelet modeled after an ingame item (believing it is for him to promote/advertise) he is sent isekai into the game world. He arrives in an alternate timeline China, where the assassination of the Qin Emperor prevented the unification of China and led to the continued war until the ""modern"" time. The MC uses the bracelet (artifact) and cultivates to live and rise up in this world.  The setting can be considered a mix of Japanese isekai and Chinese cultivation stories. The MC does have a cheat, but not a OP broken cheat right off the bat. Instead he has to work/use his cheat to strengthen himself. Since it is in the historical fantasy genre, you can expect similar setting, presentation, speech and drama of historical dramas. Expect the more gradiose/long-winded political debates, cross class romance, romantic drama, etc. Intermixed is some decent comedy. The plot so far is not too deep, but we can clearly see there are things going on in the background that is being built up.  The character models and art is good. The animation quality is also high; it is a bit childish, but that's fine. There are quite a few characters who will probably be main contributors to the plot, though most of the focus for now is on the MC as he gets stronger. This Season 1 can be could be considered a prologue to the story.  If you like historical fantasy drama or cultivation type works, this is a good watch. I would recommend it.  Now as an adaptation, this donghua is probably the closest I have ever seen to a ""perfect"" adaptation. One of the reasons for this is because the original work is a manhua, which has much more manuveurability in it's plot than a novel. Novels tend to require prioritization because of how detailed it can be, while manhuas have looser plots and require readers to ""fill in the holes"". That said, there are some noticable changes to the donghua plot. Part of it involves introducing certain characters eariler to build them up as an antagionist, quick recoveries from injuries to spare resources on animation. There does appear to be some details and dialogue left out that suggested the ""awakening"" that happened at the end. All the other changes made the plot develop more smoothly so they were all considered good changes.  By the way, the donghua adapts manhua chapters 1-39.  Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 8/10";Recommended
0;Zettai Shounen;Halo_s_Maze;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Halo_s_Maze;8;I don't write reviews, but this show only has one short review so I feel inclined to do my part.  Zettai Shonen is an anime that stays away from a lot of the normal conventions found in anime with the label of supernatural. The pace is much slower and more heavily focuses on the characters than the supernatural event itself. Ultimately I would say that the focus is on how each character internalizes and acts on the odd things that are going on around them.  The story is broken down into two arcs. The first arc is the summer arc and the main character is a middle school boy named Aizawa Ayumu who is visiting the tiny town of Tana for the summer. The second arc called the winter arc,takes place in Yokohama and the story shifts ahead a year and a half. Also a new main character is introduced, Tanigawa Kisa. A girl who is considered an outsider among her peers. In both halves of the show, weird creatures have begun to show up and cause confusion and mild chaos.  STORY: 8  This story is heavily driven by character development, however the plot is there pushing the character's in a general direction. If you're looking for a story that delves deeply into the occult or the science of aliens than this is not the series for you. All of the supernatural events are shrouded in mystery and give off a feeling of long ago fairytale or folklore. Nothing is ever concretely explained what you are handed by the director is all that you will get.  The story moves slowly and things take awhile to develop. It doesn't necessarily take long for weird events to start occurring in the show, it's just that the development and progression of these events is not rushed. To find enjoyment in this show you have to like these characters, because outside of the characters there isn't much else for the viewer to grip onto. The upside is their are plenty of characters all of them vastly different from each other and playing out a different roll in the show.  It's not the most complicated or quickly paced story I've ever experienced, but if you give it enough time it grips you. With time you'll find yourself caring more for what is happening around the awesome cast, the story amps up the supernatural eventually until the plot seems nearly as important as the turmoil that the characters are facing.  CHARACTER: 9  The characters are the driving force of the show they are the breath by which this show breathes. Yes this is a story about odd occurences, but the important part of Zettai Shonen is how the individual characters react and change in concurrence with the strange things happening around them.  The characters in this show are strong and dynamic, they all change and grow and learn. The development of the individuals in this show feels more slice of life than anything. In fact it wouldn't be ridiculous to call this show a slice of life with a little mystery and supernatural events thrown in. There are many different people in both arcs and none of them completely abide by the typical anime stereotypes. The characters are the heart of this anime and where this story shines. You can see the motives and reasons for all of the characters actions, they don't do unnecessary things, and they react as you would expect normal people too.  I found myself falling in-love with many of the characters, especially with the residents of Tana, like Miyama Miku and Unno Shione. They were interesting and dynamic, so even as the plot dragged by slowly I could count on the interactions between the characters to keep me interested.  This is the show's strongest aspect by far, at least in the summer arc. In the winter arc I found that I was slightly more drawn to the supernatural events occurring around the cast.  ART: 7  The art style isn't exactly typical, but it isn't radical either. The way the characters are drawn is hard to put into words exactly, but it's very child like even kiddy, however I thought the style suited the show. The background scenes were nice, but didn't dwarf the characters or whatever events were occurring in the story. My only complaint is the CGI used for the creatures, it stuck out a lot in certain scenes where it was used. It could possibly have been done on purpose to highlight the other worldliness of the creatures that disrupt the town of Tana and Yokohama, but for me I would be engrossed in some scene when suddenly I'm pulled from the moment by a very harsh CGI image thrown into the mix. With time though it grew on me.  SOUND: 7  The music used for this show was appropriate, I really like the ending theme song too. They had this one repeating chorus that they used throughout the show, it helped build up a sense of familiarity and was usually placed in situations that were similar to each other or reminiscent to something else that had happened. As if the music is helping connect all the interrelated dots. The reused chorus is really light and unobtrusive so it doesn't get annoying after repeated use. At times I didn't even realize it was playing till it ended.  The music isn't epic, but then again neither is the show however it worked perfectly and never took away from the rest of the anime.  ENJOYMENT: 9  I enjoyed this show immensely by the time I finished it. However when I started I was only mildly interested, I had to keep going despite the slow pace, and eventually the characters caught my interest, and shortly afterward the plot did too. I loved the slow and dreamy pace and the overall lack of urgency despite the events that were occurring. It vaguely gives me the same feeling that Natsume Yuujinchou gives me, except it's not as melancholy and doesn't emphasize nature or the elements.  OVERALL: 8  I give this show a solid eight, I really liked it from top to bottom, the art style is a little young-looking, if I can describe it as such. At first glance it doesn't look like much, but it really delivers if you're willing to give it a real chance.  You have to be willing to sit down and watch three or four episodes before you can even begin to understand or appreciate this anime. It's not a show for those looking for action or even romance. Really I want to compare it to Haibane Renmei, in that there is a story, but the nitty gritty of the story isn't the most important aspect.  If you have time on your hands and want something that is very character driven almost slice of life like, but with a little more flesh, then Zettai Shonen is a great anime to pick up.;Recommended
1;Zettai Shounen;windkirby;https://myanimelist.net/profile/windkirby;10;"I'm writing a review in an attempt to express my feelings on an anime I feel few have heard of. Zettai Shonen is in my opinion a masterpiece of storytelling and is my favorite anime/tv show of all time.  The guidelines say not to summarize, but I'll give my take in this paragraph if anyone is interested: The story is split into two halves. The first deals with a city boy spending a summer in a small, somewhat boring town, quiet but for the constant, tremulous calls of cicadas, but the summer becomes more interesting when supernatural occurrences begin to take place. In the second half, we are taken to a city in the winter to follow a reclusive girl who has stopped going to school, whose life also changes due to similar supernatural events. The two arcs are related but loosely.  The story is not ambitious or complex, and it is actually this simplicity that lends it such strength. The conflicts are small, perhaps even microscopic; but in the attention to minutiae I perceive such a deep love for the characters that I've rarely if ever seen matched in another visual storytelling work of art. I actually do not like supernatural events in animes I watch and prefer slice-of-life; however, the supernatural blends so well with the day-to-day that it doesn't feel like a gimmick or a ploy to keep you interested. Instead, the characters interact authentically with these happenings in a way that deepens your perception of them, rather than distracting you from them for the sake of a showy plot.  The story-telling is slow. Don't watch if you are looking for revelatory twists, sabotage, or some slow build-up leading to a fantastic climax where all the questions are answered. The twists are more ""hmm"" than ""aha!"", there are no grand schemes, and the climaxes come, but again, they are focused more on the characters than on the universal ramifications. We're not here to scientifically chart out something new but to just spend some time with some individuals.  With that said, I will state that the characters are somehow a bit simple in their depth. They are SO un-distracted in pursuing their personal truths that they don't seem like people you would actually run into on the street. Watching I felt almost as if I was getting to see humans who were more human than actual humans, due to the busy chaos of how life goes. But that's more of a pleasure than a complaint.  The art and sound are somewhat marked by the time the anime was made, though I personally like it that way. They seem old-fashioned but still beautiful. Even though the rural setting of the first arc is more naturally arresting in my opinion than the city setting, the team has a way of making even the crowded metropolis seem humanized and rightful in its existence.  I feel there really isn't a drop of hate, fear, or outlandishness in this anime. I suppose the closest it comes to outlandish are the supernatural child characters, which I forgive them for. As for hatred, the characters can be quite cruel--don't get me wrong. But it is the patience the anime has for these characters, somehow even supporting these cruelties, and its inclusiveness of them as a part of life, that make me feel as though the anime reveres the human experience like no other I've seen.  I'm sure I haven't done the anime justice, or perhaps I've soured its qualities by speaking too highly of them. If I've exaggerated what it is, that's my mistake. But I truly believe it is an anime worth watching--certainly not for everyone, but perhaps for some, even worth watching again and again. If you are in the market for a slow-paced anime to chill you out or perhaps get you to think about things you don't always have time to think about, I recommend Zettai Shonen. In its embrace of the mundane, it is a character-driven powerhouse.";Recommended
2;Zettai Shounen;trzr23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trzr23;9;"Once in a while, we see Slice of Life shows that are incredibly slow paced and are heavily atmospheric. These shows have a pretty static setting and allow you to dive into their world. I like to call these shows Slice of Nothing shows, simply because there's not a lot happening that actually contributes to the plot's development. Zettai Shonen is a slice of nothing show that slipped under the radar when it aired and never really saw the light of day. Which is a shame really, because it was a breath of fresh air and off the beaten track.  Zettai Shonen is an anime about Ayumu, a guy who moves to his Dad's (yes, the mythical species known as normal fathers exist in this anime) house in Tana. He spends his days exploring the countryside and meeting the local residents. However, he soon realizes that things aren't quite as normal as they seem. Mysterious objects that look like tiny UFOs start to appear all over the place and seem to have a special affinity for Ayumu. There is also a second arc, which focuses on another protagonist, this time a girl called Kisa. She too attracts these UFOs. Slowly, the two teenagers start to wonder what these things are and why they're attracted ti them. All they know is that it has something to do with their dark and murky past.  First and foremost, I have to warn you. This anime is slow. Incredibly slow. Its buildup is even slower than Goku charging a Spirit Bomb...and trust me, that is slow. There's almost no action and hardly any movement. Generally, it may be a bad thing in case of other anime, but it works out really well in the case of Zettai Shonen. The plot isn't really moving forward, but the atmosphere feels so...atmospheric! It just has these melancholic undertones with an air of mystery around - an experience not too unlike Haibane Renmei or Ghost Hound. It's one of the most unique features of the anime.  And I say most because this anime stands out from the rest for many of the quirky little things it does. Let's start with the realistic and down-to-earth characters.  Despite what the title of the anime says, this anime isn't really much of a shonen. The guy doesn't have any superpowers, the women don't give him any (neither are they cliched tsunderes) and the side characters don't fit into any particular TVTrope either. The supporting cast is bland, but hey, rather bland than annoying (read: Any random Hana Kanazawa character), right?  Ayumu, the main character of the first arc isn't really the most charismatic or lively guy you're going to see. To be frank, he has the emotional range of a tea-spoon. But again, he fits well into the Zettai Shonen niche of being a low key and mellow anime. Kisa is a pleasantly creepy girl whose anti-social side has gotten the better of her. And no, she is not his childhood friend. Her character is something like a mix of Yuki Nagato (of Haruhi Suzumiya franchise) and Moeka (of Stein;s Gate). The thing is, all these characters have this rustic charm to them and seem to grow on you.  One of the things I really liked was how the interactions between the characters shaped the story moving forward. The conversations were normal and weren't blown up or exaggerated. For example, most anime contain this scene where the protagonist is talking intimately with the female lead and suddenly an adult walks in and they jump, scream and fumble all about ""I-It's all a misunderstanding!"". See how neatly Zettai Shonen does it (video at 4:20).  The animation too, is funky. It's drawn like a childish cartoon, with very little detailing. You'll also notice immediately the heavy usage of still frames. They're gonna have one picture and move slowly across it and probably repeat the footage in another episode as well. The studio probably knew this anime wasn't gonna sell a lot of DVDs...and they were right. This anime comes from Genco, the studio that's produced some of the best Slice of Life anime in the past decade such as Nodame Cantable, Kino's Journey and Honey & Clover.  Zettai Shonen is a mystery and supernatural blend that works out really well. The two arcs come together nicely and while the show doesn't really explain much, it hardly matters, because it's a case where the journey matters more than the destination. Although I described this anime as a Slice of Nothing anime, it's not that there's completely nothing in terms of plot, it's just that there's relatively less action even by a SoL anime's standards.  Overall, this is an anime you have to be patient with. And if you are, it rewards with you some of the most gripping story telling you'll ever see. If you're looking for an anime that's off the beaten track with a really spellbinding atmosphere, then this show's the real deal. It's calm, yet compelling. A definite recommendation for fans of Haibane Renmei, Dennou Coil and Ghost Hound.";Recommended
3;Zettai Shounen;underMebius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/underMebius;8;I'm writing a review, yet again.  The story is pretty simple really, people got involve with the spirits sprites in the Summer Arc (Ayumu), and the evil sprites in the Winter Arc (Kisa). If I got the information all wrong, sorry, because I didn't wacthed this on youtube. 8/10  The art is pretty good. Zettai Shounen's artwork is kinda like Kamichu, but with slight weaker animated thingimajig. Oh with 3-D. 9/10  Sound? Well, you get to hear a lot of it, and yet, I'm not impressed. For an anime that doesn't 'talk much', the backround music kinda irks me. The dub where i 've watched it? They've improve it. 7/10  The characters doesn't give themselves much histroy, but it's enought to understand. 9/10  Enjoyment, is really good, it ups points if you watch it at dawn, where the sky is dark (Not at night, that's a good way to watch horror series.) BUT, I don't recommend you watching this anime by force. It's really broing unless you have nothing else to do. Those who wat to watch it, cannot stay for more than a few episodes, you should have a strong will of heart if your watching this online. (There's a big difference on your attention span between TV and Online, so if this is broadcasted on your local station. WATCH IT.) 9/10  Overall, well I have nothing to say except, the only real excitement here is on episode 17. (or was it 18?) 8/10;Recommended
4;Zettai Shounen;Bishounen_Hunter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bishounen_Hunter;8;Zettai Shonen is the type of anime you might only want to watch if you find yourself needing to take a break from watching whatever type of anime you normally do watch. Otherwise if you pick this title with the same level of expectation you would have for your favorite anime then you might be in for a let-down. Still, it's pretty far from what I would call un-watchable or a “bad anime.” Zettai Shonen is a quirky, slow-paced, sci-fi/fantasy anime series that's a little bit off the beaten path. If you are in the mood for something quirky and different then pick this show, if not then stick to safer territory and the titles you normally like.  Simplistic, Children-style art. It has a very Pokemon/Digimon look except the color palette is different and a bit more sophisticated...tho, not much. Most children's shows tend to use overly bright, explosive colors which can be a bit distracting so I can understand the choice of colors! Still, Zettai Shonen does very much has a very simple aesthetic appearance overall, everything had a very bold outline and there was not a lot of detail is given to any particular object except the “Material Fairies” and “Material Evils” which have a lot of little lights and such. The art isn't cheap-looking or anything and it's not like it's an older anime series or that they didn't have any money. I have a feeling this was a deliberately chosen style which does work for this show.  Both the OP and ED music were good, the ED might have been a little better since it was just as unusual as the series. I watched this show in the original Japanese since it was a fansub version...I don't think I would have watched this show in English though because it has to do with Japanese superstitions and such. And I've started to discover that a lot of the shows that deal with superstition and cultural folklore are better off in their original languages, This show is no different. Also the voice acting was great just as it is in the original Japanese language, if this was dubbed in English I think that they might have ruined it with voices that are too high pitched and overly emotional. Zettai Shonen isn't supposed to be like that.  This is a very slow-paced story that doesn't ever fully unfold.....ever. Do not look for extreme action, do not look for overt explanations and plot lines, do not look for logical conclusions. I don't think Zettai Shonen intended to define whether it's all about aliens, monsters, fairies or spirits so there was not special focus on any of that, it's more about the human interaction between the characters and also how they each reacted to as well as interpreted the increasingly recurring phenomena.  My favorite character would be the main guy name Ayumu, a soft-spoken, introspective sort of fellow. He doesn't really like a lot of attention or drama and often prefers to be by himself [very much like me in that way.] Although he's not the first character to witness the weird occurrences in the rural Japanese town when he visits his father, he's the only one that pursues the investigation with a reserved, self-reliance that does not bring any undue attention to himself. I love Wakkun because of his voice, Sakakura I love because he has very intense eyes and he may be a beefy jock-type but he's very perceptive and devoted. Lastly I love Kisa, the girl in the 2nd half of the series that loves reptiles. She is like Ayumu in that she is also a loner, though I guess the correct term for her would be outcast, she also doesn't have the same kind of quiet strength that Ayumu has. She is rather fragile, but not as fragile as people think.  Overall not a bad show. Again, I would recommend this only as a break from the norm. This series is like reading a book, there's a lot of attention to detail for things other shows would have found inconsequential. But the things that you want pointed out to you or the things that require a more detailed explanation are only mildly inferred or subtly defined so therefore, you are more or less left to draw your own conclusions.;Recommended
0;Zettai Shounen;EarthPotato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EarthPotato;3;"This anime feels like a shitty game. This is mainly due to the slow progress of the main plot and the boring length side quest that I give 0 fuck. There's only like 20% of the main quest and the other 80% is filled with shitty side quest that are unskippable.  I'm not saying the whole anime are shit, the first arc is good because it feels like the main quest and side quest were moving along side each other so you don't feel that much of gap on the story going on. It slowly reveal the main mystery going on in the anime while showing the surrounding character lifestyle.  The second arc feels like it's a crazy ass shit filler. It take like 8-9 episode on this shitty ass romance bullshit going on between these 4 main characters that I hate. It's the typical childhood cliche shit where there is 1 girl like the dude, and the dude like the other girl, and the other girl like nobody, and then there's this 1 outsider group loved 1 of the childhood friend. Damn this arc is so stressful that it ruined the series for me. The main story for the second arc is on the last 4 episode or so. It reveals the ""truth"" on the mystery part. The story balance is way off for the second arc.  I would say that the ratio for the first arc feels like 10% main and 10% side story. Second arc is 10% main and 70% side story. The anime should've ended on the first arc.";Not Recommended
0;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;10;"Every April 1st, I spotlight a heartwarming anime with a special place in my heart. Last year, I covered the wonderful family film Shoujo Ramune. A film where we learned the lesson to choose ice cream over frozen yogurt, because some yogurt isn't even yummy at all! This year I'm covering ""Master of Martial Hearts"", which is the greatest magical girl anime you've never heard of! Move over Doremi, there's a new sheriff in town!  Why you should watch Master of Martial Hearts:  1. The characters. Simply put, Aya is one of the loveable and well developed characters in the medium. However, great characters can't exist in isolation. Even Don Quixote needed Sancho Panza. In Master of Martial Hearts, we get to see the astoundingly realistic family life of Aya and her mother Suzuko. The relationship between these two just blows past the mother/daughter relationship in Beast Player Erin. This is family drama on the level of Yi Yi and Tokyo Story.  2. Funimation is well known for their high moral standards. That's why they chose to dub, mass distribute, and continue to stream this series. Anime has a reputation for being lewd and sexist, but Master of Martial Hearts finally gets the portrayal of women right! This belongs in the pantheon of high brow, feminist anime along with Nana, Rose of Versailles, and Utena.  3. The art. My GOD the art is just beautiful. I wouldn't expect anything less from the esteemed Studio Arms. A studio most well known for their excellent biographies of prominent 19th century intellectuals including Wordsworth and Gauss. With titles like that, you KNOW it means quality! What other studio would have the artistic merit to make biographies of William Wordsworth and Carl Friedrich Gauss?!  4. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but this is hands down one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen in a visual medium. The ending is so clever it makes your jaw hit the floor, but then you feel mad at yourself for not guessing it. The clues were all cleverly laid down all along! When the big reveal happened, I stood and applauded ecstatically for 3 minutes! This is the best ending I've seen since the 1973 film The Sting!  If you have friends that turn their noses up at anime and say it's trash culture, you MUST show them Master of Martial Hearts! Not Lain. Not Texhnolyze, not even Galactic Heroes. FUCK that shit! You show them Master of Martial Hearts and they will immediately apologize for ever questioning your tastes!";Recommended
1;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;RealityEX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RealityEX;7;Just a review I felt like writing because I thought a lot of other reviews left out some details. For starters, this review is meant to give people a general impression of the anime and whether or not they should watch it. I have been surprised from all of these action-ecchi anime series that Funimation has licensed recently, but I guess people out of Japan have started to take a liking to these genres. Watch this show in whichever language makes you more able to comprehend the story. I viewed the anime in English dub so I could catch more of the vocal connotations.  Story: The plot revolves around Aya Iseshima, a high school junior, who is dragged into a “Martial Hearts” tournament one day. Yes, by dragged, I mean Aya pretty much has to participate in a life-or-death situation since she justifies her use of martial arts as self-defense. Aya has to battle other very stereotypically dressed anime girls to obtain this martial heart capable of granting any wish. The initial premise should be familiar to almost everyone who has seen anime like Fate/Stay Night.  Since the anime revolves around Aya’s perspective most of the time, many technical details are left out in the beginning, such as who sponsors the event or why only females have to fight it out like this. Although this lack of context kept me in suspense about the real plot, it nonetheless oversimplified procedures and made the anime very predictable in the beginning. In other words, don't expect the plot to be innovative.  Now, a big problem comes with the anime’s direction. On the surface, the anime seems to appeal to guys who enjoy watching women’s clothes ripping off during fight scenes. That is, expect a lot of unnecessary fan service. However, the actual fight scenes are often brief, spanning only a few minutes at best in an episode. A large portion of the anime is spent on the drama and transition events, such as Aya lamenting over the consequences of her actions or trying to find out why her opponent has to fight.  In general, the shifts may confuse viewers because they don’t really know whether to treat the anime as more serious or comical, especially with the stereotypical costumes and battle moves during the fights. It’s like the anime staff wants you to like all this fan service but still feel guilty about it as a morally responsible human being. Thus, the drama does not complement the anime's action scenes very well.  This anime also has the issue of length. Spanning only 5 episodes, the story really doesn’t allow much time for multiple character developments. You’re expected to know how each character is related when they are first introduced, and the story pretty much goes from there. Therefore, you might have a hard time sympathizing with some of the characters, especially when it comes to situations when you're clearly suppose to feel sorry for them. For example, you're suppose to believe that Aya's friendship with a character you meet in the first episode is reason enough for her to risk her life.  If you can’t come to like any of the characters, that makes appreciating the drama in this anime rather difficult. Things might have been more clear if the anime was extended so proper character introductions could be made and the fight scenes given more detail. It just often seems unrealistic when the staff spends so much time emphasizing how important each contestant feels about winning and yet each fighter gets beaten in a few punches.  In addition, the length of the series makes episode 5 a bit hard to swallow for most viewers. I had to watch the episode more than once to fully grasp its meaning. The staff jammed way too much information in one episode, since the anime had so many plot holes to cover. The lack of transition scenes can make the ending appear rather distorted to viewers, which is understandable. I could tell that the staff members were attempting to make the plot seem simple at first but gradually grow more complicated. The only advice I can really give for this factor is to pace yourself when watching the anime to minimize information overload.  Art: In my opinion, this is probably the weakest category in this anime. The art style is your usual pretty girl look, and the female bodies are given a mature appearance to enhance the appeal of the many boob and panty shots. Seeing as how this anime is based off of a visual novel, you would expect the art to be gorgeous, but this is sadly not the case. There was obviously a budget issue. For one thing, the characters hardly look the way they are portrayed on the cover advertisements for this anime. Whoever was in charge of character designs in the show probably didn't care very much.  Furthermore, the animation is often very limited. You’ll often see only a few frames associated with individual facial expressions and movements. Some of the scenes were quite ridiculous, like the flight attendant’s handbag assault in episode 1. The bag was clearly heavy enough to dent a solid wall, yet the woman suffered no recoil. This obviously violates conservation of momentum and demonstrates how the staff lacked an understanding of fundamental physics. But I suppose this is anime humor in its own right. Other fight scenes tend to look rather jerky and fake, and female bodies are sometimes shown out of proportion when the camera angle shifts. At the very least, special effects like explosions, rain, and obstacles are inserted in the right places.  Sound: There’s nothing too radical in the sound and music department for this anime. The opening is upbeat and cheerful to fit the action genre of the series, while the ending is more melancholic to fit the drama category of the show. The OP can get annoying somewhat, but you can always skip it at will. Music of the proper mood is thankfully inserted during important scenes of the anime, although they can get slightly repetitive. Most of it, once again, is used to enhance the drama that is centered around Aya. However, don't expect anything groundbreaking.  Character: There’s pretty much a large variety of stereotypical female characters you would find in a ecchi anime, like the shrine maiden, nurse, and police officer. The characters certainly act like the way they should in those uniforms, which tends to add some comic relief because it’s just plain hilarious to see people out of context like that duke it out. Besides the costumes’ intent for fan service, it also seems like an easy attempt from the staff to try to differentiate characters in order to make them more memorable. This is reasonable because there's really little time for development in these other characters, so you pretty much have to stick with what you see on the surface here.  Aya seems like the only one whose background was explored in-depth somewhat, although this isn’t a surprise since the story revolves mainly around her. You’re often forced to interpret her past through brief flashbacks and subtle gestures she takes towards certain events, at least before the final episode. One thing I liked about her was her humanistic reactions to her situations, like how the Martial Heart tournament sounded really ridiculous at first or how there would be consequences for others if she continued fighting. Aya's determined but naive personality will certainly be a mixed bag for most viewers.  Enjoyment: To get the most out of this anime, you pretty much have to appreciate both the hilariously bad fight scenes and the emo drama scenes. It’s not something most people can do for this anime, especially since this series is so compressed. You’ll just have to keep an open mind and try to place yourself in Aya's shoes, particularly as the series progresses. For many of the poor aspects discussed above, it might be a good idea to treat them as more amusement from the anime.  Overall: I somewhat enjoyed this anime since I was able to bring myself to like the drama centered around Aya, even though such a story element is overused by now. The action scenes weren’t particularly the best, but they were still rather funny from being random and out of place at times. I especially liked the plot twist towards the end even if it was a bit rushed. For those of you interested in watching, pace yourself and try not to focus solely on the comical fan-service part of the anime if you want to get something out of it.;Recommended
2;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;someone173;https://myanimelist.net/profile/someone173;10;In this world, there exist all kinds of anime. There are good ones, bad ones, as well as REALLY bad ones. And then… there are some that transcend the idea of good and bad, so much so that one cannot simply express their opinion of it by means of such trivial things like “numbers” or even “words”.  This is one of them.  Only 5 episodes long, the story is rather simple for something of its kind. Our protagonist, Aya Iseshima, one day finds herself participating in the tournament of Martial Hearts, and determined to win the tournament so that she can have her wish fulfilled. The first four episodes are pretty dull, and kinda just mediocre overall. Boob and panty shots are in no short supply thanks to the help of Arms, with everyone apparently liking to wear clothes that explode on impact, and so on. Pretty silly, but whatever. It is what it is. If that were the case the whole way, I would have just given it a 3 or something and move on with my life. Of course, if it were all that simple, I wouldn't be writing this as though I just got home from war, writing about my experiences from observing horrors of what humanity is capable of doing to their own kind unfold in front of my very eyes either.  This brings us to the final episode. In the span of 20 minutes, it goes from a generic ecchi fighting OVA to something much greater than that, one that would make End of Evangelion look like baby food.  You might cry.  You might yell.  You might drink heavily, much like how I did when I wrote this review.  Either way, you will react, and afterwards may experience strange things, like you would during puberty: you don't know what the fuck is going on, but it's happening and you don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing. You may have an out of body experience, as the reality you once previously knew crumbles apart. When it is all over, and able to digest everything that has transpired over the last two hours or so, it will forever be seared in your conscience for as long as you are able to retain memory, no matter how much you want this to happen or not.  There are no words. Only tears. Whether it is from grief or laughter is your choice. It doesn't matter, nothing matters at this point anyways.  All that said, watch it in the dub. Yes, we can party it up like it’s the mid 90s all over again and have 40 page long wars over subs vs. dubs, but there is simply no contest here. Funimation already generally makes some pretty solid dubs when not working on something like this, but the bar set by the Japanese audio is so low to the point that you could replace the entire cast with alpaca noises and it’d still probably better.  And so there you have it. Anime of the year, all years.  Forever.;Recommended
3;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;lawlmartz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lawlmartz;9;"Master of Martial Hearts is the utter definition of ""So Bad It's Good"".  I have long prided myself on being a lover of the best and worst that the visual medium has to offer. I don't limit myself to watching anime and movies that people, critics, or my friends think are great. I love watching things that just plain suck sometimes. So bad it's good, so bad it's HORRIBLE, I don't care- I think you can get something out of anything, even if that's ""I want that hour of my life back and a bag to puke in"".  I've seen a good number of godawful 80s and 90s OVAs that exist solely for exploitative purposes- tasteless, shameless, filthy, or just plain obscene things that have no good reason to be out there but for some T&A, but are cult hits regardless. Mad Bull 34, Violence Jack, Angel Cop, the list goes on and on. The ""trashy OVA schlock"" is basically a genre of its own, and if it's not, I'm coining the term now, Bob Saget!  I had thought that this was a dying breed, the anime equivalent of a late night titty movie- something with such a barely functional plot that served only to push you from one pointless sexual scene to another bare body. I was very, very wrong. In 2008 and 2009, studio Arms (the animators of Kite, Elfen Lied, Queens Blade, and hentai galore), perhaps the most famous tasteless anime-trash producer of all time , dropped another bomb on the world: Master of Martial Hearts.  Since this is a 5 episode OVA, there's not a whole lot that can be said regarding the plot and characters that the viewer shouldn't just see for themselves. Master of Martial Hearts is, at heart, a panty fighter in the vein of Ikkitousen and Butt Attack Punisher Girl (yeah, go look that one up). Every episode features the MC, Aya fighting against various fetish stereotype girls- the little sister, the maid, a priestess girl, flight attendant, sexy nurse/cop, and Shenhua from Black Lagoon. (cheongsams, whaddup?) PS, be on the lookout for a FOTNS reference. Every gut busting, throat crushing, bone cracking blow from our pugilistic sadist of a MC also destroys her opponent's clothes- another note straight out of Ikkitousen. One chick takes a knee to the face, and her bra shreds into tiny pieces like paper. Another girl gets punched so hard in the stomach that her butt comes bursting out of the back of her panties and skirt. No article of clothing is safe! It's like Soul Calibur out here! Expect a lot of exposed titties to keep you glued to the screen, because it's certainly not for the personality anyone exhibits.  The next bit is the plot twists. It would be criminal of me to reveal anything, but dayum, there's so much over the top, out of nowhere melodrama that a telenovela would be jealous of Martial Hearts. If you've ever seen the SNL skit ""The Californians"", IT'S THAT, IT REALLY IS!  Finally, we put the icing on the crap cake that every shameless OVA Schlock must have to achieve legendary status: the dub. Staples in the OVA Schlock genre have historically consisted of the venerable Central Park Media or Media Blasters. No more. Funimation stepped up to the plate (and why they licensed this odious turd is beyond me) and immediately started swinging for the fences. It's hard to believe it, but they actually pulled out all of their A list ladies for this one- Trina Nishimura, Alexis Tipton, Cherami Leigh, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Caitlin Glass, Brittey Karbowski, Monica Rial, and they even got Luci Christian in on the action. It's an ensemble of various action girl voices, and boy, does it ever make it more fun to imagine the other characters they voice going at it in a trashy, half naked death match. I mean, the show is already about some disgusting fetish wish fulfillment, so why not imagine that the blank slate characters are replaced with ones from other series?? In all seriousness, these ladies actually didn't do a gag dub. If anything, the English version is vastly improved over the completely emotionless, robotic Japanese. It adds so much more color when they get really into it, which brings this into that special level of schlock: Shoji Sato class. High School of the Dead was a terrible anime pandering to people with swollen cow udder fetishes, as was its stablemate Triage X. But what makes them so special is how they're the perfect amount of schlock and trashy, tasteless titty movie with some super hammy and overplayed melodramatic moments. They're hilarious in how utterly ridiculous they are, (not to mention that the HOTD dub is 5/7 perfect). Shoji Sato is a man who knows his target audience, and makes manga that appeals to them. It sells. It was a shock to me that Mr Sato didn't make Master of Martial Hearts, because it's so perfectly in line with his style.  Seriously, I'm giving it a 9 for the same reason I gave Mad Bull a 9. Just plain ridiculousness. And if you manage to make it to that 5th episode... the ending will leave your sides as shredded as the girls in the show's clothes. I promise it's worth waiting until the end. You might die laughing at the sheer stupid craziness.  Oh, and if you value your eardrums, mute the opening song. It's like a tonedeaf gazelle trying to mimic the shrieks of a dying whale mixed with Eddie Vedder and nu-metal. ""Just forget about that, and act stupid for a while!"" -Natsume";Recommended

7;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;kanam;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kanam;9;Zettai Shougeki Platonic Heart. At the picture on MAL, you may think that the art is pretty good. That was why I watched this series, ignoring the complains of other users... and yes, at first I was disappointed. The animation is not fluid, and I believe the cover above is drawn by a completely different person from the one who drew for the anime (well, there are a lot of others, like Mikagura School Suite anime from the song video).  That is the worst part of Zettai Shougeki Platonic Heart. The other not-so-important weak parts include a horrible shout at the OP song, and the strange waves emitted by the girl's attacks resulting in clothes ripping. And it wasn't censored, at least in my version (kinda shocked about it).  Now for the good parts... The story is about a girl who wants to save her friend. The rather mysterious disappearing makes you feel like this anime will be a fiction story... but it isn't. You have to use your head. There must be some reason this anime is dubbed to English. Yup, a reason: look for it. Americans just love ecchi action series? Maybe.  But seriously, don't be disheartened by the appeal-lacking art, the unappetizing breasts (you will see) or the strange things they do when fighting (which is funny). It will all pay off.  The sound is, well, nothing exceptional. I give it additional points for the last ED, [Zero Gravity]. Tried to search for full version but no results. After you watch the last scene, that song really fits the mood for letting you reflect on what you have just seen. And by the time the song ends, you will suff-, uh, rejoice.  The character development... none that I notice. In other words, zero. But for Zettai Shougeki, it is not relevant. Look at the English title : Master of Martial Arts. Why would a master need development? No, they don't. After all it is just a five episode OVA, logically you can't expect anything in character development.  Many people complain of the last episode. It doesn't make sense. It makes me feel a lot dumber. How did it get to this. What was that. Too much information cramped in the last episode... Yes, they are all true except for the last one. The last episode is really... amazing. You should see that for yourself. It shows how a human being could be if taken to its limits. A psychological attack on your brain. Even after anticipating something from other reviews while watching, I still didn't expect something this... well, unexpected.  So what will the winners get after finishing Martial Heart? Can they realize their dream, built on sacrifices? What will their solution be to solve THAT situation? What will happen to Miko? Why is there no foreshadowing at all? The answer lies within the gem called Zettai Shougeki. Except for the last question.  So, if it is still not clear, I really enjoyed this series. Not trolling. This series is scarier than most horror series out there, and I don't even like horror anime. Definitely recommended for people who can tolerate the art and have a bit of a dark side... Ok, a LOT of darkness in their heart (shine, your chuuni self!).;Recommended
8;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;godzuky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/godzuky;9;I'm going to make this review short and sweet. The reason I loved this anime so much was because of the ending. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was not only original but strong and different from most (if not all) other movies or anime out there. But let me go through my ratings with you  Story: 8 I rated this high simply because I like unique characters and this anime has them in spades. Some times I also like anime that stand everything you ever thought you knew about the characters on their heads simply because you know a little of their story. For me the story, especially the ending was worth the price I paid for it.  Art: 6 I have seen better, but also some a lot worse.  Sound: 6 The opening song was good, but they do use it a lot and it seems that is the only song they use.  Characters: 10 Just because you see a high school student trying to be good doesn't mean that person is good. Just because you see a mom doesn't mean that person is good.  Enjoyment: 10 The ending blew me away, I LOVED it. As a viewer sometimes you get caught into a trap with happy endings. Don't, let a movie or anime be what it is and enjoy it for itself.  Overall: 9 What this anime says about life is don't judge a book by its cover, never enter a fighting tournament if you are a woman and boobs are great and yes, there a lot of boob shots so if you don't like boobs or are offended by them, move on to another anime. And did I mention the ending????;Recommended
9;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;KaminL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KaminL;7;"I can't help but think of Deser Punk after watching this entire series. This is a show that is advertised as some sort of light hearted action anime with a cast that is promising not only laughs, but boobs. With that being said, i can't tell you how disturbed i am right now. So, there are only 5 episodes, so you already understand that you are gonna get a lotta info within each and every minute. But the problem is, you don't really KNOW ANYTHING until the last episode. You are left in the dark while Aya and her opponent of the episode slap eachothers clothes off for twenty minutes. Which i wasn't really complaining about. Then the final episode comes around, and the series makes an absolute 180 from action/ borderline hentai anime to some sort of Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni meets Die Hard. So, in summation, if you went to the Funimation pannel at Anime Expo this year (like i did) and saw their ad for this show, DONT BUY IT. By the last episode, you'll be wondering if you just watched an M. Night Shymalan porno debut before you even stop to think that they just decided to add a little ""gurro twist"" to the mix. Well, maybe not that brutal. But it's still pretty brutal. Story: Gotta admit, nice twist. So: 8/10. Art: Lacking throughout the entire series. Unproportionate breasts, awkward eye shapes, the works. 6/10. Sound: Alright soundtrack, but they should've used it more. 7/10. Characters: No CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT but a nice array of females. 7/10.

11;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;Gotbat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gotbat;10;This anime is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. While the story has room for improvement, the art and animation is beyond terrible, which is what makes this a divine work of art, not to mention the use of nudity at the most improper moments. Watching this alone is a mistake but should definitely be watched with friends as a group.  The list of negatives is fairly short. Mainly there needed to be more episodes. While the plot is fleshed out within the 5 episodes made, I wish it had gotten a full season because that's how much I enjoyed this.

0;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;ThatJazzyGuy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatJazzyGuy;5;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart, what a series this is, it's truly something that has to be seen to believe.. And I don't mean that in a necessarily good way either.  I'll first start off by stating I watched this expecting a whole lot of ass-kicking babes, with a lot of fan service, which is exactly what I got. But here's the kicker..  General premise of the series is about a girl named Aya Iseshima and her best friend Natsume Honma, and their (well Aya's anyway) inclusion in a fighting tournament called the Platonic Heart, a tournament where female fighters compete for the grand prize of the Platonic Heart, a jewel that can grant any wish to the winner of the tournament.  Story 5/10 I admit I was kind of enjoying this particular little anime, for a little while. While the story lacks any true construct, it makes up for it's brilliant fight scenes.. But then again, a story can only go so far, when after all, it is about buxom babes fighting each other with plenty of ecchi to boot.  Art 7/10 Now I have to say that the art style is actually pretty good. Watching our heroine beating the living daylights out of her opponents is a crisp, and rewarding thing to watch, and I love the fact the fact their clothes literally explode when a blow has been landed hehe.. Alas though, that's just about the only good thing I can say about this..  Sound 5/10 The soundtrack or BGM, is rather forgettable, nothing really struck me as brilliant, I can say is that I don't particularly like the opening theme. As for the ending theme, well.. It's forgettable! (Haha, oh well, I tried)  Character 6/10 I really found myself liking our heroine Aya Iseshima, she has a knack for kicking some ass so.. Elegantly, which is pretty fun to watch! Aside from Aya, and her best friend, the rest of the characters hardly have any real development, they are just there for their respective episode, and we'd be lucky if we'd hear or see from them again.. Like I remember seeing one character with only 1 minute of screen time during the entirety of the show! She didn't have it good at all, ahh well, a lot of characters are indeed left with something to be desired, go figure. Afterall this is a show about expendable characters.  Enjoyment 5/10 Like I said, there are parts where I liked, but for everything I liked, there about a dozen things I didn't.. There are characters we only see for a brief period of time, sometimes see them once, and never again. Soundtrack is relatively forgettable, and that awful opening theme I just don't care for in the slightest. Story is nothing spectacular, just your standard fighting tournament with Femme Fatale's fighting and tearing apart their clothes.  Overall 5/10 This is something that was truly something to behold... Well I guess if you're looking for a show with little plot, but plenty of fan-service action girls, then this is a show you may like, just don't go into it thinking you'll get anything other than that. Being said, the only thing I like is the main lead character Aya Iseshima (The only character with development), and her fight scenes. In conclusion, Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart is just your fan-service fix for the weekend.;Mixed Feelings

4;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;DyceAverruncus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DyceAverruncus;5;Never has a fighting tournament anime dropped the ball harder than master of the martial hearts. Ut's best described as a poor man's Ikki Tousen and that show was already a poor man's Tenjho Tenge. The only thing keeping this over series from being completely mediocre all across the board is the infamous ending that needs to be seen to be believed.  Our story centers on Aya, a kind-hearted girl who always more than willing to protect the weak. It's this attitude that brings her to the martial hearts tournament when her friend Miko goes missing after losing a match. It's said that whoever wins the tournament can have whatever wish they want granted.  For the majority of it's run, MOTMH never tries to be anything more than a standard female based fighting series. Big busty girls punch each other, clothes fly off, and Aya wins. The same formula is repeated four episodes straight with lazy animation and even lazier sound design. The punching sound effects literally sound like something you could find on youtube.   It took until the final episode for this anime to make strides. In a move similar to school days, the previously bog-standard show drifts into incredibly dark territory. Aya his drown into a blind rage by one of her opponents and brutally beats her to death to the tune of public domain punching sounds. There to greet her is her friend Miko who lares bare the true intentions of the tournament.  I don't like to include spoilers in my reviews, but sitting through four episodes of mediocre action to get to the high point might not be worth it to most people. To make a long a consulted plot twist short, Aya's father used to be married to Miko's mom and abused the both of them before killing the wife. Aya's mom fought Natsume's( aya's other friend) mom in a previous tournament that left her mute. Natsume and Miko met one day to set up the tournament to make aya suffer.  The plot twist was lazily put together for having zero foreshadowing and with zero build-up. Viewers barely have any time to digest the info before another twist is thrown at them. The show didn't know what it wanted to be so it threw everything up in flames. Good riddance.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;MrRedrum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MrRedrum;3;"Okay, so having completed this anime I can say I almost enjoyed it... until it got to the end. It has the rather standard ecchi anime vibe and typical OVA problems. Every fight you are guaranteed to see a boob shot with the occasional unnecessary fan service shots... it definitely feels like a wannabe Ikkitousen in that regard.  The story had a rather plain and unoriginal plot revolving around a gem that would grant the user any wish she chooses, however, it comes at the price of requiring them to fight for the gem and if they lose the fight, they would go into the ""dark realm."" The dark realm is never really explained and once you get to the end of the series you understand why. Now, as I was saying, I started off semi-enjoying this anime until it got halfway through the last episode. Out of nowhere it had more twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie and like the new M. Night Shyamalan movies, the twists sucked and made no sense.  As another reviewer said, the main character's sole drive of continuing on this battle for the Platonic Heart is to save a ""friend"" that she only met a day prior. I don't know about you but I wouldn't put my life on the line for someone I just met and have no attachment to. Now, the other characters that you meet are plain and you have no interest or feeling towards them what-so-ever. Everything about this anime screams mediocre, from the art style to the characters and most importantly the story. It seemed like whoever penned the story liked the idea behind Sekirei and wanted their own version of it, yet they failed horribly.  I cannot express my frustration with how this anime ended anymore without giving it away. So I recommend anyone that is interested in this anime and feels the need to watch it, to possibly stop halfway through the last episode. You'll certainly be saving yourself a headache in the end.

Especially whenever something like... well, THIS hits the shelves.  I don't even wanna type in the name of the anime because it's such a disgusting piece of crap. Let'S just call it ""Schlocky Ikki Tousen Fanfic"", or SITF for short. It's not possible for me to accept the fact that really awesome, thought-provoking and just downright beautifully crafted anime like ""Now and Then, Here and There"", ""Infinite Ryvius"" or even just fun, sexy (""sexy"" will be a keyword later on, so bear with me on this one) titles like ""New Cutie Honey"" don't get a proper Bluray-release here in the west, while Funimation - as it seems - has nothing better to do than to license this... this wretched piece of baboon doo-doo!  F*ck!  Anywho, plot: Aya and Natsume (the subtle Tenjou Tenghe-reference here is the only thing in this OVA that can be described as borderline clever) are totally, like, BFFs and stuff. One fine day they stumble across a sexy stewardess fighting a sexy priest-chick. Aya - herself a sexy schoolgirl - helps sexy priest-chick out and by doing that, she ""accidentally"" joins the Martial Hearts-tournament. In this tournament, only women with sexy trademarks are allowed to participate and THE PRIZE (tm) is that any wish you have will be granted. And from there on out, bitches be fightin'. Bitches be fightin' in a garage. Bitches be fightin' in a maid café. Bitches be fightin' on a busy street. Bitches be fightin' everywhere. And then an awful, awful twist happens and this thing turns from a shitty anime into something way more sinister and vile.  Let's get the obvious thing out of the way first: Titties. SITF has lots of titties. Really poorly animated, poorly drawn titties that are shown off in the most unattractive way possible. It's marketed as ""Ikki Tousen without censor bars and with a little more gore"", but they (= Funimation) left out the ""... with way less budget""-part.  Resident animu-schlockmeisters and occasional porn producers ARMS - who, I might add, once were pretty damn good in the animation department when it came to sleazy-ass schlocky action-series (see: ""Kite"", ""Mezzoforte"", ""Elfen Lied"") - churn out their worst effort to date. The animation and art quality is complete horseshit all around. Everything looks unappealing and artificial, and despite being an OVA (for which, generally speaking, studios have more budget on their hands to do stuff with) this could easily be mistaken as a shitty generic shonen-panty fighter-series from the 90s.  Don't even get me started on the soundtrack that might just feature the most awful opening song I've heard in anything ever. Imagine Avril Lavigne being really frigging high and just babbling words in a foreign language into a headset-microphone, while some crappy garage band shreds ""Smoke on the Water - The Punkrock Edition"" in the background - there's your opening.  The Japanese cast doesn't even care, everybody just phones their performance in and collects their paycheck - and can you really blame them? The English dub is kinda decent, but the talents of the dub actors are wasted on this dull piece of crap, and you cannot make dialogue like this...  ""I WILL CALL THIS DAY 'BEST FRIENDS DAY' FROM NOW ON! YAY!""  ... sound appealing even if you tried.  To talk about the characters would mean spoiling SITF. And it's against the guidelines to spoil stuff, so let me put it like this: SITF tries really hard to sell one of the unnecessarily darkest plot twists I've seen in quite some time. Emphasis on ""tries"", because the anime needs AN ENTIRE FLIPPING EPISODE to explain the twist. The fact this twist exists is not my problem though - I dig the idea, sort of.  But the execution is incredibly baffling to watch. All of a sudden, everything just seems cold and meaningless and doesn't even start to make a lick of sense. Characters who were carbon copies of crappy character archetypes become even worse archetypes, people die, people try to explain what the heck they're doing and then SITF just pulls the plug at the end of episode 5 without even bothering to fill the plotholes it left behind, after (clumsily) deconstructing itself and the entire genre it belongs to. And, by proxy, it kinda accidentally shows us what kind of people work at Studio ARMS. And in the industry in general.  Here's what SITF wants to tell us: Basically, everything is a scam and we're dickheads for buying into said scam. SITF takes burning itself down into account to drill this into our heads: we're bad because we watch boobs. Bad us. Bad viewers. Bad Aya for participating in a tournament that fulfills some vage wish. Everything is shit. You're shit. How dare you?  Too bad it comes from the same goddamn studio responsible - as said above - FOR EXPLOITATION. ARMS animated stuff like...: - Queen's Blade - Sekai de Ichiban Tsuyoku Naritai! - Elfen Lied - Kite & Mezzo Forte - Word's Worth  ... but now WE, the viewers, are the bad guys because we buy into their crap. Well, congratulations, everyone - we watched crappy fighting anime after crappy fighting anime as kids, just HOPING for that one shot of the female characters' titties - but in the end it doesn't really matter, because we're horrible people and everybody's miserable at the end. Woop-dee-friggin'-doo.  And the fact that this message - this ugly, ugly message that harkens back to the ""uberviolent underage- and tentacle-porn""-archetype I mentioned above - is basically carried to the west by one of the biggest anime distributors in North America is nothing short of alarming, cruel and a disgrace to the fanbase.  I love anime. I love exploitation. I love sleazy-ass Ralph Bakshi-cartoons. I love Yasoumi ""the dude who made Kite"" Umetsu, he's one of my favorite animators and character designers of all time. But I don't like being scammed. I don't like being painted as an idiot because I watch animated girls fight each other and getting a kick out of that. I don't like being painted as such an idiot by the same idiots who churn out ""Ikki Tousen""-season after increasingly shitty (but at least fun-shitty) ""Ikki Tousen""-season, and seem to judge their viewership OPENLY as such idiots. And I don't like it when something this stupid thinks it's smarter than me or anyone who likes exploitation'esque cartoons, by implementing a plot twist this jarring and nonsensical.  0/10";Not Recommended
2;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;LeaderTGW;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LeaderTGW;1;"Words cannot describe how terrible this OVA is. In fact, you know how you see lots of bad reviews on MAL and think to yourself ""oh maybe I shouldn't watch this?"" Go with that thought. This is one of the many terrible Ecchi shows ever made. You can seriously skip this show, there are so many things wrong with it that I'm sure have already been explained. The story is terrible, the Opening intro sounds like they just grabbed some random non talented girl off the streets and paid her to sing. The art, is really bad for it's time. It has more of a 2001-2004 feeling to it. I found it rather difficult to continue watching, however I made it... mostly because boobs.

3;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;RoarkTenjouin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RoarkTenjouin;1;"When it comes to anime that's commonly called the ""worst"", many people will generally answer with shows from one of 2 groups of thought - new school anime fans will say something like School Days, Mars of Destruction, or Pupa; old school anime fans will generally say something like Genocyber, Violence Jack, or MD Geist. I'm here to present the case that THIS is the worst anime of all time, hands down.  Story - 1/10 The short version: Take Ikkitoisen, make it as edgy as the anime adaptation of Akame ga Kill!. Then, condense the end result into a 5 episode OVA, and give said OVA an ending as shocking as School Days - without the satisfaction of said ending. You now have the plot to Master of Martial Hearts.  The long version: A girl gets forced into a fighting tournament, with the prize being a gem called the Martial Heart, which supposedly grants the wish of the winner; the girl in question, Aya, wants to win her friend back - a friend that she just met, and has no reason to save. The plot gets darker and darker as the episodes progress, but it's not dark in the good sort of way, like the 2011 reboot of Hunter x Hunter. The ending, however, is absolutely shocking - but because it's the type that only works if you have seen the entire series, I'm not going to discuss it.  Essentially, this show is acting as a deconstruction of the ""Panty Fighter"" genre (examples of the genre include Rosario+Vampire, Ikkitousen, Kill La Kill). While I was able to understand the story better than, oh say, Mars of Destruction...what I understood of the story was terrible.  Art - 1/10 This wasn't the worst I've seen...but for 2008 standards, it's pretty bad. However, considering the fact that this is by Studio Arms, who have literally made only one anime I like (Maoyuu Maoyu Yuusha), it's pretty understandable as to why the animation quality sucks.  Sound - 1/10 The reason it gets such a low score is because the sound is just...forgettable. The only sound I remember is clothes ripping.  Character - 1/10 There is literally no character development (I guess there is character change, but it's ""character destruction"" instead of character development - the character that undergoes change is Aya Iseshima, and she devolves from ""I'm fighting for my friends"" to ""I'm going to murder you for no reason""), and the characters there are just uninteresting. I could not name a single interesting thing about the characters if I tried. The characters are all unlikable - even the main character, Aya Iseshima, had no redeemable qualities (and for the most part, that's usually something that most anime get right - the only other case that I can think of that screws this up just as much as Master of Martial Hearts is School Days!).  Enjoyment - 1/10 This was the only area where my expectations were met - and that's not a good thing. I was expecting this to be terrible, and I was right.  Overall - 1/10 This anime makes me wish I could give a score of -1/10 - since this DESERVES that score. This is the worst anime of all time - it's not enjoyable as a show, and if you look at it as a deconstruction, it absolutely fails on that regard - heck, even School Days is a better deconstruction than this show, since at least with School Days, they actually manage to avoid most of the flaws that they are trying to make fun of, and the ending is awesome.

4;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;Moon_Light;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moon_Light;3;"I’ll start by saying, I don't usually have a problem with finding anime I like, actually where genre is concerned I'm pretty easy to please. As long as it; Has some funny moments, a cute guy here and there, and a main lead that uses words with more than one syllable (sometimes). I mean that’s not so hard to do. Maybe throw in a cute animal just to add to the overall cuteness. So how, HOW, can a show that the girls kick ass be such a disappointment? For me it was because it just made me feel extra dumb. Hey I'm the first to admit I love certain genre because it requires minimal brain usage, no shame in admitting it. Yeah, so if you plan to watch this one just hit the eject button on that brain of yours, send it out to clean or something and use that in between time to watch shows like this.  What is Master of Martial Hearts about? It's about the the world of Martial Hearts. What the heck is it? A fighting contest/tournament that one enters which has the prize of a gem that can grant the winner her one and only wish. The main leads are friends Aya and Natsume who happen to stumbled into the Martial Hearts world by mistake when walking into a fight in progress between a priestess named Miko and a flight attendant. After saving and hearing Miko’s story and the learning about how the tournament is and a few happenings in between they decide to join. Who will come out victorious?….dah duh dum, wow no one will ever contract me to do soundtracks lol  Requirement to be recruited in the Martial Heart: -Have knowledge of the martial arts. Which just so happens ALL the girls in this one have. Love it when that happens. -Be a girl, which is just code for have boobs you don't mind being displayed to the world. And wear tornable (should be a word, clothes that can be easily torn, or made of foam) clothes. -Have a wish that seems impossible and you want it to come true -A cell phone, so that they can text you with the contest information -Appear half naked at impromptu times throughout the day while fighting another female.  How it works when you‘re in?.. It’s not that easy, there are rules people! They supply you with the money necessary to get ready and you start battling your way up the pyramid. If you end up being the winner you will receive the gem. -That’s it? -Yeah… -But I thought you said it wasn’t that easy? -Don’t blame me I don’t make the rules. Anyway you have to fight girls in really skimpy outfits. Maybe it makes you uncomfortable…  This contest isn’t for the faint hearted and boys can’t participate. I guess in this anime world boys have no hearts, sorry guys there’s always a next time. Don’t worry I feel insulted for you. But to be fair the fan service is ALL for you.  Actually even above all that it wasn't soooo bad. More annoying with than anything, and for a fairly short show that’s saying something. For instance, every time (EVERY TIME) they hit, punch scratch their opponent their clothes magically shred leaving them in their underwear or naked, all I can do is call forth the 14 year old dude inside all of us and he'll say, ""Boobies!"" Fine he probably won't say it, but he'll think it. For those wondering, no, I don’t even take myself seriously sometimes. And with anime like these, that’s a silver lining.  As for the soundtrack and animation. Nothing stood out and the animation is rather plain. It’s not a new anime therefore it’s actually pretty ordinary in character design and color as a whole. No major flaws that I could see but I'll be honest I dozed off a lot of times. No worries when I came back five minutes later I still understood the plot, so no harm done.  The ending is where you get a feel for the main characters and you see they have some depths. It's a shame it's only for 10 minutes and you don't really care at this point. Which honestly I just didn’t see throughout the show to begin with. Well maybe in a few instances but they get stripped away by battle scenes, pun intended. It’s also at the end where you see the perverseness behind the show, I mean it’s there (duh, the ecchiness?) but it shows you more in the end. They tried to stuff us with useless plot lines and complicate the story to make it more interesting when if you really stayed and watched until the last second it was probably because you (as I was) were wondering if the ""gem"" was a symbol for anything but gem. Maybe that's just me cause seriously this was a piece of work... yeah let's go with ""work.""  What does Aya want as her wish? Watch and find out, why should I suffer alone….";Not Recommended

I finished this series and I have to say that i was pretty disappointed. i understand that it's a 5 episode series, but this one dropped the ball and has no intention of trying to pick it up. I thought it was good at first; however, the series lead up to the biggest WTF twist of an ending i have personally seen in an anime so far. Basically, through out the series, it was one fight after another with plenty of fan service and somewhat of an attempt to throw in slice of life scenarios. Other than that, there really wasn't too much to it in terms of plot, characters and story.  That being said, if you are someone who doesn't care too much for those specific areas, then don't be surprised if it turns out to disappoint you, because it most likely will.";Not Recommended
6;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;3;WHAT THE *Beeping* HELL IS THIS *beep*! WHO THE *beeping* HELL DECIDED TO ASK ME TO REVIEW THIS PIECE OF *Beep*? I SHOULD…  *Please stand by as we are having technical issues*  You know, you would think to this point that I would be desensitized at how much fan service the animators put into these shows but I end up feeling still grossed out to how much they do place. You don’t need a breast and tant shot every five seconds for it to catch someone’s attention, nor do you need female characters that are stressed that they may be more then just friends. The forcefulness of the girls being friends makes me feel a bit unwell and makes the script that much harder to listen to (Before anyone asks, I did watch the English version). Every character in this show seems ether perverted or a mental case.  The first girl they meet in this fighting match is a woman named Miko… a priestess… I shit you not, that’s her damn name. For those of you who don’t know Japanese, Miko is the name of a Japanese priestess. The word means pristest so therefore… SHE DOESN’T HAVE A NAME! Not only that, but she is in the fight because of a rather stupid wish, not that wanting to make friends is stupid… just fighting people in order to get a jewel that will grant that wish just so you can have a friend is stupid. She ends up making friends anyway with Aya and Natsume anyway even though she doesn’t get the jewel so what the hell is the reason she needs it?  So I got a question for you, when you fight someone, do you start kicking when you are about a foot away from the other person or do you kick when you are farther away? Well in the first episode, Aya actually kicks when she isn’t even close to her enemy and then stands in the way while she’s getting attacked. I don’t think the fighting animation works like that. A lot of the fighting looks half assed or done with a lot of speed lines and cheesy backgrounds. Another small thing about the battles I should mention, HOW ARE THEY SECRET? Half the time, they destroy everything around them anyway so how can they even think that that would be a secret?  And they didn’t have to place all of the little love problems Aya has in there as well. She is always giving the love lust eyes at Natsume’s brother even though she thinks she knows a dark secret. We feel nothing for this little love problem because we get no idea of who this boy is. We don’t even get a chance to feel for Aya herself so what makes the writers think we would have time to feel for the brother?  The ending really doesn’t work right. The ending is so demented that it just doesn’t feel right. It’s like they pulled it out of their butt because they had no other idea how to end the series.  The art is well… up to par with most hentai I think, and it really should be hentai for how much bare boob and pantie-d taint they show in it. I also wish they would pick a size for the breasts too, Aya seems to gain and lose boob mass whenever the artists seem fit. And what is the obsession with clothing being the look of wet paper towels getting ripped from a person’s body? I know I am a girl but I do know what is sexy and what isn’t on a women and this… this really isn’t. That and the strange breast transformation from large to tiny in two shots. Many bits are just looped and it’s rather bad. I would not watch this for the animation at all. The eating animation they have in the beginning of the series actually is very unattractive and makes me wonder what women in their right mind would even eat like how Miko was doing.  The opening it actually pretty good though the girl screaming in some parts makes me cring. I actually liked the upbeat way they did the song and it does show this will be a rather action packed show. The script for English is rather bad, and though it does ‘sort of’ get better, it still feels like it could have been done much better, it would have at least added something to this little piece of… um… ya. The script starts out stupid and pretty much remains that way throughout. The tone of the voices are better then the script but again, not much. Natsume comes off sounding like a whinny school child and Aya doesn’t sound much better when she gets down to the actual thinking.  They had an ok idea for a show, but in the end, they really massed it up with the script and the artwork.;Not Recommended

Completely uninteresting characters, and a final episode that is so WTF why did they go there. Complete waste of time, you might laugh a bit at first, but that is only good for an episode or two.

Apparently school uniforms are made out of paper. I was suprised this show had an english dub. And the dub was not terrible but it sure was cheezy. The op is garbage the worse i have ever seen. There was a distinct lack of any characterization. I found about zero enjoyment from watching this. It was a waste of time. The biggest kick in the balls with this show was its ending.

11;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;EdenEastway;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EdenEastway;4;So I've watched this series probably anywhere from 5-7 times out of the boredom and interest of just watching whatever comes on. In an entirety the plot doesn't really make much sense at all even if it tries to tie things together it doesn't do even a decent job. It's mainly just a lot of nudity and fight scenes where girls get their clothes torn off with even a slight hit until the end there is little to no real storyline and even though there is one it's difficult to find yourself following it even when the plot tries to come together at the end it still doesn't make enough sense to care about this anime at all.  Sure, it can be fun to watch bad anime and this is not the worse I've seen overall. I say that there are just one to many loose ends in the anime and they really try to just play it off with shock factor and it is shocking, but not enough to justify the rest. With repetition of watching the series you do catch on to a few more things that knowing ending clues you into. I think in whole the anime was just a bit rushed and the themes were so repetitive it kind of seems pointless.  I think you might enjoy this anime if you're bored one night and you're in to a little bit of fighting and nudity and having laughs at how bad this anime is. I think the main purpose of this anime, and most anime in this certain kind of range, are just made to see girls stripped naked and fighting. So if you're into that just go for it.;Not Recommended

Sound: The sound wasn't anything amzing so don't get your hopes up  Character: Since there was only one main character (who had very little developement) and many side characters who were important to the plot (who had no developement or just dumb development) I say there aren't any characters who would make most people favorites.  Enjoyment: Again I will say I actually gave this anime a 7 until the last episode. You see the rating I gave it now.

14;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;nothost;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nothost;3;"For the record, I would have given this OVA a 5 if it weren't for the ending. Don't worry, we'll get to the ending in awhile. Not mentioning the ending when talking about Patonic Hearts is like trying to ignore a naked old man in a parking lot that is dancing to a boom-box that is playing ""Sexy And I know it"" full blast. Once you've seen it, you're inevitably going to tell people you know about it. Now I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I will talk about how it affected my score of this OVA. Now then, onto the actual review for the OVA.  Story: 3/10  This Girl called Aya has to participate in a tournament to win the Patonic Heart (AKA, Martial Heart), which has the power to grant any wish, as long as you're a girl. She is fighting to save Miko, a girl in a priestess get-up that she met one day earlier. I don't think I would try to save someone by entering a fighting tournament. Personally I'd call the cops and let them handle things, but I'm just a guy who spends his spare time watching anime, reading manga, and reviewing said anime/manga, so what do I know? Aya has to fight and defeat 5 girls with her epic martial arts skills. So yeah, this has been done before in shows like Sekirei and Ikkutusen. Well, besides the ending anyway. Like I said earlier, we'll get to it later.  Characters: 2/10  Most of the characters are ecchi stereotypes that get no real development, apart from the main lead Aya, who does get some amount of development through the course of this OVA. That doesn't mean she stands out as a great character. None of these characters are really all that memorable. To be fair though, this is a 5 episode OVA series, so they would have to work a lot harder to develop their characters properly. That being said, I think they could have done it a little bit better. Since they aren't that well developed, it's hard to develop any sort of sympathy for the characters, and this really comes to light during the climax of the final episode. Most of the villains are just stock that appear for one episode for Aya to defeat in the tournament. I can't even talk about all the villains because that would spoil the ending too. I know, I'm bringing up the ending a lot, but it has such a huge impact that I can't help but continually mention it.  Art: 4/10  It's alright I suppose, but for an ecchi show that throws most of its money at making the characters look as good as possible, it's lackluster at best. The animation is average, the fight scenes are slow and clunky, and the artwork has this shiny, cheerful look about it that isn't all that appealing. Oh, and this is one of those shows where clothes are made from paper and can break apart with one punch. You know what's funny? In Claymore, most of the main characters and girls with swords that go around fighting monsters (and occasionally each-other), and yet somehow their clothes get less messed up then in Patonic Hearts, where one punch can cause your clothes to just get torn to pieces. This is common in a lot of ecchi anime though. I've gotten used to it, but I wish that the clothes would at least come off from some sort of special attack, not a simple punch or kick.  Sound: 5/10  The voice acting for the Japanese dub is just average for me. The English voice actors put a lot of effort into it though, more then this turd deserves. The music is mediocre at best, and that opening is very, very annoying.  Enjoyment: 2/10  So this was a standard ecchi anime for me at first. Like I mentioned before, I've seen this kind of thing before, although it was not as good as the others. Still, it was a harmless, predictable show. And then the ending happened and.... well.... how do I put this? Okay, you know what Fairy Tail is about right? It's about this girl who joins a magic guild and they have a bunch of adventures and beat the bad guys with the power of friendship and whatnot. The main bad guys at this point is a bunch of ""dark guilds"" that are no longer a part of the normal guild system that Fairy Tail was a part of. Now imagine if at the very end of the series, Fairy Tail defeated the final dark guild, it was revealed that the dark guilds were actually good and were trying to destroy the normal guilds because the normal guilds wanted to enslave the Earth. Fairy Tail would then show its real colors and take over the world, and then they do horrible, unspeakable things to the main heroin who joined the guild at the beginning of the series. The climax of the final episode of Platonic Hearts is like that. The ending is a dark twist that comes the hell out of nowhere. And contrary to what some people believe, a dark twist doesn't automatically make an anime better. These kind of things are definitely more memorable then the typical happy ending that you see so often, but a twist like that has to make sense in context. The way this one is presented seems needlessly cruel to me, especially considering the tone of the anime until that final episode.  Overall: 3/10  A standard Echhi tournament OVA with a rather needlessly-cruel twist ending. I recommend staying away from this one.";Not Recommended
15;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;2;What exactly was I watching? From the looks of it, Master of Martial Hearts was trying to be some sort of Ikki Tousen knockoff where Aya is caught up in a clothes-tearing and fan service loaded tournament against a number of fetish-themed women competing for a prize that will grant one's wish. However beyond the clothes tearing, panty shots and boob exposure, the plot to this series is quite a mess. There are enough lapses in logic for the setup of the tournament where it's claimed to be a secret tournament which is quite ridiculous as there are several occasions in the series where Aya's fights with the fetish-themed women are out in the open with a good-sized crowd of witnesses. Much of the plot is pretty much padding for the ecchi content from the fights and the occasional hints being dropped about the true nature of the Platonic Heart tournament. You don't get to know very much about the women that Aya faces as their roles are limited to titillating its audience and being punching bags for Aya who is conveniently skilled in fighting. The final episode seemingly tries to rip a page from School Day's book by having a shocking and unexpected resolution concerning the reality of the Platonic Heart tournament. But whereas the finale to School Days at least worked because of how much the series had viewers hate the show's cast throughout its run (one of the few times you'll see me compliment School Days on something), the resolution to Master of Martial Hearts was quite nonsensical and mean-spirited with what is revealed and the challenges Aya had to put up with.  In terms of presentation, Master of Martial Hearts is below par in visual quality for an OAV series as it looked to be on par with a TV anime. Scenery and character designs are on the plain side in terms of quality, though battle scenes are not well animated with a number of apparent shortcuts and a decent number of occasions where the bust sizes of female characters are inconsistent. The soundtrack to the series is nothing special, though the OP song to the series tends to be a bit on the obnoxious side.  Master of Martial Hearts isn't a series I can find myself recommending to anybody unless you are part of the title's intended audience. Being unoriginal, its plot being a convenient excuse for its ecchi material, having subpar animation for an OAV title and a questionable way in which it resolves its plot, it's no wonder there are many folks who find this to be one of anime's most recent duds.;Not Recommended

It was bad enough before the last episode but the last episode completely obliterated it.  Art: The art is okay. It's not as smooth and fluent as some of the anime we have around, so it's seems a bit low budget.  Sound: It might have been where i got it from but it was a bit choppy at times.  Characters: Generic as S***  Enjoyment: I didn't even enjoy this with the fan service in it.  Overall: i'll give it a 5, just because they got it made. It's not something i'd suggest to anyone, for that fact, completely avoid this show if you can.

You have a purpose. You are going to live a happy, healthy life full of wonder and awe. You are going to make a difference, whether it be to one person or to millions of people. You will be amazing."" But then things like ""Master of Martial Hearts"" reaaaaally begin to make me want to shatter the mirror and eat the glass shards so I can forget all about the horrors of such a piece of shit show.  Look, I understand why ecchi anime exists. Yeah 90% of me finds the genre sexist and deplorable and not very progressive towards putting female characters in a positive light, but I get it. I'm not going to scream into a megaphone about how it's the worst thing ever, because it caters to an audience the same way horror films do. Not everyone is going to willingly purchase a ticket to see ""Paranormal Activity 49: Dawn of the Ghosties"", and that's OK. I'm not going to buy every DVD of ""Ikki Tousen"", but that's OK. Whatever.  But how do ecchi fans find ""Master of Martial Hearts"" entertaining? It does show nudity, but they're animated so poorly that it's not worth it to get excited about them. The animation in general is just so shoddy. This feels like it should've been in 2002, but this is 2008. 2008?! Ah, fall of 2008. The season of anime that brought us ""Clannad: After Story"", ""Toradora!"", and ""Michiko to Hatchin"" brings us ""plastic breasts"" and ""rubber doll anatomy"". The beauty! *vomits*  And can we just talk about that opening theme? I don't mind opening songs and I enjoy a lot of them, and some are even beautiful and unique. I've heard many people compare the singer of the opening song to a worse Avril Lavigne, and it's really the most accurate way to describe her. I only hope that someday she learned how to sing without going off key, but who knows. I think she may have been embarrassed to be apart of ""Master of Martial Hearts"" and decided to hide away in shame.  You would think that ""Master of Martial Hearts"" would be easy to get through since it's only 5 episodes in length. Yeah, ""Pupa"" and ""Mars of Destruction"" are less than an hour long and look how well people turned out from those monstrosities. These 5 episodes feel like a lifetime. It's like trying to binge watch ""Naruto"" in a day.  I know why we're all REALLY here, though. That last episode. That final middle finger of an episode that made me resent everything. You know, that final episode that has the ""dark twist"" that takes over fifteen minutes of expository dialogue to explain it (yeah, what if ""The Sixth Sense"" took a half hour to explain about Bruce Willis? 10/10 BEST MOVIE. M. NIGHT SHAMABAMARAMA IS THE NEW SPIELBERG.) The last episode is so absurd, so disgusting, so UNNECESSARY that it really seals the nail in the coffin that ""Master of Martial Hearts"" is for NO ONE. Ecchi fans would hate it because it does a poor job of being a strong asset in the genre, and the final episode is so UNSEXY that anyone who DOES find it even the slightest bit sexy needs to listen to an Enya CD and talk to a therapist. Women would hate it for its degrading portrayals of women as well as the constant fan service, as well as the outcomes of the characters in the final fifth episode. Anime fans would hate it because of the poor animation, soundtrack, characters, and multiple plot holes that the show was riddled with. Parents would hate it because they find it demeaning and would never show their children such a thing. Teachers would hate it because it teaches viewers absolutely nothing. Pets would hate it because it is so loud and obnoxious that it always makes them leave the room in a panicked stupor. Michael Bay would hate it because it didn't nearly have enough explosions to satisfy his cash boner. Time travelers would hate it because when they come to the past to find something to eternally preserve, if they watch this they will regret ever coming to the past and weep their way back to the future where they can have their minds controlled once more by the Squid-Men. God would hate it because it would make him question why he decided to create all of mankind. He promised he would never bring another flood, but he does so anyway. The oceans clash and the waves pour unto the cities. The buildings collapse and the people scream in agony. Their lives are at an end. They question why God would do this, didn't he love all of his children? So why take away their lives in such a wretched, cruel way? The world is cleansed, the last person swallows the saltwater that killed their friends and family. The world is silent. God sheds a tear. It is time to start again: to start a new population of humans. He will protect them this time. He will save them from such fates. A world...rid of those who created ""Master of Martial Hearts"".

18;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;Fear_the_Reefer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fear_the_Reefer;1;"High school sophomore Aya Iseshima was on her way to school one day, alongside her peppy best friend Natsume, when they happened upon a strange sight; A shrine maiden named Miko was engaged in a dramatic battle with a flight attendant, right in the middle of the street, in broad daylight, throwing each other into car windows and punching each other’s clothing to shreds. Deciding to step in, Aya both sides with and befriends the shrine maiden, inadvertently taking her place in an underground martial arts tournament called the Platonic Heart. The winner of this tournament would be granted one wish upon completion, and when her new friend suddenly disappears without a trace, Aya embarks on a string of deadly battles to work her way through the tournament to find poor Miko. Unfortunately for her, literally nothing about this situation is as it seems.  Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart... Or, Master of Martial Hearts, as it’s known in the west, because a terrible pun legitimately sounded better than the original title... was produced by Studio Kikan, now known as St. Signpost, and I’m kind of at a loss here because I’ve never actually seen any other title from their catalogue. I had previously heard rumors that it was produced by Studio Arms, which would have made sense given the litany of hentai attached to them, but nope. Kikan. But hey, that should tell you all about the production values of this series. It looks like swill from a company that has dipped it’s fingers into way too many cream pies. As far as I can tell, that isn’t actually the case with Kikan, but I have nothing else to work with here.  Most anime with budget problems will save the best looking animation for their openings, because that’s often the first impression most people will have of any series, so the fact that even the opening features running animation that would barely qualify as the worst an average anime has to offer should be your first red flag. This anime is asshole ugly. The animation is cheap and stilted, using budget saving tricks at every opportunity without bothering(possibly due to simple inability) to hide them. The only remotely expensive looking visual in the entire series is the platonic heart itself, the glorious mcguffin everyone’s fighting for that often gets shown to us in an endlessly recycled rotation. It’s fully 3D rendered, it’s see-through, and its design is garish and tacky, just a crystal pretzel covered in smaller colored gems.  The characters proportions are inconsistent, they’re frequently off-model with their eyes rarely set right on their faces, and for a fanservice show, it’s stunningly unappealing. I think the kind of sexiness they were going for was the kind where you take a body part people want to see... T and A, obviously... And just find every attempt to shove those assets as far into the camera as they can, leaving the people attached to them in unnervingly awkward poses. Bare breasts look passable maybe a quarter of the time, but far more often than that they look like the kinds of really shoddy nude-filter fan edits you can find on Rule34 sites. The only half-way decent looking nude scene is a shower sequence in episode 2 that looks like it was stolen directly from Vampire Hunter D.  The fight scenes themselves are honestly kind of hilarious, not only in the logic behind them, but in the different ways they manage to rend the clothing of any given targeted area. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of anime where women punch and kick their opponents’ clothing to shreds, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen one where a bra is literally punched off, still in one piece, like the force of the impact somehow unhooked it. The backgrounds are lazy, the movement of extras is minimal at best, and the main character just makes the derpiest expressions whenever she feels the cardinal emotions of anger or despair.  It’s been a while since I talked about the opening theme of an anime, but lord this one stands out for all the wrong reasons. Every single episode starts off with the soothing melody of an electric guitar doing an impression of a fire alarm. I’m a pretty big fan of Kaidoku Funou by Jinn... It’s my favorite Code Geass opening, what with it’s Garbage-meets-The-Donnas aesthetic, but I know I’m in the minority. I’ve heard lots of people call it off-key, shrill and annoying, which means Tatsumaki Wave by Little Non is MY Kaidoku Funou. It sounds like Avril Lavigne trying to cover Britney Spears’ Toxic. The rest of the music isn’t much better, but I barely noticed it.  The English dub, I am sad to say, is annoyingly, disturbingly, distressingly, unforgivably... Good. Like it’s actually really good. Just about every Funimation regular is in this show, and they do a stellar job, especially Cherami Leigh, who is just an absolute champ at making the shrill Natsume as likeable as possible, and Monica Rial, who played against her usual type to make a pretentious sounding lore dump in the final episode(not even the worst of the episode) sound almost palatable. A sad exception is the main actor, who plays her role... I don’t want to say half-assedly, because it does sound like she’s trying her best, but more like half-heartedly, where there are moments where she genuinely sounds like she doesn’t want to be there. She works under an alias, as Anita Neukar, and while it’s usually not my policy to do so, I am going to respect her wishes on that.  Funimation has a weird history of giving some of their best possible effort to fanservice titty shows that do NOT deserve the attention, and this OVA is no exception. The actors put their all into reading their absurd and often repulsive dialogue, recreated faithfully but altered just enough so that the glut of awful Japanese puns will be accessible to English speakers, and I know I’m going to sound ungrateful for saying this, I’m kind of disappointed by that. If this show had come out a few years prior, and had found it’s way to the desk of ADV Films... Or a few years later, with Sentai Flmworks... I have no doubt in my mind that someone like notorious ADR director Stephen Foster could have given it the Ghost Stories treatment, albeit maybe on a smaller scale, just basing an entire dub around calling out it’s own material for how stupid and non-sensical it is.  But yeah, really good dub. Go figure.  So here’s what this show is, and this is probably the best description I can possibly give it. Let’s say you’re playing a table top RPG, similar to DND but in a modern setting. The DM says you each create your own female combatant character... Humans only, of course, but weird gimmicks are encouraged... Who will battle each other to the death in a series of one on one fights. Simple, intriguing idea, could be fun. Immediately after the game starts, however, he railroads the game and makes you the main character, placing you in literally every single fight except for the introductory one between another player character and his own DMPC. You fight all the other player characters, personally, and when you’re losing, DM gives you some BS power-up so you win anyway for the sake of his story. At the end, DM mercilessly dumps layers upon layers of cruel, soul crushing plot twists on you about the game and your character, and you just have to sit there, jaw dropping further and further to the floor, as he revels in his own delusional sense of depth.  The whole game just follows a bunch of edgelord murder hoboes calling out ridiculous attacks against each other while the ‘mastermind’ behind it all sets up fetish scenarios for each fight, saving every defeated player character to serve his own twisted, perverted endgame that none of their creators would have allowed given the choice. This anime reeks of poor planning and world building, revolving around a concept that could have worked if they spent any time trying to make sense out of it instead of focusing all their time in writing reveals, none of which were properly foreshadowed. It’s a secret tournament, but it takes place in broad daylight in the middle of the street. Combatants are putting their lives on the line for one perfect wish, but they shoot themselves in the feet by basing their entire combat styles on overly complicated gimmicks. Remember in my review of Key the Metal Idol, how I said it’s only glaring flaw was that it spent the majority of it’s feature-length penultimate episode lore dumping to explain the mystery to the viewer? I take it back. This show does the same thing, only far worse, and in far less time.  The only reason I could imagine anyone subjecting themselves to this cringe-fest... Aside from inviting some friends over and drinking until it’s funny, which I’ve done... Is for the uncensored nudity, which this show has in spades, outside of one indoor pool scene that stands as a lone, and very weird exception. My friends, it has often been said that I like boobs. My friends, I like boobs. Friends, I love boobs. I love when they’re bare, I love when they’re not covered by hair, steam or streams of light, and I absolutely hate it when uncensored manga are adapted into TV safe anime, sacrificing my beloved boobies in the process. I won’t deny that watching Master of Martial Hearts after watching an anime that constantly teased you with TV-safe nudity does create a favorable comparison for it... This show can be a serious palette cleanser after watching something like A Sister’s All You Need, Fire Force, or let’s just be honest here, pretty much anything by Hiro Mashima.  But you know what else could serve that particular esoteric purpose? A lot, actually. Even in a modern market where the inclusion of uncensored nudity in non-hentai anime is becoming less and less common for the sake of appealing more and more to the puritanical American market, there will always be options out there, and they will always be better than this crap. You could watch Highschool DXD, supplementing your fanservice with intense, suspenseful demonic action. You could watch Strike Witches, supplementing your fanservice with high-octane aerial combat and a cast of extremely likeable characters. You could watch A Centaur’s Life, and supplement your fanservice with smart social commentary and some of the ballsiest world-building I’ve ever seen. I know there’s a lot of horny 14 year olds who probably don’t have any self respect, and I’m saying this as someone who was once one of you... You deserve better.  Master of Martial Hearts is available from Funimation. I should warn you, they were so desperate to sell this puppy that they put fanart of three characters topless right in the inside cover of the DVD, do with that information what you will. It’s supposedly based on a video game of the same name, but I can’t find any proof that it actually existed, like, ever. That says a lot.  If Ikki Tousen were to have a baby with Fate Stay/Night, Master of Martial Hearts would be the afterbirth. It starts out bad, and it never gets better, oh no, quite the opposite. This series goes downhill faster and faster, leading up to an infamously rancid trainwreck of a conclusion that has to be seen to be believed. I don’t think this show is quite as bad as the worst anime I’ve ever seen... Which I’ve vowed to only ever refer to as “Name redacted” until the end of time... But that’s also probably because it’s only five episodes long, I can’t make any guarantees for how much more bafflingly heinous it would be if it were stretched out to a more standard 14 episode length. As it is, it’s more of a challenge than entertainment, something you survive rather than just watch. For literally anything that you think you can get out of it, just watch Highschool DXD. Trust me.  I give Master of Martial Hearts a 1 out of 10.";Not Recommended
19;Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart;SweetStreetGX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SweetStreetGX;4;"Master of Martial Hearts is a mixture between Mortal Kombat & My Little Pony, but in all the wrong ways. Everything about this anime is bad. The story is dumb, there's no other way that I can describe it. It's just dumb.

The original soundtrack is meh. It's not really the type of soundtrack you'd want to listen to on a daily basis. However, when there's bad, there has to be good (or at least tolerable in this case). The animation is actually OK; for an anime based on an original project, it's quite good. The voice acting is also good, but it still doesn't help how sh!tty most of the dialogue is.

0;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;When I first started watching this series, I originally thought, “Oh, it's just another anime with cool guys and girls using superpowers and flying around like Superman-wannabees.”. Of course, that was before I watched its parent story, Zettai Karen Children. But more so, it was before I fully embraced the spinoff known as Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke. This new piece of work that Manglobe is presenting here could be defined as their latest line in their evolution of supernatural phenomenon. In fact, Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited takes supernatural with a world of super powers and transforms it into profound psychic tale starring....  The one and only Hyoubu Kyousuke  Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke is a spinoff the original Zettai Karen Children. It is presented by Manglobe, a Japanese anime studio, who is known for some of its other works involving supernatural such as Deadman Wonderland, Ergo Proxy, and The World That God Only Knows. And now here we are with their latest presentation. Now, this series can spell out a lot of questions for potential fans. One of most common ones may be something along the line of, “Do I need to watch the original Zettai Karen Children?” From my perspective, it is not necessary but I would say that it can open some insight as well as background to this spinoff. But of course, this isn't the parent series. This is UNLIMITED featuring Hyoubu Kyousuke as the star of the show.  The way the series is adapted is quite a peculiar one from my point of view. Even from the starters, we can clearly see that Hyoubu Kyousuke is not your typical hero. Rather, he can be seen as an anti-hero with the way he dresses, the way he acts, the words he speaks, and the action he commits. With his silver jet hair and floating around the city, he is a man of many mysteries especially behind that devious smile. Even from the beginning, he seems to have devious plans from his head. For example, he has himself taken prisoner on purpose for the reason to save one of his own partners in crime. He often thinks before he acts and is calculating toward his goals. Additionally, Kyousuke seems to be a man with a brilliant mind and often plans strategically in order stay ahead of his adversaries. As the leader of the mysterious organization, P.A.N.D.R.A, Kyosuke shows why he is the leader with his ruthlessness when events calls for it. He really is a star of his own show here folks.  Having seen the original series, Zettai Karen Children, this spinoff originally put me on odds side with Kyousuke. In fact, he is an antagonist from the original title. Here, he is portrayed as a protagonist. (although I see him more as an anti-hero) I found out the easy way during the first few episodes when Kyousuke is able to pull off his plan in his own 'heroic' effort. With that, he even meets a new friend by the name of Andy Hinomiya. He has a mysterious power of his own that can be compared to a certain unlucky protagonist from another series. I won't spoil here so watch more to find out. At any rate, he is introduced as an anime original character who joins P.A.N.D.R.A. His friendship with Kyousuke seems to be based on both fear and respect. Yet, they do work hand-in-hand and often times gets the job done. Speaking of anime original, there is the cute Yuugiri. She is a strange girl with the ability to read minds but that often puts her at odds with society. She is even viewed sometimes as a 'monster' for just being an esper. This isn't surprising though as the world often sees those who are special regarded as being a threat to society. Among others of the team includes includes some returning characters from the original series such as You Fujiura, Momiji Kanou, and Shirou Magi. They make up the firepower of the team and gives P.A.N.D.R.A a reason to being so feared and dominant.  So, this spinoff takes the setting in a more dark city atmopshere as opposed to the 'family oriented' atmosphere that the original Zettai Karen bought to us years ago. Honestly, who remembers that stuff anyways? In most of today's anime series, the market often aims at viewers for fan service, gore, and those romance subplots. Thankfully, this series avoids most of that and aims directly towards the story along with its strong cast of characters. With his name being set as the title, it is no surprise that Kyousuke gets the most attention even through the flashback scenes we see in later episodes. The other characters aren't omitted either as they all get his or her own little spotlights.  The story focuses mainly on the organization that Kyosuke sets up. His idea is to save Espers of his own kind because the way society ostracizes them. In fact, Espers in this spinoff are not seen as saviors of the world but as harbingers of destruction. It can easily be taken the fact even from the pilot episode given Andy's treatment behind that prison. It's cruel for them just because they are “different” from others. The way I see this though is an utter misunderstanding. In fact, some of the people who treats the Espers themselves can be seen as the real monsters to society. It's irony at its very best. However, this shouldn't be entirely be blamed on such trivial accusations that Espers are evil. There have been facts which proves the existence of espers to be a threat in the case of criminals in the series. As a matter of fact, Kyosuke's father ran into a case many years ago that changed his outlook on espers forever.  The series seems to lack the ultimatum for its plot. I guess the long story short here is that this spinoff contains way too many mysteries. It starts off fast and keeps its pace here and there. As mentioned before, Kyousuke acts with a plan through his head and cunning strategies. But most of the time, I find that this is almost redundant. The guy is nearly unstoppable and presented as being a boss. His powers of flight, telekinesis, and super strength is overpowered as he takes the skies and dominates in most of his fights. Even from the original series, Kyousuke is calculating and manipulative with his actions. In this spinoff, he is no different and often plays his plans like a chessboard. The pieces are his organization but rather than using them, Kyousuke plays the role of a leader leading them through missions.  The action of the series is also full throttle and packed with explosive warfare. It doesn't run through egoistic dialogues and strange gags but gets straight to the point. Otherwise, it does occasionally lack a bit of flavor as it just seems stale. Additionally, I find the characters' designs to be a bit generic. With the lack of fan service, the characters' clothing makes its impression through..generic designs. Their seemingly lack of attractiveness in their outfits also makes their stance a bit dull. The result often leads to a repetitive fight scenes and in general, a lack of flavor. If they were so 'badass', why not go all out and make the skies your God?  Oh wait, they don't need to do that since being OP does all that for them already.  In terms of overall visuals, I thought the series did a great job here. Taken on the opposite side of the original series, Unlimited makes its way of with more of a cutting dark age background. It's not on a dystopian level but gets its point across in that the world the espers live in is not a paradise. The artwork of the city in fact reflects more of a 'gotham' like atmosphere, one where there are criminals and people who prejudices against others just based on personal outlooks.The characters' design in particular Kyousuke show that they are indeed not normal. I mean, look at that silver hair and you tell me if you see that often in real life. It's definitely not something you see every day.  The soundtrack of this spinoff makes a strong impression on me. Its organ plays and style of choice in using more of a dramatic tone enhances the theme of a dark series as opposed to the family-oriented Zettai Karen Children. In other words, most of the soundtrack is serious because the series makes its way of being darkier, edgier, and sexier. (in that Unlimited way) The OP song LΛST RESOLUTION (for some reason performed both in English and Japanese), shows the revolution in which Kyousuke sets towards those who are a threat to espers. Oh and those various ED songs? Pleasure to my ears.  Overall, this underrated series gets a score of “8” from me. I don't know about you but Unlimited sure got my attention. No, it's not because I watched the original series so I can get a taste of the spinoff. But rather, the characters, setting, and the general mood of the story gives a more defined way of the psychic world. Despite having some generic/shounen fight styles, I feel that this series pulled it off right. It doesn't seemed to be forced and balances itself well between its subplots. Hell, even the flashback arc was an entertaining watch. Ultimately, I would like to ask people to give this series a shot. It's not perfect but a definitely a way to make your time pass by. At least it did for me. After all, time isn't unlimited so make use of it wisely. This series right here is something you should spent that time on.;Recommended
1;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;B3astpwn;https://myanimelist.net/profile/B3astpwn;10;"This anime is 12 episodes long. It's fast paced with lots of action scenes, sarcastic moments, sad moments, pretty much everything. When i first saw the first episode i knew i was going to enjoy this anime. It has that compassion side towards it, where not many action anime's have it so early into the anime.  Story 9/10  I've rated the story 9/10 because for starters, it's 12 episodes long. It's fast paced which i like especially for a short series. The plot makes sense, and the pace is very smooth.  Art 10/10  The art you see in this anime may remind you of the newer animes, like Hamatora or Jormungand. They spice up the art to look exactly what you'd want! For an evil bad guy, or a good guy with hatred in his soul, they certainly focus to bring out the key details to make you want to go, ""WOW This anime Has it!""  Sound 10/10  I love the OST's. It's so filling, with every battle scene the background music is insane! Legit hype. Definitely lives up to having one of the best OST's out there.  Character 7/10  The character development is fairly decent. At first you have your Main character, (DONT WORRY NO SPOILERS!) Who's trying to find his power. How do they go upon this? Well...he meets new people, and blah blah blah. . It goes on from there! I rated this a 7/10 solely because of how they went about to show how he develops, mainly towards the acting part and just...the way how they did it.  Enjoyment 10/10  I solely enjoyed this anime to the fullest! I've watched it all and I Absolutely Love it! It's just like Hamatora, HxH 2011, A hint of DBZ maybe, Jormungand, basically it's an all around perfect anime! Obviously there's more anime's i can name that are similar to this one, but that would just make this review too long xD.  Overall 10/10  Yes it's true, a 10/10 Anime! Whoever watches this anime will come out loving it! The art, the humor, the plot, the characters, everything! Well. . . what really caught my attention was how the characters acts towards one another. It's not that usual anime where if somethings bothering one of our MC's, the other MC will just be like, oh, okay well hope you get better. NO! It's more than that! Its...Its...ART!";Recommended
2;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Toucanbird;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Toucanbird;7;"The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke: It Has Its Limits  Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited was actually one of the more surprisingly good series I watched out of the Winter 2013 lineup. One of the nice things about this series is while it does have the Zettai Karen Children name slapped to this series, you don't actually have to watch the original Zettai Karen Children to understand the story. I certainly hope that didn't deter anyone from watching this series, because it nearly deterred me since I originally had no interest in the series. I originally thought you had to watch the first Zettai Karen Children to follow the plot...and after hearing about how mediocre that series was, I wasn't looking forward to it. As I said, you fortunately don't have to sit through Zettai Karen Children to understand it since this is more an alternative setting that's connected to that series.  The story follows the story of a powerful anti-hero esper named Kyousuke Hyoubu that leads PANDRA, a band of espers against a society that generally doesn't accept espers equally. Espers are commonly imprisoned or used by government organizations for their own personal gain. The story begins with Kyousuke breaking into an esper prison to rescue one of his PANDRA members that had been imprisoned there. While in the prison, he receives assistance from an inmate named Andy Hinomiya. After successfully accomplishing the prison break, Andy decides to join PANDRA and assist Kyousuke with his goals of recruiting espers and trying to bring an end to humanity's rule over espers. However, it turns out Andy has a different goal in mind when he joins the group. Overall, I found the story to be fairly good and the plot itself to be outstanding. I was intrigued by the plot and found it to be an interesting set piece on how unforgiving society can be towards people that can be considered different.  The strongest aspect of The Unlimited was its animation. I found the animation to be downright gorgeous. The character designs were precise, clear cut, and reflected the personalities of each character rather well. However, where this series really shined was the atmospheric animation when an esper was releasing their power, like when Kyousuke or Yugiri were releasing their powers. It really did a great job of creating a feel that espers are all-powerful beings and provide a reason why they are feared in a normal human society. My jaw dropped at how gorgeous the animation was when Kyousuke turned off his limiter. I have to give credit to Manglobe, they are on their A-game when they create dark, atmospheric anime like this one. This is not a sunshine and rainbows series. The animation is dark, gritty, and can get downright graphic at times. While I wouldn't put it in the same category as a Deadman Wonderland for its grittiness or Ergo Proxy for its dark atmosphere, it seems to do a nice job of balancing the two. It's actually impressive considering Shishou Igarashi (Director) and Jun Takagi (Chief Animation Director) aren't the most experienced in anime directing. This was definitely a good stepping stone for their careers if they can continue to create animes as polished as this one from an animation standpoint.  The music and voice acting was also incredibly strong as well. The music really knew how to set the mood and I have to give a ton of credit to Koutarou Nakagawa for creating such an excellent soundtrack. Personally speaking, I have a lot of respect for his prior works that include Code Geass, Gosick, and Scryed to name a few. He brought out his best for this series as well and it paid off. The seiyuus were also remarkably well-cast, with most of the original Zettai Karen Children cast returning to their roles for this series. Kouji Yusa returned to his role of Kyousuke, which I must be glad for because he seemed to play the role of a mysterious, all-powerful esper perfectly. Junichi Suwabe played the role of the eccentric, but naive Andy quite well and the young, up-and-coming Nao Touyama's portrayal of Yugiri was downright adorable. I even got a laugh at how dynamic the castmembers were. Aya Hirano played both Kaoru from The Children AND a young Kyousuke from flashbacks...and the scary part was I couldn't even tell she was playing both roles until I read the cast listing. Just more proof that Aya Hirano is one of the best in the business. I will give Manglobe one thing, they do excellent cast work and even I have to admit, I got a chuckle out of the subtle Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd reference in one of the episodes.  Where The Unlimited fell a little short in my opinion, with the pun intended, was the length. Considering how detailed the plot was, it felt like there wasn't enough time to hash out the characters. It was slightly difficult to get attached to the other PANDRA members besides the leads because their exposure was limited and the supporting cast aboard the Catastrophe didn't get a whole lot of development. Although, perhaps they received that development in the original series and I just wasn't exposed to it, but it felt a little difficult to become attached to PANDRA's team dynamic. Considering the feel of the series, plot elements seemed slightly rushed at times. The team sort of jumped from one plot point to the next with little rhyme or reason. I also found the flashback back story to be a little out of place and slightly mundane. I didn't feel as though it added a whole lot to the story...or rather its focus didn't add much. It did play a big role in the story as it wore on, but I felt its focus was a bit off since it didn't seem to portray Saotome's character motivations very well. The way segments were edited during the series, it seemed as though this series was longer, but editorial mandate required things to be cut altogether. ""Cut-and-paste"" is really the best way I can describe this series at times. It didn't completely ruin my Unlimited viewing experience, but it was quite noticeable.  On the whole, The Unlimited is a REALLY good series to watch if you're looking for a supernatural shounen series. It has an awesome plot and an interesting cast of characters (albeit somewhat underdeveloped) with excellent animation and a very nice, atmospheric soundtrack. While I wouldn't call The Unlimited an amazing series, I would call it a rather pleasant surprise. I got a lot more than I expected when I started to watch it. It's a shame this series just wasn't a tad bit longer because there was quite a lot of material to work with. This series certainly had a ton of potential. I did feel this series ended on a pretty good note since it had a satisfying ending. It concluded rather well, but also left enough open to continue if Manglobe does decide to do so. If nothing else, this series certainly did a wonderful job of advertising for its predecessor. I am somewhat intrigued to watch Zettai Karen Children now despite it being considered a somewhat mediocre series by the general public. Perhaps if these two series tie in well together, it might alleviate some areas of mediocrity both series might have had. I would highly recommend this series if you enjoyed animes like To Aru Majutsu no Index or Deadman Wonderland. It has similar psychic elements compared to Index, but also has the beautifully atmospheric animation and social commentary comparable to Deadman Wonderland, although not as gritty. Overall, the Unlimited isn't an amazing series, but is still a fun watch for those that enjoy some exciting psychic-powered action.";Recommended
3;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;7;"Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke is a spinoff to Zettai Karen Children that tones down on much of the comedy to the series, focuses more on its darker and serious elements, and shifts major focus from the Children of BABEL to our series titular anti-hero and his comrades among the esper resistance organization known as PANDRA. An esper by the name of Andy Hinomiya with the power to negate esper powers winds up joining PANDRA during one of Kyosuke's missions, being a secret agent sent to infiltrate the organization and finding his loyalties to come into question as he becomes more acquainted with PANDRA's familial environment and operations.  With Unlimited's more serious bent and the focus shifted on Kyosuke, it is more focused on exploring the hostility between espers and humans from his perspective as we come to learn more of the operations and treatment of his fellow espers that our lead is committed to with his organization. This creates some nice intrigue throughout the first half of the series as Kyosuke and PANDRA butt heads with the Children and BABEL at points, serving as nice foil to the differing ideologies that both organizations have regarding the treatment of espers since both sides would be justified in their actions due to the differing circumstances that both groups arose out of. A couple episodes in the second half of the series even provide back story into Kyosuke's past with how he developed his beliefs against humans during World War II. The addition of Andy to the mix lends more to the story as well where we see his character's internal conflict over whether or not to back Kyosuke's cause as he performs his mission due to feeling neglected by both humans and espers due to his negating abilities. Still for those who did enjoy Zettai Karen Children, the Children do pop up alongside the members of BABEL at points throughout this series and there are occasional comedic bits to lighten the mood which don't detract too badly from Unlimited's more darker storytelling.  In spite of my praises though, the series does have its flaws. The final quarter of the series does take a hit a bit quality-wise when the fun gray moral storytelling crosses into more typical ""save the world"" territory when an enemy from Kyosuke's past makes his emergence felt in spite of no explanation being provided as to how he survived against Kyosuke decades earlier during the war. The ending felt like a bit of a cop-out as well where the series teased of some dire problems that Kyosuke was facing toward the second half of the series yet the final episode to Unlimited hand waves this issue aside to maintain much of the status quo that the series had from its start. Also, Unlimited isn't really breaking any new ground for an anime as there have been a decent number of titles made in recent years depicting dark and serious storytelling mixed with morally grey implications, notable ones being Black Lagoon and Gunslinger Girl.  Presentation-wise, Unlimited is an improvement over Zettai Karen Children as the series sports a bigger animation budget. Character designs and scenery shots sport more detail and the color shading is noticeably darker to compliment the title's more serious storytelling. In addition, the battle scenes are a treat as many of them feature fluid movement taking place as espers either fight one another using their powers or unleash them against fleets of military forces. There are occasions where the series cuts on some corners with its animation with shortcuts, but it is nowhere as frequent as what Zettai Karen Children did. To flow with the darker storytelling, Unlimited sports a mix of dramatic and J-rock tracks that do their part to compliment key scenes throughout the show's run, though the tracks lack much in the way of subtlety for the type of mood that it wants you to believe that Unlimited has.  Overall, Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke makes for a decent alternative to Zettai Karen Children as the focus on Kyosuke lends it some more morally grey implications and offers a solid amount of intrigue over both justifying whether BABEL or PANDRA's objectives are right on the esper-human conflict and new series character Andy becoming conflicted over whom he desires to ally with. It does have its bumps in quality for its second half and it doesn't break any new ground as titles with dark, serious and morally grey storytelling have been done before. But if you are looking for a psychic-action title that is a decent time killer, then Unlimited offers just that.";Recommended
4;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Arixaya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arixaya;10;"First: I didnt watch more then 1 ep of the original ""Zettai Karen Children"" and in my opinion it is not necessary to do so. This spinoff is nothing like it.  The Anime has an overall ""Dark"" feeling, and you will like to watch it if you like : → mysterious powers → badass (esper) guys fighting, maybe not for the world peace, but for esper freedom ^^ → to solve the secret behind unlimited Power! → a great storyline and explanation about how espers got introduced into the present society   Its the story about Hyobu, and how he started to be what he is: An esper with Unlimited Powers, and a leader of an esp criminal organization. It still means that hes a bad guy, but it explains why hes like that.  (slight spoiler) The presented world has many conflicts between espers and government - the governments of Japan and USA, want to use espers for their purposes, while Hyobu tries to free the espers completely from the Governments Control with every means possible. That is, in fact, kill the ""normals"". So the conflict between esp users and ""normals"" has to be solved somehow.   ( more Spoilers alert! )  Andy Hinomiya, an human with the power to negate esp powers in a certain radius, is told to infiltrate the Catastrophe, Hyobu Kyousukes ship, with a mission from the US Governnment. There is a prediction of a ""Queen of Catastrophe"" that will rule over the espers and finally give them freedom, and while Hyobu tries to do everything possible to make the prediction come true, other people want to hinder his plans. Everything is for the purpose of changing the Future of human and esper interaction.";Recommended
5;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Notalice;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Notalice;7;"I have yet to finish the original but The Unlimited H.K. is pretty stand alone as its spin-off focusing on Kyousuke, a sort of enigmatic criminal from Zettai Karen Children. Despite the somewhat lack of depth in plot, character development and just not exploring all the settings to the full extent, there're a few things I really like in this series.  First the protagonist is ideally imperfect, strong and likable. His character is significantly enriched through the 2 episodes about his past as well as throughout the entire anime where he takes on a lot of burden to protect his crew. Here, the flashbacks are used perfectly for the purpose of augmenting the understanding of his motives. There's a lot of potential to this character yet he somehow puts all of his hope in the ""Queen of Catastrophe"". It is a mystery whether he is a true prophet or just a fool. On the other hand, his powers (and the other characters') and mission plans (especially in the first half) are not explained at all. Although this is not necessary the fault of his character, the quality of the show as an independent piece is quite reduced due to the confusion caused by the lack of explanation.  The newly added protagonists are not too thoroughly developed to my disappointment. Especially, the whole set up of the protagonist, Hinomiya, is made to seem like a coincidence and a farce with his superb naivety. It's not like he fully trusts his organization in the first place and yet, as fishy as the orders sound, he still goes and does something unwarranted. Also, him being not really ESPer and not completely Normal would've added more depth on his part but wasn't delved into at all. Yuugiri's role is also not fulfilled for the majority of the show despite being a main character. It is another mystery how she ended up in the prism in the first place.  Regarding the story, I really expected much more than what it delivers. The unraveling of the climax is too straightforward and predictable. Also, I find the ending somewhat vague. On a grander look, there's not enough light shed on the future where the ESPers and Normals will hold together. I think the main set-back of this anime is the narrow minded psyche as well as the isolation in settings especially since it focuses on a social, cultural and political revolution for the ESPers and for *peace of humanity. Whatever that is.  With consideration of the topic's complexity, it's understandable that the development is unsatisfying. This aspect is similar to X-Men from Marvel.  Secondly, from a director's standpoint, the pacing and scene cuts are really well done. The op really gets me hyped up and the hue changes depending on the content of each episode. The graphics is standard and character designs are somewhat interesting.  Compares to the original, the spin-off is a lot less childish and contains somewhat sophisticated elements such as war, human rights, experimentation... Although I still feel that the anime is aimed for 12 year-olds with the avoidance of exploring gore and death, lousy scientific foundations, flashy action scenes. and weak military defense.  Despite its obvious flaws and lack of exploring its full potential, perhaps it has been a little underrated. I would watch it for Kyousuke's awesomeness and for a good kill-time but don't expect it to be mind blowing.";Recommended
6;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;rightyjen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rightyjen;9;"One of the most important things that I loved about this series was that although it was a spin-off, you did not need to watch the original series, Zettai Karen Children, to understand the storyline. In fact, having not watched the original may make this series all the more enjoyable to watch because everything will be new and you’ll be able to watch without previously formed opinions.  The artwork is extremely visually appealing. It leaved the childish, overly cartoon-like appearance of the original Zettai Karen Children and enters a more realistic and alluring style. The characters are drawn with dramatic features that draw you in and emphasize the mysteriousness of the storyline.  The characters themselves are seriously one of a kind. Hyoubu, leader of P.A.N.D.R.A. and one of the main characters, is a bit silly, somewhat immature but adamant in his belief. He is strong-willed and cares deeply for his people. Andy is the newest member of P.A.N.D.R.A. his past is very mysterious. Andy gains a lot of attention either for his fighting or for being ridiculed. You’ll find yourself questioning him frequently. Yugiri is a child with abilities stronger than imagined. She provides a sense of innocence and a common ground for Hyoubu and Andy.  The storyline is amazing. The main storyline leaves you wanting the next episode to come sooner. While they also present a side storyline, by constantly highlighting the mysteriousness of Hyoubu’s past and his life presently. The events of his past and childhood are tastefully revealed and weaved into the main plot carefully and thoughtfully. The series does not waste a single episode, and uses its episode frame effectively as to pack in everything without rushing the plot. The ending definitely leaves you satisfied.  The series was definitely a great must-watch that kept me anxious every week for the newest episode. There is just so much to love and enjoy; from the artwork to the storyline.";Recommended
7;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;NG_Chloe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NG_Chloe;9;I was browsing crunchyroll one day and cane across the unlimited Hyoubu Kyousuke. The description had sold me when it mentioned a silver hair, which for me Silver/white hair is my favorite color of hair. I had no idea what to expect when entering this series.  So what I got was awesome. Hyobu is an extremely entertaining character who is not only OP he also tends to be a bit of a troll. Though his can character can be very serious at times in the later parts.  The co-star of our story is Andy Hinomiya (a guy who looks strangely like Shun Asanaga from Endride), a character Hyobu found in jail(presumably because of Endride) and adds to his crew of loyal followers and a cute little girl.  the rest of the crew isn't really that important, except for the little girl Yugiri, whose the shy type. The other side characters are the main characters of the show this is a spin-off of, Zettai Karen Children or Psychic Squad. These characters oddly felt much more important than the other members of the crew(especially near the end).  One thing I really liked in this anime was the music, I love this soundtrack. The opening is all forms of awesome, and the ending themes(yes I said themes) are spectacular, special props to Darkness Night, which sets up some of the darker tones. One problem I find with having multiple endings though is that unless your that you'd have to re-watch a bit, as there is one ending that lasts only an episode.  The animation is also really good for an anime original. This anime, along with Kabaneri of the iron fortress, and a few other shows, is raising my hopes for anime originals.  I can say that this show is a must watch, though there is some plot brought up that you would probably need to read the manga to view.;Recommended

10;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Ketamigo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ketamigo;9;First things first:  This is a standalone anime. By no means do you have to know anything about the original series to understand or enjoy this one. In fact, I never had even heard of the original series, and when I did look into it, it seemed totally out of my interest zones due to the Loli and little girl bullshit. I hate cutesy anime, and I don't even really like typical Shonen/fighting anime, so I don't plan on watching it anytime soon.  The unlimited is, sadly, relatively unknown and therefore under appreciated. It's equal parts mystery, fighting and alternative history, and it does almost everything right.  A recent show that actually has gotten much hype and critical acclaim that I could compare The Unlimited to would be Bungo Stray Dogs- more the second season than the first, as the first season of BSD was riddled with randomness and unfunny jokes, while the second season was darker and more character oriented. This show is very character oriented, and towards the middle and end delves into particular characters history and psyche very admirably.  Although it is sometimes seemingly episodic, there is a definite main story that never fails to entertain. Although much of the second half of the show is serious, and sometimes the show can even get quite dark, the family-like dynamic that builds between the characters always keeps things light enough to be enjoy as a casual show as well.  The cliffhangers between episodes made it so I finished this show in just a few days. It's quite short, but it doesn't waste a minute, so the story is actually well rounded and doesn't disappoint near the end- like so many anime that are front-loaded with intriguing story, but fail to deliver and eventually feel like a waste of time.  This show was obviously a labor of love for the crew behind it, and the quality of the show shines through in every episode.  There are definitely some original X-men cartoon vibes here, but not nearly as much as some other reviewers have suggested. I'd go so far as to say this show outshines anything in the x-men universe anyway.  Mystery, espers, WWII, modern day Japan, a magic ship 🚢 and some government agents, plus a tight knit group of friends - what do they have in common?  The Unlimited, of course.;Recommended

I watched the first episode and I was just immediately hooked. I must admit though that I did not see the mother show, Zettai Karen Children. I had found this and just thought that I had to watch, even though I am still unaware what the mother story actually brought to the table.  Story: Ok, I gave the story an 8, but don't expect the most intricate storyline ever. So don't expect a puella magi madoka magica. but it's actually not that bad, a little standard but also some little twists to keep everyone hooked. I was and I can't stand slow and boring storylines =P  Art: WOW, just wow. the colours are so vivid it's astounding and the animation is top notch. smooth, colourful and just pure awesome.  sound: you can sort of tell by the music that it was never really meant as a story on itself. The series has 9 endings if I counted correctly, so +/- 1 or so in real probably. the opening scenes also change but the song stayes the same. The music adds to the series and it's wonderfully done, but personally no real chill down the spine sound that caught my attention. Still, quality is amazing so way to go.  Characters: it's a 12 episode series, so how deep can you go with character development. We still are unaware of some backgrounds and the side characters are hastily explained. The main characters, however, do get a proper background story and development on their part is surely not disappointing. We have all sorts of personalities, which is a +, and of course we have Yugiri whom we all just want to hug and cuddle and she's just too cute. Of course Hyobu is someone you quickly get to love too, wondefully made character and non-faked personality.  enjoyment: well, I think I've said it all really. I LOVED the unlimited, couldn't stop watching. enjoyment is a 10+.  so overal, really not bad guys. must watch if you ask me! ;)";Recommended

Its truly a shame to look back at it 6 years later and think of it as an abandoned project, when it could have been so much more. An amazing anime with very little appreciation or consideration. If you haven't yet, give it a watch, you won't be disappointed in any corner. I hope someone gets to see this and responds because unlimited fans are on short supply and these days.

The watcher isn't slowly introduced to the series, like we know from many other shows, but thrown right in the middle of a (very one-sided) battle. And it doesn't stop there. Every episode up until the middle is pretty much P.A.N.D.RA. wiping the floor with their enemies until the show suddenly takes a turn into the department of drama. They remind us again that, no matter how strong you are, you are never invincible. All in all, this anime has everything. There is action, comedy, intrigues, angst, drama, the psychic powers of course and nothing overly excessive. And even though The Children show up a couple of times, they don't steal the show and don't act like the little spoiled brats they really are.

In contrast, the parent story, while touching on similar themes, does not explore them as thoroughly.  2. Morally Complex Themes: ""The Unlimited"" presents morally complex themes through Hyoubu Kyousuke's actions. As an anti-hero, he blurs the lines between right and wrong, forcing viewers to contemplate the concept of justice. This moral ambiguity provides a thought-provoking layer to the series that the parent story lacks.  3. Character Development: Hyoubu Kyousuke's character development is a highlight of ""The Unlimited."" He undergoes a significant transformation throughout the series, grappling with his past, his choices, and his role in the world. This evolution makes him a more dynamic and relatable character than Kaoru, who experiences growth but does not face the same level of moral ambiguity.  4. Exploration of Power: ""The Unlimited"" delves into the consequences of immense power, particularly through Hyoubu Kyousuke's abilities. This exploration of power dynamics and their impact on individuals and society adds a layer of intrigue that sets it apart from the parent story.  5. Hyoubu Kyousuke as Protagonist: While Kaoru is a central character in the parent story, Hyoubu Kyousuke takes the reins as the protagonist in ""The Unlimited."" His character is multifaceted, with a traumatic past that influences his actions. His willingness to embrace morally gray areas, coupled with his charismatic presence, makes him a more captivating lead than Kaoru.  [Character]  While Kaoru, the main character of the original ""Zettai Karen Children"" series, is undoubtedly a vital part of the story, Hyoubu Kyousuke takes center stage in ""The Unlimited."" His character is more morally complex, which adds layers of intrigue to the narrative. While Kaoru's journey is one of growth and self-discovery, but Hyoubu Kyousuke's character arc is more dynamic and emotionally charged. He's an anti-hero who challenges conventions, and that makes him a standout protagonist.  1. Complexity and Depth: Hyoubu Kyousuke's character is multi-faceted and complex. As the leader of PANDRA, a group of individuals with psychic powers, he grapples with the responsibilities of leading his team while pursuing his vision of a world where espers can live freely. His past experiences and his interactions with other characters in the series add layers to his character. In contrast, Kaoru, while being protagonist of the series, lacks the same level of depth and complexity.  2. Strong Motivations: Hyoubu Kyousuke's unwavering determination to protect and empower espers is a driving force in the series. His motivation is clear, and viewers can empathize with his desire for espers to live without fear of persecution. Kaoru's motivations are relatively straightforward, primarily centered around her friends and her sense of justice, but they don't carry the same weight as Hyoubu's.  3. Moral Ambiguity: Hyoubu Kyousuke's willingness to employ morally ambiguous means to achieve his goals adds an intriguing layer to his character. He constantly challenges the boundaries of right and wrong, forcing viewers to question their own moral perspectives. Kaoru, by contrast, tends to follow a more traditional path of heroism, which, can be less thought-provoking.  4. Screen Presence: Whenever Hyoubu Kyousuke is on screen, he exudes charisma and gravitas. His commanding presence captures the audience's attention and leaves a lasting impression. Kaoru, while a central character, doesn't possess the same level of magnetism.  [Art/Animation]  1. Stunning Character Design: The character designs are both unique and visually appealing. Each character's appearance reflects their personality and abilities, making them easily distinguishable. Hyoubu Kyousuke, in particular, stands out with his charismatic and enigmatic design.  2. Fluid Action Sequences: The action sequences in ""The Unlimited"" are beautifully choreographed and executed. The animation team does a fantastic job of bringing psychic battles to life with fluid movements and dynamic camera angles. This makes every battle a thrilling spectacle to watch.  3. Vivid Psychic Powers: The depiction of psychic powers is a visual highlight. Each esper's abilities are visually distinct and creatively presented. From telekinesis to pyrokinesis, these powers are brought to life with vivid and eye-catching visuals.  4. Detailed Backgrounds: The series pays attention to environmental details, creating a world that feels immersive and believable. Whether it's the bustling cityscape or the hidden facilities of PANDRA, the backgrounds are richly detailed.  5. Artistic Choices: ""The Unlimited"" makes artistic choices that enhance the viewing experience. These include dramatic lighting effects during intense moments and a color palette that reflects the mood of the scenes, from dark and brooding to bright and energetic.  In summary, ""Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke"" offers a richer and more morally complex narrative compared to its parent story. The exploration of esper discrimination, moral ambiguity, character development, and the consequences of power make it a superior series. Additionally, Hyoubu Kyousuke's role as the protagonist adds depth and charisma that elevate the series to new heights. If you're a fan of the ""Zettai Karen Children"" universe or simply enjoy thought-provoking anime, ""The Unlimited"" is a must-watch.

0;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited- Hyoubu Kyousuke is a shounen anime based on a manga by Shiina Takashi. The studio behind this adaptation of the series was handled by Manglobe, the studio behind Deadman's Wonderland, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, along with a bunch of things I haven't seen. I have no idea what to expect from this one. I'd describe that as intriguing, but the last time I expressed excitement at watching something completely unfamiliar I ended up watching Cheesesteak Suppository. Let's just take a look.  The story of Zettai Karen Children: Unlimited, henceforth referred to in this review as ZKC:U for the sake of brevity, opens with a silver-haired character named Hyoubu Kyousuke using ESP to wreck everything before allowing himself to be captured. He's taken to a prison camp for espers where he meets up with a young man named Hinomiya. The two start bonding and Hyoubu gives Hinomiya some of his food, which happens to be poisoned. Consequently, Hinomiya is taken to another facility. Hyoubu follows and the two escape along with a captured girl known as Yuugiri. Hyoubu offers Hinomiya a position in his organisation, P.A.N.D.R.A, which is accepted. But Hinomiya has a secret which could threaten Hyoubu and his organisation. The story mainly focuses on Hyoubu, his organisation and their goals. There are some things it does well and some it doesn't. Let's start with the latter. The pacing in this is pretty bad. they put some flashback episodes that don't serve much purpose directly in the middle of the series, which interrupts the much more interesting action that's going on in the story's present and leaves less time to flesh out the ending. As a result the ending ends up rushed and kind of weak. On the positive side, the world they create is pretty interesting and the story is mostly effective. With everything following a logical progression.  The characters in this, with the exceptions of Hyoubu and Hinomiya, aren't particularly well developed. Most characters tend to get either really obvious arcs or be archetypal characters without much to set them apart. That being said, the character interactions are really well done. Hyoubu and Hinomiya are also really interesting characters. Although Hyoubu has some moments that make him seem kind of creepy and make you wonder if he likes little girls in an inappropriate way. Particularly during his dealings with Kaoru. To ZKC:U's credit, it's vague enough that that may or may not be what's going on, but you should never have valid reasons to suspect that your protagonist is a pedophile when they're portrayed in a generally sympathetic way.  The art in this is pretty impressive. The character designs look good. The effects when certain espers use their powers are pretty flashy but they never cross into the realm of the ridiculous. The action sequences are, mostly, well done. With the exception of one in particular that happens later on in the series and features antagonists with worse aim than the Stormtroopers in Star Wars. That one just comes across as kind of stupid.  The voice acting in this is pretty well done. Suwabe Junichi, Yusa Kouji, and Hirano Aya in particular. The one real weakness is Touyama Nao, who doesn't have any depth of emotion. Although, to be fair, her character is supposed to be emotionally stunted. The music is quite good.  The yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri.  My final rating for ZKC:U is going to be a 6.4/10. It has some really interesting elements, but Hyoubu's semi-creepy scenes and the pacing do make it quite a bit less enjoyable than it could have been. With all things considered, it's still a decent series but not quite good.  Next week I'll look at Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino.;Mixed Feelings
1;Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke;Frying-_-Pan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Frying-_-Pan;6;"[This review is spoiler free!] TL;DR: This series had a lot of potential. Although there are plot twist, they are predictable and the character's boring, wish-washy nature made the dialogue sections long and skippable. The beautiful animation and battle scenes truly saved this show in my opinion.  Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke is the spinoff of the anime, Zettai Karen Children. I will begin this review by saying no, you don't have to watch the original to understand what's happening in The Unlimited. This is pretty much a stand alone show. You can go in totally blind.  For a 12 episode anime, the pacing is decent. Although I did find that some integral information was revealed too early, and the dialogue sections were extremely long winded. After episode 8 or 9, I found myself skipping the majority of the episodes because I wasn't interested in the background and lore of our favorite anti-hero, Hyoubu.  Without getting to into it and revealing any spoilers, Hyoubu's story isn't that unique. He's an esper who wants to seek revenge on all ""normals"" for how they treated him and his friends. This is a fairly common trope in esper fiction. I will say that Hyoubu felt like the only character with any real sense of motivation behind his actions. I found all the other characters to be severely lacking in this department.  If you have ever watched or read the parent series, Zettai Karen Children"", you will know of the organization B.A.B.E.L. While Hyoubu is the leader of the villainous group, P.A.N.D.R.A, B.A.B.E.L is a pillar of justice and seeks to arrest the evildoers at any cost. Except...not really? From the moment they are introduced, you are to believe that their only goal is to arrest Hyoubu and his gang, and stop them from their rampage of destruction across the world. And while that is their goal, it is only something secondary to them. In actuality, they want to save Hyoubu from himself and they believe rapid fire missiles are going to do the job.  Up until the episode where the writer's had to explicitly tell us such, I would have never known that was what they were trying to do. Their characters never tried to convey that sentiment through their actions. To me, it felt extremely disingenuous.  This is my biggest problem with The Unlimited. Besides the characters lacking the general drive/motivation to take action, they also tend to be extremely wishy-washy with their convictions. The biggest criminal of this would be Andy Hinomiya. I won't go into his origin, but, if you watch the first episode you will quickly find out. One second he thinks one way, another something else. Oh but, I can't do that. I must focus on my original task. But...  It's like an never-ending cycle of indecisiveness that leads up all the way until the very end of the anime. I found it to be extremely vexing because in his indecisive daze, he ends up saving the day.  Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke had a lot of potential to be something great. Yes, there were plot twist but they were all fairly predictable. However, besides the beautiful fight scenes and art, I would have probably ended up dropping this series half way. Besides Hyoubu, none of the characters were likable or memorable and the story was predictable enough that you could skim through episodes and would've have missed a thing. I began writing this review with a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The ending wasn't exactly what I had been expecting.  Although there was some good fights towards the end, nothing overly dramatic or awe-inspiring happened. I was left with the basic, ""It's the start of a new era,"" type of vibe. For me, this was especially disappointing because the few episodes prior made me feel like we ever on the homestretch the D-day. I was expecting the last battle to truly be the last, but eventually the sun broke through the clouds and ultimately we reached a happy ending. That's....okay, I guess.  If you are interested in the anti-hero esper vibe that The Unlimited presents, I would definitely recommend you try out ""A Certain Scientific Accelerator"".";Mixed Feelings
0;Zettai Karen Children OVA: Aitazousei! Ubawareta Mirai?;kluxorious;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kluxorious;7;"For some weird reason, I get addicted to Zettai Karen Children. After I finished the 51 episodes, I quickly jumped to the manga and has been following the series ever since. So naturally I'm ecstatic with the release of this OVA titled Changing Love! Take Back the Stolen Future? It was released on July 16, 2010 and it took me this long to watch it because of the same reason why I am not up to date at all with my summer anime: life.  The OVA takes place a few years after the Children last appearance in anime so they are more well developed. If you read the manga then you are happy to notice that even the PANDRA children has joined the Children at their school which mean, Yuri/Feather/Phantom Daughter is around too.  The story line for this OVA might be meh but the production team went to great length to make it clear in this OVA of the canon pairing of Kaoru and Minamoto so I'm a happy camper about that. I've been rooting for them even when Kaoru acted like an old man and sneaked around to see the girls pantsu. I approved.  The art and animation haven't differed much from the first season. They still wear unusual villain clothes and shit like that. I found it rather funny actually since the series looks like it was targeted for the younger children/teen but the manga has that ""mature"" tag to it. The irony.  Aya Hirano is still the seiyuu for Kaoru so obviously she does a good job at it. For the first time I though Yuuichi Nakamura sounds mighty sexy. I guess the plot kinda acquired Minamoto to have a sexy voice. I'm definitely going to remember him now, along with Tomokazu Sugita and Jun Fukuyama. The OP and ED still have that quality to it that will only remind you of the series without even have to second guess. I like the BGM during Minamoto and Hyoubu encounter before the real fight unfortunately I have no idea who sang it or what is the title of that song. It was pretty cool.  You can probably deduced of the character that I like the most (Kaoru) to my least favorite character (Yuri/Feather/Phantom Daughter) so I am not going to repeat myself here.  All and all, I like this OVA. It wasn't spectacular but it is something that will probably lead to second season of this series. I'll look forward to that. Let's make it official that I am now is gay for Kaoru as well";Recommended
0;Zettai Karen Children;NG_Chloe;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NG_Chloe;9;Let's start with my favorite parts of the show: The main Antagonist  Kyosuke for me is interesting, he's cool, he's likable, he's funny, and I have never wanted to join the villains organization more than I want to join PANDRA, Even the members are awesome.  Then there are the main characters in BABEL, now if I wasn't going to join PANDRA, and I was an Esper(#Esper_master_race), I would join BABEL maybe. That's because while I like most of the characters in BABEL, most of them should be fired or sent to prison. The chief is the the absolute worst character in the show, he wastes resources and harasses 10 year olds. Then there's Sakaki, who while actually being a very likable, would be arrested for some of the things he does in the office. Then Supervisor Tanizaki, who was extremely creepy in episode 4, Tanizaki is the other worst character in the show.  Then there's Director Fujiko, whose introduction could be edited out and it would change nothing, including her ability to drain other characters energy with physical touch, which was used in a pointless minute long seen that could be removed and change nothing. I actually do like Fujiko in some cases, but the first few episodes she's in are mediocre and in the grand scheme of things, pointless.  Next let's talk about my one of my favorite characters in the, Naomi! 2 out of her three episodes in the show were amazing, and they all have the same premise, Tanizaki(the creepy guy) is worried about her, and our main characters spy on her to figure out what's really going on. Other than episode 4, these episodes are really good.  Next let's talk about the main characters, Kaoru Akashi, Aoi Nogami, Shiho sannomiya, and Koichi Minamoto. These characters are really good, most of the time. The girls constant jealousy or attacks against Minamoto get annoying after a while. Minamoto himself, if you look had him individually, he is very bland. The girls themselves are likable in their individual characters are very likable, especially Kaoru, who has to be since she is probably the most important character in The Children. Aoi is cute, but annoying at times, and Shiho doesn't really have a lot to her in terms of character in the beginning, but gets better as time goes on.  There are also some some other characters who I really like, but we don't have time, we should move on to other parts. Let's talk about the music. I really love the music, even though I didn't like either of the opening themes at first but I grew to love opening 1, and like opening 2. I love all the endings, especially ending 3, I usually like female singers more than males, but I love the singing voice of Kouji Yusa(Hyoubu Kyousuke).  Next let's talk about the animation. The animation while outdated, looks really good to me. There is one episode in collection 3 when they have a really fast paced fight scene and they sacrifice a lot of detail fr the movement is what it feels like. There are also episodes that have good artistic direction, and bad artistic direction, where for some reason they make the screen sideways, like it's meant for some kind of Fanservice, but really just makes you dizzy.  Let's talk about the story, which the anime doesn't actually get to the main plot of the entire series till the end of collection 2. Now I'm not going to go too deep on spoilers, but there was a prediction of the future, and a select few characters are trying to prevent it in different ways, and realistically you know that it's going to happen because that would be anticlimactic. I like a lot of the events in the show that I personally like and though I really wish there was more of this show, because I really like a lot of the characters.  The ending we're given is serviceable, even though the manga is actually still continuing today. I really think that in few years we should get a remake that goes all the way to the more resent manga chapters, which in 2018 or 2019 the manga might be over. Now they could probably just remake the the whole series because not a lot of people have seen it, considering you can't really stream it anywhere legally, but I will say this show is worth buying, I rewatched several episodes in the show, but I would say that they should cut out some stuff in order to broaden its audience.  Like they could sensor a lot of the loli stuff, and though I'm kind of against the idea, they could do an FMAB and have a filler that tries to introduce us to the characters and stuff in order to skip some of the other stuff, I'm against the idea though, because you'd probably miss out on many amazing moments and a few hilarious moments too, but I would understand trying to get to when they're in middle school as fast as possible though.  I give this show my fullest recommendations to watch by any means necissary. I'd also like to have to possible remake to be licensed by funimation, becaused while they could never be as good as this Japanese cast, I would like it to be dubbed. The show is licensed by sentai filmworks and does not have a dub. It's also cheap to buy, which is another reason to buy it. I only spent 100 dollars on these four collection, and 25 on the spin off, The unlimted Hyobu Kyosuke. This show is known as Psychic squad on disc release;Recommended
1;Zettai Karen Children;Albelio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Albelio;7;"Currently this will be the 1st draft of this review. (I will make a better one after my Exam)  [Even though I gave it low grade, it comes from how hard I grade it and maybe it'll be bump up 1-2 points if graded by others]  To say it simple for simple understanding for simple people: Magical Girl  This show was really based on magical girls who were called ESPer instead and the main character of this show are the three Level 7 (highest level) children esper who luckily found someone who accepted them.  Story: (7/10) I must say Zettai Karen Children really gives me high expectation at first sight. The story was about Esper, as known as people who have abnormal powers (e.g. psykic, mind reading, teleportation), which was obvious that they'll be hate by normal people. That's really the strongest part of this story; is how to lead normal people and Espers to live together. However, this story doesn't allow that to happen easily and the obstacle called ""Normals"" who hate esper and ""PANDRA"", espers who hate normal. The story level ups when we knew that the people who are holding the future were 3 Esper children (Kaoru, Shiho, Aoi) . That part is what I like about the story, children, who were the future for us adults. We are leaving the future in their hands either for them to be good or evil and saving the world or destroy the world is up to their choice. Then we had this 20-years-old guy name Minamoto, who was the key to those 3 children future and the future of the world. The story will become fabulous if the main theme of ""co-opporation"" (since this story wants normal and abnormals to be together). Howeve, maybe due to the extremely long series (52 episode) the story does have some ""not relevant"" (extremely out of the blue) kind of episodes that doesn't makes sense. Thus, pulling it down from a 9 to an 8.  Art: (6/10)  We cannot expect much from art when they have 52 episodes to do, however, they still meet my expectation as albe to watch. There are no rag-doll and people move normally (well, most of them). However, their background sometimes totally fail and that also concludes to their characters. For conclusion their art was their weak point in this show. (No shining point at all)  Sound: (6/10)  Their sounds are good, but just barely good and not anything better. Their OP and ED are consider as above average (for only 2 OP and 1 ED) but still not good enough to make people remember it and want to listen to it again. Thus, pushing it down one grade from 10 to 9. Then sometimes they lack sounds at places where there should be sound effect there (even though most of the sound effect were heard and was good) and push it down to an 8. Finally is the character voice acting, as expected from high level voice actor (e.g. Aya Hirano) their sounds were very good, but when thinking ""They're currently acting as a 10-year old kids"" some part are not realistic enough to be 10 years old. Overall, their sounds made above average effect on the viewer.  Character: (7/10)  We did see a hell lot of interesting characters in the story. For Example, a guy name Muscle Okama (Muscle friends) who are gay and shoots laser beam from...ahem...that thing. The three main character have their character development from brats (sorry for rude words) who were spoiled to nice kids who were self-sufficient (a little). However, they do develop at some parts without any information leaving the viewers to questioning about when did they stop doing ""...."". The character did develop, but not to their critical yet and thus (also leaving the question of are they bad or good) only develop from brats to kids, but not to good children. They did show them at adult around 18 maybe. Next is balancement, main character were well balance with 3+1 however, the minor character just kept increasing and some are used only once and forgotten. If they can manage their character more (if they create a second season) then they'll earn more points.  Enjoyment: (7/10)  I can't believe myself that I'm saying this but I do enjoy this show to the level of watching it every 2 weeks after some episodes came out. Their series have loads of parody from many other animes (e.g. like Hayate no Gotoku) and some parody were clearly shown and not being the background image (e.g. Imitating of Death Note). However, they lack the timing of using their parody (the clearly shown one) and some ruined the moods of watching totally. Next was I enjoyed seeing how the children (girls) react to their supervisor (man) and also like seeing him get into many troubles ( funny, scary, gay-ish, almost dead). What really makes me annoyed the most was their acting like those Magical Girl series (ones where their transformation took the whole 1-4 minutes) and how some actions doesn't make sense. Overall I still see it as Enjoyable, but not to the extreme rate.  Overall: (7/10)  It is a show with a really interesting topic to do with. However how they express it from the anime wasn't sastified and I can't really give them anything more than 7 (Actually it should be a 6 but I gave them one more for interesting topic). My suggestion is that if you're those kind of loli's, parody and comedy lover it isn't a bad anime to try.";Recommended
2;Zettai Karen Children;AomiTatsuya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AomiTatsuya;9;"I am sure everyone who has watched this Anime would agree with me. Minamoto is a really irritating idealist who keeps on admonishing Hyoubu, saying he is the bane of all normals and some stupid stuff like that. He doesn't even try to understand Hyoubu's point of view.  Hyoubu is the SIGMA of the series. Other PANDRA members fall under the ALPHA category. Minamoto is a beta for sure. The other BABEL members are gamma's.  I have never seen such a bland characterization for a protagonist(Self-Proclaimed) Minamoto, who always spews idealist stuff and blames everything on Hyoubu and PANDRA. He doesn't even know the dark side of humans which is shown constantly in the series.  The main antagonist, is what they say but the true protagonist of the series Hyoubu is the most unique and most awesome character to be ever made. He is funny, powerful, sarcastic, kind, caring. He is a whole package. But the idealist Minamoto who spews nonsense always trains his gun at Hyoubu,  I liked Minamoto at the beginning but he kinda does the same thing, Hyoubu would just be taking to Kaoru but Minamoto will arrive and be like, ""don't go near him he is evil"", after literally being saved by Hyoubu. In reality i liked Sakaki who had a unique character very much unlike Minamoto.  The Girls were cute and funny, but sometimes i just skipped the stuff they say since they are boring. The school parts were funny. Kaoru grows into an OK character but the initial episodes in which they appear, Kaoru behaving like a pervert, Shiho like a mature yet yandere type character both sucked very much. Aoi is a silent character which i enjoyed since she is humble and not a creep like the other two.  Some evil espers do some bad deed, but Minamoto being the tunnel visioned beta blames who? You have guessed it right : Hyoubu. Someone is hypnotized, someone is killed, someone is kidnapped : Hyoubu. Someone is saved : BABEL. BABEL is the place where love beats power. Even in BABEL chief doesn't see the girls as girls but treasures. More like things that show the domination of their country. Good job BABEL. This is the propaganda they spread. Looking at it now, makes me laugh my ass off.  My only wish was Hyoubu to have been in all 52 episodes atleast for 10 mins per episode. He was so popular they made a spin-off with him as the protagonist. And it has much higher rating than the parent one. And also not seeing the spectacled beta everytime.  Everyone constantly berates Hyoubu to be a Lolicon, but Hyoubu only cares about the happiness of the Espers especially Kaoru's and their safety, but in reality the Chief, Minamoto, Tanizaki are the real Lolicons, all are from BABEL by the way. I really get pissed off at Minamoto when he says Hyoubu to be a Lolicon when he constantly have these blushing shitty moments with the girls. ""Think back on what you said about Hyoubu you beta"", is what I want to tell to Minamoto.  Sorry for the long review but I just wanted to make sure everyone knows about ""The beta, who keeps berating the SIGMA, just to be saved by him again and again and again."" This actually sums up review. ""SIGMA rules.""";Recommended
0;Zettai Karen Children;NV2301;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NV2301;6;"A fairly enjoyable series which has either been watered down too much, or not enough.   Overall - 6/10  From the Animesuki thread, I read that the manga is more hardcore with blood and depth in comparison with the anime. While I have not read the source material, I can already sense in the anime that things have been watered down to an extent. This has all to do with the series airing at 10am on a Sunday. I feel things are still too hardcore (i.e. targeted at Japanese Otakus) with the constant perv/service/loli references, to be suitable for kids.  On the other hand, the general over-action of the BABEL boss, and the limiter de-activation scenes have certainly been created to make kids laugh and enjoy. While I thankfully do not know the tastes of a hardcore Japanese Otaku, I found my attention span dropping in the scenes that are meant for kids.  So where exactly does this series want itself to be placed?   Story - 7/10  The story follows the daily lives and missions of 3 children who are exposed to events that usually, only grown-ups can comprehend mentally. Thus the events, missions, conversations and the experiences that the Children face are crucial in influencing the way that these children grow as characters. It is known in the story that these Children have an almost equal chance of becoming ""good"" or ""evil"" when they grow up and I liked the latter episodes where the events may greatly influence their mindset.  The style is standalone episodes with quick action and conclusions, but they follow a logical and linear timeline and the way they made it so episodic, yet so continueous in a smooth manner is commendable. However, the time constraints per episode may have compromised depth.  The scene is where a government organisation called B.A.B.E.L is responsible for policing and looking after espers, with their objective to show the world that both espers and non-espers can peacefully co-exist. B.A.B.E.L. faces against both extremes, organisations that are determined to create a world ONLY for espers, and those who want a world without espers. This creates a Gundam SEED-esque mess which I like because both sides have very ""human"" reasons for their opinions and objectives. Such a setup also creates potential for depth and involvement. All in all, the story has a very solid foundation.  The series ends nicely, but with lots of loose ends that were left untied. It seems to be implied that a sequel is possible, which would justify the loose ends.   Art - 5/10  Being a 52 episode season, one couldn't expect spectacular art due to budget constraints and indeed, the art and animation are nothing spectacular. I found the art and animation to be of fairly average standard where nothing really stood out. Animation had jerky moments but it was far from ""framelaggy"" as in the case of You're Under Arrest - Full Throttle. The art does its job and is fairly consistent. To sum it up, it was good enough.   Sound - 6/10  The music and sounds are fairly repetitive and what can one expect from (supposedly) a kid's show? I found the BGM to be fairly convincing and I definately liked the music where the limiter was deactivated. However, not much else really caught my attention aside from...  ...Over The Future, the first OP. The voices sound a little weird because it had been transposed up a minor third for the TV series - the full song has a lower pitch. This song definately caught the spirit of the series and I really love the feel-good feeling. I do question the use of *real* kids to sing this. While it gives them opportunity to shine into stardom (and what a solid performance in the MV), this show screams ""Japanese Lolicon"" at times and I feel there's a moral issue. The seiyuu's could actually sing this to an acceptable standard as heard on Youtube.  I found the voicing of the characters to be very good, with excellent performances from cast of The Children - Hirano Aya, Shiraishi Ryoko and Tomatsu Haruka, all who have provided great performances in the past.   Character - 6/10  After the initial 10 episodes or so, when The Children are tamed down enough to be sent to school, I feel there was limited character development, save for Kaoru being subtly manipulated. I felt that the episodes in the runup to the finale would have a real impact in defining Kaoru's future (and turning evil or not), which I throughly enjoyed.  We however get to know the backstories of the major characters which were definately interesting and links in well with their current behaviour.  If there is a second season, then I would feel that the limited development is justified, as Zettai Karen Children by its nature is a dragged out series.   Enjoyment - 7/10  I actually enjoyed this. The dumb things and the abuse of power that The Children can get up to is just entertaining, including whacking people into walls, when there was a lesser option that is just as effective. Watching the antics of moderately bad kids is definately funny. Of course, I also got a lot of enjoyment from the story.  However, I didn't really feel as involved (glued to the screen) as I could have done.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zettai Karen Children;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;6;"Zettai Karen Children is a shounen action-comedy focused on a government organization called BABEL tasked with serving as mediators in hostilities between espers and humans. Among the organization and main focus of the series are a trio of powerful esper 10-year old girls called ""The Children"" who are chaperoned by Koichi Minamoto. The series explores the developing bond that occurs with Minamoto and The Children, as well as the group and BABEL coming at odds with several enemy organizations who have differing views on the future that espers can bring to humans to the world.  Zettai Karen mixes around comedic and serious moments in exploring its world and characters. The comedy mostly comes in the form of parody and the eccentric quirks of the cast. It makes nods at points to other anime titles and pokes fun of elements to sentai shows with the over-the-top introductions, commands and attack names being called from BABEL and other espers. The series also milks the eccentric quirks of the characters for its humor at many points such as Kaoru's perversion for attractive women, Muscle Okama's stereotypical gay character and Ichiro's lusting for partner Naomi. Many of these comical bits left me feeling rather indifferent or feeling some of the quirks were on the obnoxious side, particularly anything involving perversion of the characters being shown or teased. Still, there was some stuff that got me giddy such as series anti-hero Hyobu Kyosuke trolling Koichi for his personal amusement and an episode that parodies Death Note.  The series also has its serious developments in exploring the hostilities between espers and humans. In spite of his trolling, Kyosuke's character is fleshed out to explore a rather tragic back story that led to his mentality to become a Magneto-like figure in trying to aid espers and prepare for a possible war between his kind and humans. The pasts of the Children are also explored with how they became part of BABEL and their complicated pasts with their family members. The positions of organizations and individuals on esper abilities and how those with such power utilize it are also focused on at points throughout the series. While the series is comedy-driven throughout a good chunk of its first half, it does come to gradually tone down on its humor as hints to a possible dark future for Kaoru and the presence of another enemy organization rear their head in the second half.  Still, the series lacks a proper ending as the mentioned enemy organizations are still at large and things with Kaoru's future are left uncertain. Plus like a good number of action titles of its kind, Zettai Karen Children still dabbles fairly heavily in cliches typical of shounen anime with a number of adult characters behaving childishly for their age, many characters within the series filling certain archetypes and a good amount of black-and-white morality being milked in regards to some of the enemy organizations.  Overall, I suppose my thoughts on Zettai Karen Children are a bit mixed. I liked what it explored with its esper premise when things got serious and some of the humor to it did get me laughing, especially with moments where Hyobu was behaving like a troll. However, a good chunk of the show's humor did not really appeal to me and it still dabbles fairly heavily into the typical cliches and character types that one would find with a shounen title. I guess like the majority of titles aimed at the demographic, the series is best worth checking out if you're fairly new to the cliches offered for action-comedies geared toward younger male fans.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zettai Junshu☆Kyousei Kozukuri Kyokashou!!;BaalthusVane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BaalthusVane;8;Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you on this day to discuss Zettai Junshu Kyousei Kozukuri Kyokashou. This is what I feel to be the very essence of hentai. The exact reason we watch it over 3D, non-animated pornography.  When I first stumbled upon this gem via a randomized search, the synopsis immediately intrigued me. Sure it's ridiculous, that's why I'm here now. Hentai has the ability to be anything it damn well wants to be. This OVA exercises its born right to be over the top and not make any sense, and executes this flawlessly.  How many times has a man looked at a stranger on the street and had thoughts of sexuality involving them? Only every 3 seconds, of course. And with the Free Sex License, this becomes a reality for Takumi. Not only that, but he is the lone male in a large city filled with women who are obviously curious as to what sex entails. Talk about appealing to a massive audience right off the bat.  The reason this particular title stood out to me, was its intensity. Not just the content itself, but how said content was put across. Every wet slapping noise, every strand of body fluid, every ridiculous scenario had me glued to the screen.  I would like to touch briefly on the single unforgivable fault I found with this. And it becomes apparent immediately. If you begin to wonder if the entire thing will have that 'shaky cam' feel by the 5-minute mark of the first episode, I'll save you some time and give you your answer.  Yes. Yes it does.  It becomes painful. I personally felt dizzy after roughly 10 minutes of each episode of this series, which should have been more aptly named Cloverfield: The Blair Hentai Project. It however is not entirely intrusive to the overall enjoyment gained from this material.;Recommended
0;Zettai Junshu☆Kyousei Kozukuri Kyokashou!!;bill_nsfw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bill_nsfw;2;"First review ever, hoorah.  What does this hentai shine at? The variety of of sex scenes/poses. They are all very short, but there are a ton of different poses in just two episodes. Many of them are vanilla, but there are a few fetish-type stuff here and there. If any sort of fetish stuff isn't for you, you don't even have to worry because it goes by very quickly.  What does this hentai do badly? Well, the thing that made me decide to write my first review to warn people to steer clear of this: THE FUCKING CAMERA MY GOD. If this were a live-action show, it's like the cameraman was filming for ""Cops"", and he has vertigo. It detracts from everything about this. The art is also very inconsistent, probably because of how much the camera has to move.  Verdict: If you just want something to beat it off to, this wouldn't be terrible, but the camera shake makes that just about impossible. Not worth the effort.";Not Recommended
0;Zettai Junpaku♡Mahou Shoujo;codelancelot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/codelancelot;7;"This anime is based of a doujin manga (I'm pretty sure it's a doujin hentai manga but I'm not 100% percent sure) called Mahou Shoujo written by Raita. it is currently about 10 volumes long and about 25-30 pages per volume. You won't find it on MAL because it was not written and published by a real writer (in other words because it's a complete doujin). I am going to split the ratings for this anime in two ways: one for the people who read the manga and the second one for people who did not.  Story (for people who have not read it) - 2 I rated this a three because if you are like me and just happen to come across this and say: oh, look, a six minute anime, let me just watch it to say that I watched it, and had never read the manga or heard about this anime before you do not understand what's really is going on. I mean the basic idea of this is not like impossible to figure out but it leaves you going why are they half naked, why do they turn into angles, what are they, who are they, and so on .  Story (read it) - 6 I give it a six because it is pretty much totally cliché. Guy meets girls, girls like guy and they fight over him, girls transform into almost completely naked angles and fight tentacle monsters. I am not saying that it's completely unoriginal, I'm just saying they could have added more to the story and changed it up some. I can't really judge too much because I have not read all ten volumes; I only really read one and I am not supposed to talk about the manga. All I have to say is that it's borderline OK.  Art (for both) - 10, outstanding The art in this short anime clip is amazing and from what I have seen in the manga it's great there as well. All the characters have eyes and full body features they don't look rushed and move as well as look amazingly good. What I mean is that there is barley any detail untouched. The background is greatly drawn and has full detail. Heck, even the background characters are different and unique. Simply said, it is amazing. Most doujin anime and manga I have seen do not go through as much effort to look as these. I would go as far as recommending this anime just because of the art.  Sound (both) - 10 I know there really was not much music in the anime but in the parts where there was music it was really well placed and really enjoying to hear. As far as the voice acting goes, it was good at well. The voices matched the lips, none of the voices were annoying and the voices matched most of the characters great.  Character (not read) - 2 The reason I rated it a 2 was because I was looking at it from a development point of view. I know that it is only 6 minutes long and it was just a part of the whole series (there are no more animated versions) but I have to rate it like this was the whole series and there was no character development at all in this anime.  Character (read) - 6 Like I said before I have not seen all of this series but from what I have seen there has been a lot of character development up to this point.  Enjoyment - 9 My overall enjoyment for this series is a 9. Even though I had not read the manga when I watched it I still ended up not regretting watching this anime. I personally enjoyed this anime very much. I enjoyed the music that I heard, I absolutely loved the art and all the boobies hanging around. In other words, I really like the fan service.  Overall enjoyment - 7 I got this by adding all my scores and taking the average. My final thought was that these where six minutes well spent. I really loved it and I recomened to anyone take 10 minutes tops out of their time to watch this good episode of anime and I also recomend people to take some time to read the manga. I recommend to read it not just for the hentai parts but to enjoy the story.";Recommended
0;Zettai Junpaku♡Mahou Shoujo;handkc12;https://myanimelist.net/profile/handkc12;5;"This anime is based on the hentai doujin manga ""Mahou Shoujo"" by artist raita.  This is a parody to all the magical girl hentai doujin mangas. Hot magical girls fight against whole bunch of tentacle creatures. Yet there is no tentacle rape or strange vore scene you see all the time in other magical girl hentai animes.  This is a Preview anime to the doujin manga: more like a ""yo, check this out,"" kinda thing. It's a mere 6 minutes long anime with one episode. And this just had the things I expected it to have and nothing more. To be honest, I want to give this one more score just because it's a PV anime made for the sole reason of being a PV anime, and I would give this a pretty good score if I completely rate it based on it being a PV anime. But because I really want this anime to become a real series, I'll review it based on standard anime score.  Story: 1 There is no story. Characters are introduced; sure; but no plot development, no backgrounds, just whole bunch of booby girls fighting monster octopuses.  Art: 8 I'm really glad that the anime respected raita's artwork; it looks nice. It looks a little sharp, so that lowered down a score or two.  Sound: 9 Holy crap, they probably spent all their budget here. How and why did they cast all these voice actors for this thing? It's like butler x lady thing: the voice acting is so good because voice actors are soooo good.  Character: 2 Characters are introduced; that's it. Like I said, no backgrounds, no plot development, two of the girls are hinted that they are celebrities. I don't even think the guy can be called a character at this point. Extra point because of boobs.  Enjoyment: 4 It's 6 minutes long. It's a eye-and-ear candy you can check out for once, but would you watch it twice and thrice? Nah.  Overall: 5 I can only give it this score because this is just a PV, not even TV Short. There is no plot, no story because it is a PV episode. Like I rated, Art and Sound is real nice, but at this point, you're not really watching an anime, it's more like you're watching an advertisement of an anime. I really want the real anime series to come out. Just because I'm quite fond of raita's artwork.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zettai Bouei Leviathan: Mini Takibi Gekijou;shintai88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shintai88;8;Personally I found this more enjoyable than the actual show.  Mainly cause in this mini short we see more of the characters personality. It also pretty much like listening to a radio special with the cast.  The animation is simple, the 4 are always around a campfire, and basically just chat about the episode in which it relates to.  We get some fan service still shorts, of the girls in Maid, Miko, Scale outfits. And we get to see more of Levi as a character, something I felt was missing in the actual show.  All in all its about 48 minutes. And to me the banter here was more well written. And it was also a lot more adorable.;Recommended
0;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;Nashe_Clet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nashe_Clet;7;Zettai Bouei Leviathan is an enjoyable anime. Even though it has many flaws, it is a pretty decent anime because this was just based on an iphone game. The story is somewhat cliched because the idea of people coming together to try and save the world is not new. The plot line is not very good, but it is not the worst.(Three girls with different elements try to fight against lucasites that are trying to destroy the world.The main character, Leviathan, is trying to find her lost brother. Bahamut is struggling with family problems, and Jörmungandr is trying to protect her family.) While watching the show, I noticed that some characters actually became quite annoying. The main character, Leviathan, is very passive and does not really talk with much emotion. Bahamut acts spoiled, but that is not the problem with the character. She is sometimes annoying because she acts very selfishly. Despite all of this, the character designs are actually good. Another small problem in the anime, when I watched it, was the animation for the dragons and lucasites. I believe that the anime would have turned out better if they did not change the animation for the dragons and lucasites. Because of that different animation, it looked as if the creatures were moving very awkwardly. Overall, it was an okay anime. I have to say it was somewhat good because there is no actual manga or novel to base off of. So, I thought this was an enjoyable series, even with some of the flaws. The major positive thing about this anime is the character designs. I would recommend this series to people who want a light-hearted anime and to people who just want to enjoy a decent show. (this anime would be great for cosplay);Recommended
1;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;Omfgakitten;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Omfgakitten;7;Zettai Bouei Leviathan, although pretty cliche, was harmless and relatively relaxing to watch.  Story - 6/10. There wasn't much of a story to be found in this anime, to be honest. A peaceful planet, Aquafall, is beset by meteors, inside which are bugs called Lucasites. A fairy, Syrop, goes on a journey to find people willing to protect the planet. The story development is incredibly slow - we are introduced to our characters, they do cute stuff, eventually they go on a short adventure to kill some bugs.  Art - 6/10. The art for this anime was okay. Character designs were relatively predictable and bland, each being designed to fit their element, colour included. Backgrounds were nothing special, either, just kind of generic, but inoffensive. The one thing that really bugged me (ha! get it? bugged...) was the 3D animation of the dragons, Lucasites etc within the anime, they looked pretty clunky and I didn't feel they really had a place in the anime. (Although that big river dragon thing was kinda cute). I also found their transformation sequences awkward - boring, and the music they put to it didn't peak my interest either.  Sound - 7/10. The voice cast for this actually includes some very famous seiyuu - including the voices of Ayase and Kirino in OreImo and Kana Hanazawa. However the sound in general was pretty bland despite the star-studded cast. Leviathan's voice sounded a little flat, and the others were just on the edge of being irritating, especially Syrop.  Character - 6/10. The characters for this were pretty archetypal - nothing original about any of them. Syrop was essentially a token character there to be the butt of or make jokes, Leviathan the shy and quiet one, Bahamut the fiery spoilt one and Jormungandr, the excitable but loving one. None of the characters particularly grated for me, with the exception of Bahamut, whose spoiled attitude really got on my nerves a mere few minutes after her introduction.  Enjoyment - 7/10. Despite its flaws, I enjoyed switching my brain off and tuning into this show every week (I watched it when it was still airing). It was unoriginal and slow but nevertheless the characters were decently cute so it was okay for a wind-down watch.  If you're looking for an original piece, something funny or something with a proper story I'd suggest you look elsewhere.;Recommended
2;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;FoxFuryy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FoxFuryy;8;I started out watching Leviathan without much interest thinking that it would be for kids, which it was partially. Once I actually got started watching the show though, I couldn't get enough of it. I laughed and I cried sometimes too. (Not very often though.) I enjoyed the art and sound of the show as it kept me captivated the entire time. The story wasn't anything too special, but still it was a good way to pass the time. One part I liked and disliked at the same time was the fact that they wear scales instead of underwear, no that isn't a spoiler you find that out in the first episode. But look forward to the swimsuit episode. (There is always a swimsuit episode so no spoiler there either.) So all in all, I would give it a try if you are reading this. I didn't find it the best, but I still liked it. I hope you all do too.;Recommended
3;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;Anubriel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anubriel;10;I really love this show.

I really wish for a second season to be announced, because I want to learn more about their lives It is of uttermost significance that shows as these exist. Stories about people, who have been labeled as something bad being presented in a positive light, so we can decide to grant them the chance of a new beginning together. A chance of the opportunity of working towards a noble future with purpose so we can all coexist in peace and harmony one day.

0;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;TheAshmanCometh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAshmanCometh;5;"When an anime serves as a prequel for an Android-based RPG you've never heard of, chances are good that one shouldn't go into this series expecting much more than a four-hour commercial for the game it's advertising. Throughout the entire run of Zettai Bouei Leviathan, the show never really tries to be more than it is, which is a mediocre piece of fluff that just happens to have a fantastic voice cast.  Zettai Bouei Leviathan tells the story of a trio of dragon-girls on a planet named Aquafall that is occupied by dragon-people. At least, some of them are dragon-people, as we see non-dragon denizens milling about over the course of the show. One day, Aquafall starts getting pelted with meteorites that contain insects known as Lucasites who start invading the planet for an unspecified reason. In order to put up some resistance, the fairy Syrop goes on a journey to establish a team to defend Aquafall from these insect invaders, but, instead, she just ends up relaxing for a while with the first three girls she comes across and calls it a day. Once she infroms the girls that their planet is in grave danger, they all rebuke her, so she decides to stick around and convince them to join her team. That's right. The world is in grave danger and in her quest to form a team to save it, she asks the first three people she finds to assist her. Strangely enough. nstead of going and finding teammates who are actually interested in saving the world or who even have the skills required to do so, she decides that these three are her only options and spends an inordinate amount of time pestering them.  Granted, the story is mostly non-existent, but to be fair, If you decide to watch this, you're probably not here for the story. For the majority of the show's run-time, the characters just sort of hang around and do nothing, with the occasional cgi bug battle thrown in. However, for the most part they just go to the beach, eat, or visit a hot springs. Additionally, this anime acts as a prequel to the game, so the plot doesn't even really kick in during the show. In other words, if you want a story, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  As far as the characters go, they unfortunately don't fare much better. The cast mostly consists of the four main characters; Leviathan, a timid water-user, Bahamut, a selfish fire-user, Jormungandr, an adventure-loving warrior girl with an ax, and Syrop, a useless fairy that isn't good for anything other than food jokes. There's very little depth to the characters, who are best described as vague, color-coded archetypes. Although there is a bit of character development here and there, there isn't enough of it to make the audience care about any of them.  That isn't to say that the characters are particularly unlikeable, but their mannerisms and interactions can certainly be quite grating at times. Leviathan is obsessed with finding her brother, Bahamut has daddy-issues, and Jormungandr comes from a loving two-father family (which is something I've never seen in an anime before.) Syrop on the other hand is just annoying. We never learn anything about her and her comic relief moments are all so interchangeable that it's a wonder they exist at all. Bahamut is also extremely whiny and selfish, so she tends to grate on the nerves as well. On the other hand, Leviathan and Jormungandr are mostly non-offensive, so at least the major cast members aren't all annoyances.  Interestingly enough, Zettai Bouei Leviathan comes courtesy of Gonzo; the once powerful studio that famously imploded, only to slowly start building itself back up without any of its real talent on board. The lack of vision in the staff is visible throughout many aspects of the production. That is to say, Zettai Bouei Leviathan is extremely bland and generic to look at. The character designs are bland and extremely basic and the background art is the same type of typical fantasy fare that you can find anywhere else. There was absolutely no creativity expended on the characters, nor the world that they inhabit. That's not to say that they're badly drawn or anything, but everything is simply as cookie cutter as can be. Significant portions of the show take place in such interesting settings as Generic Fantasy Town and Generic Desert. All in all, the art isn't interesting to look at, which extends to action sequences and enemies. All of the Lucasites and dragons are rendered in CGI and while they don't look terrible, their appearance shares the same weaknesses as the rest of the art. They're completely non-threatening looking and, once again, extremely generic. The animation is much the same; it gets the job done while doing the bare minimum.  The girls also have transformation sequences, but these are boring as well. Each one just shows the characters wearing scale underwear (because they're dragons, or something) at which point they put on magic outfits and grow wings on their sides and heads. The fights are also very uninteresting to look at. When it comes to attack variety, the characters leave much to desire. Leviathan conjures water-tentacles to grab her foes, or throws water projectiles while Bahamut either throws fireballs or uses a stream of flame, while all Jormungandr does is hit stuff with one heavy swing of her ax. The battle scenes are few and far between, so they're not THAT redundant, but they do come across as rather lazy.  Then we have the voices. Despite how mediocre every other aspect of the show is, Zettai Bouei Leviathan has a fantastic voice cast made up of Saori Hayama (Ayase in OreImo), Eri Kitamura (Saya in Blood+), Ayana Taketatsu (Kirino in OreImo), and Kana Hanazawa (everything ever.) These talented actresses all do the best they can with the material, which, although it isn't much, helps to muster at least some enthusiasm for the series. They do sound a little bored, though, especially Saori, which is hard to fault her for, considering the monotone nature of her character. Still, the voice acting is the sole bright spot in the series. Why they got a star-studded voice cast and left them to languish with such mediocre material is beyond me, but if there's any reason to watch the show, it's them. On the other hand, the music is completely forgettable and not even worth mentioning.  All things considered, Zettai Bouei Leviathan isn't terrible. There's nothing particularly offensive about the show, but it is extremely boring most of the time. It mostly plays like an extremely long advertisement for the game and it feels like it only exists to spread the word and fill air time. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone, but I wouldn't moan and groan about it either. There isn't much to like, but at the same time, there's not much to hate either. If you just want a bland, fantasy show with a great voice cast and cute characters, you could certainly do worse than Zettai Bouei Leviathan, but there are much better shows to spend your time on.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;Zettai Bouei Leviathan is an anime series released virtually concurrently with the mobile game it was based on. The series was written by Zappa Go and Ide Yasunori and was created by Gonzo, which has been behind some really good stuff like Bakuretsu Tenshi and the Lunar games. It's also been behind some real rubbish like the Brave Story film and Gantz. The only way to find out where this one falls is to check it out.  Our story opens with a fairy named Syrup looking for strong people to join her Aquafall Defense force to protect the world from invading alien bug creatures. Naturally, she seeks out the silliest trio of girls she can find, Leviathan, Bahamut and Jormungandr. Okay, she doesn't try to recruit them because they're silly people, that's just a happy coincidence. The problem is that neither Bahamut nor Leviathan is interested in the position. The series mainly revolves around the misadventures of the three girls while Syrup tries to get them to join her in protecting the world. The series mainly revolves around two things comedic moments and action sequences. So, how well does the comedy work? Well, the series certainly has some really funny moments. In general the comedy is quite effective, actually, but there are also some jokes that fall flat and some that are just predictable and not all that amusing as a result. Putting the humourous elements aside, the story is rather mediocre and predictable and, unfortunately, the series does try for some serious story moments.  The characters aren't very well developed. The four main characters do have somewhat fleshed out personalities, but they aren't particularly deep ones. That being said, they are functional for comedic purposes. They interact well with one another which does lead to some good moments where one plays off of another. The familial relationships are decently handled, for what little you get of them.  The art is pretty mixed. On the positive side, the character designs are really nice, in spite of Bahamut's cap of +10 tomfoolery. The action sequences are also put together pretty well, for the most part, and have good intensity. Onto the negatives. The transformation sequences are fan-servicey, which you should never be able to say about a series that features characters who are designed to look roughly twelve. The series also makes use of fan-service in several other scenes because... the art design team was obsessed with Nowi. The backgrounds are also kind of lazy and the side character designs vary quite a bit. Jormungandr's family suffers from recycled designs with minor differences, for example. They also incorporate more traditionally CG designs for Fire Drake and Yurlungur, which are interesting but also look completely off when contrasted with the rest of the art in the series. It would be like taking Vincent as he appears in Advent Children and randomly throwing him into an episode of A-Channel. The styles simply don't work together.  The voice acting is pretty good. The main cast consists of Kitamura Eri, Taketatsu Ayana, Hayami Saori,and Hanazawa Kana, all of whom are good voice actresses who occasionally end up cast in something really terrible that requires them to pretend they aren't. While this isn't a series that requires them to be at their best, it is a series that allows them to show their skills. The music is okay.  The ho-yay factor is a 3/10. There are moments where you can envision them going that route, but nothing substantial.  So, how is Zettai Bouei Leviathan when taken as a whole? Well, the comedic elements are mostly effective and the characters are fun, the voice acting is good and there are some real positive aspects to the art. However, the fan-service is pretty bad, there are some other assorted art issues and the attempts at being more serious outright fail. That being said, if you're looking for a light-hearted fantasy story with some good action sequences you'll probably like it. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. It's decent, but nothing spectacular. Next week I'll look at the Bubblegum Crisis OVA, because why not?;Mixed Feelings
2;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;FuzzyButtGaming;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FuzzyButtGaming;6;It has some fox/wolf girls in it so it makes the overall enjoyment A-OK for me lol. But besides that, a few of the English dub voices seem to always do the most annoying characters, I really like the the VA so don't get me wrong, but you will start to notice how some of them always appear in the same shows and either ruin a character or the character just becomes super annoying with high pitch yelling or almost monotone lines.  The sound was good, the story was ok and I giggled a few times. It isn't one that I would re-watch tho but not like disappointed that I watched it. If you want a show with a mid evil setting, some adventure and a fairy you really wish would have never showed up after the first episode, some cute animal girls and an out of place thermos then this is a good one for you.;Mixed Feelings
3;Zettai Bouei Leviathan;Daku_the_Green;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daku_the_Green;5;The show is honestly not very good. Someone linked it on an rpg forum, with a humorous text that it is a show about a D&D campaign gone wrong. And that is exactly what it is, the three girls stumble about, completely disregard the plot and instead go camping and socialise with random NPCs, while the DM pulls Deus ex Machina after Deus ex Machina to bring the show back on the rails. If you enjoy role playing games, and you want to see three cute anime girls flailing around in one with utmost incompetence, then this is the show for you!  I tagged it as a 7 in my own MAL as I love roleplaying games and their tropes, but this show has no value beyond its RPG like nature. You can have fun with this show, but do not expect it to be good. It has heart however, and it had me smiling from ear to ear at certain parts with how cheesy it was.;Mixed Feelings

Nyaruko-san W has some company for most generic anime of this season.  Story: 0.1/10  Zettai Bouei Leviathan is a boring anime with cute girls. So there are girls, they get together, one of them loses a staff I think..they end up going to a spa…yeah. This anime was not interesting what so ever. There was an attempt to have an overlaying plot but in reality all this anime tried to do was put out cute yuri scenes.  Animation: 6.4/10  The animation was pretty good but not amazing. The lighting was actually really well done and the character models looked pretty good. The issue though was that there was a noticeable drop in quality at some moments during the show’s airing. Some great looking scenes but a lot of average ones as well.  Sound: 5/10  Average voice acting; average soundtrack.  Characters: 4/10  So the characters worked ok with each other but they were far from interesting on an individual level. Bahamut is your typical rich loud girl, Jörmungandr is the tomboy, and Leviathan is the shy one. Just some basic empty shells.  Overall: 3.9/10  This show like Haiyore! Nyaruko-san W was just pure averageness. I find it almost unfathomable how shows like these make it to airing…oh yeah it’s because of the boobs.  Enjoyment: 0.001/10  Thanks for reading my review!

0;Zetsumetsu Kigu Shoujo: Amazing Twins;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;7;"Zetsumetsu Kigu Shoujo is a two part OVA where the first part was released very late 2013. It was written by Okada Mari. Who's also done good work for anime like Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans, mediocre work on anime like Toradora & shit work on rubbish anime like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Although, in all fairness, the mediocre and terribly written examples were both adapted from light novels. And this is an original work from Encourage films. You may know them as the driving force behind... nothing I've seen.   Story:  Todoroki Amane is an esper or an ""ISH"" if you want to use the anime's terminology. She desires one thing and one thing only, to use her powers to entertain people and give her bodyless twin sister a purpose. Their entertainment group has a small fan base but they're trying hard. Unfortunately, her powers draw the attention of a shady man who experiments using espers. And he sees her multiple esper abilities as a grand asset for him.   The biggest issue with this OVA is that the story does somewhat rely on clichés. Take, for instance, the big confrontation Amane has with Aya. There's nothing in the OVA to show any real friendliness between them, but they have to have a stereotypical ""convert the villain with the power of friendship"" moment that relies entirely on the trope being common to work. It's also a bit disappointing that they spend so much time building Hasudou up as a shadowy puppet master and grave threat only to just kind of drop it in the end. It's like they were going to have three episodes and canceled the last one.   To the OVA's credit, Okada does do a good job of using the time effectively. She sets up the scenario and gives you all the essential information pretty quickly. She also provides compelling reasons for a conflict between Amane and Aya. She also does a pretty grand job of building the world enough that it feels much larger than it actually is. And the comedic scenes are pretty well handled. The Captain Japan super hero parody segments are especially memorable.   Characters:  The big problem with the characters is that there are just a lot of one note ones who don't do much. Take the dude with teleportation abilities and the girl with super strength. Their purpose is pretty much ""part of Amane's entertainment troupe."" Or how about the girl who shows up with their sponsor? She's such a nothing character I'm not sure why she's even here.   Okada does a pretty good job with the major characters. We get a strong sense of what Amane, Lilian and Aya are like. Even if the dynamics are a bit trite.   Art:  Encourage did a pretty decent job. The animation isn't the highest budget out there for certain, but it looks just fine. The best part of the artwork is definitely the action sequences. I gave Mob Psycho a hard time for their overly busy, messy esper battles. This presents much cleaner and better sequenced esper fights while still taking advantage of the unusual abilities for a unique feel. Am I saying this two episode OVA is artistically superior to Mob Psycho 100? Yes.   My biggest issue with the artwork is the way they sneak in some rather crass fan-service scenes. They Put Amane in a school swimsuit and have her strapped in a chair for an examination while Aya a similar examination with only straps to cover her private areas. These girls are probably supposed to be all of fifteen. We should not be seeing them scantily clad.   Sound:  There are some strong actors in this. Sato Satomi, Uchida Aya and Touyama Nao all deliver fairly strong performances. The music was composed by Conisch and he did a great job with it.   Ho-yay:  There's a bit. Amane's female sponsor very blatantly has a thing for her. And probably shares around a Mamoru/Usagi age gap with her. So, pretty questionable. Aya and Amane also come across as a bit homo-erotic in a couple major scenes.   Areas of Improvement:  Lose the extra performers. Just give Amane a solo show. You can still have the same ending, just without the superfluous characters who don't really add anything.  Ditch the fan-service of young teenage girls. Bad Encourage, bad. You sit in your room and think about what you've done.  Actually build up the dynamic with Aya and Amane to make the ending trope work.   Final Thoughts:  This OVA is actually pretty good. For an hour long work, Okada and the folks at Encourage put together something quite solid. If a comedic bent little story about espers seems interesting to you, maybe give it a watch. For me, I'm giving it a 7/10. ";Recommended
0;Zetsuen no Tempest;nixnao;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nixnao;9;“What’s past is prologue.” - The Tempest - William Shakespeare  Nothing could say more about Blast of Tempest than Shakespeare’s The Tempest which is heavily referenced throughout the series. Blast of Tempest is a story about overcoming entrapment in the past, both figuratively and literally.  Story  One thing that can be said about Blast of Tempest is that it follows a logical premise that manages to feel legitimately inspired despite its fair share of twists. Even though the story involves magic, the series defines a strong logical framework that both empowers and entraps its characters.  Above all, our character’s personal history is a major factor in the series. It drives Mahiro on a vengeful path to determine who killed his sister and weighs down Yoshino to the point of near-detachment. It is only when these characters are able to accept fate and focus that they are able to allow a tragic event to become the means to a better end (saving the world). Moreover, past as a general influence is extremely well-realized. Events in the past, including Hakaze’s imprisonment, Aika’s death, and even further back to the formation of the Tree of Exodus as a means to end the Tree of Genesis’s purpose in resetting humanity are central to the plot.  Furthermore, the notion of order and chaos is thematically prevalent in the series. Even though the Tree of Genesis represents order, it is only with the chaos represented by the Tree of Exodus that humanity can thrive and even exist. Despite the resurgence of crime and inequality after the dissolution of the Tree of Genesis, it is easy to understand the necessity in the action and why the order imposed by the Tree of Genesis would eventually deem all of humanity unrighteous.  The only major flaw to Blast of Tempest‘s story is that it tends to use its characters as if they are actors in a play (perhaps intentionally). Each character plays his part, often without question. This is extremely noticeable in Aika’s casual acceptance of her fate despite what clearly would have been a difficult decision – but this may actually speak more to her character than to the show’s tendency to have its actors fill a role.  Characters  Character development is very important in Blast of Tempest - and all of its main characters, Hakaze, Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika, are a strong basis to the show’s central themes despite their differing personas. What enforces their strength is their intelligence – even in Mahiro’s case – the characters carefully and cleverly plan their actions.  Hakaze is a strong female lead that is open and direct, while sometimes being too upfront and occasionally becoming distracted by desire. What defines Hakaze the most is that, despite her attunement to the Tree of Genesis, she is far from unquestioning. Her actions are often fueled by her desire to seek her own path, even with opposition or without knowing the consequences. It makes her into a character nearly embracing chaos despite the order surrounding her – which accentuates her foil in Aika.  Aika, though appearing frail, is strong to a fault. Her character embraces the ideology of Exodus far too unconditionally which is but testament to her acceptance with being an actress in a play. She often quotes Hamlet and The Tempest because she feels that her only goals have already been previously scripted and she must play to those ideals.  Mahiro, on the other hand, represents another extreme of chaos with his absolute path of vengeance. His early ambitions are simply to avenge the death of Aika, but this actually drives him to greatness because of her involvement in much more crucial matters. When he is freed from this path, his goal has actually become to enact a plan to save the world. Mahiro is a renegade without being overly reckless and ambitious to a point where he is not clouded.  Yoshino, for a large majority of the show, is very detached. Aika’s death had an opposing effect on him in that he nearly lost desire to function after her passing. Even though he is tied down by her loss, he thinks clearly and keeps Mahiro in check when he is pushing himself too far. It’s important to note that Yoshino is the last character to resolve his past as a lesson in history, because he is too entrapped by it. Hakaze’s confessions to him cause him to break because he is not ready to continue his life until all others’ problems have been resolved.  Quality  Blast of Tempest is breathtaking visually and its usage of classical pieces in its soundtrack is excellently done. By now, this is what we expect from BONES, so it isn’t too unbelievable that this show lives up to BONES’s capability to generate quality in its production value. Particularly of note are the show’s excellent action scenes that accentuate brilliant animation along with well-utilized classical music.  Closing  While Blast of Tempest occasionally falls short of absolute excellence in its willingness to allow its characters to fill roles, it presents a story of past entanglements that is very well-realized and non-contradictory with a cast that synergizes their differing viewpoints.;Recommended
1;Zetsuen no Tempest;liidistorted;https://myanimelist.net/profile/liidistorted;9;How should I say this... This anime was one of the best that I've seen. Whenever I have nothing to watch, I would turn to Zetsuen no Tempest (Blast of the Tempest/ The Civilization Blaster). The ending was perfect, the story line was amazing, but the best of all were the characters.  Let me go into detail...  Story: The story was put together in a great yet questionable way. There were many parts of the anime that could be related to the famous works of Shakespeare. With plot twists that would leave you confused, the story was never boring. The twisted tale of love, hate, revenge and a touch of magic was most definitely satisfying especially how the ending wrapped up the entire story. I sincerely wish that they would make a sequel.  Art: The art was satisfying, it clearly showed details in the magic shields and barriers. They point that stood out the most for me were the eyes. The characters eyes showed their emotions so clearly that they sent shivers down my spine, how they would dull or brighten depending on the emotions being conveyed.  Sound: The music chosen for this anime was.... Fabulous. The violin solos with the varying volumes matched the pace of the show and the suspense in the best fashion. The opening and endings weren't boring and they definitely didn't reveal a lot about the story. The upbeat openings shows the action and the more aggressive emotions in the show whereas the slower themes in the endings portrays the more negative and deeper feelings.  Character: Gosh, all of the characters were so perfect. They each played a huge role in the story but I think I should be more specific. Takigawa Yoshino is my favorite character, he is so mysterious and he definitely is a major character. He is referred as Horatio in some parts of the anime. His tale of not being able to grieve for the one he loves is heart breaking, how he shows great deduction skills and how he seems so innocent is so twisted and yet it fits the story perfectly. Fuwa Mahiro is the rich and feared character. His feelings played a large role, I find his motives very amusing throughout the plot. Yoshino and Mahiro are very... different characters compared to the cliches that show up nowadays. When you expect them to do something, they do the complete opposite. But what scares and surprises me the most is the lack of response from the two of them, no matter what they can always appear calm.  Overall, I ranked this anime a 9/10. Although I would say that it's closer to a 9.5/10.  This is my first review, so I hope I did well;Recommended
2;Zetsuen no Tempest;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;8;"Some secrets are better left dead.  Yet, in some ways, they always seem to come back from the past and continue to be part of your lives. It's like when you go through a photo album and you see that one picture which strikes you the most. You take out that picture and examines it carefully and take a trip down memory lane. However, in this series, that memory lane isn't a happy memory. No, in fact, it's one ride you wish you'd never had taken because from that event, things are never the same again.  Zetsuen no Tempest (also known as Blast of Tempest) is an anime series adapted from the manga of the same name handled by Bones. The studio is already known for some of their other works with the supernatural/super power themes such as Full Metal Alchemist, Darker than Black, and Star Driver. Their latest title in their line of evolution of works is this little gem. Written by Kyou Shirodaira, the series follows the aftermath involving lives of two best friends after the events of a tragic past. To uncover the mysteries of the past, they seek the help of a powerful magician and with their help might find the answer they are looking for. At the same time, it's up to the duo to stop a mysterious clan on the horizon to prevent the end of the world.  Sounds all intriguing and mind bobbling right? Well, that's what it seems at first especially with the rather confusing pilot episode...  On the surface, there are many questions that seems to need answers not only revolving for the main protagonists but for ourselves as well. It's no surprise there is so much mystery involved either considering the author of the series is also involved in another mystery title, Spiral: The Bonds of Reasoning. The pilot episode suggests this with introduction of the main characters and a small glimpse of their mysterious past. Curiously enough, we also see the “mage in the barrel” (as the pilot episode suggests) that may make us scratch our heads a bit more. In fact, we can even see blood and tragedy already from the backgrounds. Furthermore, there seems to be a barrage of butterflies roaming in the air as well as the monotonic speeches from the main protagonists. To add to the package, we have some action including a dark haired beauty, shounen-style action gags, and a seemingly civilization that is in ruins for God-knows-what reasons with a touch of magic. All sound mind bobbling, doesn't it? For some reason, it's how the series begin and towards the ends it shows the dark revelation of a tragedy. In order to embrace on what's to come, it's imperative to watch the series with some insight and with your brains focused on more than just the pretty visuals.  Oh but visuals itself doesn't just represent Zetusen no Tempest. It's a bit more than that. For fans of Shakespeare, this could be a delight of those into his literature. As a matter of fact, a few of the dialogues and characters may represent his works themselves. For example, the term “Tempest” could be a homage of Shakespeare's work of “The Tempest”, which was assumed to be one of his last creations. The themes from that play such as an island setting, magic, and those bits of romance suggests this and be converted into modern times. It's quite appealing to watch though as most of us who attends those boring English classes at high school and sleeping through discussions (you know who you are) might get a pleasant surprise at this series. If not, well then, tough break.  The plot of the series seems to be quite attractive not only with the mysterious backgrounds but also the way it is presented. The Tree of Exodus seems to play a prominent role to determine the fate of the world by the way everyone tries to learn and awaken its power. It can also be implied that the Tree of Exodus may be a key to unlock the main protagonists' past tragedies and the truth they are looking for. Nevertheless, it is definitely important since everyone wishes to get to it before the others. The mysteries surrounding the plot seems also revolve around the purpose and true origins of that tree. Why was it there? What is its power? And how did it came to be are just a few of many questions that the viewers may ask themselves when progressing through this series. There also seems cases of government conspiracies and conflicts between clans with its fellow mages. All of this spells out the word confusion (it sure did for me!) in the first half of the series.  There are also various flashbacks played throughout the series from the viewpoint of Mahiro related to the case of a main character. She is in fact already dead prior to the series but maintains a strong after-presence with her backgrounds and the mysteries that resulted her death. Plus, there is peach haired princess Hakaze who is crafty, resourceful, and often likes to play mini mind games with the antagonist, and at times with Mahiro and Yoshino. Bored much? Well, probably from being stranded on that island for an extended period of time. In fact, she has her own little secret that gets revealed soon and that itself is a mystery. Nonetheless, the plot twists and various sequences are crafted carefully in order to not go off track and often makes viewers question themselves on what's next. That's where the thriller part comes in. It is thrilling with some of the surprises but at other times, just cliched or even predictable. However, it should be no surprise that Mahiro clearly wants revenge expressed by the look of his face each time his past is reminded. He wants vengeance for his tragic past and he'll stop at nothing to achieve it. Mahiro desire for revenge spells out his determination and what he wants. Yet, there's a point to be said here. Even if he achieves his goal of revenge, the past won't change. The dead don't just get back and walk again.  The series maintains a small cast of characters rather than a whole all-star ensemble. The two main male protagonists, Mahiro and Yoshino seems to resemble a reflection of William Shakespeare's famous works, Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet respectively. If we look at it carefully, Mahiro seeks revenge for his tragic past similar to Prince Halmet from the play. Mahiro struggles to avenge the death of his family while at times becomes irrational in the way of him doing things. On the other hand, there's Yoshino who seems to allude the character Romeo. In Shakespeare's famous play, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo loses someone they hold dear to their heart. The result of that loss becomes a tragedy in what seems to be a forbidden love story from his work. Behind the scenes of all this drama is the girl Aika who despite her lack of a physical presence in the series seems to influence it more than anything. Although she doesn't technically make a physical appearance in the show in its present storyline, viewers can clearly see that she is a special individual to both the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, even Hakaze is curious about her (despite not seemingly know who she is) after being acquainted with the main protagonists. From my viewpoint, Aika seems to represent a girl with a mysterious personality with a manipulative state of mind.  The antagonist of the series, Samon also has a mysterious way of doing his things. In particular, he seeks out the Tree of Exodus with his clan but at the same time seems to want to prevent the destruction of the world with his own ideologies. Behind that suit also seems to lie an insecure individual even with the protection of one of the most elite of those mages from the series.  As being action, fantasy, and shounen all at once, expect some action throughout the series. The way is presented is in a magical way that although lacks strategy focuses more on morality even doing the occasional dialogues between the fight scenes. However, this doesn't last too long. The fight scenes are significantly toned down later on and hell, even eradicated later on from the show. It goes from action packed to lengthy dialogue that almost seems like reading a textbook. The certain shift of sequences from saving the world to speeches toned me off a bit especially when one moment, there seems to be cool action with an apocalyptic presentation. Then, the next moment it shifts to long dragged out speeches about morality, identity, and more mysteries. The speeches themselves seems to be a bit confusing and not surprisingly enough has Mahiro voice his desire to take revenge AGAIN. The way the characters speak in some of the later dialogues also seems repetitive and digs a bigger hole to the mystery itself with more and more bizarre revelations.  In terms of artwork, Zetsuen no Tempest has a well crafted image of portraying its various scenes. The art directors makes most of the visuals appealing that gets to the point with the themes of the series. In fact, most of the palates and crafted visuals represents the civilization, the tragic scenes, flashbacks, paradise, etc. The characters' designs are also visually represented well especially Aika who has a sense of beauty in her manipulative ways. The series even attempts some jokes with its visuals such as the snickers bar. There some bits of fan service mainly involving around Hakaze by the way she dresses on the island during wet days. But it's really not too much in my opinion.  The soundtrack of the series has many Shakespearean like rhythm to them. It should not be a surprise though given the themes of the series. Kazuhiro Wakabayashi (Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain, xxxHolic) orchestrates many of the music scores well and develop that sense of mysterious atmosphere in many episodes. In fact, the eerie soundtrack and factors with the dialogues matches well with the rhythms. The opening song, ""Spirit Inspiration"" by Nothing's Carved In Stone from the first half has a strong representation in the sense of what the series may be potential be about. All the main characters as well as some of the supporting characters are presented along with potential conflicts. The first ED song, “happy endings"" is presented by Kana Hanazawa who does quite a nice job with her voice. The song shows many of the more metamorphic images involving the main characters as well as the butterflies as seen throughout many times in the series. She also happens to voice one of the main characters in the series, Aika.  All in all, Zetsuen no Tempest represents a modern style mystery with some ancestry blood of William Shakespearean work bought to life. The life of one of the main characters no longer exists and that set off many of the conflicts. The conflicts from this series are quite a twist with the various plot holes and surprises. It can be thrilling even with the dialogues but at times, it can also be a bit bothersome. It's a mysterious series to me and should be considered a watch.";Recommended
3;Zetsuen no Tempest;explicit707;https://myanimelist.net/profile/explicit707;9;"This is a story that constantly quotes and references Hamlet and The Tempest, both works of Shakespeare. Some people will love that fact, while others may be a little annoyed. I thought it was done very well, and I really loved the theme and the execution of this series. I have not read the Manga it is based on, but I never expected to love this series going into it. I was pleasantly surprised and it's now one of my favorites. It is a great blend of story, dialogue, action, and it has a great visual and audio presentation.  What's it about? The synopsis doesn't really say. It's about magic, it's about relationships, it's about the end of the world, and it's about quirky characters that interact with each other in very bizarre ways. It's difficult to describe without throwing spoilers around. Think ""Shakespeare Play"" and you'll get the feel of it right away!  This is one of those beautifully done series as far as artwork and animation goes. It's consistent, it's good quality and it has some wow moments. The music fits well, and it enhances the experience, and the voice acting is done very well. Being filled with so much dialogue, this is an important piece for them to nail and I think they did just that. I loved the package, I loved the execution, and I really think it shines in these elements.  The characters of Zetsuen no Tempest were dysfunctional, unexpected, and yet wonderful at the same time. The two main characters were not your stereotypical heroes, in fact their roles in this story were borderline bizarre. This story is based on the emotional involvement of these main characters. They do have their awesome moments early on, but later in the story are not the dominant ""action heroes"" of the tale by any means. The fate of the world revolves around the ""feelings"" of all parties involved, and the two main characters relationship with each other keep the fate of mankind hanging in the balance. It is a character driven story, and the characters are not swarming with stereotypes. I loved that fact about Zetsuen no Tempest, and I think it gives it that little extra something.  Now the story.... I loved the story, though it's filled with plot holes and flawed logic. The flawed logic is going to really bother some people, but the constant reference to the flawed logic of “the world” really almost pokes fun at the story in general. It’s a little ridiculous while being absolutely wonderful at the same time. The fact is that the flaws are used as storytelling devices, and it's the plot holes and flaws that help tell the story properly. It is a little obvious at times, but it has some nice little twists and surprises that keep it fresh. Best of all it’s told in such a way that it was easy to watch week to week. I looked forward to every episode and the cliffhangers were done very well.  I really loved this series. It was different enough to feel fresh while being absurd and intriguing at the same time. I loved the main characters and I loved how it tried to imitate Shakespeare in its delivery. The fast and quirky dialogue while focusing on the interpersonal relationships made this series special. I highly recommend it!";Recommended
4;Zetsuen no Tempest;eskimoseb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eskimoseb;9;"“There is more shounen ai in this anime, Horatio, than is dreamt of in your philosophy” - Definitely not Shakespeare  A light hearted review of Blast of Tempest (my first, so suggestions welcome)  Blast of Tempest (Tempest for short) is, for some inexplicable reason, a love letter to two of Shakespeare’s most enduring plays: The Tempest and Hamlet. A strange concept it is indeed, and this anime is, without a doubt, one of the most pretentious I have seen as a result. I admire the writer for being self-absorbed enough to take two classic pieces of literature, and squeeze them into the context of a high-schooler mystery action anime. Surprisingly though, it is exactly this confidence that the show exudes that makes the mixture click beautifully.  Our main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino, are thrust almost immediately into a world where everyone is turning into stone, Mahiro’s found a doll allowing him to speak to Kusaribe Hakaze (a half-naked magician/tsundere stuck on an island) with Yoshino just following along looking generally photogenic. Standard fare then, for a shounen series. The real standout feature for the series presents itself rather abruptly with the fixation on referencing Shakespeare, particularly when Fuwa Aika (Mahiro’s recently murdered sister) enters the stage. The story and characters aren’t just inspired by Shakespeare, they’re going to make sure you know the sole reason they have for their existence is to be going around quoting Shakespeare.  So it is unsurprising, given the plays this anime is inspired by, that this is a tale of revenge primarily for both the main characters. For Mahiro, it is a chance to use his newfound magic capabilities thanks to Hakaze in order to track down his sister’s killer (for whom he has a very obvious, entirely unrequited, love). Yoshino meanwhile is determined to gain peace of mind for the death of Aika, who until her death was secretly dating Yoshino under her brother’s nose. Yoshino tries to make it seem that he tags along however so as not to see the killer punished by Mahiro, to uphold his position as our inevitable token idealistic anime character (in the very best of ways though).  Anyone familiar with the stories of The Tempest or Hamlet will quickly notice the similarities between Blast of Tempest’s two main characters and the protagonists of The Tempest and Hamlet. Mahiro in his hell-bent devotion to revenge, calls Hamlet to mind, whereas in his more optimistic but rational moments, Yoshino is a transparent reference to The Tempest’s Prospero. While not necessary, as the anime does a reasonable job of explaining to the audience the overall themes behind The Tempest and Hamlet, anyone with even a passing knowledge of the stories and in particular the characters of both these Shakespeare plays will no doubt leaving the anime more satisfied. The ties to Shakespeare the story and characters the anime holds become more and more elegant as it progresses, and are certainly one of the most enjoyable features of the anime. That is, if you can handle the sacrilege that is an anime so arrogantly ripping of the works of the one true playwright (note: sarcasm)  Secondary characters in the show are largely passable, especially after the change in personality much of the characters have in the second half of the anime, which adopts a far more shounen tone than its first half. What you make of this is very much dependent on your overall opinion of typical shounen anime. If anyone had to animate this show though, I am glad it was studio Bones; the light-dark tones of the second half of Tempest are reminiscent of the comedy tones Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood had going for it when it wasn’t being a horribly dark I see you’ve just turned that poor girl into a monster you heartless bastards sort of show.  Blast of Tempest’s animation is what I would expect coming from Bones, not up there but definitely pleasant to the eye. I think Bones knew however that they wouldn’t need exquisitely animated backgrounds, because it surely isn’t just me who can’t get over those character designs? The power of photogenicity is definitely strong in these ones. And respect to Bones for making a show where some of the characters do occasionally find themselves wearing different clothing. If you’re not a fan of shounen ai, stay very much clear – this show is like the gateway drug to watching Free! - Iwatobi Swim Club.  The music as well ranks very highly for this show – particular props to Fuwa Aika’s seiyuu, Hanazawa Kana (also known for Kuroneko in OreImo and Mayuri in Steins;Gate), who apart from playing the ultimate ice queen as Aika, can lay claim to one of the more pleasant ending songs I have listened to. Spirit Inspiration, the first op, is great fun as well, if utterly, entirely devoid of actual meaning. Wholly deserving of my best use of engrish 2013 award.  Bones no doubt took a bit of a gamble with this show – the story is so far up its own behind it probably put many people off without giving it time to settle down and, worse still, it isn’t set in a high school. I am so glad however that they did. This 25 episode anime has an incredibly satisfying sense of progression, taking time to slow itself down before each crescendo, with the first half in particular being one of my favourite arcs in anime. If logic and rational progression in a shounen story aren’t your thing, you will probably leave Blast of Tempest feeling underwhelmed, as my favourite episodes of the series, episodes 9-12, are spent almost entirely stationary by the main characters, engaging in a good old fashioned debate. However, if you appreciate more logical progression in a storyline with a good sense of pacing, and less fanservice-based, more intelligently designed characters, you should definitely give Blast of Tempest a look. If the entire concept sounds mad but cool to you, that’s exactly what it is, and it’s brilliant for it.  Recommendation: Psycho Pass for a similarly pretentious and yet oddly satisfying storyline, filled with photogenic characters galore (and a penchant for quoting various well-known authors). Funnily enough, the band responsible for Tempest’s first op also has a (rather good) op in Psycho Pass. Note that Psycho Pass is a work of Gen Urobuchi, so by definition almost is darker than FMA and Blast of Tempest combined, with room to spare for a Madoka Magica sequel.";Recommended
5;Zetsuen no Tempest;Codered-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Codered-sama;9;This is one of the best psychological anime that I have ever seen till now (Might change in the future if I stumble upon another anime which is even greater than this). Let’s find out why is it the best psychological anime, Shall we?  Story: 9/10  This was just wonderfully written and done. It was simply epic. I don’t marathon a anime in a single day but Zetsuen no Tempest made me marathon it in just a day. This was an anime which I shall call the mother of all plot twists. You will think exactly the opposite of what will happen *no let me correct that* No you are actually made to think the opposite of exactly what will happen. I still wonder how this isn't in the top 100. This should be rated even higher than it’ current ran of 277th. I did not expect disappointment when I picked this show and it didn't give me disappointment either. All the questions we have near the end of the anime are answered (Well that was for me though). The story was at a really good pace and even leaving a few hours for some work will make you want to watch the next episode and find out what is going on. It’s that kind of feeling I had.  Sound: 9/10  Now this was another brilliant part of the anime. The 2 OP as well as the 2 ED will not disappoint you (ED 1 made me sleepy actually). The OP 1 was completely sung in English by Nothing’s Craved in stone, yes you heard me right. It’s a full English OP and not a semi one and it was damn good to listen to. They have also sung OP 2 of Psycho Pass too. The OST were pretty well done and a few were done by the people in Key and the OST just fit in with the scenes.  Characters: 9/10  They weren't uninteresting nor interesting, they were just good and they did their roles well. The 2 male MC were just brilliant (in terms of having brains.) They both were intelligent but they both had their own separate ways in dealing with the same problem. We were also shown of a few side characters past or we were more exposed to them = learning who and how they are. So it didn't suck there. We were introduced to a lot of characters but the main side characters behaviours and how they truly are were shown which is supposed to be important in all anime. We also had a few plot twists in the characters itself too.  Animation: 9/10  Again this was good. There were some parts where it did go downhill for a few secs but they were ok for me as the story is more important to me. The CG were pretty good too. The CG didn't even feel like it was Different. The OP2 introduced to us the new characters and it was enjoyable looking at it. Well there was not much here for me  Enjoyment: 8/10  I enjoyed it pretty well. There were few episodes of enjoyment + it did keep me entertained the entire anime. So if you think this is all a serious anime then you are wrong. There of course need to be fun time too.  Overall: A Really good psychological + supernatural anime I would recommend to watch  Overall score: 8.8  Personal note: These are entirely my opinions and you don’t have to agree or disagree with me.;Recommended
6;Zetsuen no Tempest;TheGunners;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheGunners;7;"Before getting into the review, let me say that, Zetsuen no Tempest is heavily linked with the works of William Shakespeare. The Tempest and Hamlet are the two pieces used and having some prior knowledge on these two texts does help fully appreciate Zetsuen no Tempest. If you have an indepth understanding of both of the plays you'll be able to notice the similarities and predict some scenarios beforehand. However, the anime does a good job of not making it a prerequisite and thus the general audience will be able to follow. Simply put, the major difference between the two is that; Hamlet is a tragedy while The Tempest ends happily. There are many references of the two pieces, while the plot and characters are heavily influenced from both The Tempest and Hamlet.  The first episode sets the up the plot and wastes no time in getting into the action. From the episode, it's evident that there are two main complications. The first is of the death of Aika Fuwa (Mahrio's sister), and Mahiro is trying to hunt the killer himself. The second key plot is about the Kurasibe Clan. Hazkaze (female lead) is stranded on an island, because Samon (Kurasibe Clan leader) wants to awaken the Tree of Exodous. Simply put, there is the possibility of an apocalyptic-type destruction to occur if the tree is awoken from its slumber. The two stories approach closer and closer, as the series progresses only to tangle into one bigger picture.  Zetusen no Tempest does a good job of making it appear more complicated than it really is. The basic plot is covered with mystery and psychological elements which are used to disrupt the predictability. New aspects are continuously added to create unexpected moments and attempt to confuse the audience.  Zetsuen no Tempest has a lead dual protagonist, of equal position, which is pretty rare and difficult to pull off. However it manages to do it exceptionally well and thus characters Mahiro and Yoshino are appealing. Mahiro started off as someone who was blinded for revenge, but only to become more mature and calm than at first. Yoshino appears as an innocent bystander, but as the story progresses, the perception of his character changes. They give mutual assurance to each other as arise, which helps advance the story. Their relationship starts as friends, with some background to it, but changes overtime. Bonds are tested by issues and complications arise which can only deepen or break friendships.  Hakaze Kusaribe is a sorceress and the strongest one in history. Hakaze isn't as central as the duo but still went through some growth and change. Her selflessness was the most evident part of her personality, and thus it goes through the biggest development. She is the strongest magic user and thus becomes an invaluable person in most of the situations in combat. Her relationship with the other characters can only grow after being in isolation for so long, and she begins emotions she hasn't felt before.  Secondary characters weren't as influential but they were important to the initial advancement of the story. They each had a role to create a complication, helping the main characters mature. They played apart in conversations and various narrations. But towards the second half, they began to lose their purpose as the main plot was becoming uncovered. Their roles started declining and becoming almost generic, like a backdrop to the scenes.  The latter half of the series lacked what made the first half so special. In the first half , the predictability was never there because the characters were indefinite. They still weren't fully matured and thus could do the unexpected by, having a change of heart. The plot was also purposely undeveloped but flexible allowing it to potentially stray off into any direction. In the second half, the general plot was revealed and thus it loses its charm of secrecy. However, it does a solid job of maintaining the major mystery of Aika's death until the very end. Zetsuen no Tempest had the choice of either ending as The Tempest or Hamlet. Though I won't say how it ends, the one it does choose is rather forcible.  The use of magic brings a supernatural theme, but takes away some of its realism. And thankfully it did not go over the top with the use of magic. Its primary uses were for combat, destruction and for some odd bits and pieces. It wasn't a major part of the anime, but instead adds another dimension of possibilities to the already flexible plot.  The depressed atmosphere goes well with the world ending theme. There was little action in general but for the small pieces of combat were animated nicely. The fighting scene act as a change of pace from the rest of the anime. There was a good amount of it, never too much or too little. The art-style looked good and consistent throughout. While the character models depicted the personalities of the characters. The soundtrack worked well and only enhanced the mood.  In the end the anime handled itself well and its ending that ties up the ends. The series as a whole, balances all the components, and has an excellent cast of characters. Although the first half is noticeably better than the second and attempts to force a specific ending, but no doubt it was worth the watch.";Recommended
7;Zetsuen no Tempest;MrSunshine004;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MrSunshine004;10;My favorite anime this season, really interesting story that pays homage to Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Tempest while integrating its own original storyline and unique characters.  Zetsunen no Tempest, a story of revenge and tragedy. Referencing Shakespeare's Hamlet, the story portrayed can lead to tragic end of revenge where sadness is reflected with more sadness. However, there is also The Tempest, the alternative end to a story of revenge. An ending where all is forgiven and sadness is repaid with forgiveness and happiness.  Story: Amazing plot, the story of revenge leads the audience to decide whether the ending should be one of tragedy or happy ending. Loved how Zetsuen no Tempest tells a story of magic and mythology, at the same time giving the possibility that what seems like magic and gods could merely be science at a level above one's comprehension. The story involves a lot of psychology theme which is a favorite of mine. Questioning just how one should response to loss of loved one, by either responding with desire for revenge or to continue living a normal life. Honestly this story deserves a higher rating than 8, a majority of top animes with high ratings are romance comedy. This story is interesting! It helps question what it means to be human, whether being logical all the time is appropriate or to express those emotions we humans were given to show. Using the words from Hamlet and The Tempest, truly made the story more elegant and beautiful. Showing that humans not only desire a meaningful life, but a meaningful death. Not to mention Zetsuen no Tempest help question whether lifes' coincidences are just coincidences or do they tie to pre destined state of events in life.  Art: Enjoyed the art definitely, characters were well design. Loved how Aika's death was shown to be mysterious, beautiful and meaningful when given reason for her death but also cold and tragic without understanding what was the point of her death. Mahiro's character art was well drawn as well, his appearance gave off a rebellious leader aura that was recklessly yet rational. Yoshino's character art was also well suited for his character and personality, looking somewhat regular like character but hiding a calculative intelligent persona that at times lack delicacy due to experience.  Sound: The classical use of music helped produced the atmosphere really well. Music being classical really help Zetsuen no Tempest relate to Shakespeare's Hamlet and the Tempest even most so. Not much to say otherwise.  Characters: Loved all the characters, especially Aika for being the mastermind behind our 2 protagonists' journey for revenge and truth. Aika (also voiced by my favorite seiyuu) was my favourite, her personality being a little bit of everything. Strong and cold by being able to make the decision of her death all on her own, playing an act in front of Mahiro with Yoshino to keep their relationship a secret. Yet having a soft, warm and playful side to her that is somewhat childish at times. During times with her and just Yoshino or arguing with Mahiro because neither were afraid of her but rather felt the need to protect her frail looking appearance. Yoshino was my favourite character for first half of the story, being able to calmly make decisions and act out of rationality, adapting when necessary. Being perfect yet imperfect was what made him interesting. Since Aika mentioned that Yoshino is able to be calm and act rational at all times is because he goes with the flow adapting when necessary, able to be everything appropriate but unable to be individual. Mahiro wasn't much of a favorite character but likable nevertheless. A typical rebellious cold and cool character, reckless yet has good rational than most rebellious characters would. Hakaze being the opposite half of Aika was good to have. A sheltered princess unknowing to common sense, having an outward tough exterior but is actual frail on the inside being the maiden she is. Complete opposite of Aika who was frail in appearance but strong willed in personality, complementing each other's character.  Enjoyment: Probably one of my new top favorites indefinitely, since its rare to have good tragedy stories. Not to mention a tragedy story with a good turn around. Plus despite the continuous bombardment of tragic plot events, it had some slight comedic relief time to time to help keep the story from being depressing. One of my favorite reasons that I enjoyed this story was that it was not 2 protagonist with special traits or abilities, but rather 2 ordinary high school students at a unique place at a unique time, making it very adaptive to the idea that no matter how normal the life you live is. You are your own protagonist in your own story. An enjoyable story of what may seem like predetermined act with actors following a script, but it is the actor's will to carry out those lines.;Recommended
8;Zetsuen no Tempest;FMehdi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FMehdi;9;"Zetsuen No Tempest is one of those series that you'll come across accidentally, instead of getting it recommended from an anime-loving friend, and after finishing it, you'll be scratching your head, wondering why it isn't higher up in the rankings. But what makes it so good? Let's find out, shall we?  Story:  At first, the story may seem like a typical shonen; the two main characters are trying to save the world, with the help of a stranger, from a seemingly evil group (and a tree!). However, as you progress through the series, you'll start realizing there's a lot more than to what meets the eye. The story becomes a roller-coaster ride midway and until the end, you'll be on the edge of the seat, captivated by the flow of the story.  Art:  This is probably the weakest point of the series. Although it's not horrible, the art is not exceptional either, and the animation does no justice to the series, with regular animation errors that you can't help but face-palm at. Try not to be too hung up on the errors, or it might be make the experience a bit more unpleasant.  Sound:  The music is pretty decent, in my opinion. The first opening, Spirit Inspiration, is a fun ride (although its lyrics make no sense), and he two endings are a pleasant experience. The background music is also well done, with each piece setting the mood properly, if not perfectly.  Characters:  Undoubtedly the best part of the series. Each character is different from the other. Most of them, including the supporting protagonists, have character developments which range from good to amazing. The dialogues are the highest points of the show, with frequent references to Shakespearean plays like Hamlet and The Tempest which are used to great effect.  Enjoyment:  To be honest, I was pretty skeptical of the show at first. Little did I know though, it would be one hell of a hectic ride that would keep my eyes glued to the screen at all times and prevent me from ever wanting to take a break.  Overall:  In conclusion, Zetsuen No Tempest is like a sports car you haven't used in a long time: it takes some time to get to its best, but when it does, you won't look back. It's a gem of a series which deserves a lot of recognition, and I can safely say it is one of the finest anime I've seen in my life.";Recommended
9;Zetsuen no Tempest;yogotah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yogotah;10;"Would you obliterate this world for the sake of someone you love? Would you go against the logic of the world to achieve your goals?  Zetsuen No Tempest is a masterly written piece of work that challenges the watcher to reflect on their ideas of death, love, and logic. I started this anime with low expectations. I am a rather optimistic person, and the premise of a dystopic world did not attract much enthusiasm from me. Zestuen No Tempest, however, is not just a story of some parallel dystopian world, but rather a personal story involving love and tragedy.  Story  ZNT prides itself in their story telling. Yes, there are numerous action scenes to gratify our blood-thirsty anime watching peers but these are not the most impressive features of the anime. The splendidity is established in the plot and dialog. ZNT did a great job with dialog. The initial proposition of the anime were not striking. You have a world where there is a special clan, called the Kusaribe, that can manipulate technology to use their power, which they call magic. It seems like this “magic” comes from a tree, and the magic can only be used to enforce the world's logic. Nothing mind blowing.  The story is less about magic but rather the peculiar circumstances of the two main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino. These two characters are both thrown into this surreal world of magic after the murder of their beloved, Fuwa Aika. Mahiro is bent on avenging his little sister, while Yoshino is struggling to find inner peace with this news. These two personalities are the driving force of the plot.  I think Yoshino and Mahiro had a terrific dynamic that kept me in the edge of my seat, at least, during the first half of the anime. Yoshino and Mahiro are supposedly friends, but their relationship are at first pictured ambiguously. Their devious personalities made me suspicious of their real motives, but it is those parts that made the anime so intense and eye grabbing.  Though the anime is rather dark, there are comedic elements that help alleviate some of the darkness that surrounds the story. I am not a fan of ""fan service"" but there were some of it in the anime. It was all nicely placed and didn't interfered with the viewing experience. Some of it was actually nicely appreciated.  The first half of this anime was phenomenal. The intensity of those first few episodes were unprecedented in my experience, and the most surprising part was how they executed it. I will not spill spoilers, but those parts were dialog-driven, and it is spectacular how those scenes captured you into the story and made your mind thrilled at every new twist.  The second half of the anime was not as intense as the first half, but by no mean was it sub par. The second half just added more to the story. The introduction of a certain anticipated female character was the main event, but there were other factors that made the second half excellent.  Overall, I give the story 8/10.  Sound 10/10  The scores says it all. Not much to explain.  I enjoyed the second half's opening and closing more than the first half's Op and Ed. Both of them were good.  The BGM was excellent and fit every scene. It was so unique and theatrical in it's volume and instrument used. The epicness, the intensity, and the dystopia shown were all equally fitted with superb background music.  Will definitely check out the OST when I get the chance.  Characters  10/10  I mentioned earlier that the plot drives the anime, and while this is true, it is the characters that pushes the plot forward. ZNT did not flesh out every character that were introduced ( there were some characters that we never even got to see at all) but they managed to really fulfill the characters that were the most central to their story. These central characters would be Mahiro, Yoshino, Hazake, and Aika.  Mahiro- He was my favorite character of the series. His intellect could not be denied, his will power was impeccable, and his vengeance nothing to play with. I felt bad for him throughout the anime since it seemed like he was the one in most pain, and I couldn't see a good ending for him emotionally. One that is driven for revenge usually doesn't have the best ending. There was character development and Mahiro did change a bit, though he would deny it. I like seeing his interactions with others, though Mahiro seems like he can do it all, he does have trouble with communication, which gave some good comedic relief on my part. Liked his character design.  Yoshino- I have mixed feelings about this character. I mostly like him but I still feel like we didn't really get to delve into who Yoshino really is. I get it. He prides himself in not showing his emotion to anyone, but you would think that we would at least get a glimpse, as us watchers, to his inner attitude towards other characters. Besides that, I really enjoyed this character. He is not your typical MC, he is smart, conscious, and and not afraid to get his hand dirty. He is a complex character, and you always want your MC to be more than one dimensional. Unique character design, but looks like Light Yagami in some angles.  Hazake: I did not like her at first, but she grew on me over time. She's smart, but has an annoying attitude. She is extremely arrogant. This makes sense however, since she was raised as a princess, and is the strongest person of the Kusaribe tribe. She grew on me later, because we got to see different sides of her, and it made her more human to me. I grew very fond of her. Typical but fitting character design. She was a bit too short for my opinion. Maybe she has a Napoleon complex......  Aika: The mysterious girl that has captured the heart of the two main MCs and thrown logic out of joint. The girl in love with Shakespeare tragedies, and can be seen religiously quoting verses from Hamlet and Tempest. I enjoyed Aika. I think the anime foreshadowed her to be this special and unique character, and I thought they were doing too much with all her flashbacks, but in the end, Aika in full glory was all that I thought she would be. Her witty remarks, her dark humor, her sexual teasing, I loved it all. She certainly deserves all the attention given to her in Zetsuen No Tempest. Pretty Character design, seems to be in contrast to Hazake's design.  Enjoyment 10/10  Zetsuen No Tempest was a heck of a ride. The first half shined as bright as any anime I have ever seen, and the second half was spectacular in their transition. The theme of the anime about wanting to change the world for someone you love is reiterated and explained throughout the anime. There are numerous quotes from Hamlet and Tempest, and I would be surprised if one is not at least tempted to get into Shakespeare after completing this anime. The enjoyment was out of the roof for me, I initially gave this anime an 9/10...but there was two episode in the second half that boosted the anime to a perfect score.  But the anime was not perfect, there were some underwhelming parts, but overall, I cannot disregard the tremendous excitement that I felt while watching this anime.  I recommend this to anyone that enjoys a great Ost, drama, love, and battle of wits.  Outstanding (10/10)";Recommended
10;Zetsuen no Tempest;TheLlama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheLlama;7;"Can you blame an anime for having too much... anime in it?  Perhaps not, but Zetsuen no Tempest tried its dardnest to convince me of it. I do not by that mean that it has a sickening over-abundance of weathered shonen tropes, overt fanservice, cringeworthy harem setups and moe everywhere you look - it has some of these things to moderate extents, but not enough that it feels bad. Nor is it the fact that that quotes and references classical literature are a dime a dozen; a feature all too familiar with those who enjoy more philosophical and ponderous animes (and perhaps fiction in general), and one which does work within certain frameworks and in moderate amounts, but usually, as ends up the case with Tempest, winds up as a contrived and counter-productive attempt at appearing edgy and smart, leaving the overarching work with a bitter taste of pseudo-intellectuality.  No, in fact, Tempest surprised me by having a series of opening episodes that actually pulled me in and left me intrigued, by playing out the setup in a very fascinating manner, leaving little breathing room as you gradually get a sense of a bleak situation that leaves the necessary blanks, aided by animation and music that sets up just the right tone - something Bones has a fairly decent track record with. Indeed as the plot unfolds and unravels to the viewer, we are treated to a handful of very nice twists; some are expected but none the less engaging whilst others come as a bit of a surprise, one that makes sense in hindsight, as any good twist should. The characters as introduced appear multi-layered and there's a lot that's said by nothing being said in terms of interaction and emotion.  And then... it all sort of fizzles out, not after fifteen episodes or half the series but alrady seven-eight or so episodes in it had become clear which direction it was headed, and it was not a particularly good one; I was wondering every time I was about to open the next episode. I kept hoping it didn't lose the tempo and the mood it had created - certainly, any mysterious fog about characters and the plot is bound to unravel, but it can be done elegantly or bluntly, done well or done poorly, and in some ways it did manage to keep going and hold strong to what it did well, what set it apart (and in a good sense at that) but more and more it departed and became more.... well, anime-like.  To be specific, then, as I already excluded what I meant by this statement, let me elaborate on what I include in this statement.  First, let it be said: Zetsuen no Tempest is a story about people, who range from the completely ordinary to born with a special destiny, each is faced with carrying the fate of the world on their back to some extent or another, but choose instead to disregard this in favour of acting entirely on their own, personal reasons. People who choose revenge or love over saving the world, or finding meaning in a loved one's death. It is a very interesting angle to start with, as we are usually treated to people who without hesitation tend to accept that they must, indeed, save the world above their personal priorities. To a certain extent, the characters of Zetsuen do this, particularly as time goes on and they learn to cope with their circumstances and come to terms with reality, but they remain personally - emotionally - motivated, which serves a different angle, as indeed many people would not readily say ""OK, I'll save the world"" when presented with such a daunting task, at least not without secondary motivation.  On the other hand, these personal and deeply emotional motivations often find themselves stranded in a vacuum. They are is repeatedly portrayed with an illogical sort of unreasonableness; not just one that can be waved away with basis in the fact that emotions are by nature unreasonable. Rather, it approaches a level of nonsensicality that extends quite beyond the scope of the human condition, it becomes a rather wishy-washy and forced excuse for the characters acting on their own impulses and not caring about saving the world (even though they deep down do), again suffering from the sort of assumed edginess that endless quotes of Shakespearian works are symptomatic of. It is the sort of unreasonableness that is often seen in anime characters as their initial defining characteristics, such as acting only for love or revenge, are taken far beyond their logical conclusion, indeed, even past the often extreme points that revenge can take one - or rather than talking about moving past it ends up becoming something entirely different of a sort, still portrayed as a desire for revenge or love but stooped to a put-on and uncohesive mess that falls on its own rambling, particularly as we are treated to a set of increasingly strained exchanges towards the climax of the first act. It loses aim and purpose in a sense; that is, the plot still knows its direction but the characters and themes feel lost in some sort of hollow vacuum manufactured separate from the narrative, in order to defend their increasingly contrived stances. And, yet, in a twist of irony, it also completely forgoes these stances at times when the story deems it convenient, oft bereft of any explanation.  After this, the second arc ends up being, for the most part, an increasing anticlimax where any sort of pull the story originally had becomes lost, washed away in favour of increasingly, well, anime-esque elements. As the heroine, Hakaze, asks herself in a moment of authorial self-deprecation: ""Is this some sort of romantic comedy?"" Unfortunately, making a joke at your own expense does not excuse shoddy work. It is not just the ""rom-com"" aspects as much as how everyone starts to act more towards anime stereotypes, the standards are more conformed to, scenes and themes and indeed even jokes alternating between the self-regurgitating nonsense, as previously described, and increasingly common anime tropes. It at once manages to depart from that which in a good way set it apart in faovur of the mundane, and also completely soil those more unique aspects, turning it on its head to something that kind of just leaves a bad aftertaste.  So, to re-ask my original question: Can it be blamed for too much an anime, for conforming to its own medium? My gut answers no, and I don't really, but unfortunately it showed a lot of excellent ways to stand apart from the rest early on, only to have that descend into utter banality and near-parodic mirroring of its once-great aspects. And I will not forgive it for introducing butt-monkey character Hanemura, who ironically ends up being almost the most relatable of the bunch at a time when the rest have long since departed any sense of reason or insight. Even so, the late introduction out of nowhere, while perhaps expected of a second arc, does not work in his favour and he feels way too weak and irrelevant a character to have the role that he has thrust upon him.  And, yet, it still offers up the occasional well-placed dialogue or development, even as it goes on, and Yoshino remains an interesting character almost entirely throughout, as one who actually offers some semblance of realism in his approach to situations and particularly his emotional development is interesting to watch. The flashbacks with him and Aika are also highly enjoyable, though Aika is the main ""beneficiary"" of the frequent Shakespeare references, putting her on the put-on edginess pedestal. It should be said that the parallels to characters and themes from the relevant works of Shakespeare do sometimes work heavily in the show's favour, but mostly it falls flat and you are left wondering why it even matters. Mahiro on the other hand is an incredibly dull character, the ""cool guy"" stereotype with an added flavour of revenge to make a very overused form of anti-hero  In the end, Zetsuen no Tempest is an anime that tries, that really tries, to do something good and different, and it almost succeeds but seems to stumble in its own feed as it gets going, which is such a shame, for it started out well. The one highly praisable thing is the soundtrack, and at times the animation, which helps set the mood it needs, but that, too, often fails its job. Most of the second half of the first arc could easily have been condensed into perhaps two episodes, and most of the second arc could have been cut entirely, or condensed equivalently, which would have lent the series the pacing and tempo it would have needed to maintain that excellent mood it sets right off the bat but quickly departs from as it descends into all-too-familiar territory.";Recommended
11;Zetsuen no Tempest;bakuenjincamillo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bakuenjincamillo;10;"Here we have, a superb series that didnt get the spotlight it deseved. The Fall 2012 anime season brought a lot of fan favorite series that would have viewers buzzing so other anime would be dropped. Zetsuen no Tempest was unfortunate, for some, to be part of the latter.  Studio Bones animates another Shonen Gangan manga, but unlike some of their previous adaptions it's not pragmatic and has no gecko ending. Meaning it follows the story all the way through. Some scenes are altered and arranged differently from the original manga but they're arguably improvements. The plot of the anime, even if not original is executed very well. From episode 5 and onwards there's at least one twist or revelation in every episode and Zetsuen no Tempest does this without getting convoluted. It starts out as a simple story about revnge but expands the plot to a worldly scale.  As stated earlier the anime is by Studio Bones so it's given high production values in it's art and animation. The character designs are very attractive; the hairstyles and outfits are very detailed and the colors are deep and vibrant, especially in the character's eyes. The CGI also adds to a beautiful experience, most notably in the action scenes and the animation of butterflies.  The main characters meant to be based off those in Shakespeare's works. Mahiro as Prince Hamlet(Hamlet), Yoshino as Romeo Montague(Romeo & Juliet), Hakaze as Prospero(The Tempest), and Aika as Sycorax(The Tempest) and Ophelia(Hamlet). However, due to the plot of the story, the characters' actions differ and they're spared some of the angst found in a Shakespeare play. In fact Yoshino, Aika, Mahiro(and Hakaze later on) are aware of Shakespeare's works and make a point to not ""let this story end in tragedy). Mahiro is a straightforward, almost stereotypically shonen protagonist, main character. He has an unfettered mind consumed by revenge, yet even he has some wits about him. Yoshino, is a ""Beware the nice guy"" type who isnt afraid to turn into a manipulative bastard. Mahiro doesnt care about the world and even he finds Yoshino ruthless. Hakaze, despite her upbringing is spunky and probably gets the most character development in the series. Then there's Aika, the posthumous chracter, who has a huge impact on the plot, and is brig something to look forward to in the flashbacks as she steals scenes. The supporting cast is pretty small so they're given a lot of screen time to be memorable. All in all , this show has good characterization.  The music is ambitious. It alludes to Shakesperean plays by using deep, orchestral sounds in the episodes. The first opener is a solid rock song and the second one is more melodic and quite possibly fits the show better based off it's lyrics. As for the ending themes, ""Happy Endings"" and ""Bokutachi no Uta"" may feel out of place but are enjoyable nonetheless. If the sound doesnt interest you the voice acting will. Particulary, Toshiyuki Toyanaga whose playing against his type as Mahiro. Toyanaga delves so deep into the role he uses an unrecognizable voice. Still, the rest of the actors are strong. Kouki Uchiyama gives a heartstring pulling perfomance as Yoshino in episode 18. Meanwhile, Miyuki Sawashiro's Hakaze is very spirited and Kana Hanazawa gives Aika an enchanting voice. Rikiya Koyama delivers Samon's inner thoughts effectively.  If there is an issue with Zetsuen no Tempest it's episodes 10-12. What was meant to be a showdown comes out as a debate of sorts, and after some impressive fight scenes, the clever dialogue of the show might not appeal to everyone.  Earlier in the review I wrote that some people may have dropped this anime but for the people who stuck with it, they can tell you that the show kept them on the edge of their seats. I would obviously agree. With all the drama, dailogue, and plot of this show waiting for a new episode every week was almost painful. And now that it's over I'm almost going to feel abandoned.  For all the reasons I put in this review, I'm willing to consider this show a masterpiece. At the risk of sounding like a weaboo I think this is the ""BEST ANIME EVER"" but I know it wont take the #1 spot on MAL because it's got traits that will turn some viewers. Even so, I highly recommend it.";Recommended
12;Zetsuen no Tempest;TsuisutoMirai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TsuisutoMirai;9;This is probably one of the best anime's i have seen. It has many elements from different genres making it very enjoyable for many people. It also has great cliff hangers in almost every episode making it hard for you to stop till the end. It has a quick story line that is fast paced but is still a longer story that is pretty hard to predict even if you think hard about it, it will just change completely.So overall its an amazing anime. It has many genres that are enjoyable, Great story, Beautiful artwork, Interesting characters, Ever changing plot and much more.;Recommended
13;Zetsuen no Tempest;Tsushiro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsushiro;8;This is the first time I'm writing a review for a anime, and I have literally just finished the anime not even 2 minutes ago, I have to say it was overall pretty good. I enjoyed it up to the end, the characters were well built, the art was great, even the story. The story behind it all was very original, and i think its rather hard for some anime now-a-days to do so. Zetsuen no Tempest is a great watch overall, I'd recommend it to anyone, the only hard part of the entire series is getting over some of the main character's personalities which you just find out later makes their character even better. All in all, it's a great watch!;Recommended
14;Zetsuen no Tempest;Kirvan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kirvan;9;Zetsuen no Tempest is the best anime I have watched for quite some time. It's great.  9.2/10  Tempest has a solid story, intriguing and very well thought-out design, powerful characters (as in likable, well writen characters), and very solid pacing. All of these are stuff I have been missing from shows for months now. I've been stuck with shows that don't manage to make you care for the characters even after 12 episodes. Tempest makes you want them right from the start! It really is a mark of greatness when a show can introduce a character with just one or two episodes and make you like them instantly. A rare mark.  The only faults I found with the show is that mid-series there's a twist, and it changes the situations for the MCs quite. It's not bad, doesn't really take anything away from the show, but I would have liked to see more of the setting they had during the first half. Also they referenced Shakespeare way too often. I understand why they reffered to the plays Hamlet and The Tempest both writen by Shapespeare and both relatable to the story in some way, it really brings with it an uncertanity. You don't know which play the shows ending will refer too, and that keeps you guessing as to how it all might end. But during a few episodes it felt like they put way to many references into a single episode, like one per every 4 minutes. It gave of the feeling of talking to a person who saw Hamlet yesterday and is qouting it like he knew it all his life. Even tough he never heard of William Shapespeak before that.  This critique sounds really silly and unecessary, and that's because it is. I had a really hard time finding faults with this show, especially since I don't review the sound or art unless it's extreme of some sort.  It's a very good show. You respect the characters because they acctually seem intellectual. You respect the story and setting because it isn't made too convenient. And you respect the ending because the show keeps you guessing.  Enjoy!;Recommended
15;Zetsuen no Tempest;colorful_smile;https://myanimelist.net/profile/colorful_smile;9;Before reading this review, you need to put in mind that I watched after the original run . so, my perspective would differ from that of those who watched a single episode per week. One more thing, I tried my best to make it spoiler free no need to worry..  Characters: Let me start by stating that there isn’t a real main character in this anime. Which I quite liked . For once everyone get their fare share of screen-time and character development. The Characters are linked in a very impressive way. you will see that the character’s are quite solid , attractive and unique . They have depth , dimensions and great character development . You have the guy who seems reckless and restless but can easily be tamed by logic, The girl who seems mighty and unshakable who’s in fact have the heart of a teenager that can be swayed by passion, the guy who seems kind and indifferent but has his own deep dark secrets . Those who are considered to be traitors but have their reasonable motives etc ...I have to say that it’s one of the strongest points in the anime.  First Half: For a 24 episode anime, it’s expected for the first 5-8 episodes to be invested on characters introduction and story establishment . ZNT is an exception. It throws you right in the middle and gradually reveals its story. This should be an advantage but it turns out to be quite the opposite .. Because the first half of the show sat a very high standard, The second half had a problem keeping up with it., but let’s save that for later .. ZNT is a character driven anime so, psychology plays an important part in it. The story is simply amazing . You can see that all possibilities were considered , every detail was well thought out and explained reasonably. Every action had a logical internal drive . Although action plays an important part in it ,I wouldn’t recommend this for people who don’t want to use their brain or want a straight forwarded action anime. ZNT is not about pure action . there is no good or evil in it .It’s about logic , reasoning and standing for your beliefs you can say that it has a literary feel ( only natural since it’s inspired from Shakespeare’s plays) It may not appeal for all viewers.  Second Half: This is where the anime starts to struggle, It seems as if the anime no longer knows what it wants to be. It switches between slice of life, romance and even teen drama. Luckily for me, I had the choice to watch as many episodes as I want but I can understand where those -who had to wait a week after the other for a single episode - are coming from. It’s not entirely bad but when you compare it with the intensity of the first half it simply falls short.(if it was set in the beginning of the show I doubt anyone would’ve minded) Many people disliked what had come of characters (mostly Hakaze). I don’t want to give spoilers so I’m going to address this briefly , you people need to put in mind that these characters are created to simulate humans who are NOT perfect. You can’t expect them to be cool and awesome- or whatever- all the time. Hakaze spent her life between the country and a deserted island . Her actions are only natural for a teenager going through ( .. ) for the first time. And giving all she’s been through.. anyways, it pays to be patient. The show does redeem itself unlike other shows .. cough~ .. SAO.. The last few episodes are on fire. It will blow your mind . All the masteries are uncovered beautifully and the end is very satisfactory.  Enjoyment : I truly enjoyed this anime. It had its flaws but it’s a great watch after all . It’s worthy to give it a chance . I guaranty that you’ll end up with at least a good watch .The art and sound are incredible . The animation is top notch . The story is -no matter what- original and the characters are memorable.;Recommended
16;Zetsuen no Tempest;ruudes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ruudes;10;"This was one of those series that I had randomly happened to stumble upon on one of my days off. It just so happened to hook and reel me in so strongly that I started and finished all 24 episodes in one sitting -- with the obvious restroom and food breaks. That said, I have no regrets about those 10 hours of my life.  Although this series had the potential for a lot of overwhelming magic battles, a majority of the fights were fought through words and plot devices. I'm not really one for drawn out dialogues, but within this series, it was very well done and kept me hooked. There were three consecutive episodes where the characters hadn't moved an inch, but I hadn't noticed -- and wouldn't have cared even if I did. I was at the edge of my seat until the end.  I really enjoyed the characters. I'm normally a freak for romance, but didn't even mind that there was no hint or suggestion of such until mid-series. The two main protagonists gave me a Nartuo x Sasuke feel, and the plot had set up for many instances where that rivalry could stir up -- but both were able to handle things maturely. Which I feel is pretty rare in anime, so that was pleasantly surprising.  The plot itself was fairly original. I enjoyed the way that by mid-series, I had trained myself to expect the unexpected. This led to my only anticipating a few key parts of the story, as opposed to having most plot ""mysteries"" figured out before they were revealed, per usual.";Recommended
17;Zetsuen no Tempest;Longxinus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Longxinus;9;"Now it might sound very cliché that these two teenagers are on a travel to save the world, but luckily the series does it very well in that regard.  I can start of mentioning the two lesser good things about Zetusen no Tempest:  1. Fuwa Mahiro. One of the main protagonists. At times, he can be too much of a hot-blooded shounen character. Rushes straight into matters with simple and brute solutions, fueled by the emotion of revenge. While this is a good counterpart to the other protagonist and his friend, the intelligent and methodical Takigawa Yoshino, Mahiro's personality can be a bit clichéd and predictable at times, but he also has his good moments.  2. The first few episodes. While I never got a feeling that the pacing of the these first episodes was never rushed, the plot progressed kinda slow. It's not a big issue, but I feel like there could be a slight improvement here. However, this allowed more time to get to know the characters and the situation of the world. It just would be swell if there was a perfect balance between the amount of exposition and plot progression. But after those few episodes, things start to heat up pretty fast!  Now for the good stuff:  - Story: As already mentioned, the whole teenagers-out-to-save-the-world-thing is old as hell, but the way it was executed was rather surprising and unconventional in a good way. You know those typical solutions of typical shounen characters? The ones where they pull a superpower or something similar out of their asses and suddenly the problem is solved? Well, nothing of that here! Here we actually have characters that fight equally with superpowers and words. While the action parts can be entertaining to watch, it is the clever fights with words that steal the show. Words that are carefully crafted with logic, reasoning and lies can even have the power to the turn the tide of a conflict. That itself is something few animes (and far less in shounen animes) can do well, and well Zetsuen no Tempest does.  - Art: I dare say that the art surpassed the manga version. It has a lot cleaner look and emphasized the characters' personalities better than in the manga. Seeing how the drawer for the manga was responsible for the character design of the anime, it isn't too odd, really. Luckily, the production value of this part is a lot higher than your average shounen anime. And for that, I am glad, for Zetusen no Tempest truly deserves it. As far I noticed, there were no cheap shortcuts for the animation and such. The series has a quality feel to it.  - Sound: The music. Without a doubt, the most surprising part of the anime. Here I was expecting somewhat generic music to accompagny the art and story. But boy, was I wrong. The exception is the first opening song. While it isn't necessary a bad song on its own, but it doesn't match too well of the tone of the anime. My favorite track of Zetsuen no Tempest is without the second opening song (""Daisuki na no ni"" by Kylee). It's a catchy and beautiful song with lyrics that fit with the show. Other than that, the show has music that fits with the mood, created with real instruments rather than computer-generated. It really helps set the mood of the moments of the show.  - Characters: I already mentioned the bad things about Fuwa Mahiro, so I'll let that be. But the real star of the show is his friend Takigawa Yoshino. Even just a high-schooler, he is a rather intelligent individual that would rather fight with words and wit than brawn and might. Overall a cool and composed character that is hard to not like. The other characters can be a hit or miss. Just about all characters you meet, are in some way used in future episodes and not just ""thrown away"" like they tend to do in other shounen series. However, some of them don't add too much than other characters. This is more of a nitpick from my side.  So overall, a great series. Too bad the anime didn't cover the epilogue that the manga had. Let's hope they produce this if many enough people enjoy the show! ^^";Recommended
18;Zetsuen no Tempest;vampire5003;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vampire5003;10;"What starts out as a William Shakespeare heavy drama quoting ridiculously in the first episode, ends up becoming one of the most amazing pieces of art I've ever watched.  It was fantastic.  If you watched the first episode like I did back in 2013, pick up the series again. The characters do not quote Hamlet as much as they did in the first episode, and even when they do, you realize why.  There's a few good reasons.  Story: Excellent. Moves a little slow at times, but great!  Art: Lovely character designs, but Bones did great choreography as usual for the fights. A little Shounen Ai/Shoujo style though at times (feminine looking guys).  Sound: Good Voice acting, good OST's, but I gave it a 9 as it was weaker than the rest of the show. I LOVED opening 2 though.  Character: SO MUCH DEVELOPMENT!  Enjoyment: 10/10.  Overall: Watch it. It's great. No, it's excellent. One of my favorites.

19;Zetsuen no Tempest;Kazu-chan-san;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kazu-chan-san;10;"""𝕱𝖎𝖓𝖎𝖘 𝖆𝖚𝖙𝖊𝖒 𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖖𝖚𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓𝖊 𝖕𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖈𝖎𝖕𝖎𝖎"" - If there's a beginning, then logically, there's an ending. (Correct me if I'm wrong. My Latin is rusted as a mummy.)  The Apocalypse is one of my favorite books from the Holy Bible. There's something so enticing and exciting about the world ending. It raises many questions such as: What am I going to do? How much time do I have left? And the people whom I love, what about them? And many, many others. Zetsuen no Tempest (or Blast of Tempest/the Civilization Blaster if you prefer) is about the world ending, vengeance, and much other stuff that I'm not afraid to say that I adore. Its premise reminded me of Kara no Kyoukai: the Garden of Sinners (which is just as good as this series) but a bit more perplexing.  Zetsuen no Tempest has many genres and manages to blend everything perfectly together. Drama, romance, tragedy, and comedy. Yes, comedy. It may not be tagged as such but you know the drill. Drama is time till tragedy (?) and comedy is tragedy plus time. The tragicomic story begins with a murder and mystery, I mean MANY mysteries. The murder of the beautiful Aika Fuwa and the mysteries which are, you know, far too many to list.  𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲:  The Tempest and Hamlet are the main inspirations for this great series. And if you haven't read/watched'em you surely should. Zetsuen no Tempest has a confusing and complex story that is hard yet easy to understand. Pretty contradictory isn't it? Well, you should forget such words when reading this story because the story is just too wonderous to be tainted by such trivial (buzz) words like 'contradiction' and its many synonyms.  The Civilization Blaster feasts on contradictions like ravens and vultures feast on a dead corpse. And I mean it in the best way possible. Every contraction is killed on sight, just kidding, it takes some time for this to happen. And if it didn't, it wouldn't be fun. The Status Quo is shaken and jolted left and right constantly. So you shouldn't expect anything to make sense at first. Even though it eventually does indeed do.  This series is pretty unique in the romantic department. Instead of a love triangle or a/n (unnecessary) harem, rather we have a love polygon featuring all of the main cast. Mahiro loves Aika (yes there's some pseudo-incest in this series). Hakaze loves Yoshino, Aika loves Yoshino, you know what screw it, this series should be called 'Everybody Loves Yoshino' because believe it or not, they do. Now on a more serious note. This series features a pretty uncommon romance, no melodrama, mature ways of dealing with relationships, and a really satisfying conclusion (or an unblissful ending, depending on which pairing you were rooting for, of course).  It's impossible to talk about the English poet and dramaturge William Shakespeare without talking about plays. And Zetsuen no Tempest obviously has many allusions to plays. Mahiro is based on Hamlet. Yoshino is based on Horatio. Hakaze is based around Prospero. And Aika is based on Ophelia. They're all expires of said characters but they still manage to be characters on their own, if you know what I mean.  Even though this series questions the logic of nearly everything. It is pretty simple to understand once all pieces are put together. Don't expect everything to be answered right away and you should also expect some questions to be left unanswered, because, you know, that's how life works. And Zetsuen no Tempest touches heavily on the 'life and death subject. Sometimes saying some beautiful and touching things and sometimes reminding us of Shirou Emiya's (in)famous quote ""People die if they are killed'' or the apotheotic hero Kenshiro Kasumi's illustrious ""You are already dead."" No seriously, every time someone talks about Hakaze's life status something not so smart comes out of their mouth. According to this series logic says stuff such as: ""Although you are alive, you are also dead"" and ""Considering the fact that you were also meant to be dead, but currently live"" makes total sense. And no, I'm not mocking the series, no sarcasm here I swear. It makes complete sense, and that's just another reason to love this series. Because it is pretty hard for such a thing to happen in an unconventional yet satisfying way.  TL;DR: •Confusing doesn't even begin to define it; •Shakespeare quotes errwhere; •Unique and remarkable romance; •Meaningful quotes; •Simple and easy to understand.   𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬:  ""𝒲𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝓌𝑜𝓊𝓁𝒹 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝒶𝓈𝓀 𝒶 𝑔𝓇𝒶𝓋𝑒, 𝓌𝒽𝒾𝒸𝒽 𝒸𝒶𝓃 𝓃𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓇 𝓇𝑒𝓅𝓁𝓎? 𝒲𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝒹𝑜 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝓅𝓇𝒶𝓎 𝒻𝑜𝓇? �?𝒶𝓎𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒶𝓃𝓎𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒶𝒻𝓉𝑒𝓇 𝓈𝑜𝓂𝑒𝑜𝓃𝑒'𝓈 𝒹𝑒𝒶𝓉𝒽 𝒾𝓈 𝒻𝒶𝓇 𝓉𝑜𝑜 𝓁𝒶𝓉𝑒."" - Fuwa, Mahiro (激怒)  This series has no actual protagonists. Just like Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu and Fate/Zero, we have both sides of a story that have just as much importance as the other one. But Mahiro is obviously meant to be the closest thing that we have to a hero. Or should I say a nominal hero?  His thirst for vengeance may make him look like an antagonist. But he's, in fact, just a well-intentioned extremist. I mean, you couldn't and shouldn't expect someone to be calm, quiet, and have a black and white morality when the person you love/d the most is found dead before your eyes, in your own house, on a casual and erratic day of your life. But Mahiro is not a villain, of course. He just looks like one (red eyes are never a good sign). Or the closest thing to one, actually.  Aika's death hits him hard, but he has his ways of dealing with such tragic and undeserving misfortune. Being a sis-con and having wrath as his main cardinal sin are some of the flaws that I found about him. But that doesn't make him a bad character at all. He's my personal favorite character because of his steadfast and ardent personality. His ability to fight with fists and brains. His more than come-hither and endearing design and slinky fashion sense. And also for being an ideal model of how you should write a (pseudo)main character for a Shounen series.  ""𝐻𝑜𝓌 𝓂𝓊𝒸𝒽 𝓌𝑒𝒾𝑔𝒽𝓉 𝒸𝒶𝓃 𝒶 𝓈𝒾𝓂𝓅𝓁𝑒 𝓅𝓇𝑜𝓂𝒾𝓈𝑒 𝒸𝒶𝓇𝓇𝓎?"" - Takigawa, Yoshino (ロジック・シンキング)  The cold and emotionless (pseudo-)protagonist of the series. He shares the spotlight with his best friend, Mahiro, as the only characters that can be said to be the main characters from this series. But remember there are no actual main characters in this series.  Book smart and street smart, Yoshino is cunning, astute and one of the smartest characters in this series, if not the smartest. He's able to deduce, analyze and solve everything that comes his way. His unbeknown casanova status and his inability to display emotions, no seriously he rarely does, are some aspects that irked me about him, but they didn't make me dislike him as a character nor as a person.  Charming, intellectual, and able to heuristically figure out a copious amount of mysteries, riddles, and enigmas. Yoshino Takigawa is how you should write a (quasi-)protagonist of a Shounen series.  ""𝒯𝑜 𝓁𝑜𝓈𝑒 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓌𝑜𝓂𝒶𝓃 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝓁𝑜𝓋𝑒𝒹, 𝓃𝑜𝓉 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓃 𝒷𝑒𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒶𝒷𝓁𝑒 𝓉𝑜 𝑔𝓇𝒾𝑒𝓋𝑒… 𝒾𝒻 𝓃𝑜𝓉 𝒶 𝓉𝓇𝒶𝑔𝑒𝒹𝓎, 𝓌𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝒾𝓈 𝒾𝓉?."" - Kusaribe, Hakaze (お姫様)  A fierce and strong redhead, and the Ohime-sama of the series. The princess of the Kusaribe clan. Said to be the strongest magician of all time. Of all time! Hakaze is put on a barrel and tossed into a deserted island for reasons that are subsequently unraveled later on. Her roвυѕт( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and vigorous personality are just too amazing to not comment on. She's upfront and direct about her opinions and feelings but not so much when the subject in question is love or romance. She's kind of a damsel in distress but not exactly one. She's more like a badass in distress. Since staying still and doing nothing is not her thing. Just like every female (and/or male, if I may add) character in this series.  Love hits her hard, but not in an unhealthy way and she becomes not as great as she used to be because of this, but just a little bit and she still remains a good character. Despite what some detractors may say about her, her (quasi-)tsundere antics were cute and rarely annoying. What a woman indeed. Hakaze is a shining example of how to write a female character.  ""𝒥𝓊𝓈𝓉 𝒷𝑒𝒸𝒶𝓊𝓈𝑒 𝒾𝓉'𝓈 𝒾𝓁𝓁𝑜𝑔𝒾𝒸𝒶𝓁, 𝓉𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝒹𝑜𝑒𝓈𝓃'𝓉 𝓂𝒶𝓀𝑒 𝒾𝓉 𝓌𝓇𝑜𝓃𝑔."" - Fuwa, Aika (星)  With the quote above the beautiful, gracious, and snarky star of the show managed to define the entire series in a single sentence. Aika is how you should write a female character. Strong, independent, and witty, oh so witty. She's a really mysterious character and she always manages to steal every scene she's in. There are many things to be said about her. But I don't want to ruin the story for you with spoilers.  She's a posthumous character. This series begins with a tragedy, the tragic death of Mrs. Fuwa. Whodunit? Whydunit? And Howdunit? The answers to these questions are going to blow you away. While Mahiro is my favorite, I have no shame or remorse to admit that she's easily the best character from this series. She's just too magnificent not to love/adore. And the only flaws I found about her are the same as Yoshino's, minus the casanova part, obviously. Definitely the best girl from this franchise.  ""(っ◔◡◔)っ𝐵𝑜𝑜𝒷𝓈 𝓉𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝒹𝑜𝓃'𝓉 𝓈𝒽𝒶𝓀𝑒 𝒶𝓇𝑒𝓃'𝓉 𝒷𝑜𝑜𝒷𝓈 𝒶𝓉 𝒶𝓁𝓁(っ◔◡◔)っ"" - Descartes, Junichirou (青�?)  Just wanted to post this marvelous quote for no reason at all. It was just too bloody awesome for me to forget about it. He's a nice character though, just like everyone from the supporting cast. But Megumu and Samon are also noteworthy characters, the former has the biggest development in the series, while the latter is great. Saying anything else about him would be too spoilerific so I decided to refrain from doing so. Evangeline and Matsumura are also pleasing in their own distinctive ways.  The friendship between Yoshino and Mahiro is realistic and amazing. They're fighting against the greatest threat the world has ever known, but that doesn't tarnish their friendship, not even a little bit, I mean why it should? They deal with nearly everything together as one, physically and psychologically. There's some low-level homoeroticism between them. But I can assure you that it won't bother you much, like in some sports manga that tends to overdo it, which is something that I, personally, have a strong dislike towards. They're best friends and know each other since 4th grade after all, so some occasional touching and some ambiguous lines should be expected to happen between them.  The interactions between the main cast as well as the supporting cast were a wonderful thing to sit through. Amazing dialogues and some delightful monologues. Friendship, romance, betrayals, and very realistic, believable, and human-like characters. This series lacks nothing!  The only problem is that character development takes some time to set foot in but when it does, oh boy, it sure does. The entire main cast develops. Especially the main duo, Mahiro, and Yoshino. But it takes some time, so you should expect them to be kind of static for quite some time.  TL;DR: •Aika is the best character from the franchise; •Mahiro is nearly a villain but in a good way; •Yoshino is very, very smart and cunning; •Hakaze is better on the first part of the story; •The supporting cast is beyond amazing (especially Junichirou and Megumu).   𝐀𝐫𝐭:  The art of Zetsuen no Tempest is beyond beautiful and Ren Saizaki is a fantastic artist. The characters all have unique and eye-catching designs. There are handsome lads and beautiful ladies. Every character changes clothes lots of times, and that's something worth pointing out. It's not every series that does that, especially if we're talking about a Shounen series. The drama scenes felt so raw and touching and the comedic scenes were very funny, especially with the characters adopting some chibi attributes every once in a while.  The action scenes were a spectacle. But more importantly, the fact that everyone was very charming (and almost superhumanly smart) and realistically drawn (I'm talking about body and face proportions) makes Zetsuen no Tempest a feast for the eyes of those who enjoy appreciating good-looking pieces of art. And let's face it, the Civilization Blaster is a work of art in the art department. And somehow it managed to get better and better as time went by.  TL;DR: •Awesome art and character designs; •Bishounens and Bishoujos; •Well choreographed fight scenes.   𝐄𝐧𝐣𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭/𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥:  Zetsuen no Tempest ~the Civilization Blaster~ is very often called a 'pretentious' series, and while I can't deny it, this doesn't change the fact that this is a unique and refreshing series. It has a great cast of characters with distinct personalities and amazing interactions between them. Everyone is a badass (physically and intellectually). It covers a multitude of genres (Action, Drama, Mystery, Romance, Psychological, and many others). But the main charm of this story is the dialogues, they're so captivating, enthralling, and entertaining to read. While the action scenes were fun to watch/read, the psychological battles featured in this manga are my favorite aspect of this series.  Clever, well-thought-out, engaging and I even dare to say breathtaking. Zetsuen no Tempest is a marvelous story that contains lots of tactics, planning, logical thinking, psychological warfare, and much other stuff that are far too many to list (and all great in their own ways). It intrigued me, it fascinated me, and more importantly, it entertained the hell out of me. Shakespeare would sure to be proud of two of his works coming together and becoming such a great and compelling story as this one.  Pretentious? Maybe. Magnificent? For sure. Zetsuen no Tempest sure was a blast to read (and re-read). The mysteries, the plot, the arguments, oh the arguments. Everything was beyond perfect. A must-read for fans of mystery, drama, and romance, that's for sure. And finally, I can say what I really mean: Zetsuen no Tempest is an enigmatic and perplexing masterpiece. And one of my favorite series of all time.  TL;DR: •Smart and well thought out series; •Many great elements; •Certified work of art/masterwork (but a bit pretentious).

0;Zetsuen no Tempest;LuckyKrystal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LuckyKrystal;5;"Zetsuen no Tempest is an action/supernatural/shonen anime by studio Bones, known for its previous works Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist, Star Driver, etc. Tempest starts out as a very promising shonen anime with interesting characters and an elaborate setup in a world full of turmoil. Preferring to skip the dramatic buildup, Tempest throws you right into the action and chaos right from the very first episode. Its steady pacing keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat and eager for more of the story. It’s too bad that Tempest doesn’t keep this up for the whole series. Halfway through, the show takes a serious dip in quality in just about every area, aside from maybe animation and sound.  And it’s a shame because Zetsuen no Tempest had so much potential, but it falls flat on its face instead. But let’s talk about the good of this show first. The art and animation are top notch. Studio Bones pulled no punches when it came to the gorgeous animation and character designs. The battles are fast, fluid, and intense, going hand in hand with the spectacular and vivid wheel of colors that enhance the magical effects. The character designs are stylish and unique, with no two characters looking too much alike. Another small little detail that was well done was the character’s clothing. Each character’s various clothing looks like something straight out of a teen fashion magazine; very funky and stylish. Small artistic details are also added in the character’s hair and accessories. If I were rating this anime solely based on its art and animation, it would easily score a nine at the very least. Unfortunately, I did not, and I won’t.  Now on to the not-so-good of Zetsuen no Tempest, which is basically everything else. Perhaps the weakest aspect of the show is its story. The story starts out with Hakaze Kusaribe, the princess of a clan of mages, contacting Fuwa Mahiro to help her extinguish an uprising instigated by her followers. Left stranded on an island by said followers, they can only communicate through magic. Hakaze promises to help Mahiro find his sister’s killer in exchange for his help. Mahiro’s friend, Takigawa Yoshino comes along for the ride, and together the three aim to prevent the Kusaribe clan from awakening the tree of Exodus, which would subsequently bring destruction to the entire world.  The entire story pays homage to Shakespeare’s works, namely The Tempest and Hamlet. For some reason, the story feels it needs to remind you of this quite frequently, as it seems every few minutes someone is throwing out a Shakespeare quote. There’s no subtlety in its delivery, and the quotes have little meaning to the plot or the characters. It seems they simply threw in several quotes in order to make the script seemed more grand and classy. Instead, it ended up making the entire anime sound incredibly pretentious. It could be argued that the two differing plays were being quoted to signal that this anime could either have a happy or tragic ending, leaving the viewer to wonder in anticipation. But not only is that grasping at straws, it gives the writers more credit than they probably deserve.  Now to be fair, the first half of the series was pretty good. It was standing on shaky ground but it was still quite good. It may have been standard shonen anime fare “save the world with magical powers, stop the bad guys” but it had an interesting enough twist to keep it afloat. The characters were interesting; they had clear cut motivations that at least made some sense. The plot moved about at a comfortable pace with just enough action and character development shimmied into each episode. The rules of the universe made sense. All that was completely ruined by its mess of a second half.  The plot begins to contradict the rules it established in its first half. It makes no effort to even make sense of Hakaze’s ability to time travel for a second and third time. It presents a ridiculous plot twist that makes even less sense and gives a sort of barbaric edge to Aika’s character that the other characters don’t even bat an eye at. And worst of all, romance is shoehorned in for the sake of throwing in some aspects of a corny school love comedy. Hakaze even alludes to this in a hilarious 4th wall breaking internal monologue.  Perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of the show is the degradation of its characters. Yes that’s right, the very characters that made the show go backwards as it drags on. Perhaps the character that does it the most is Hakaze Kusaribe. She is initially presented as a strong heroine, with an arrogant edge that is backed up by her standing as the most powerful mage in the clan. She is cunning and unflinching, yet kind and caring when she needs to be. But of course that is all negated when she falls in love.  Yes, LOVE! She becomes clumsy, indecisive, and silly at the first hints of love. Her initial goal was to prevent the destruction of the world and take control of her clan once again. But when she falls in love, she leaves the fate of her clan in the hands of the guy who betrayed her and sent her to an island to die. All so she could travel freely with her love interest. Later, she wants to save the world simply for her love. To say anything else about her silly love driven mindset would mean spoilers, so to be vague, pay attention to what she says when she travels across time a second time. It is so unbelievably silly, bordering on completely idiotic. She goes from a strong heroine to someone whose sole reason for existing and acting is for her love.  Maybe it wouldn’t be that bad it we had some substantial buildup to the relationship, coupled with proof of an established and long-lasting bond that could never be broken. That, and if her feelings were actually reciprocated. Then it would be quite romantic and heroic that Hakaze would do anything for her love. But instead, her actions are based on a silly schoolgirl crush (that quite literally springs out of nowhere) and nothing more, making her actions and motivations seem incredibly idiotic.  Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino are perfect foils, making for a very interesting relationship between the two heroes. They get a significant amount of development in the first half of the show through a series of flashbacks, some of which involve Aika. Brash and arrogant Mahiro is the brawn of their duo, while the manipulative and analytical Yoshino is the brains. Their relationship is one of the most interesting ones of the series. How two young men who are so different from each other could end up cooperating so willingly and becoming the best of friends is a real mystery. But their actions in the second half become a bit odd to say the least. Not only that, but they show little emotion when finding out the truth behind Aika’s death, despite the fact that they are the most important people to her. In fact, their lack of emotion is prevalent even in the first half. They are just normal high school boys, not hardened soldiers. Yet their reactions to the destruction of their home certainly don’t give any hints to that.  Then there is Fuwa Aika, one of the most confusing characters. She’s already dead by the beginning of the series, yet still plays an important role in the story. She’s the motivation for Yoshino and Mahiro’s actions and appears in numerous flashbacks. Her character is described in the anime as having a “horrible personality.” That’s not even the half of it. Her development at the tail end of the series hints at a facet of her personality that is far more barbaric, border lining on psychotic. The rest of the side characters are mostly just there for decoration. They are lively personalities to either spice things up or be used as a convenient plot device to move the story along.  Now don’t get me wrong, Zetsuen no Tempest is not wholly unwatchable. There is plenty of enjoyment to be had watching this series, especially during the first half. It’s just too bad that Bones screwed up the story and characters so hard during the second half that it irredeemably sours the entire series. The character’s motivations during the second half make little to no sense. And trying to piece together why the characters are doing what they’re doing gives way to the realization that these characters are acting like total idiots. The plot twist during the second half was also ridiculous, giving the viewer little justification for WHY things had to be this way. Not to mention the implausibility of the situation based purely on the rules set by the anime.  Zetsuen no Tempest is a great watch if you turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: Your “only very slightly above average until the second half of the show” shonen anime. Anybody looking for anything more won’t get much enjoyment out of this anime.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zetsuen no Tempest;Trotsky101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Trotsky101;6;"The first episode of this series was most impressive. To be fair, it blew me away. First the artwork - it set the tone for the anime. It wasn't cutesy or cartoonish at all (nothing wrong with that) but showed a kind of muted realism, both in the characters' drawing and the scenery. It elevated the anime in some ways. Also the almost understated tension in the first episode showed something I'd not seen before. So I was very much interested to watch on.  The premise of the whole story was also fascinating. As well as having magic, a murder mystery, and some bizarre butterflies and floating eyeball fruit, this anime, for me, was set apart from the pack.  The initial set up to the story was intriguing, and the characters had a kind of gritty realism about them. Combined with a catchy opening sequence, the series showed a hell of a lot of promise. Promise that ultimately was unfulfilled. The end left me with unrequited yearning. Allow me to explain.  If I were to sum up the series in one word it would be ""slow"". The pace of the anime was just too darned slow. From memory I could only remember a few occasions where I REALLY wanted to watch on. And although there were a few minor surprises and twists (none which you wouldn't be able to guess yourself if you're bright enough) the anime just did not seem to have the pace that it promised from the first episode. Much of the series was taken up by somewhat pointless dialogue which kind of droned on. I kept asking myself when something would happen, then the episode would end and I was left with a feeling of ""what the...?""  That's not to say there aren't some good elements to the anime. I thought the music used was very atmospheric, appropriate and really added tension to the dramatic aspects. The art was also superb, it was really something, and for the most part I enjoyed watching it for that aspect.  But having finished I couldn't shake the niggling feeling there was something essential lacking. It's hard to put one's finger on it. The artwork was great, the music fantastic, the characters original and unique... But Zetsuen no Tempest was ultimately unable to deliver.  Firstly the characters. The first half of the series was difficult to watch because there were no protagonists who the viewer could identify with or even like, except for a mage who is stuck on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere and can only communicate through a wooden doll. Mahiro is not a likeable hero, and does not seem to pretend to be one either. So we follow his angry, selfish motives for vengeance as he tries to find the killer of his sister. And on the flip side of the coin we have Yoshino, who is nebulous at best. He barely reacts to anything, and it's hard to drum up any feeling for this deadpan character. Even at the end I wasn't sure if I liked him or not. I suppose I would say I didn't really care.  The second half of the series was also somewhat disappointing. All the potential conflicts and plot lines are too conveniently tied up, and they don't really go anywhere. It was disappointing.  The constant references to Shakespeare were interesting... sort of. The characters have this thing where they start spurting random quotes form the Tempest and Hamlet. Others have said this is a strength of the anime, but personally I'm not so sure. It appears forced initially and out of place. Even I can start spouting Shakespeare if I wanted: ""When we are born we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools""... but I'm not sure why I would do it ... At the end they tie in the two Shakespearean references somewhat nicely, so I guess it wasn't all bad.  I'd give it a go if you like slow paced character driven anime. Being a fan of fantasy genres in general, I wouldn't have high hopes for that aspect of the story as the mages' ""powers"" are kind of limited and in the end don't really mean much or add anything to the plot.

2;Zetsuen no Tempest;Newnono;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Newnono;6;Story-7 --------------- While interesting throughout, I didn't quite like the way the final conflict was resolved. I just felt it was a lot of build up for something not very special.  Art-6 ------------- While studio Bones is always where to look for some of the best animation, I didn't quite like the character designs. Aika and Hakaze being the only exceptions, everyone else kinda made me felt too feminine.  Sound-7 ------------ Alright Op and Ending songs, and some very good voice acting, but still didn't really leave too much of an impression on me.

3;Zetsuen no Tempest;femto999;https://myanimelist.net/profile/femto999;6;This is I think the the only review about Zetsuen no tempest which will explain why this anime is overrated and not underrated as a lot of people are calling it. Before I start I want to say that this is only my opinion. I don't want (and I'll try not to) insult anyone else's opinion.  First of all I want to state that I love theater. I love watching theater and I love even more to act. So wen I heard that this was influenced by Shakespeare's plays ''The Tempest'' and ''Hamlet'' I was more than excited to see it. And indeed the story seemed really interesting. In fact Zetsuen no Tempest has a really unique and interesting plot full of plot twists from the start until the end. But there was a point where it lacked. ZnT could not get away from the shounen label. That way a really interesting storyline which could be made into an amazing seinen was held back by silly comedy relief as well as a really pointless second part. Especially with the latter I had a big problem because after a strong first part which had some really huge plot twists that were making you want to see the next episode instantly we went to a romance-driven second half that was a huge obstacle for the story development. The thing that I loved in this anime was certainly the art but to tell the truth this was not something unexpected. When was the last that Bones disappointed in terms of animation? Let's move to the sound section. The openings were horrible and the endings uninteresting. On the other hand the background music was really good and the voice actors do a fair job, everyone corresponding right in their roles. And now it's time for the characters of this anime. Due to the shounenish elements that I spoke before the characters themselves could not get away from the unavoidable cliches.We had the ambitious Mahiro and the genius Yoshino as the protagonists as well as the yandere Hakaze and a bunch of other cliche and unoriginal characters. I found Mahiro and Yoshino really exaggerated as characters. Especially Mahiro was annoying and unreasonable in most of the anime. Another huge disappointment was Samon's character. This guy turned from an interesting villain to ridiculous comedy relief!!! And just don't make me talk about Aika. Generally speaking almost all characters were really uninteresting. The only thing that saved them somehow was the kinda fair development the main characters had near the ending. While and before I watch this anime I was hearing people saying how underrated this anime was. That had made me put my hopes really high and I ended up really disappointed. Zetsuen no Tempest has a really interesting concept but very uninteresting story progression and characters which hold it back from being a masterpiece. But i believe that I was the only one seeing it this way. Everybody else loved it so I would recommend you to watch this anime and make your own opinion. You may like it more than I did.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zetsuen no Tempest;iremkaya;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iremkaya;6;"This show started out strong. Shakespeare quotes, beautiful art and an interesting story. But after a while, there was nothing new that Tempest offered. Whole show went around a love story, a girl and the same Shakespeare quotes. In my opinion, they blowed off a great oppurtinity to make a great anime. They turned it into a shounen love story. Although Yoshino's character was diversed and well-built; Hakaze's character was just as much cliché. Overall, I think something went wrong along the way and everything felt rushed. It could have been so much better.";Mixed Feelings
5;Zetsuen no Tempest;OneFaintingRobin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OneFaintingRobin;7;This feels like a tricky one to talk about, because my feelings on it drastically change depending on which part of 'Blast of Tempest' we're talking about. In fact, the two halves of this show feel like the beginning and ending of two similar but ultimately different shows entirely.  The first half, in all honesty, is pretty fantastic. It's got an interesting tone, a little melodramatic, with solid worldbuilding, and a really solid premise. It's something of a road trip story, with three different but complimentary protagonists, a solid antagonist, and a great mood that lets itself have levity but is also pretty dark and interesting. It all leads up to a final confrontation, at the midpoint, that perhaps takes an episode longer than it needs to be (it takes up the best part of six episodes), but even then just about gets away with it with incredibly solid character writing, and a very fun battle of wit and logic, that has plenty of fun dipping into some more philosophical places, giving a satisfying conclusion to that part of the story. Honestly, if the story had ended there, with a couple of tweaks to iron out some final plot points, I'd have had basically no notes.  The second half, in comparison, is... mixed. Not bad, definitely not bad. There's a lot that I do like. I'm generally a fan of stories drastically shifting their premise after key events (I'm a RWBY fan for a reason), and I don't think it was a bad tactic here. Unfortunately, the issue (I'd assume largely stemming from the source material) seems to lose sight of what it was actually trying to be as it goes. The first four-and-a-half episodes of the second half feel incredibly light on a lot of meaningful events, and the story feels a little meandering for a lot of this second half. Things do happen, technically, but it feels like it's been stretched out over more episodes than it really had need for. Things to pick up a little going into the last couple of episodes, there are some decent revelations that managed to feel satisfying, if not entirely surprising. But then the last couple feel a little aimless again, or, at least, a little confused.  But it's the character side where it really starts to get trickier. One character, a very self-assured and interesting person in the first half, with a huge amount of personal character details that could have been mined for drama, slips into primarily being driven by romantic feelings, a somewhat disappointing move that removes some dimension from her character. And the two protagonists, while still being at the front-and-centre of the story, somehow also manage to seem superfluous to it. The framing is definitely that they're key parts of the conflict, and certainly they don't have NO impact on it, but as the show ended, I realised that they were almost entirely unimportant to the final conflict.  But, after the dust settles, there also is a pretty satisfying set of conclusions for the characters. I certainly didn't question where anyone ended up, those places felt generally character consistent, it was absolutely fine. Which leaves me feeling very mixed about this show (MAL's new review rating system coming in handy). At points, it's fantastic, but overstretched material leaves the plot feeling very thin in places, that ultimately made it very difficult to settle into the drastic shift in premise. And, at the end, it leaves a muted impact, a ending satisfying enough, certainly not frustrating, but without giving me anything to make me think I'm going to think about this show much in the future.;Mixed Feelings
6;Zetsuen no Tempest;Darkmoq;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Darkmoq;6;Story: The beginning of the story is about a mage chick named Hakaze who gets stranded on an island. She employs the help of two friends, Mahiro and Yoshino, and communicates with them via magic, voodoo-doll walkie-talkies. Mahiro’s motive for helping is to find the person who killed his younger sister, Aika. While Yoshino, Aika’s secret boyfriend, just kinda wants to tag along. The main goal of their adventure is to stop the awakening of a terribly destructive tree god. The series is also extremely flashback-heavy and details Mahiro/Yoshino’s friendship and the secret relationship Yoshino had with Aika.  The story didn’t grab me. When it came down to it, the main bad guy was a tree and the two main protagonists spend the entire anime moping. Come on, we all know how annoying it is to be around someone who can’t get over an ex. Now multiply that by two and put them together. The series as a whole lacked action and urgency. After Episode 12 I really lost sight of what the hell everyone was trying to do. They basically took a hiatus from the plot. This was used to develop a one-sided romance, answer a few questions about people’s pasts and introduce a couple new characters that I didn’t care about. I’m sorry, but if you want to build a murder mystery into the plot that’s great but don’t put the whole plot on hold to do it. Literally billions of people are dying, cities are being destroyed, and we are getting worked up about 1 girl’s death? Some perspective please.  On the topic of Aika and the murder mystery they kind of messed that part up. First, they spent way too much time focusing on it. By about episode 14 I had heard enough about Aika and by episode 17 I was becoming progressively more nauseated with every sentimental flashback. As for the actual mystery and suspense part they built an intriguing story only to knock it down with a weird, irrational twist. I think the only part of this anime that really stood out was when we find out the ‘who/what/when/where/why/how’ about how Hazake got stranded. It was actually really well done and could have been a great springboard for Yoshino’s character. Unfortunately the story flopped on its belly after that and those few episodes were as good as it got.  I think anime can be a tool to address philosophical questions, realities of human nature, moral truths etc.. Tempest has a lot of fatalistic themes built into it which I don’t’ mind but they didn’t do it well. I finished the series feeling like there was some vague attempt at a deeper message but ultimately I was unsure of what they were trying to convey. By the end I was just irritated at the characters I was supposed to care about.  Characters: I don’t know anything about Japanese courtship but god damn those teens were passive aggressive. Sneaking around, setting up fake encounters, pretending to hate one another to throw people off. It’s like an unspoken rule that you can’t just sit down and talk about a problem you have to put it off and hide it until it explodes. I guess it made the love triangle entertaining but it also made the dilemmas difficult to relate to and the characters difficult to admire.  The way the characters reacted to emotional situations seemed abnormal and very blunted. Yoshino’s reactions and thought process remained super passive and detached. Many characters were either 1 dimensional or inconsistent. By the end of the series I didn’t know what Yoshino stood for or why. Btw, if you watch this anime, keep an eye out for the ‘video message’, I found it to be a lot more creepy than touching. Who the fuck would get turned on by that?  As a general rule, characters should behave rationally and in their own best interests or according to their ideals. If they're going take the painful or difficult path it should be because there is no easier or simpler option. That's just good writing. You create a plot hole when the audience can think of a much simpler solution to a problem the protagonists are struggling with. Needless self-sacrifice makes for cheap emotional porn. I loved LotR. It was an epic trilogy, full of amazing battles, struggles and sacrifices but why couldn’t the eagles have just dropped the ring in Mt Doom from the start? Tempest is full of shit like that cept without the epicness.  Art: Extremely good art. I need to say it. I need to mention Yoshino's character design. He is one of the most feminine looking male character I’ve seen. He has a pixie haircut and wears hairclips. I kept mistaking him for a girl. You can take that information however you want.  Sound: The intros were mediocre but the music was very good and helped create a sad and haunting atmosphere. Overall: Not wowed. The murder mystery was kind of a flop for me. The action was average at best. The story left many unanswered questions. The characters were inconsistent.  Love/Romance: They love a dead girl. There’s some stuff on the side that’s pretty awkwardly done and completely one-sided. Blood/Gore: Not too much actually. Sex/Nudity: A bit of fan service and cleavage.;Mixed Feelings
7;Zetsuen no Tempest;Fragglepuss;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fragglepuss;5;Blast of Tempest / Zetsuen no Tempest  Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans   Blast of Tempest has good ideas and decent writing, but lost my interest with the incredibly slow story progression and drawn out dialogue. Explanations of explanations and single scenes that lasted longer than an episode were a common occurrence.  You might enjoy this if: You have patience and like to have everything explained in great detail.  You might not like it if: You want a story to progress at a decent pace.  Note to the Viewer: Blast of Tempest feels like you are watching a book. It explains everything as if you are just listening to it, not watching.  EXPANDED REVIEW FROM SLC ANIME:  There were mixed reviews about the battles, some people saying there was too much conversation followed by too short of a battle. Others thought the importance of the battle was in the conversation, a “Logic Battle”, so to speak. Speaking of conversation, a common comment was regarding how slow the story progressed, a prime example being the scene of the princess trying to get transported off the island…A scene that lasted about five episodes! The series could have been tighter with less explanation. There was super explanation for every possible circumstance, which resulted in poor pacing. On top of that, there were slow pans throughout these extended scenes to make it seem like something was happening, where there was nothing but drawn out explanations. There were mixed reviews regarding the characters. Some people enjoyed the characters while others did not connect with the characters, believing many were pointless or became pointless halfway through the series.  There was a fresh take on magic in the series, with people having to use talismans to create magic, and the talismans could be used by pretty much anyone with the proper knowledge. The animation was another positive aspect of the series. The last positive comment that was mentioned by several group members was regarding how the series drew on Shakespeare in many ways. For example, throughout the series there are several mentions comparing Hamlet and The Tempest. In other words, if you are familiar with Shakespeare, there are several parts that may interest you.;Mixed Feelings
8;Zetsuen no Tempest;BlackFlameStorm;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlackFlameStorm;6;I saw 7 episodes of this anime back when it aired in 2012. After which I dosed off and dropped it for a couple of days. A guy I knew who was also following this anime sort of spoiled a major story element involving Aika which resulted in me dropping it entirely. Recently I decided to rewatch the whole thing from start.  This anime starts relatively strong and stays that way for the first half. The pacing is slow which works fine. The characters have some depth, music is great, art is great, action (although somewhat lacking) is great.  Now for the bad stuff: - The anime pukes it's guts out after the first half. - They introduce new irrelevant characters out of nowhere to act as a tool for the ending to make sense. - The existing characters rewrite their personality and start behaving in ways they shouldn't. - All references to Shakespeare are there for fanservice. If I were to give an analogy, the anime is an Italian wine bottle filled with mountain dew. - The conclusion is disappointing. There is no plot movement after the first half of the series and it could've easily been concluded 10 episodes earlier. It feels as if they pushed it to 24 episodes just to make use of the entire budget.  It is not the worst thing ever made (there is much worse out there). But I can only recommend this to those who have nothing else on their plate.;Mixed Feelings
9;Zetsuen no Tempest;animegirlism;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animegirlism;6;"It's really hard to decide where to start this story. Let's try it like this. You have a brother whose adopted sister has been killed. The boyfriend of the sister is his best friend, but he doesn't know that. Then there is a princess who is the strongest mage in the world but has been left on a lonely island by her own clan because she would stop them in some evil plan. One day, their paths cross and the story of Zetsuen no Tempest begins. Hakaze Kusaribe, the princess of all sorcerers was stuffed into a barrel and stranded on a lonely island where she can't use magic. Still she somehow manages to get in touch with a guy over a wooden doll that he wears as a necklace. That guy was Fuwa Mahiro. He agreed to help her stop the evil leader of her clan, Samon, but only under one condition. She will use her magic and find the murderer of his sister Fuwa Aika. After being away for about two months Yoshino Takigava, finaly get's to see his best friend again while visiting the grave of his dead girlfriend Aika. He was very surprised to see his friend being able to cast magic but after explaining everything to him Yoshino decides to help Mahiro in achieving his one goal. To revenge his younger sister Aika. This is how the whole story starts. An awesome battle between good and evil begins. A story full of magic, action fights, drama, mystery etc. It was epic...In the first eight episodes at least, and maybe in the last four. The part from 9-20 was just crap. It was so disappointing. I mean I expected an awesome story trough out the whole show but in the end I was just happy it was over. Now why? First of all, the thing that made me nearly quit the show was the middle of the show. Now I don't want to spoil anything, but in the part I expected the most action becomes just a dialog that lasted for four episodes if I remember. Yeah, just talk your opponent to death. That was so boring, the magic was gone, the action was gone and so did the entertainment. It was gone. Secondly, the huge amount of plot holes. I think I mentioned plot holes in a lot of reviews but it's because I really hate them. Zetsuen no Tempest is after Darker than Black and An Irregular at Magic High School the one with the most plot holes. Now, the third thing. I really have nothing against plot twists. I like them actually because of that surprise and the sudden change, but. Yeah there is a but. If the twists are bad and they just shatter all the good things of a show, well that makes me rather sad. The whole show looses its sense, the characters become boring, the plot goes nowhere and you just loose your will of continuing watching it. It's a pity because the show starts indeed very good. The idea behind the anime is intriguing and the whole plot and story was nicely imagined. Now to the things that made me watch Zetsuen no Tempest till the end. THE FLASHBACKS. Although being dead the whole time, Aika gets a huge importance in the show trough all the flashbacks. And believe me, the flashbacks are the ones that kept the show going on. Also one awesome thing, as I mentioned in the intro, the connection with Hamlet and The Tempest. The seek for revenge from Hamlet and the injustice of ""fate controlling"" from The Tempest gave the show that pinch of uniqueness. I really enjoyed trying to find connections to these works and listening to Aika's quotations. An awesome plot that looses it self a bit in the middle but finds it self in the end again.  ANIMATION AND STYLE  Now, if there is one thing that is worth talking about in this anime than animation. It is awesome. As always Bones production did a great job as most of the anime from 2012. Just watching the action scenes makes you realize how awesomely everything is done. The colors, the effects, the ""spell castin"", everything. I have a bad animation complex. I easily quit watching anime with a bad animation. Hellsing for instance, but let's talk about it some other time. But what makes the animation stand out is still the style. The characters, especially Mahiro and Yoshino, really look kinda different, but definitely in a good way. Great job and a good reason to try to forgive the midpoint catastrophe.  CONCLUSION  It is really hard to conclude an anime such as Zetsuen no Tempest. The beginning, or let's say the first ten episodes were indeed awesome, and they promised a lot. But after that the only thing left is great disappointment. It does comes back in the last few episodes but that's not it. Just think how many people quit watching. However, you can't say that it is not worth giving it a try. If you like more drama than action than, Zetsuen no Tempest would be anime for you. But of you are more an action fan than watch the first ten episodes, read what will happen in the next ten, and than finish watching the last four episodes. My rating 6,99.";Mixed Feelings
10;Zetsuen no Tempest;dantewilcox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dantewilcox;6;Sigh...This show had such potential to wow me. The first half had me going to whole way, with its play on Shakespeare's Tempest (of which I thoroughly enjoy) and its sense of mystery. In many ways, I thought it couldn't get any better. However, after the mid-season break, all of that great stuff that had been leading to something awesome and interesting, and most of all unique, just fell flat when it became a generic save the world plot that never raised the stakes.  Characters who started off as strong and intriguing became cliches and characters that had little to no charisma came to the forefront. The two main guys went from being incredible foils, representing a myriad of Shakespearean characters to becoming basic anime guys. Overall, the return after the season break just took everything awesome about the first half and just smacked it in the face.  On that note, if you enjoy Shakespeare's work and like the idea of seeing an anime inspired by it, then I would highly recommend watching the first half and stopping. Obviously the story is not entirely complete if you stop, but most of the themes brought up in the first half are wrapped up by that time. And everything that comes after has almost nothing to do with the first half.  Perhaps it was too ambitious a concept for Japanese teens, I'm not sure, but I believe the show would have been better serviced if it had been written with adult characters instead.;Mixed Feelings
11;Zetsuen no Tempest;Asiananimewatche;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asiananimewatche;6;**Spoiler Free**  Alright let's get straight to business. As a fantasy and magic anime fan Blade of tempest had been on my list for a while. The first and biggest problems are as follows (the higher up the worse ): Character Logic: If you don't look into the details you wont have a big problem with this but if you're like me and many others who think about every action made, you will want to pull your hair out. What make it worse is that the characters are ''made'' to look smart, which again they fail at, hard.  Pacing: Again if you like slower paced anime this point doesn't count, still I'd be best to read this. The anime can take entire episodes to reveal on secret/plot twist that everyone saw coming. As a fan of faster paced action anime this just hurt. Some episodes were even fully in real time where they don't move from their location.  Character backstories: This anime just fails hard at making you feel emotionally etached to the characters. It really did start off well but the further it goes the worse it gets. As weird as this sounds, none of the characters feel like the actual characters.  Positives:  Action: Despite being slow paced, the action itself isn't bad. Nothing that'll make you go wow, but it isn't bad.  Story: The story itself actually isn't bad, interesting, pretty original. Not every store has to reinvent the wheel to be good.    Personal remarks:  As someone of a higher than average IQ (not much) I just can't stand the stupidity and flawed logic. I hate a certain main character that feels like nothing but a blank piece of paper. The CG isn't great nor bad, does the job.;Mixed Feelings
12;Zetsuen no Tempest;paintpixie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/paintpixie;5;This anime wasn't really to my tastes. The animation was very nice, but that was really the only thing that I enjoyed out of it. I honestly should have probably dropped it after the first couple episodes, but I kept at it since it was recommended to me, and I'm a bit of a completionist.  I found the story quite boring. There were four episodes in the middle where nothing much really happened and it was really a drag for me. The story also undergoes a noticeable change at the midway point, where it felt like I was watching a high school romance or something, and that sort of thing just isn't for me.  I thought the constant quoting of Shakespeare was a bit campy. I didn't care for it. To be honest, I just really wasn't feeling it. I think this anime is well-made, I just don't think it was for me.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zetsuen no Tempest;AngelsArcanum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AngelsArcanum;3;"There's this common expression: ""all bark and no bite."" Blast of Tempest is a dog that barks Shakespeare quotes aimlessly, holding little weight and consequence out of the context of its wholesome product. It's like how there's so much Zelda paraphernalia that gradually obfuscates from the point of what the iconic series was in the first place - a large game franchise with a grand mythos of diverse interconnecting core stories and subplots. Blast of Tempest puts up a facade of intelligence and substance by spouting Shakespeare when there's hardly any actual story content to speak of it. Well then, I'll move on to the core of the review that I have something to talk about, unlike this very series itself.  Story: Okay, let's start this on a positive note before I start slamming this series for its lack-of-""Story""; the initial episodes have promise at least. We have the Romeo expy Yoshino standing at his girlfriend's grave when a mysterious woman by the name of Evangeline appears asking about the whereabouts of his old friend Mahiro, the Hamlet expy. Mahiro encounters Evangeline and things get hectic. It turns out Mahiro has connections to this missing woman named Hakaze who is a mage trapped on some far off island and she wants to stop her brother Samon from reviving a magical tree that threatens the planet. Mahiro fends off Evangeline with the various magical talismans Hakaze left across the area. Meanwhile giant seeds of the Tree of Exodus Samon is trying to revive are sprouting over the city and petrifying anyone who isn't protected by a talisman. Evangeline suspects it's Hakaze's doing because Mahiro is seen actively using Hakaze's magic himself. Mahiro communicates with Hakaze via this magic idol, and Mahiro is assisting Hakaze on the condition that she finds his sister's murderer, and unbeknownst to Mahiro, his dead sister was Yoshino's girlfriend in secret. Some of Samon's assistants are thrown into the conflict to ensure things go smoothly with Exodus' resurrection, and Yoshino teams up with Mahiro to get him out of the bind and to also find out who killed his lover Aika. The first 3 episodes have lots of action and intrigue, with various sides clashing, a catastrophic plan unfolding and a decent dose of angst...but then it doesn't know where to go from there, almost literally I might add. Mahiro and Yoshino travel around every 2 episodes or so, but since nothing's going on in the present, they just settle in one spot shortly after and show flashbacks of Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika and then one boring fight scene in an aquarium and Yoshino being captured for a short period thrown to mix it up a bit. Once episode 8 comes, things get even thinner; we have not one, not two, but FOUR episodes of a long winded sophistry battle between Yoshino, Mahiro and Samon trying to prove Hakaze still being alive (which was earlier suspected to be all a weird contradiction) involving duplicates, time rifts and other stuff, and the arguments go back and forth with neither party having much evidence or going to much length to argue their stance while the government tries to attack the Tree of Exodus. When the half point hits, the world is stricken by calamity, but there's no driving conflict or urgency in the second cour, so the characters--which, mind you, all villains reconcile with the allies at this point--just meander around and occasionally blow up a tree or two every now and then, because again, nothing is going on. After blowing up enough trees (yeah, take that environment!), the plot starts to head towards some semblance of a conclusion, but not before we find out who Aika's killer is, which happens to be one of the most ludicrous and groan-worthy twists I've ever seen, and it's all uncovered thanks to the magic of a crappy time travel element to put the crap icing on the garbage cake. The remaining events unfold without many bumps in the road, wrapping up in a totally run of the mill happy ending just to nip it in the bud. That's pretty much it. The story is about as thin as a nickel and is littered with many problems, but it has the occasional saving grace like the first 3 episodes, the conflict with society and the media on blowing up the trees fearing worse than the already poor conditions, and a delightfully liberating and refreshing scene where the one sane and logical side character beats the crap out of our far gone angst-ridden protagonists. That's all more than enough to save it from being one of the worst things ever, but it is still a big waste of time. I love Shirodaira's most prolific work, Spiral, so I had some expectations going in, and suffice to say I was massively disappointed, such a shame.  3/10  Characters: Oh goody, the characters. I'll be fair and say that for the most part they started off tolerable in the first cour before the even more dreadful second, but there's still nothing exemplary from most of them, and the second cour does some hefty damage to them. Yoshino is the lovelorn Romeo character who goes from being more proactive and level headed to whiney and self-loathing, Mahiro is the cynical and sharp-tongued Hamlet who goes from a driven avenger to an egotistical bully and Aika is the sadistic princess who played around with both of them. Hakaze turns from a confident and spunky lass to a nagging waifu trying to pine for Yoshino. Evangeline is something of an aggressive Misato-esque warrior woman who stays fairly consistent but is less prominent in the latter half while her assistant Takumi is pretty much just along for the ride. Hakaze's big bro Samon gets some of the worst of it, turning from a stern and headstrong antagonist to...comic relief with a straight face. His right hand brawn, Natsumura, is a ruthless stoic, but he doesn't have much of a hand in the second half, but Tetsuma the brains and voice for Samon has it worse, becoming nothing more than a cab driver for everyone else. Now, the one who is straight up the worst character of the lot the entire time...Junichiro. The lawful neutral who fulfills only that much, just wandering around being neutral; if he ever gets involved, he beats up members of both parties, of which, the fights are omitted to be left to the imagination, making it more dreadful than it already is. He is an absolutely pointless character, and the only time he ever did something with some effect to it is when he tried to share certain plot details which obfuscate details and make things more mysterious. Thankfully though, I'll close things off with the one character who DOES stand out as a good character - better than the series does justice to, which is Hanemura. He starts out as a bit of a spineless but sincere and rational guy who learns to fight under Mahiro's tutelage and gradually becoming more outspoken and vigorous after going through all the physical duress of Mahiro's training and emotional turmoil of all the other characters angsting and complaining around him, leading to the powerful scene of him kicking Mahiro and Yoshino's asses when things get out of hand. He's a stand up guy and he sets things straight when the plot is wrought with too much self-indulgence, anguish and melodrama, making him a refreshing change, ironically he is introduced in the second cour when all else goes to crap, so that in itself is a plus. At the end of the day, Hanemura breaks the series out of its conceited shell, but when leveled with the general character decay and initial merely decent characterization plus Junichirou, I can't give the roster a pass.  4/10  Art/Animation: Blast of Tempest being animated by Bones is a good sign. The very same company known for works such as both Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, Wolf's Rain, RahXephon and many more nice looking series, and Blast of Tempest upholds some degree of that quality in its appearance. The characters are almost never off model, everything is smoothly rendered, clean and sharp looking and can pull off some more dynamic action scenes well, but those scenes are rather few and far between, and there's still much better out there, so it isn't THAT remarkable. The artwork looks really nice too thankfully, capturing the look of the manga well, with the designs being very sharp to begin with so the series looks cool at the very least.  7/10  Sound: The score is a rather enticing collection of melancholic orchestral pieces with bits of whimsy, mystery, grandiose and tragedy to them. There also happens to be select Beethoven pieces bundled in, so you know there's quality classical pieces to be had in this series, so that music happens to be the strongest department for this anime. The voice work on the other hand, is about average; characters come off as one note a lot of the time and lack a bit of enthusiasm at times, but the voices fit the characters well and performances are still consistent and serviceable.  8/10  Enjoyment: For me, enjoyment tends to run concurrent with story, and even if an anime may come off as ""boring"" in terms of tone and atmosphere to some, if there is some weighty metatheming or elaborate writing and intrigue permeating over the course of things, I won't get bored personally. However, as my story section dictates, there was hardly anything worthwhile for me to chew on. If Blast of Tempest were a steak, it would be a bland, dry and tough to chew on one. I was bored watching it most of the time because things always meandered and there wasn't much intellectual meat to it, and a lot of it was far below average. Blast of Tempest was just a really stale journey.  3/10  In closing, Blast of Tempest is one of those series that falls into-nay, EPITOMIZES the cliche of a lot of anime out there: interesting concept, poor execution (in this case, hardly any). It's one of the most sloggish and inflated series I've ever seen that clings to its premise like a pure catholic teen clings to his/her chastity. The series had a cool idea that was rather intriguing, but it didn't know how to expand on it, so they just run around haphazardly with it and start randomly expounding Shakespeare references to try and uphold the air of assured direction when they haven't a clue what they are doing. ""Okay, so I've hooked them with the premise and I gotta make a series with this, but I have no idea what to do next...GOT IT! I'll have the characters quote Shakespeare because HE'S intelligent, so that will make them think THIS SERIES is still intelligent! Perfect!"" Blast of Tempest is a stretched out, pretentious (I try to use this word sparingly) and unexciting odyssey (if you can even call it that) and it is not worth your time. Don't be fooled by the Shakespeare references, this series is hardly smart at all, don't waste your time on it. Do yourself a favour and just read Spiral by the same author, it's a mystery that's worth it, Shirodaira just dropped the ball here.";Not Recommended
1;Zetsuen no Tempest;BigOnAnime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BigOnAnime;1;"Trees destroying the world. Now this is interesting, not.  Blast of Tempest is a show where nothing matters, absolutely nothing. It's simply pretentious BULLSHIT!  It's got all powerful magic trees that pop out of nowhere, uninteresting and hardly developed characters, quotes from Hamlet for no reason, people just standing there for FIVE EPISODES debating about nonsense (Where the villain even helps his enemy, and later the villain and his enemies for NO REASON all of a sudden become friends), absolutely atrocious pacing that goes from way too fast to way too slow, and more things.  I can't even begin to really describe the story because of how much of a mess it is (It's almost as messy as BONES' last awful work, Eureka Seven AO), which is the result of the pacing being ridiculously fast in the beginning, and there being absolutely NO COHESION. The events don't flow well together whatsoever. It starts out with something about Mahiro's sister being murdered, a half-naked mage being left on an island to die, and other stuff that later does not matter much.  It then rushes through everything, and does not even spend time to have you get to know the characters well (And no, the backstory does not count because that backstory did not prove to be relevant enough to the ""plot""), or have you get to know the setting. How am I supposed to care about anything in this show if they don't even bother to take the time to build up their characters and setting? You can not even really tell what the hell is going on because of how it jumps from event to event in an atrocious way, with there being no cohesion as I've stated earlier. This is really something that shouldn't be that hard to mess up. One of the most important things in a show is pacing, and placing of events. You need to have a story flow well so the viewer knows what is going on, and is getting a good deal of storytelling.  So come around halfway through the first half of the show, we then have humanity trying to stop a magical tree from destroying the world. All of a sudden the two groups that are fighting each other then engage in a pretentious debate about time travel, the murder, and other crap for no reason. It seems like this stuff matters, but in the end it doesn't because after FIVE EPISODES of this crap with them just standing there, debating, another tree pops up, and saves the world, so their debate DIDN'T EVEN MATTER! Yeah, let's debate and let a tree interrupt our pointless conversation. Oh and apparently that magic tree ends up dictating everything humanity does, stops crime and other stuff, but we never learn one bit about how that's supposed to work.  After that, the show goes under a genre shift, from some ""serious"" adventure where people are trying to save the world to just your ordinary school setting (Minus the school), and them trying to find some wimpy guy known as the Mage of Exodus, which they later find, but have no clue if he is it when it's clearly obvious he is. Let's not forget how this show wasted time AGAIN with one of the most stupid things I've ever come across in anime. Two full episodes are spent on the character's going ""Who's his girlfriend?!!!"" when they should have known ALL ALONG! This just goes to show this show doesn't use its time wisely.  In the end, this show is a total failure that trolls its viewers, and the only thing is has going for it are the visuals (And just because a show has pretty visuals DOES NOT mean it's good, what really matters in the end are the story and characters, something this show doesn't have), and the soundtrack. Those that appreciate good characters, story, and shows that actually take the time to make you care about those things (Ex: One Piece, Nodame Cantabile, Eureka Seven, Neon Genesis Evangelion), avoid this at all costs. It is not worth the time.";Not Recommended
2;Zetsuen no Tempest;loos;https://myanimelist.net/profile/loos;4;"STORY: In most anime's it takes a few episodes to get into it, but Zetsuen no Tempest is actually pretty easy to follow. In the first few episode I was really curious to know who killed Mahiro's sister. I think that is the ONLY mystery of the whole serie. That was the only reason why I kept watching. The serie adds unrealistic aspects to the story (flying fruits, revival ceremony etc.). It's just 2 trees that are in war with eachother. The way the story is put together is not strong and not plausible. Therefore when I found out who killed Aika, I lost interest. The killer suposed to be the big twistplot, but it even made it more lame. Adding quotes of Shakespeare could be interesting but in this case it was getting more and more annoying.  I did like how they potray Hakaze as a typical girl who is in love, and Mahiro as the typical guy who seeks revenge.  OVERALL: The summary made me curious, but it really was unrealistic. It reminds me of ""Mawaru Penguindrum"" where 2 guys fight for the sake of a girl and has a random element in it. In this case the treemagic. It's not worth the watch if you're looking for a good story.";Not Recommended
3;Zetsuen no Tempest;Artsick;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Artsick;4;"THERE IS SPOILERS.  Coming into this anime with somewhat heavy expectations I was a little disappointed by what the show had to offer. The show starts outs with an interesting premise, you see these huge stones with chains around them and an eyeball in the middle floating around turning people into iron sculptures. Followed up by easy to follow explanations of what's going on, things progress smoothly until you get more into the battle scenes where you start getting an idea of the type of protagonists you're watching are. Now you're halfway into the show, plot twist after plot twist the show begins to contradict itself, then reset, you're back to point A. With some slow progression you get more plot twists and contradictions. By the end of the show if you aren't lost on what's going on, you've still lost interest in the show. But I can't not give props were props are due, the ending was at least satisfying enough to let me peacefully move onto another anime without scratching my head too much.  The biggest problem is it's tryhard characters. Junichirou is the powerful but neutral veteran, his confident and carefree attitude makes him come on as trying too hard, he gets even more cringe when he brings his love for big breasts into the equation. Mahiro is portrayed as the badass ""i don't give a f**k"" character who everyone should fear for no obvious reason despite being the most useless of them all in terms of capability to do something. Natsumura and Evangeline are the old couple who try to stay relevant by following the main characters around sometimes throwing the most obvious statements in order to move things along. Tetsuma becomes the uber driver of the series. Aika is the center of everything and also the most pretentious thing in the show, spouting nonstop Shakespeare quotes and in the end when Hakase meets her, she has no will of her own and it seems like she WANTS to die. And Hakase, yeah she's the maiden in love, you gotta have that in there right, at least in contrast to Aika whom everyone seems to put in a pedestal she’s more realistic, acknowledging the possibility she may be the the one who kills Aika out of jealousy. Samon is the only character I actually thought contributed something, he was comedic and also most of the times the most logical character, from the very begging he seemed to know what he was doing, you were able to see his sincerity and thought process behind every move.  The dialogue was poorly wrtten, I cringed at nearly everything that was said. That includes the pretentious Shakespeare quotes, yeah I hate to agree with the general consensus about it but it's true, there's a lot unnecessary quotes thrown around. I'm not going to quote every single bad script cause that would just be me trying to nitpick, but an example of the worst one was when Hanemura is sparring with Mahiro, gets angry and calls Mahiro a siscon. The three spectators overreact by saying ""The one thing everyone wanted to say."" or ""The forbidden words."" Like if Mahiro is even somewhat threatening, he doesn't even use magic or nor does he have any combat experience compared to any of the people spectating. So what reasons do they have to be afraid of him.  I don't have many complaints for the story, I was too adrift in it's questionable characters to care for any plot holes or plot devices. I will say the mystery doesn't disappoint. The story throws plot twist after plot twist repeatedly engrossing you into the mystery, this causes some plot holes along the way, but I was already showing enough disinterest in the show to really bothering paying any mind to it. In the end the show basically ends in the same place it started. Everyone who was alive, lived and the dead stayed dead. There is no more magic, but that doesn't stop the clan from having any influence. Mahiro and Yoshino stay the great buddies they've always been. Everyone lives happily ever after.  Soundtrack is forgettable and that’s just being kind. The only noteworthy feature in it's aesthetics was that it at least tried to add something into it's fashion choices, especially with Mahiro and Yoshino’s clothing details.  OVERVIEW: I disliked the show. It’s characters were walking cliches, the story loses you in it’s disoriented pacing. There is very little to distinguish it’s artstyle or soundtrack from other anime shows.  If you wanna try changing my mind or adding on/giving some pointers, I plead that you do.";Not Recommended
4;Zetsuen no Tempest;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;4;"PROPER MINDSET The story is about two uninteresting (ordinary) high school students becoming mages by a half naked witch and try to avenge the killers of a girl they liked before evil mages rewrite reality. And yes, it’s as cheesy as it sounds, a typical revenge story with some hocus pocus. The presentation of course will constantly attempt to make it appear like it’s the most awesome thing ever by throwing in complicating terminology, pretentious pseudo-intelligent dialogues, and weird visuals.  PRODUCTION VALUES But of course! The show is animated by studio Bones, which automatically means very good production values, a complicating / intriguing story, and a script written on the run without the slightest attempt to make sense or have consistency. This time in particular Bones outdid itself for messing up everything from the very first episode. Not even Eureka Seven Ao turned to shit so fast.  SCRIPT The first thing that easily proves what a mess this show is, lies in the very pacing. Let’s look at what happens in the first episode, shall we?  The plot begins with the hero returning home and meeting his SWITCH a half naked girl is thrown at an island where she can’t cast magic through SWITCH the hero is bullied at school and his girlfriend tells him to SWITCH they are on the grave of their family where they say someone SWITCH a sexy agent is after the protagonist until he SWITCH a mysterious disease turns people to statues and the heroes go to SWITCH and then a huge cocoon hatches and the world is about to end.  Oh, wow, best teaser of a half season series I have seen in awhile. Let’s see if the actual show is as good… What??? This was not a teaser but the pilot episode??? Jesus, why is the plot all over the place? They barely show something before they switch to something else. And don’t give me this whole “it is not wasting time in needless events” excuse. If you don’t invest time to the setting and the characters, then how do you expect the viewers to care?  Ok, maybe they just rushed the beginning so we can get straight to the point. Maybe the rest of the episodes will have good pacing and worthy plot… NOT! Bones sucks monkey balls, remember? The pacing in the rest of the episodes is EXTREMELY slow, with a lot of useless dialogues and pointless action scenes. The prize easily goes at one point where the characters are doing nothing but TALKING FOR 5 EPISODES WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING ELSE! I mean, really, all they had to do is press a simple trigger that would save the world and instead of that, they began talking non-stop. And do you think the whole thing ended when they finally reached to a conclusion? Hell no, a magic tree appears out of nowhere and saves the world regardless of what any character wanted. TOTAL BULLSHIT!  The above example is also proof of a major flaw the script has. IT IS FATALISTIC. Nothing the characters do seems to matter if all the action scenes and the dialogues are irrelevant to the progress of the plot. And the plot is literally controlled by a bunch of magic trees that appear anytime they feel like it and regardless of what the characters do. There is a scene where thousands of people are fighting each other with magic, and tanks, and missiles, and everything becomes a huge battlefield. The outcome was irrelevant to what they did; a magic tree appeared on its own and it just trashed everything. People are simply decorations when it comes to the plot! It should be the other away around, with the trees being a pretty background.  Not even its internal logic makes any sense. Despite its numerous attempts to make sense of magic, offer limitations and balance, and to present a worldview that can logically stand on its own feet, down to it, it is all about magic and teleportation! Anything can happen just because the scriptwriter thought it would be cool. So despite wasting half the show in talking and explanations, NOTHING MAKES SENSE much less being serious in its themes.  Exposition is boring as heck. They are talking for whole episodes about how magic works in this world, as if it’s complicating and hard to understand. In practice you just wear magic jewellery and gain superpowers without any training; anything further that that is unnecessary complication. It is ridiculous how much time they spent on explaining something so unimportant with such detail.  And even after all the explaining, the logic of this goddamn show is still contradicted in the second half. They say for example that you need to use something man-made in order to cast magic. Later on, that is no longer necessary for later mages that are introduced. They spend a lot of time showing the rivalry between the mages, the rebel mages, and the army. Countless people died because of their actions. In the second half and out of screen, they are now best friends, as if all the disastrous things they did to each other in the first half weren’t even important! The series literally turns from a dark action/survival/drama into a fluffy school comedy!  As if that wasn’t enough of a mess, the creators keep trying to fool you into believing this shit of a show is gritty and serious. The most glaring example is how the characters constantly quote Shakespearean works. Is this supposed to add depth to the plot? It adds nothing, makes the show pretentious, and the characters only manage to talk in a completely artificial way. It’s like they decorate an empty box with a hundred fancy ribbons.  Furthermore, if you REALLY think about it, the main two dudes would have no reason to do anything in this show, if any of the villains had told them the truth right away. Yet instead of just saying “Well, heh, you know, the witch can’t really help you and your plan will fail no matter what you do” they just chase them around and fight for no reason. Even when they get ready to achieve their goals by pressing a SIMPLE TRIGGER they instead start talking for 5 EPISODES while the world around them is being destroyed. And eventually what happens? Nature does what they should have done 5 EPISODES AGO, thus rendering their whole mission pointless yet again. The whole plot is one big troll.  CAST Even when the show tries to flesh out the characters with numerous flashbacks, it still fails to make them interesting. They are blunt and simplistic, they have no control over the events, their goals are petty, and to the most part they are just walking around and talk. And they also don’t seem to give a damn; everything is in ruins and all their loved ones are dead, yet they act like nothing much happened. How can you feel any sympathy for these uncaring assholes? Occasionally they fight but even that is boring as hell and could very easily be avoided altogether. Here is the roster to know what you get.  We have the Pussy Boy, someone who is following the Bad Boy for not much of a reason. He loved his sister and they are buddies but other than that he can’t do anything right SO WHY DOES HE TAG ALONG? - At one point he is fighting Slutty Spy for a whole episode. He defeats her all the time and instead of talking with her or finishing her off, HE RUNS AWAY! As a result she keeps attacking him with more and more powerful weapons, until he gets fed up to kick her around and asks for a truce… And gets it. Damn, a whole episode was wasted on these useless spars before they form a truce that could have been achieved right away. Lame excuses for wasting episodes. - He then starts arguing with Bad Boy for some misunderstanding that lasts for 5 WHOLE EPISODES the result of which is zero since that tree they were trying to destroy gets destroyed by some superpower from the planet itself.  Then we have Bad Boy, who leans magic in order to avenge his family and NOT to save the world; great motivation there fellow. - He fights a much stronger opponent and the whole episode is wasted on spars with no tactics or even a resolution. And the lolz part is how the enemy could teleport anywhere he likes, yet the injured hero outruns him and escapes by running in plain sight. DERP! - He then creates a super weapon that can destroy the bad guys’ magic tree and he is willing to use it right away, but then just talks for 5 EPISODES while pointing the gun. Planet Namek blowing up was at least thrilling. This was shit.  We also have Naked Witch, who doesn’t do anything besides sitting all day long on an island and stuffing items between her boobs. She is there only as an excuse for infodumping and fan service. She constantly tries to offer a logical explanation to everything that is going on in the series. Too bad it’s about MAGIC and after awhile it’s just random crap where logic has no place being there. - She later falls in love with Pussy Boy for no bloody reason at all and completely turns from a dynamic super woman in command of a huge clan of mages into a 10 year old girl who can’t even express her feelings for him and acts like a complete klutz. Deep … character … development! Or perhaps plain misogyny?  Slutty Bitch, the girl they are trying to avenge. We get to know nothing about her besides being constantly naked, talking about sex, and seducing boys for fun. And she is as good as dead, we only learn about her in flashbacks which fail to make her any more interesting. And apparently, this slut is far more important to be avenged instead of saving the world. - Later on she is revealed to be alive all along and the whole thing was actually a prank to make the world be destroyed for the lulz. But by then nobody cares anymore and she is just a troll that is dealt with in 2 episodes.  Evil Boss, who plans to save the world… by destroying it. Okey… He is constantly trying to pass as mature, wise, and always prepared, plus he is supposed to be a master swordsman. Yet as soon as he meets the main characters, he totally flips and acts like a complete loser who cries, panics, crawls on four, and just bangs the sheath of his sword on the ground instead of pulling out the sword and fighting them. LOSER! - In the second half he turns into a comic relief who has no real goal or dignity anymore. All his cool image gets completely ruined and becomes yet another lame idiot.  Gay Blondie, a boy with super martial arts. He can beat anyone is a fraction of a second, yet instead of joining the other two main heroes, he stays home and talks to himself without offering anything to the plot. I mean, seriously, he could beat the evil boss in less than a second, thus saving the world. He has nothing important to do in his home, and the world is about to be destroyed, and all he does is TALKING TO THIN AIR! Obviously done as an excuse for more infodump, but it could have easily been avoided if he had internal monologues and a good excuse to stay behind. In the meantime, the world is about to be destroyed and he is doing nothing to prevent that. - Oh wait, later on eventually joins the battle against the bad guys! The problem is, instead of going to beat the evil boss and destroy the tree, he only fights his underling. Why? Because there was Slutty Spy with her huge boobs near by and he wanted to show off so he can fuck her! What a responsible and mature guy!  Slutty Spy, a completely worthless woman who walks around half-naked and gets herself beaten by men with ten times her strength. I mean, seriously, she clearly has no fighting skills and constantly challenges males who are clearly more powerful. TOTAL BIMBO! And more misogyny.  Fail Idiot, a guy who acts like he can’t even walk without tripping and who can use magic without a material component JUST BECAUSE. He pretends to be a brave superhero that protects the world, as if he couldn’t be bipolar enough as he was. He is just a Power Ranger parody and completely useless to the plot.  So just imagine how less interesting is everybody else in this show. - We see thousands of people tuning to statues. Should we feel anything about them when the series only bothers to show them for three seconds and then forgets them? - There is a scene where the army destroys the exits to the town so nobody can come in or out, plus they hide the fact from the rest of the world. It is supposed to prove the army exists and cares to intervene, plus a lot of world shaking events are kept hidden from the public. That sounds so serious, right? Well, in practice all you see is a few helicopters throwing missiles without a single soldier inside or around them, and then some woman talking and saying “we will hide that from the world”. Great presentation you guys; we really see the grave importance of all these events… NOT! Where are the military officers talking about it? Where is the media cover up? Where is anything else in general besides the main two characters? THEY SHOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! You can somewhat excuse it by saying the plot is presented only through their eyes, and many events are revealed only through dialogues. That still doesn’t save said events from being impersonal, distant, and eventually makes you feel or think absolutely nothing about the show. - Later on, the army tries to save the day by attacking the evil tree and again it fails to achieve anything because another magic tree does all the work for them… And also kills them despite the fact they were its allies. How nice; all the struggles and the battles ARE RENDERED USELESS! The moral of the story is “Do nothing and let the world be magically saved by hax powers. If you try to help, YOU WILL DIE BY THE VERY PLANET YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE!” - This show also has the privilege of taking phallocracy to new heights. Remember how women in shonen shows are completely useless? Well, this anime goes further by killing all the main heroines right away and leaving them there only as annoying memories and sidekicks. LAME! * Of course, BONES’ complete incompetence couldn’t bother to deal with such issues; they were too busy explaining how magic works for half the show to deal with character motivations. Are they really trying to save the world or just have a stroll, talk, and go to save some chick by a villain? It’s presented in such a boring way you just have nothing to care for.  LEGACY A total fail of a story that may have some interest as themes but is otherwise shit in terms of plot and cast. The production values are ok but who cares if nothing is important? Only BONES knows. Easily the second most badly handled anime of the year, right after Eureka 7 AO. Which to nobody’s surprise, is also made by BONES.  And now for some excused scorings.

5;Zetsuen no Tempest;MongoDB;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MongoDB;6;Really disappointing ending. Finishing this show will leave you with a feeling of 'That's it?'.  All this tension and build up over so many episodes just to be shrugged off and thrown in the trash in the last few episodes. A total shift in genre and story that feels so out of place and unwanted.  I leave a 6 for the interesting moments it had. But like many works of art, the ending falls flat and leaves a feeling of longing, an expectation for something much better, something to fill the missing gap that the show leaves.  A dozen of episodes of teasing for big things and when they are revealed, the 'twists' and climax end up leaving you speechless and shocked, not out of awe, but at how simple, nonsensical, and uninteresting they are.  Somewhere along the story the author clearly lost motivation to finish writing an enthralling story. And they just tossed in the most basic and meaningless conclusions and answers, completely disrespectful of the audience's intelligence.;Not Recommended
0;Zetsubou no Kaibutsu;loreeellaii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/loreeellaii;6;Look, I quite enjoyed it, but if you're somebody who can't watch something with obvious production problems, don't watch it.  My opinion here is that this anime film would be awesome either as a short series or a longer movie -- 30 minutes isn't enough to really flesh it out and hit those sad beats in time. And that's a good thing -- that means your story is very well-written, and it is.  The story seems like it could've been based on a short story somewhere, it's almost Edgar-Allen Poe meets aliens. It's a tragedy, through and through. I wouldn't be surprised if the director was the main person who carefully constructed this narrative, but they obviously have talent. The pacing wasn't horrible, but like I said, if it was longer, I feel it would've been better.  On the other hand, making the film longer would require more production, and it feels as though they were hurting for money. Valid issue.  Yeah, there's not much to say other than that. The story's great, but if you can't watch something unless it's super high-quality, don't waste your time.;Recommended
0;Zetsubou no Kaibutsu;delta5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/delta5;6;This is an incredibly sad short film about the impossibility of belonging in a society that will never accept your existence as you truly are. It's frequently described as a horror anime, but if you're looking for scares or gore this short film won't offer any of that. It will, however, probably make you pause for a bit and consider what you just experienced.  I really appreciated that the whole creative team behind this story committed to a very specific vision, one that isn't likely to appeal to a broad audience. The music is simple but evocative, and it complements the melancholy story quite well. I'm glad I took a chance on this.  I will, however, say that the animation is woefully subpar on every level. Please don't let that dissuade you from giving the movie a chance. I would, however, say that I would have increased my score if it didn't look so cheaply done. That being said, I hope that the people who worked on this get much better funding in the future. They deserve it.;Mixed Feelings

Firstly, I really loved the song it’s an MV for. The characters designs were really nice, especially the main girls ‘magical girl’ forms and the ways the infinity symbol were incorporated into her outfits and hair was really cool and clever! The artstyle and animation were stunningly fluid, and I really enjoyed the fire effects. The story suffered a little from it being a dialogue free music video, but that’s to be expected. I could still tell what was going on, and it’s a story with the potential to be really powerful if fleshed out into a full series.;Recommended
0;Zetsuai 1989;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;8;8 in rating. seen via english sub.  To be honest the cover art and yaoi genre through me for a loop. Both i did not expect to be what i ended up seeing. The emotions and drama that went into this movie caused my emotions to stir. The passion, the strength of will really could connect to the viewer. Sure at first the story portrays a kind of screw you (hate you) kind of moment. However, had it not have been would the same ending have been reached? The cover art is there to show the stone cold emotion/emotionless feeling. The genre is there because both main characters are both strong roles. I am not saying a woman can not be as strong. Women can even be stronger but they are known for there emotions not there muscles. Hard truth but it is the truth.  Along time ago i heard from an unknown source fight fire with fire. How can you do that if your love has been involved in a murder? making matters worse your parents are both the murder and victim. How can one recover from that? This writer found a way that i thought there would be none. The murder weapon needed to be in the hands of the innocent but how? How was the question.;Recommended
1;Zetsuai 1989;Akira_999;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Akira_999;10;"I will defend this yaoi till the day I die. The art style may put a lot of people off. Yes, the art is wacky with their long limbs and fingers that resemble the art of CLAMP. Nearly almost all characters in BL series from the '70s-'90s were hilariously drawn that way. There's nothing wrong with liking feminine-looking boys (if you're under the age of 18 ofc) and men. Get over yourself if you perceive all men should fit your standards of being extra masculine. Go watch some Bara or other yaoi if you see that the image cover isn't right for you. And yes, although I do understand pretty gay men is considered a negative stereotype; I appreciate old yaoi because I can look at modern shounen-ai and other yaoi and see how far they've improved in the animation. I can also compare and contrasts the diversity of gay men drawn in manga and comics as well which brings pure happiness to my little gay heart.  The music from this OVA is wonderful, I still listen to the extra soundtrack to this day. I guess because I am nostalgic for an era that I've never witnessed. If you like cheesy 80's music like me then I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. I was in the closet when I watched this as a teenager and this anime helped me cope with being closeted. Especially when Nanjo who was mostly a player with the ladies suddenly realizes the girl he's been searching for all along is a boy his age. The boy, however, resents Nanjo and rightfully so because he's not sure why Nanjo looks at him that way and why he won't leave his life.  It's a cliche storyline. Rocker pretty boy falls in love with an athletic pretty boy, but athletic pretty boy doesn't reciprocate those feelings back until one day their life turns around and everything changes. You know that sort of cheesy thing. As a young cold-hearted homosexual, this anime definitely pulled several heartstrings. Therefore this anime will always have a special place in my heart and was one of the reasons why I decided to come out.";Recommended
0;Zetsuai 1989;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;4;"The decision to start Zetsuai was a random one for me. I am not the world’s biggest yaoi fangirl, not that I am somehow morally against or disgusted by the subject matter, but I always attempt to try new things. I really did try to go into this with an open mind but sadly this turned out to be exactly the kind of tripe I was originally expecting. As an anime in general this may be the worst drawn and most poorly designed show I have ever seen.  The story starts out with a flashback of our hunky lead reminiscing about a football hunk from his childhood. Excuse me will I clean my keyboard after spilling my tea laughing at that statement. I lied; there is nothing hunky about our girly man leads. Back on point, the lead Koji Nanjo is a super famous and popular musician who insists he isn’t gay, despite having these thoughts about this footballer. Coincidently the now grown footballer, Takuto Izumi picks up the passed out and drunken Koji from a rainy alley and nurses him back to health. I’m sure this kind of thing happens all the time. Straight man picks up a drunkard from an alley and takes him home then sleeps lovingly with him on the same bed. What a nice man.  Actually this illness, and let’s call it what it is; IT’S A COLD! It’s not life threatening! For the most part healthy young men do not drop dead after getting wet and developing a small fever and the sniffles. However this is a recurring theme in this anime. I would guess that at least 60% of the story takes place in a hospital or in someone’s sickbed. I know, I know, I am sure this is supposed to drive home some kind of splendid drama or titillate me with the promise of healing buttsecks.  All this being said there is some decent drama beneath all the sickness and gay-angst. Sorta. Kinda. Koji moves from a man who claims he isn’t gay to a flaming symbol of gay pride in the span of 10 minutes. Most puzzling we are supposed to believe that it was the look in Izumi's eyes that so captivated him when he was younger. Towards the end though the drama is fairly interesting as Koji tries to get his feelings across to the emotionally damaged Izumi. The story doesn’t really end satisfactorily but it isn’t horrible. It doesn't change the fact though that Koji is an obsessive psycho and there is nothing to make you think either one of them have any real feelings for each other besides what they say. Additionally the sports action and portrayal of the music industry is unrealistic to say the least. Yaoi fans looking for a lot of guy x guy action are also not likely to be satisfied either. There is very little intimacy between the ""lovers"" and absolutely zero chemistry and nothing that is even close to being called romance.  The cast for Zetsuai is small and pretty much keeps to its two leads. They are both underwhelming as characters. Izumi attempts to be played as this macho and manly athlete. But he comes across as a heartless brooding asshat. Yes, he’s had it rough. He is haunted by the murder of his father by his mother and her attempted murder of him. Because of the societal rejection of him as the son of a murderer he is understandably scarred emotionally and distant from people. He is moderately sympathetic as a character because most of what happens to him or has happened in his life is really through no fault of his own. I suppose the most inspirational thing about his is as a warning to people on why you shouldn't pick up strangers in the street and take them home with you.  Koji on the other hand is equally passionless. Though what exactly he is messed up about is anyone’s guess. I find it quite laughable that someone with so little interest in anything could ever become a successful musical artist. The only time he shows any real passion about anything is in playing the pining man-wife type, while he tries to force himself on Izumi. He is a complete psycho and his antics get more and more over the top the more desperate he becomes.  What can I say about the art? Well it is without a doubt one of the most horrible things I have ever subjected my eyeballs too. This kind of thing is precisely why I don’t watch this genre. If you want to see two women together why not just watch a yuri anime? It seems 99% of yaoi artwork is a rip-off of CLAMP designs. The guys are way too feminine, with long girlish nails and fingers, long silky hair, and thin faces with knife like pointed chins. Either the artist really loves Jay Leno or this is supposed to be attractive. Additionally the characters are supposed to be 16. Despite the silliness of that when it comes to the story, these guys don’t looks like they are 16. No way in hell. It’s not just the character designs that are hideous, the backgrounds and settings are just as bland and uninspired. I suppose I should give it a bit of a pass being that it is from almost 20 years ago but I can’t see this looked good ever. Even a cave artist would have thought this looked like shit.  Perhaps the only thing worse than the art is the music. Wow. I can’t believe we used to listen to this trash. If you want to reminisce to the good old days of hair bands and trite lyrics and corny keyboard sounds then maybe you will get a smidgeon of value. As hair bands go Mötley Crüe rocked, this is more like listening to Nelson. The acting performances are equally uninteresting and unmoving.  Overall Zetsuai 1989 is an anime that should be avoided by all but the most undiscriminating viewer or yaoi fangirl. I would say you could watch it for the lulz but you should love yourself more than that. The only thing it really has going for it is that it’s a million times better than its epically shitty sequel.";Not Recommended

0;Zetman;Stark700;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stark700;7;"""To be the man, you gotta beat the man"". - Ric Flair  Being a superhero is never easy, especially when you try to live a double life. Superheroes like Batman, Superman, and Spiderman deals with the dangers they get exposed to on a daily basis. They feel like it's their responsibility to protect the innocent and deliver that strong sense of justice. After all, justice is the judgement of truth and to uphold such a sense comes at a great responsibility, sacrifice, and lives.  Then there comes a hero at the darkest hour. He is ZET. Enter Zetman.  The story is set in the modern times with technology that passes our own in the real world. Such technology of course brings forth wealth, prosperity, hope, but also crime and monstrosity. Luckily for the good folks, we have heroes.  Now, to call Jin a superhero would be an overstatement. He is in fact some of us see as a dark hero of vengeance. Or maybe, we should call him a dark angel. Because of his efforts, lives are saved but not without a cost. That's the price of being a hero. Sometimes, you just can't save everyone. Yet Jin is an interesting character if we look at him carefully. He is quite the mysterious figure and for most of us, difficult to read. After witnessing the tragedies of his past, Jin swears vengeance and to never let anyone else close to him die again. Now that my friends makes him the dark hero, the dark angel, and the holder of justice in a different light.  Then, we have somewhat of the antithesis of the story, Kouge Amagi. Both academically and sports-inclined, he is also popular and has nearly everything he's ever wanted...wealth, admirers, and a family. Yet, there's one thing he seems to be missing and always wanted. That would be his dream of becoming a hero of justice, one that people admire, one that people respect, and one that helps the helpless. Unlike Jin however, Amagi's desire to become such a hero is quite on the opposite globe. (rather than for vengeance to say the least) In his mind, justice should be delivered and enemies of justice will be terminated. Bu it's a lot said easier than done.  We also have some of the other characters that lighten up the gloom and doom story a bit. The all innocent Konoha Amagi, and sister of Kouga, who has known Jin since their childhood times. The tomboy Hanako who has a curiosity in our dark hero (who also holds a dark secret) and among others. They tend to balance out the dark atmosphere and brings a little light as well as entertainment into the story.  Now for the story. I'll best honest here, it's not really well performed. There's always a risk of making an anime adaptation off of a manga but even more so in this case because the amount of material it covers. There's a lot of potential and believe me, I want to see it at its finest form. Yet what I see so far is a rushed story based off a manga of over 150 chapters. It doesn't also help with the fact that the series only runs for 13 episodes. Thirteen episodes I'd repeat again! With that unlucky number, my hopes for the overall story is a little bit down with its rushed sequences. All in honesty, it kinda feels like reading a story with chapters missing. Oh yes, there are some awesome fights and blood gore if you can take it in the stomach. However, it feels that a piece of excitement is missing. This series could become a real blockbuster made for mature audiences with its old school action and violence. Yet with only 13 episodes, I just don't see how it could out perform some of the other longer series of this Spring. Maybe our heroes can save this series from being sent into turmoil.  As for the art, the series seems to adapt a bit of old school. With the old school-like art, it certainly spawns some nostalgia in some of us who have been anime fans. But this is a R+ rated story and a reason for that. There's bodies being torn opened, blood spilled, and showing what our heroes do best: delivering justice (even if it comes at a cost).  The sound is just ""meh"" in my opinion. It does contain drama and conveys the dark mood of the story but not something too noticeable. I do admit that the OP song, ""dots and lines"" by You Hitoto feat. Mummy-D, is performed well and give us a more suburban type of feeling. With the word ""Zet"" being mentioned several times, the songs brings out the dark hero out of the characters.  Well, it is also not surprising that Masakazu Katsura was involved with the work of this series. He is Batman's biggest fan and we all know who he is. (at least I hope you do). As such, it is one of the possible main influences of his work. In fact, his influences can be even traced to another superheroes series that debuted last year. Maybe, Tiger & Bunny ring a bell?  Overall, I'd say that this series just fits into the ""so-so"" for the Spring Season. It has entertainment value especially if you're into some fan-service and hardcore action. But if you can't take the violence and sexual content, then just hit that drop button and try something else. This series blends in the idea of a hero at the darkest hour and shows the cruelty of the world. Its approach of the dark hero genre will give you a strange feeling of both justice and also cruelty once you start watching. Yet, the story is blend and too rushed so for those looking for a complex storyline, then that little glimmer of hope may be crushed faster than a Player. However, if those aren't your criteria, then this series might be worth a shot. Try coming home from school or work, and watch this on your computer or TV with a nice cup of coffee (or w/e it is that you drink) and get into the OP song (while keeping up with the rhythm) after a tiring Monday. You might smile wishing that there are more heroes like Jin and Kouga to save you from all the tiredness of work/school. Or you might feel sad that there are such enemies of justice in the Zetman world. Yet, we all know one thing.  There is a hero, a hero living in all of us.";Recommended
1;Zetman;Kruh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kruh;8;I was suprised by this Anime, Didn't think I'd like it that much. Zetman is a Seinen. If you like violent stories, full of psychological warfare, Full of Blood, Monsters. You will surely and truly Like Zetman.  The Story was a bit confusing at first, Getting clearer and clearer throughout the Anime. Monsters created by Humans break the law and start killing they're creators. I liked the story.It's a dark anime. Violence everywhere, Blood everywhere, And bunch of psychological mind games happening to the characters. I gave it a 8.  The Art was good. Unique Art which differs from other Animes, Although I did not find it was the best, But yet good enought. I gave it a 7.  Sound. Some Good OST's, Okay Sound Effects, Good Voice Actors. I gave it a 7.  The Characters, I fell in they're story, Very Psychological for some of them. The Main Characters, are very Likable, I fell in they're world. I really liked the Psychological Warfare of the characters, They're reaction, They're thoughts. It made me worry about them, Worry about what Will happen to them and such. I gave it a 8.  Enjoyment. Zetman was very enjoyable. Although being very crude and violent, I liked every bit of it. 8, Enought Said.   So the Overall Note is 8. If you Like Seinen's, Violent, Bloody, Psychological Animes. Zetman is clearly for you, You should even give it a shot if you want to try, You won't regret it. A great Anime. I recommend it to anyone. (Mostly 18+ haha.)  Thanks for reading. :);Recommended
2;Zetman;Jeffrey-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jeffrey-sama;7;"What is the true meaning of justice? Is it doing the right thing no matter the situation, or achieving the right result no matter the cost? This is the question that ZETMAN centers around. What may seem like the right thing to do can actually end up not being the case and vice-versa, as shown many times throughout the series. The decisions that one comes to based on their kind of justice will undoubtedly vary from person to person. Thus, ZETMAN attempts to illustrate the effects of various viewpoints on justice within a city that is riddled with evil and crippled by the conflicting mindsets that its inhabitants carry.  Art 7/10 Personally, I found the art to resemble the quality of rough sketches that have been coloured in. The sharp strokes and uneven outlines of the artwork, although I haven't seen it too often in the anime I have watched, didn't really impress me all that much and took a while to get used to, especially when it came to the characters themselves; I still wasn't able to fully appreciate it in the end. But in terms of fitting the anime's atmosphere, I thought this art style was a great choice. I found the roughness of the art actually enhanced my overall experience, even though I didn't really like it.  Characters 6/10 On one hand, the character development was definitely there. Both the two main protagonists, Jin and Kōga, were easy to understand and empathize with by the series' end. However, a lot of their development had a tendency to feel rushed and/or forced, hurting the solidity of their characters. Although the change in their characters could be explained by the circumstances that they went through, I still felt it wasn't enough to fully justify their development. On the other hand, some of the minor characters lacked development and seemed, at most times, to just be an unimportant part of the story, like an extra in a movie. And when they did play a role, it wasn't easy to connect or relate to them, given the limited amount of information about their character as a whole. The vast amount of characters for a short series also made it hard to keep up with and/or recognize each one. In a nutshell, the presence of a few great characters was offset by a bunch of not-so-great ones.  Sound 7/10 The highlight of this category is definitely the OP. While it took a while for me to get used to, I thought it was an excellent choice for an anime like ZETMAN. It's extremely catchy and does a good job in pumping the viewer up for the episode. The ED provides something different-a soft and slow song that follows a cliffhanger especially nicely. Aside from that the OST was unmemorable and the voice acting was average.  Story 7/10 In a way, the story of ZETMAN depicts the possible outcome of when humans abuse their scientific knowledge for their own pleasure and entertainment. Adding in the conflict between the two protagonists' different views on justice when it comes to dealing with the consequences of the aforementioned outcome and you have an interesting plot. Unfortunately, ZETMAN was unable to fully flesh out the potential of this basis and a lot of the story felt rushed. Accounting for the flow of the story in the manga, the anime, as agreed upon by many, paled in comparison. But that may have been due to the lack of time that the show was given (13 Episodes); maybe a 26-episode run would have greatly improved the overall entertainment value of the story. But as it stands, ZETMAN (the adaptation) ended up failing to build upon the solid foundation built by its predecessor.  Overall 7/10 When you look at it in a general sense, ZETMAN was a decent anime. It had its good points (lots of action, an interesting premise, and two decent protagonists) but also had its flaws (rushed story and character development). Those who have read the manga will mostly say this adaptation was a complete flop, but by itself, there's no real glaring fault that makes it a complete failure. I'd recommend ZETMAN to anyone who enjoys a good mix of action (violence) and a decent story (nothing too special).";Recommended
3;Zetman;Toucanbird;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Toucanbird;7;Zetman was certainly one of those animes that had me a bit torn on whether or not I liked it. It certainly was different from a lot of the animes I do watch.  I felt Zetman's strongest aspects were its artwork and story. The artwork for this anime was just gorgeous. This didn't have your typical shonen cartoony animaton feel. It had a dark, gritty story and had the animation to go with it. The story itself I felt was very solid as well. I was hooked as soon as I saw this was about a boy with supernatural powers born from the very monsters he was hunting. What made this story's dynamics even more interesting is when Jin befriends Kouga and Konoha Amagi, two aristocratic children who also share the same goals as Jin, even though Jin knows about the darker, deeper evils that lurk within the shadows. While Jin is mostly sent on saving anyone and everyone, Kouga mostly wants to become an admirable superhero while Konoha just wants to help the less fortunate. It makes for a very interesting dynamic between the three characters later on in the series. I did also think this anime added some elements that are a bit edgy for your typical anime. I won't tell you what they are for spoilers sake, but let's just say this anime felt as though it wasn't afraid to add more adult elements to this story.  While Zetman's story and art were great, it had a few things that I felt were major weaknesses in the story. First would be the Jin/Hanako relationship. This felt EXTREMELY forced. Yes, I understand the implications it had later on in the series (and for those of you that haven't seen the series, something happens that ultimately leads Jin to make a vital choice). However, this relationship seemed to take off before it could get a proper introduction. It felt as though Jin and Hanako run into each other, Jin saves Hanako, Hanako and Jin are bam, IMMEDIATELY in love. It just didn't feel right to me. Granted, I am a little biased because I didn't like Hanako's character from the start...but still, there didn't seem to be any buildup to their relationship.  I can't feel like I can give this a proper review because this anime did set itself up for a sequel. For a first season (assuming there will be a second season), it built up an interesting story that I can't wait to see continue. This anime certainly had its ups-and-downs but I'll admit, I enjoyed it even though I did find it kinda flawed in some aspects.;Recommended
4;Zetman;snivek101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/snivek101;7;"""Zetman"", the story of genetically engineered ""creatures"" who fight for the amusement of powerful men. The story is simple, clean, and to the point. There is nothing overly deep here, but there doesn't need to be. For a 13 episode series ""Zetman"" was loads of fun and not as predictable as one may think. Sure the characters were cliche but the direction in which the story takes us was fresh and fulfilling. Most questions were answered by the last episode and the ones that weren't didn't really important.  The character models were really well done. Facial expressions were well defined, noses were realistically shaped and, lips were plump and rounded. However, color could have been used more rigorously while structural art was utterly forgettable with the exception of one or two scenes.  The opening theme is hit or miss. I enjoyed its simplicity and like Little John had little substance but nevertheless was fun to listen to. Ending theme was in my opinion very dull. BGM was okay and got a little better towards the end of the series as tensions rose.  It's important to take into account the brevity of the series as character development was hard pressed in a 13 episode action oriented anime. With that being said we see a very plot driven series whose character faults are forgivable.  Overall I would definitely recommend ""Zetman"" for someone who doesn't want to invest too much time but still wants to be entertained.";Recommended

6;Zetman;xxAnjixx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xxAnjixx;7;"This is my short and hopefully sweet review of Zetman, which is an action anime that revolves around human engineered monsters called players, the rebellion of these ""players"" and the growth of the player hunter Zet.  The show in it's self isn't a bad watch. The art work, action scenes, voice acting, and characters, are all very good in my opinion. You can also tell there is a story good here. But without ever reading the manga, you can also tell that everything is rushed plot wise because of the series only being 13 episodes long.  Everything appears to be disjointed or very hard to believe because the show expects you to have knowledge of the manga as well. Also to keep up with the time constraints, key plot points in the anime differ from the manga. Which isn't bad when done right ""see full metal alchemist"". But often you will not understand the history,bonds and breakdowns that some of characters have built up or gone threw because there is alot that went on in the manga that the anime does not relay at all.  Overall this show is a classic example of why I believe most short anime series based on long running manga should stay true to the cannon and have ""no ending"", ""see Shigurui"". A show that lays the ground work for the series in great detail, but ends after the first arch is vastly better than a show that try's to jam 100 plus manga releases into a 300 minute anime Imo.  Also making an original story and sticking to it makes for a better short series than jumping between the cannon of a manga and what ever liberties the anime decided to come up with.  It's still a good watch for 13 eps, but don't expect to come away with anything more then alittle intro into the Zetman universe and some gory fight scenes.";Recommended
7;Zetman;Rebfy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rebfy;8;The score of 6 let me think that Zetman will be bad, but it definetly deserve a 7 or a 8. This anime is good, you got old scientist who creating dangerous creature which run out of control, a main character with badass hidden hability, almost authentic love story ( without annoying fan service, women are not over-sexualise by other character) and some rage moment wich are pretty satisfying. The story, as you could gess, is pretty generic ( like tokyo ghoul, kiseiju and a bit like devilman ) but it's coherent and the animation is relevant (better than lot of crap 2D or 3D animation which have higer score *humm first episode of kingdom* ). The story-line doesn't spend time in boring explanation, action are promptly coordonate and there are a lot of explanation explane by camera angle or expression of character. The last episode isn't good as the rest of the show but eventually the anime derseve a better score, i 've spend a good time and i was hype by the progression of the MC. Try the first two episode and don't let the score influence your opinion;Recommended

9;Zetman;DarkScribe492;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DarkScribe492;9;"What would you do to bring justice to people? How far will you go? What sacrifices will you make?  These ideas and more are explored throughout this show. Both in show and tell. It was another one of those days where i chose a random anime to watch and see how it goes. As always, my rule when doing this is that the show has 3 episodes to hook me or i just drop it and move on to another. There was no need for this one though. So let's explain why.  Story: 9 A show about two friends out to fight crime. One a rich kid with a sense of justice straight out of a Saturday morning superhero show. The other a slum kid who does it because the people need saved......and maybe to make some money along the way. A common goal forged by two different views. Can you see the picture I'm painting here? I'm actually reminded a lot about Gungrave when I watch this. They follow similar formulas and share a similar outcome. The point is, this is a story woven in with three other stories. All of which will have your full attention. The only downside I see with the story is that it feels rushed. A good example would be the the first two episodes. The first episodes starts off when they are kids, the second is when they are teens, and it gets a bit worse from there. All in all, its a good story and one I hear has it even better in the manga.  Art: 8 Bringing it back to the art style of older animes. Hard lines and grey gradient color scheme. I always enjoyed watching shows with this style because the action feels more gritty. Aside from that I didn't notice anything wrong with it.  Sound: 7 The sound did it's job........... What? You want more? Fine. The Opening song is very different to the rest of the tone of the show but after a few episodes you will start to really enjoy it. Ending is pretty forgettable, consisting of a low, sad beat and it really only fit the mood of 1 episode. Voice acting is hit or miss. Sometimes the characters sound normal, others they sound like they are A. trying to hard and B. Actually reading from a script. The second one might have you going ""Well duh, they are."", but you aren't suppose to feel that when listening to it.  Character: 10 This is where I feel the show really shines. Each main character has a very distinct personality. You know how you feel about each one. Not a theoretical feeling, a solid feeling about them. Whether it's a solid like or dislike. And that's what's great about them. They are so flushed out. Take our lead character Gin. He grew up as a slum kid with only his ""grandfather"" there to teach him the ways of the world. He never went to school, he only learned what was absolutely needed. You watch him grow and his ideals being forged, even after everything that he went through. I know I felt bad for him because I could relate with him a lot. I even had myself saying I'm sorry every time something bad happens. ACTUALLY SAYING I'M SORRY TO A 2-D CHARACTER. That is great character building right there.  Enjoyment: 8 I enjoyed this show, if you couldn't tell already. Sure there are flaws and they are very noticeable but honestly I enjoyed every second of it. Especially when it can hit you in the feels. I would give this show a try. Who knows......  Maybe you will question what justice means to you.  Overall: 9";Recommended
10;Zetman;AnimeFan_01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnimeFan_01;8;ZETMAN Review : SPOILER FREE  👌🏼 Very well rounded anime, action, thrill, suspense, story, soundtracks characters...  Ofcourse it could be better, in a few places but I would be nitpicking... It almost felt like I was watching a Hollywood movie for the entire time... There is a little bit of skin show as well, but only for a few seconds, nothing cringe worthy as it is very well blended in with the story and doesn't feel forced, like in many ecchi anime... Moreover as it's a seinen anime, it's totally acceptable and I shouldn't complain on that...  Ending could have been slightly better, but its not even close to bad. I am surprised that I didn't come across this anime earlier... A very enjoyable superhero anime...

13;Zetman;Neurose;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Neurose;10;"[Portuguese-BR] ""Justiça"", é uma palavra um tanto curiosa, me pergunto até agora ""o que é a justiça?"". Bom Justiça de acordo com o google, seria um equilibrio, uma igualdade que deve ser razoável e imparcial entre os interesses, riquezas e oportunidades... Não está só resumido em ""fazer o bem"", pois assim como o ""bom"" pode ser interpretado de um jeito, o ""mau"" também pode, e assim a ""justiça"" é, cada um tem seu tipo de justiça, claro que a justiça que o google fala é muito boa, mas não esta certa, porém também não esta errada.  O curioso do anime, é que a ""justiça"" ali teve dois lados, uma pessoa que só fazia a ""justiça"" como resultado de suas ações, e outra que a ""justiça"" era mais uma desculpa para receber elogios. Salvar pessoas, é justiça? Ao meu ver ""salvar pessoas"" não é justiça e sim uma ""boa ação"".  Jin, o protagonista, também conhecido como Zet, seu objetivo juntamente com o presidente da corporação Amagi, era exterminar todos os Players ou Evols (como preferir) como meio de sua vingaça, pois mataram seu ""avô"" Gorou Kanzaki que era seu criador. Em certo episódio, Zet se encontra com Alphas, o Kouga Amagi em um incêndio provocado por um Player e após derrotar o player, Jin salva uma familia inteira, sendo que Kouga era contra salvar a mãe por estar machucada. Logo após isso, Zet sai do local, deixando todo o crédito para o Alphas que não tinha feito nada de útil.  Kouga Amagi, bom ele que se diz ser um Herói, possui um certo sendo de ""justiça"" meio distorcido, porém não errado. Amagi é uma corporação, então Kouga futuramente seria o presidente dela, que até então essa posição era exercida por seu Avô. Obviamente uma familia muito rica, Kouga tendo tudo o que sempre quis, ganha sua armadura, a Alphas. Uma armadura que possibilitava a Kouga ser um ""Herói"".  Ambos são muito diferentes como o preto e o branco, porém o menino rico que sonhava em ser um herói, mas nunca conseguiu fazer isso realmente. E o ""menino pobre"" era realmente um herói, porém era somente um resultado de suas ações.  Bom se eu for falar do anime inteiro aqui vou ficar muito tempo escrevendo, então é isso. O anime é muito bom eu recomendo!  [English-EUA] ""Justice"" is a rather curious word, I ask myself until now ""what is justice?"". Good Justice according to google, would be a balance, an equality that should be reasonable and impartial between interests, riches and opportunities ... It is not only summarized in ""doing good,"" for just as ""good"" can be interpreted in a way, the ""bad"" can also, and so ""justice"" is, each has its kind of justice, of course the justice that google speaks is very good, but it is not right, but also not wrong.  The curious thing about the anime is that the ""justice"" there had two sides, a person who only did ""justice"" as a result of their actions, and another that ""justice"" was more an excuse to receive praise. Save people, is it justice? In my view ""saving people"" is not justice but a ""good deed"".  Jin, the protagonist, also known as Zet, his goal along with the president of the Amagi corporation, was to exterminate all Players or Evols (as he prefers) as a means of his revenge, as they killed his ""grandfather"" Gorou Kanzaki who was its creator. In a certain episode, Zet meets with Alphas, Kouga Amagi in a fire caused by a Player and after defeating the player, Jin saves an entire family, being that Kouga was against to save the mother by being injured. Soon after that, Zet leaves the place, leaving all the credit for Alphas who had done nothing useful.  Kouga Amagi, well he is said to be a Hero, has a certain being of ""justice"" half distorted, but not wrong. Amagi is a corporation, so Kouga would later be her chairman, who until then had this position held by his Grandfather. Obviously a very rich family, Kouga having everything he ever wanted, gains his armor, Alphas. An armor that enabled Kouga to be a ""Hero"".  Both are very different like black and white, but the rich boy who dreamed of being a hero, but never really managed to do that. And the ""poor boy"" was really a hero, but it was only a result of his actions.  Well if I'm going to talk about the whole anime here, I'll spend a lot of time writing, so that's it. The anime is very good I recommend!";Recommended
0;Zetman;Cornercircle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Cornercircle;6;It's a bird, it's a plane' it's ZETMAN!!! This is my very first review and I'm glad I started it like that. Since this is my first review I will try my best not to write a bunch if garbage. Zetman is an anime I have been looking forward to ever since I saw the 2012 anime lineup online. The superhero genre does not really exist in anime since the only real superhero anime out there is Astro Boy, which is considered a classic and one of the first shonen anime/manga. The superhero genre I personally think has the potential to be a great addition to so many things that already make anime great. It can make you forget about slice of life and psychological thrillers if it is done properly. Zetman could have put this genre on the anime map. But like this review's introduction, this anime is anything but super. Zetman's premise sounds like the perfect set up for a crimefighting show. Monsters created by humans for humans' entertainment escape from their captivity into this world and our hero has to stop them. It is a fairly simple premise with which a lot can be done with but alas the creators miss the mark with failed execution. My main beef with this series is that it should have lasted longer. 13 Episodes is enough to tell a decent story, but the producers needed more time for what they were going for. I feel that not a lot of time was spent on character development with the exception of the two main characters. Every one else is just there to fill up space or to move the story along. I wish that viewers could see Jin(our protaganist) find out about his powers and how to control them,and it is never actually stated what ZET is specifically capable of doing, that you have to figure out for yourself as the series goes on.Everyone else's motives are never really explained. Why do they do what they do?They just do do what they do. What I really liked about the series was the way Kouga (the other hero) is tested to see what his idea of justice is.This was a character that I really liked . But that was really the only REAL exciting bit I thought there was. There is a real twist at the end which I didn't see coming so props to the writers for that.The sound of the anime was alright,with the voice acting quality about the same as your average anime. The OP was alright but I got sick of it 4 epsiodes in. The ending theme was a lot better but I think it could be because of my love for slow songs.Visually the the show is not bad, I just wish that more detail was put into the blood, which reminds me that the fight scenes were enjoyable as well as it supposed to be since this is a superhero show. In a nutshell here is the pros and cons of Zetman.  Pros: -Kouga and Jin are good lead characters -Nice ending theme -Enjoyable fight scenes -Twist near the end of the show -Visuals are not that bad  Cons -Average voice acting -Very little character development -Not a very good OP -Invisible support characters -Boring story -Too short to cram everything in  Zetman is something I would watch again but not for a while,it really is not that bad,but with my high anticipations for it it felt like a let down.I recommend it as a something you can watch to pass the time if you have nothing to do for the weekend.  6/10;Mixed Feelings
1;Zetman;thatsuperheroguy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thatsuperheroguy;6;"This anime doesn't stand too far out from other anime and manga like Guyver and Devilman. But that is fine and not where the problem lays.  Starting off there are a few things that start off rather ludicrous and out of touch with reality. I give those a pass and then the anime begins to pick up and I enjoy the pacing.  but then things are thrown in that aren't properly explained and are just completely ignored. One thing is something you'll come to see called ""The Ring of Exposure"" which is all I'll say without spoiling the story.  The character Alphas feels interesting and unique. You go on an emotional trip with him but that emotional trip is rushed and his character arc falls flat on it's face towards the ending.  Some things regarding Zetman's powers are never explained and the anime ends on a note that gave me a quizzical look regarding the unsolved problem with his now double edged sword of a power.  The anime is good, the story was good but everything was rushed towards the ending. Now this makes sense since I found out that the manga was actually 20 volumes in comparison with this 13 episode anime adaption.  I have know idea what the difference is with how situations are resolved so I can't entirely recommend it but if I was to guess, I'd read that.  Over all this feels a little misdelivered but definitely a whole lot better then Casshern sins. If anyone wants to see something else like this or something with a superhero fighting monsters. I recommend the 2006 Guyver and the Baoh OVA.";Mixed Feelings
2;Zetman;Althamus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Althamus;6;"TLDR; Instantly forgettable, with some redeeming points.  Zetman has a few redeeming features in it. I found the premise interesting, but I could never connect very well with any of the characters and felt them all to be a bit standoffish, with one or two exceptions. Because I hadn't connected with them, the ending (which I assume would be more shocking and more eliciting of emotion if you read the manga) felt like another drab turn.  That having said, I did enjoy watching it, and have no regrets having done so. I do think that if it had had more than 13 episodes it might have been able to invest the audience more deeply in the characters and story rather than dash through it at lightning pace.";Mixed Feelings
3;Zetman;JoexySun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JoexySun;5;"Short Review (spoiler-free):  Zetman the 12-episode anime is, in summary, a far inferior adaptation of the original manga of the same name from renowned mangaka Masakazu Katsura. With its cheap and simplistic facial art, choppy and incomplete storyline, hammy dialogues and goofy characterization of the main characters, it retains only slims of the brilliance of the manga.  A random YouTube review of this anime I encountered picked my interest, and I went in expecting a wild ride full of 1970's manga antics (the 2002-2014 manga itself was a hardcore homage to the Devilman series). The first thing I noticed is the character facial art being unrecognizable from Masakazu Katsura's famous style. Let's just say that mangaka has been famous for depicting feminine beauty and sexiness in a way mostly unmatched by his peers. But if you compare the anime's characters with their original depictions in the manga, you'll know what I am talking about. Story-wise, although the anime covers the most crucial events from the manga's original 226-episode run, it ditched the necessary character development and worldbuilding the manga took a full decade to establish. As a result, characters' arcs and motivations seem hammy and choppy as heck in the anime. ""Oh you are the bad guy now, so I have to kill you"" sums up Kouga Amagi the second protagonist's character. A side character saved by Zetman a day ago said to him ""I don't want to go home"", and they just became a couple instantly. There are other minor issues holding it back from its full potential as well.  Baseline quality: When the manga is a 7-7.5, this anime is a 5.5 at best.  Recommended to: fans of the transforming superheroes (x-men, devilman, Guyver, etc.) when they get absolutely bored.  Pros:  + some decent fighting sequences. + Jin's relationships with his grandpa and aunty are decent and touching to a degree. + the climax in EP11-13 is somewhat captivating.  Cons:  - Facial art being simplistic and far inferior to the manga. If you are here for Masakazu Katsura's art, just go read the manga. - weird edginess (e.g. having Jin's aunty hyper-sexualized even though the audience is supposed to think of her as a mother-figure. The manga has the same issue). - Hammy characterization and dialogue. - With Devilman Crybaby the anime out in 2018, this anime feels like a meager copycat of Devilman. - The anime adaptation broke the original flow of story and made it a jumbled mess in some episodes, sometimes to the degree of immersion-breaking (e.g. Jin agreed to distance himself from his loved ones in order to protect them in EP3, but in the next episode he's still walking around in the same area). - Incomplete storyline (the original manga's run ended on a similar note, but we never saw the planned second act in any format, which is a shame.)";Mixed Feelings
0;Zetman;nightcrawlercyp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nightcrawlercyp;3;What can I said about it? It was an anime with enormous potential and up until episode 12 that potential existed. The last two episodes though basically screwed everything up. The anime starts kinda all over the place, but until the last two episodes is nothing that cannot easily be fixed. I will not give spoilers to the ones that still want to see it but you will be disapointed by the resolution of he show. Also Kouga is just a puppet from beginning to end even though he could have grown into a great character. The Jin character also develops quite nice until the last episode when I guess the readers decided to do some marijuana or something because this seems to be the only explanation for what happens.;Not Recommended
1;Zetman;mouthpiece;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mouthpiece;4;"Animated by Studio TMS, which never produced an above average work (its best attempts were Hundred Stories, Kenichi, and D.Gray-Man). Directed by Nabeshima Osamu who has directed all sorts of shows over the years, from children’s, to mahou shoujo, to fighting shounen. None of them managed to be above average either (the most famous amongst them are Saint Tail, Hamtaro, D.Gray-Man, and Lost Canvas). Can’t say there is much to expect from all that.  Zetman seemed very promising at first to me. It was dark, it had rather realistically drawn characters, it was very violent, and had people turned to monsters and using lots of gruesome superpowers. It would be a nice change from the average superpower shounen with its comical goofy kids and never-dying cast. And yet the anime managed to make me lose interest just from the pilot episode by being nothing but a parody of Power Rangers. By parody, I don’t mean it is funny but rather that it makes fun of the genre than being the mature seinen show I thought it would be. It is just than it is obviously poking at the stereotypes and saying “We will have more violence and sex than Naruto but it will otherwise still be like Naruto.” So yeah, it is still just dumb and it is not going to require any brain cells to figure out what is going on; the storyline is just what it appears to be. Idealistic good-hearted kids taking on evil organizations run by adults. They are just more selfish and violent than usual; something that hardly offers more depth to those who got bored of the easy going violence of normal fighting shounen and want more gore.  So, what is the story all about? There are these people who can mutate to monsters and are used by the rich and powerful in death matches for amusement. Some manage to escape and believing they are better than the rest, they start causing several deaths and mass destructions. The hero is a poor orphan who lives in some slum and after his friends and family are attacked by said monsters he decides to protect them by turning to a slum gang leader who transforms to this macho monster and kicks ass of bad monsters who mess with his buddies. Plus, there is this rich kid who thinks it’s a paragon of justice and forms a team of school kids who protect the town from the monsters. There you have it, the protection complex strikes again and that is all you get. Oh, and there are token cute girls in there just for the sake of having some piss poor platonic romance. They are as important to the story as sand is to Bedouins. YAWN!  The cast is not any more complicating or realistic than your typical Power Ranger characters; they are still easily divided into good guys (always dumb teenagers) and bad guys (always ambitious old dudes) and it is just the depressing and violent backgrounds that make them appear to be a bit unusual. The illusion breaks very easily when you figure that they are not doing much with all that other than having them as dressing. Heck, just listening the more than corny dialogues is enough; they all talk like their IQ is around 80 and repeat the same 50 words over and over again (protect, power, superiority, stronger, love, etc).  Also, although I never read the manga (and after seeing the premise in the anime I probably never will) everybody who did, claim that it messed up the character depth of the manga source (whatever depth you could get in such a story that is) by rushing through several events instead of investing time to flesh them out. So the pacing of the plot is extremely fast, to the point lots of important events happen without the proper duration. That tends to make you not care if people die and stuff blow up in a few seconds. I mean, seriously, the first episode alone felt like a summary of six episodes instead of one normal one.  The artwork is definitely the best part about it… and still bad compared to the manga. It looks detailed and mature until you start looking at the fine details. The facial grimaces for example will feel way too off for such a setting to the point it feels like comedy. They react in very woody ways like it is all a bad theatrical play. And the action scenes are flashy on a very superficial level but otherwise lack any great fighting choreography. They are just disjoined simplistic attacks and the hero is unbeatable, so they lack excitement entirely. You may enjoy it for the gore but even that is censored and doesn’t last too much; so again YAWN!  The soundtrack is also nothing memorable. Despite sounding like an old fashion ballad at times, it is still far from ear catchy. It feels colourless and having to endure all the corny dialogues of the characters your impression won’t improve much.  So in all the only thing I liked is the rather detailed and realistic artwork. Nothing else seems to be above your dumb Power Ranger level, despite the show boasting to be a dark and violent seinen. Its ideology is still shallow and there have already been several other similar titles over the years that did far better; some of which are the following: Devilman, Guyver, Parasyte, Tekkaman Blade, and Soul Taker. I liked those far more in their early stages than Zetman and it’s not because I grew older or I don’t like buckets of blood anymore. The presentation simply sucks in this one; it is lifeless and shallow. Nobody with above minimum demands should give it a try or expect anything other than a forgettable time waster.

2;Zetman;TBlazeWarriorT;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TBlazeWarriorT;2;The last two episodes managed to drop my rating from an overall 8 rating to a 2. I've only been this pissed off with anime 3 times in my life, congratulations. I won't spoil and while I know some people might find the way the anime ended fine, it really isn't my thing and I can't reommend the anime thanks to that.  Right as Kouga starts sounding like he knows what he's doing and that he'll start being a decent character, he just drags the anime back downhill and into the pits of hell, being probably the worst anime character I've had the bad luck to stumble upon. The whole anime ending is unsatisfying, ruining the nice building the anime had the effort to build throughout all episodes. It really is a shame, it feels like the author wanted to have some non-clichê ending or something like that so it decided to go with a bad ending intentionally (because there's no way he didn't know that ending was going to be horrible, I refuse to believe that), but then failed even that and just ended in a miserable and frustrating ending.  For people who like anime movies and anime with ridiculous endings where the most bastard characters triumph and get the good endings instead of the main character with no penalty whatsoever, I'd maybe still recommend this anime. All the good characters die or have the worst possible ending, no exception, all the prick characters stay alive and get the best possible ending, also no exceptions. Genuinely bad ending in every possible way.;Not Recommended
3;Zetman;Ludwig_Anarcheon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ludwig_Anarcheon;7;Plot: 6 - If you want a filler anime, there are better options. This is an aight story with an aight execution. - First 6 ep were amazing, everything made sense from the motivations of the characters to the problem definition. What happened afterwards was a complete U-turn. For some strange reason, the entire plot shifted and made no sense whatsoever. For an anime to start of so strong and become terrible so quick shows clearly that manga wasn't followed properly. - 3 out of 10 characters are portrayed, the remainder are just there to waste time by being useless obstacles.  Animation: 7 - Some good fight animation, meh choreography. - General animation is decent, nothing too special.  Voice acting: 7.5 - Most characters voices don't fit them, but overall they do a good job regardless. Could've been much better if the studio was given a larger budget.  Music: 8 - Ok OP, nothing too be too excited about. - ED is beautiful, perhaps the only redeeming factor about the music in this anime. - General music and OST didn't make sense in some scenes. Almost felt like I'm watching a batman training montage to be barbie girl.  Execution: 5.5 - As I mentioned above, first 6 ep are executed amazingly and can be given be an 8 for their efforts. the remaining are lucky to get 5's and 6's. - What could've been a good anime became an average anime at best.  Enjoyment: 7 Overall rating: 6.8 Adjusted weighted Rating: 6.78  P = 35% - 2.1 A = 30% - 2.1 V = 20% - 1.5 M = 10% - 0.8 E = 5% - 0.28;Not Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama;--Kaori--;https://myanimelist.net/profile/--Kaori--;7;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama is honestly, imo better than the entirety of S3 itself. If we're picking out moments from S3 then nah, but as a whole? I'd say this is better. Characters don't betray their personality like in S3 and ofc the other faults S3 has that my review pointed out but no need to mention that here as its not relevant to this review.  You can (at the time of this review's date posted) find this on YouTube, if you're looking for the English Sub version you can find 6 out of 7.the last one not subbed you can find with a CC turned on but the sub for the CC is crap. However if you like me have seen enough sub anime and know enough Japanese words then that + the CC and whats going on in the episode you can make out most or all of whats being said/happening. That said the other 6 that ARE subbed are out of order, it was annoying to have to play puzzle to find the right order, thankfully logic and common sense as well as the sub and start of the episode as well as the MAL synopsis here are what made it possible to find the correct order with little trouble. As a result i only saw 1 episode out of order.  Ah, my apologies, let's get onto the review itself. Basically the art for these 7 eps in this picture drama is really nice and well done. The story is basically Saito, Louise and Siesta are doing a play. Why, where and for what purpose is never explained, sadly. Likewise I'm unable to say if this is even canon, as only one thing said during the performance they did indicates this may not be canon (Hint: Wedding) however at the same time nothing besides that says it isn't canon. If its mentioned in S4 then its canon, otherwise you can skip this but personally if you like this series or any of the 3 characters then i'd strongly recommend to NOT skip it. (disclaimer: Siesta doesn't get much screen time at all, so its really the other two)  The first 3 episodes have Louise and Saito playing roles of the opposite of what they are in the anime. So, the proud stuck up aristocrat is now playing a maid. Mean while Saito is playing an Earl... sadly a cheating one who cheats on his wife but thats just part of the play and I swear this is based on an actual play as i swear I've seen/heard this story before, prolly in another anime or two... anyway, the real question is, will Louise be able to finish the play and stay in character or will she lash out and go back to being herself?  Episodes 4-7 put them in a role that's very close to their role in the anime, despite this it ends up going further than even the anime thus far has gone, so if S4 doesn't show serious growth/this then hey, this is a nice way to see what the two might be like in the future, sadly, i can actually see this happening as of the series' state thus far lol that said these short 7 episodes were really great, I'd really recommend checking them out, don't be scared of the other reviews with low scores. That said keep in mind it IS a picture drama so expect a few pics and most of it is just audio, those aren't so bad and certainly not here, especially if you like Saito and Louise!  I rate Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama, a 7.0 out of 10.0, check it out :);Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama;GreatS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GreatS;3;This review might not be really helpful, but as there wasn't any review out there I thought I might just as well share my thoughts. The story is totally worthless except for the last two 'episodes', it mainly only consists of fan-service and naturally story is totally irrelevant to fan service. As its a picture drama the art is naturally poor, and the number of pictures was even low compared to other picture drama's I have seen. Sound was just ok, though I think it reused most music from the main series. In the picture drama Louise and Saito are playing a theatre piece and their characters are interesting to some extend and I in the last two 'episodes' there is something (at least I smiled for the first time) which is enjoyable to some extend, however due to the first few episodes which were pure fan service I went down from a 4-5/10 to a 3/10. Overall I think it's not worth watching, though it won't take a lot of time to watch either.;Not Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama;Amert;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Amert;2;I remember when first time i saw this series. It had some potential in it. But series after series it went horrible. Back then it had some story in it. Relationship between Loiuse and Saito. But in second and third season there is only fanservice. And im not saying fanservice is bad nor good. There is plenty of people who do like it. The problem is in overall everything. First, in third season there is no story at all. Second anime has terrible sound for 2009. Third there is almost no animation. U can see that they are put just 3 or 4 mouth animation on characters and make them talk. That's bad. And last they put almost no effort to design of characters. I mean in first season there was some bad character looks that i said oh it's 2006 and it's ok maybe they will improve but as new series camed the quality was decreased. So if you are into some weird fanservice anime that has no story in it give it a shot.;Not Recommended

It was simple, generic, yet stupidly hilarious.  There isn't much of a story. The principal and Saito found a chest full of bikinis (don't ask how) and decided that everybody should go to the beach for a short 2-day vacation.  (girls + bikinis) x (Order of Perverts + Principal) = you know what happens.  Oh, and add a giant octopus with tentacles in that equation as well.  It was a great, hilarious OVA that everybody should watch just for the laughs. It's definitely worth 20 minutes of your time, so enjoy it!";Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo - Yuuwaku no Sunahama;Ilyaoh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ilyaoh;7;"There's not much of a story here, the Principal and Saito find a chest full of beachwear, bikini's and swimsuits. After Saito explained what these were for, the Principal dismissed the original summerschool trip and made a new one, to the ocean. Then, fooling all the students and the princess and her bodyguard, letting them believe, that clothing is for rituals (like volleyball, and watermelon bashing &gt;_&gt; ) to please the God of Water (or something like that). Of course, it's starts with beachwear and swimsuits, it goes to bikini's and last but not least, swimsuits excisting out only three seashells (which is worn by both male and femal characters).  The art is good, perhaps a bit better then most in the series, which is good of course, the animation is still no the same level, while they did a better job on the sound, the voice-actors .. acted better in my opinion, while the background music and sounds are in better quality too and since it happens between two original episodes, the OVA has the same opening and ending as the series, which are in the same quality and contain the same clips.  The characters are still the same, though we get more intimate with the female one's, and see the Order of Perverts in their natural habitat (So they wish). I'm not one to get enjoyed by ecchi anime easily, but this OVA got me. I enjoyed the first &quot;contact&quot; with the Giant Octopuss, and I enjoyed some several close-ups too, which I normally don't.  Some jokes, scene's and sounds made by the voice-actors are just hilarious and really make you laugh, I even laughed out loud .. twice! Which I normally don't, not by any (or at least most) comedy anime's. For people who like Zero no Tsukaima it's a fun OVA, and for the people who watched the show (and enjoyed it) for the wrong reasons, it's HIGHLY enjoyable.  Even though the story's nothing special, everything makes up for that.";Recommended

It's a single special episode of 20 mins, so during the time you read reviews about it you might as well just watch it.  What's it about? Take Zero no Tsukaima, and move it to the beach. Girls in bikinis, boys who want to peak, a bit of Louise x Saito. That's it.  And since I have to write a longer review.. the story is absolutely amazing! I would've never thought to see such a complex, flawless story being put in a mere 20 minutes. I was completely blown away!;Recommended

Put the story on pause for a second so everyone can get in their swimsuits and frolic about splashing water at each other and doing that watermelon smashing game they apparently love so much in Japan. Of course Louise isn't called Zero just cause she can't do magic, if you know what I mean. She hasn't exactly got anything to show off in the first place, so I don't blame Saito if his eyes are wandering more to Siesta or the elf girl.  In all seriousness it's just your typical fan service OVA that doesn't really add anything of value to the series. You can safely skip it and not miss out on much. 7/10;Recommended

There is no real story here, worse is all the boys are scummy pervs, even Saito whom I'd still had respect for in S2, lost my respect in S3 and certainly here. Anything they get in this episode they more than deserve far as am concerned. This episode unless you're into fan service and pervy scenes is a waste of time unless you like the cast of characters in the series, even then you may not like this episode.  Rating is a 4.0, mainly due to the fact no actual story and just boys being pervs. Anything else I have to say about this OVA episode isn't good, I don't hate it but I've certainly had more praise for beach episodes than i have this one. Anything I did like in this episode is, merely because I like the cast of characters in the series, looking at this however from what it does, is bad, hence my harsh words and harsh rating.;Not Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Nequam;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nequam;7;In contrast to the previous two seasons, which were somewhat enjoyable, the third season was the most disappointing of all for multiple reasons. It manages to start off well however there were many possibilities that were available but were infrequently explored which could've potentially made this season much better or so. Unlike the first season, the third season seemed to not focus on the plot as much. It seems as though there was an excessive amount of romance cliches which strongly detracted from the season, such as the overly emotional and volatile tsundere (ex : Louise zapping Saito as comic relief), ecchi fanservice (ex : hotsprings, nosebleeds, yuri, breasts). Though the storyline does bring along some good results that are decent to the viewers such as the highlight of Tabitha's storyline, development of henrietta's character and Louise's insecure side and Saito shows his chivalry side. In addition, with the introduction of new characters, each character has a unique personality. More often than not, Louise and Saito bring out romantic moments which bring out a refreshing experience to the audience. Saito accompanies latterly his incredibly and heart-warming feats of courage and caring devoted and engaged in singularly towards Louise, while Louise introspectively loves him so, she cannot express it properly and openly until there is more character development.  One of the best aspects of Zero no Tsukaima are the animations, the character designs are fairly decent visuals, and the illustrations successfully convey the character's expressions to the audience without a problem while adding onto the humorous moments. There is also a fair amount of detail in the background which would enlighten the audience respectively.  The opening and ending themes are fairly decent and manage to fit well and the bgm is also well-accustomed to the particular moments. The voice actors are consistent throughout the series as well with their voice acting.  In conclusion, Zero no Tsukaima ~Princesses no Rondo~ is an above average sequel to the series with some intriguing moments. It seemed to ignore the most compelling and intriguing aspects of the series, the storyline. It could have been possible to focus on the two main antagonists and the overall objective of the antagonists while filling in the plotholes instead or it could of spent more effort on the relationship of Saito and Louise.  Hopefully, the next season will end this cliffhanger.  Though the enjoyability of this series is dependent on what exactly you are expecting.;Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;mcjazzman32;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mcjazzman32;9;"Zero no Tsukaima is one of those rare romantic anime that actually allows the viewer some of the pleasures of romance that are rarely ever actually allowed in a series: actual physical contact. You see, most romance anime feature a boy and a girl and 24 episodes of them muddling through genre cliches and stuttering annoyances until finally, they get together in the end, and even then, only about 5% of the time, it ends in a kiss, which really blows my mind about romance anime in general, but that's another matter.  Now, to be truthful, there's a lot that can be said against this show. The story is weak in itself, filled with more deux ex than can possibly be explained. It's almost like the creators just don't care about plot holes and rediculous assumptions. Not only that, but the original premise of Season 1 (where Louise is a magic student in a magical academy) has been completely abandoned. I think the academy showed up once or twice in Season 3 and the Professor showed up only in the last episode.  However, somehow, all of the bad things that can be said about this show still gets pushed to the backburner because this anime is just downright fun! I could watch the episodes over and over because the characters are so well done and the dialogue and voice acting are top-notch and the relationship between Louise and Saito is just amazing. (Just watch the boat scene in episode 4 of Season 2 and you'll know what I mean. That kind of thing NEVER happens in romance anime, especially in the middle of the season, so I've watched it so many times, because I just loved it so much.)  Louise is perhaps the most adorable character in the history of tsunderes, if not in all of anime. She hardly ever gets on your nerves like most tsundere types can from time to time, because in every episode you can see how vulnerable she is... how much she needs Saito. And unlike most tundere types, she breaks down quite easily in confessing what she doesn't want to: that she has feelings for him. That hits at the heart of what usually annoys most fans of romance: that it just takes too dark long for the characters to confess their love and that when it does happen, the anime is already concluding and we don't get to see any aftermath. Well, that's not the case with Zero. Louise and Saito confess early and often in Season 1 and after that, it's just more and more development, more and more physical contact that displays their feelings, and more and more love. It's actually amazing what a simple plot change can do when you do it right and let me tell you all: Zero no Tsukaima gets romance right!  Other notables about this anime. The fanservice isn't the best, but its good. There's no nudity, but perhaps in this case, there's no need (although Louise naked would be nice, but that's just me *wink*). Louise's stuttering nervous voice is beyond adorable and I guarantee you'll fall in love with her the minute you hear it. Saito is actually pretty solid as a lead male in this genre and he surprises often. If I had to use one word to describe him, it would be &quot;realistic.&quot; Everything about him from his responses to his feelings is spot on and just makes sense. He brings balance to the anime.  Anyways, overall, I would reccommend this to anyone who loves romance anime with strong harem theme, but isn't truly harem. I guarantee you won't find many pairings that matches the strength of Louise and Saito. From the looks of the last episode, it seems they probably aren't doing a Season 4, but luckily the last episode of Season 3 was magnificent.";Recommended
2;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Andristian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Andristian;7;Zero no Tsukaima is back for a third season with the so-called Princess no Rondo (translates to Rondo of the Princesses, for the curious ones) and I have to say that things haven’t changed too much. The first season was pretty good, the second one didn’t disappoint either (although season one was much better) and I’m somewhat happy to say that season three is pretty good too. “Pretty good” meaning that it won’t disappoint those who know what to expect – the fans of the series. Yes, Louise’s tsundere charm is still there and yes, Saito continues to get into seemingly perverse situations with other girls, which makes Louise go gaga and punish him with her infamous whip.  The joke may be old, but it’s still as funny as it was the first day. Hell, maybe even funnier! How is that possible, you may ask yourself? Well, it seems that the writers really raised the bar and improved overall writing quality of the anime, especially the funny, more lighthearted situations. The jokes seem funnier than ever and there are tons of situations and scene that will make you laugh uncontrollably throughout the season. The main storyline isn’t as good as it used to be, but that really doesn’t matter too much anymore. Most of us who continue to watch this anime don’t watch it for its awesome plot, but rather for the interactions between characters.  Not many new stuff are introduced in Princess no Rondo, but we do get some new characters and a continuation of the previous story (even if it develops rather slowly). The most important new character this season offers is Tifania, also known as the forest fairy which saved Saito’s life back in season two. There isn’t much to say about her without mentioning her enormous breasts (which are even bigger than Siesta’s – imagine that). Obviously she’ll somehow get attached to Saito, which will lead to Louise catching them during inappropriate and this-is-not-what-it-looks-like situations, and before you know it Saito will be punished by yet another creative and painful way by Louise. There are some other minor characters introduced as well, but they really aren’t worth mentioning. I’ll just add that we’ll get to meet a new villain, who seems to be the mastermind behind all these ‘evil’ operations. Not a very impressive character, but he gets the job done.  That’s about all I need to say about this season. It may not be the best in the series, but I consider it to be a fine improvement over the last season (Futatsuki no Kishi), which I consider to be more of a mess and totally out of balance (still good, though!). You’re definitely gonna enjoy this one if you’ve liked the other two seasons and even though there isn’t anything new to attract attention, it’s good enough to keep the story going and the entertainment pumping. Have fun watching Louise unleash her rage on Saito (and some of it on the enemies as well)!;Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;ethann;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ethann;7;Zero no Tsukaima ~princess no Rondo~ is the third installment to the series where the story carries on from the previous 2 series, with saito and Louise now closer together but with more competition now from the other girls. The story reveals the presence of more than one void user and this is what the story revolves around.  I must say that as someone who has watched the first 2 series of this show, it is a big letdown. The story does not develop very far until the last few episodes. And is very slow moving even for a 13 episode anime.While there is some progression, much of the story is actually left open ended, and i presume a fourth series will be produced to continue from this. Also i feel that many charcters have been altered or bent in terms of personanlity in order to fit this comedy filled anime. Of course this is a romantic comedy so romance and comedy are both evident, but i think that the producers tried too hard this time, but there are some good moments still so it still passes.  The art was the same as the previous series with artwork leaning more to the cartoonic side to portray the comedy in this show. Nothing wrong with this area.  Sound was actually quite good compared to the first two series, the inserts were timed nicely to bring out the atmosphere of the different moments in the story. OP and ED songs were more lively and actually hints a comedy show.  The characters was another huge disappointment. As mentioned earlier, the characters have been altered here and there to the point that nearly all the girls go for Saito...it feels like this anime is becoming a harem more than romance. Louise is now some really over emotional girl who is quite dense(when you watch it you'll know what i mean) all the way through the show. Of course the characters were still as effective in portraying the comedy as the other two series had done but i felt no significance in the characters anymore. Depth was especially lacking in a lot of characters, i still give it a pass on the account of the comedy and romantic moments here and there in the show.  Overall, If you have watched the first two series of the anime, don't expect anything better than the first two, it is a bid disappointment compared to them. The anime has become too emotional in some aspects and is clearly lacking in the romance genre as they have to create situations whereby louise gets jealous in order to keep up the love tension, they do this by altering the personality of some characters. Also the sheer number of characters has again increased which would explain the lack of depth in the characters. Hopefully, the fourth season would be something to look foward to...should there be one.;Recommended
4;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;GreatS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GreatS;8;The following is true for all three seasons of Zero no Tsukaima. Overall there are over a million points to complain about, yet it was simply too much fun too watch xD. This review should be quite spoilerless, except for the very last line (which is a relatively small spoiler).  ==Story 7/10== The Story is quite straightforward up the point of sometimes even being downright childish. At some points during the series this can slightly distract from the story itself, however there is an overall plot binding everything together enough for it be worth more than just a 6. Still I would definitely not advise anybody to watch it for any in-depth plot development.  ==Art 6/10== The art is fairly good in general, but at quite a number of points during the series cartoon like art is used (not sure about the name). Though this sometimes is enjoyable, I personally regarded this as being quite distracting at times. Still I would suggest you look for another review if you're concerned about the art.  ==Sound 7/10== ... no clue... (I don't care about music) ... It felt slightly repetitive at times, but all the music had one single theme binding it together, which IMHO is quite a good thing.  ==Character 7/10== First of all the characters seem not to develop at all and the same situations are used over and over again. Despite of this one can not be stopped from loving and hating the characters at the same time. Loving because they are all adorable presented and hating them for reasons as messing up the main romantic relationship in the series and the main characters inability to stick with his choices. None the less the characters seem to develop over the course of all three seasons, so it wasn't as bad as I was fearing, though - if there is a fourth season - it would be cool to have a season without a fallback in character development, like the ones which happened at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd season.  ==Enjoyment 10/10== The best aspect of this series xD, while watching I simply had to have a smile on my face. At various points the series actually crossed the border of what I find enjoyable as far as ecchi stuff goes and I have hated the series for the nearly-harem aspect. Despite the fact that I am a boy, I more than hated it how the main character was kissing every single girl in the series, but still I can't deny that I more than greatly enjoyed the rest. SPOILER!!!:(I wouldn't have been so positive if not for the main characters getting closer and closer in the end.);Recommended

Why ? No improvement like the last one . Basically it's the same thing like the last two is . Other than the story , everything is the same . Onto the review yeahhh......  Story:8 After the event of Saito , who himself face more than 70 thousand army . After some 'gruesome' battle , he supposed to be dead but nahhh . He was save by a fairy . After that , his rune on his left hand dissapear and that's where the real journey begins . I won't tell much about the story plot because nothing is worth mentioning here .  Art:8 Like the other two seasons , same arts and animations . Does have some 3D animation which is kind of cool . Have some beautiful arts . And yet again , the character design doesn't change like the last two . I really wish they improve this one .  Sound:9 Same voice actor and actress . Nothing that make me stop or anything . The OP and ED were enjoyable especially the OP . Have some thrill feelings like the last one .  Character:8 Some characters here does have a background . Like the last two seasons , nothing change . There were a few new characters like Sheffield , the one that has a rune that has the same power as Saito rune except her rune is located on her forehead , Joseph , the one who kill Tabitha's father , Vitartial , the elf boy and many more . I can see that these new characters especially the female , have a lot in common with the old one . Huge , big , bodacious of boobs . Big is fine but if you make it THAT big , then it just look ridiculous man.....  Enjoyment:7 I thought when i watch the third seasons of Zero no Tsukaima , i will get the same enjoyment as before . I was wrong . I didn't enjoy this one much . The comedy is still there , the romance are by far worse than twillight , harem is a must in this one , fan service paradise hooray which i hate . Nothing enjoyable on this one except that i was surprise that Colbert is still alive . That one did make me happy . I guess dead people is a NO on this anime....  Overall:7 I am very dissapointed on the third seasons for Zero no Tsukaima . Because of this , i'm having trouble on trying to watch the fourth one .

The so-called plot begins around ep 7 where things actually start to get better, most of the time you will be see louise trying to get hold of her feeling towards saito, it was good, I admit. Smoothly and nicely until ep11, which I think the snag came. IT WAS HORRIBLE. How did J.C. manage to ruin something as smoothly as a slide into a terrain full of F**K-lots of spikes? Watching ep 11 makes me feel that I'm sliding through lots of spikes. They had done it. They had you excitied for 10 episode and ruin you with the 11th episode. Well done J.C. staff, you just made me lost 95% of my interest in Zero no Tsukaima.  But other than that screwed up episode, ZnT S3 is still considered enjoyable (as long as you don't think logically). Screw the plots cause theres never 1. Art is amazing, I admit, way more beter than the previous 2 seasons. I personally prefer this season's opening over the other 2, although not a great song, its nice to hear it every once a while (especially ep12 =P). Enjoyment is there, seriously, as long as you avoid 11 the value stays at 8 (but that would make 12 weird &gt;.&gt;).  So in overall, I'm giving this a 8. (Originally 7, thanks to last ep the god-dam saviour)  Screw 4th season.";Recommended
7;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;haremfreak900;https://myanimelist.net/profile/haremfreak900;10;i think that the writers had run out of idea's for this because there were to many unexplored areas of story yet should be filled out. more could of been added i dont think that this should of ended the way it did. i have a strong feeling that there wont be a season4 people say the mangas not fininshed but i dont read manga so =( this series was one of the best in all the harems i watched even though most of the stupid things everyone did in this series was more of comady. there were some romance in this series but kinda dull. only in the end will u cry and say wtf this was so good make another. i should tell u to watch this anime starting from season1 and if u still dont get it i would insist u watch it 2ce. honestly ill give this series a 10/10 bc it is one like no other and i feel very strongly about this dont get mad and say well u knwo he says its good and i don like it. its good for me and if u dont like it after seeing it twice then i guess u have no taste for anime. thanx  XD;Recommended
8;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;VelocityWaffles;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VelocityWaffles;7;Honestly I was a little disappointed with this season, a lot of good ideas were put into it but there were so many it seems they rushed through them like saito's rune disapearring, tabitha's rescue, and the end with the square golem. I'd rather see them make more seasons and extend everything than smashing it into one, still I can't complain, it is ZnT still laughed a lot, and had fun watching it. I don't want to be one of those people who complains about everything wrong with an anime though so I will tell you this is still a must watch, very funny, much is revealed, a few suprises, louise is starting to act more mature and see whats important, and louise and saito's relationship has some advancement where she's learning to trust him more. If the pattern I'm seeing is correct than season 4 should be good with an epic ending.;Recommended
9;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;lamaraptor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lamaraptor;7;Okay, they are no longer in a war. If you missed the joke, all through the second season I felt like the show went out of it's way to constantly remind us that they were fighting a war. So that's done with now.  There's an attempt to shift the status quo by making Saito a proper nobleman because of his war time heroics. Because he's no longer a commoner the super thirsty queen suddenly thinks that's her cue to horn in on her childhood friend's lover, attempting to use royal justification for seducing him away. It'd be more forgivable if she wasn't just the worst. I'd sooner prefer he get with Siesta than that absolute thot of a queen.  Saito's harem in general seems to be growing every season. He's got the elf girl and Tabitha now chasing after him just as much as Siesta. I still think Zero will probably win out just by virtue of being first girl best girl, but she's got her work cut out for her. We're 3 seasons in and the story is starting to drag a bit, only remembering to get back to the main plot at the start or end of a season, and just sort of meandering everywhere in between. It's still entertaining, but the premise is starting to wear pretty thin, and I'm really just hoping for a definitive ending sometime soon.  7/10;Recommended
10;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Aphiel1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aphiel1;8;Bwahahaha that pretty much sums up my feelings after the final episode. I've been following this series since the first season and let me just say this season has by far been the most funny if not the most irrelevant addition to the story line yet. Story- To understand where we are and everything that's happening you must have at least watched the first two seasons otherwise you'll have no idea about the whole atmosphere of this season. In terms of what this season added to the series...near nothing we moved a little forward. Art- I think well drawn and well animated I love the way magic looks in this series and I love how we get a combination of new age and old age technology. Sound- Probably my least favorite opening and closings yet but it still has what I love best and that would be the killer voice acting which got me addicted to this series to begin with. Character- So we had some more character development this season which was good I always wanted to know more about some characters not to mention we had some new character introductions which in my opinion only made this season better. Enjoyment- If we're talking about how I enjoyed the comedy, romance, and drama of this season a ten would be my score however if we're talking about my enjoyment in terms of what was added to the storyline and how I felt things progressed a seven would be my score. This season was hilarious. Overall- I give this season an 8 although you didn't give me much to add to a storyline you more than did your part in making me laugh and reminding me why at first I thought this series was so funny.;Recommended
11;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;seroth77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/seroth77;8;I have read a lot of reviews saying they didn't like this season as much as the previous but I loved it. Season 1 they met and liked each other. Season 2 they fell in love and finally admitted it. Season 3 is all about their relationship and how it grows. I really liked how the focus shifted from the secondary characters back to the main. Sadly, Season 4 is the end of the show but I am excited to see how it all works out. This tale of love and comedy is the reason I gave this genre a chance and after watching this series I'm glad I did.;Recommended
12;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;RoyalSeraph;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RoyalSeraph;7;"Alright, I know that what I'm about to say seems to be an unpopular opinion, and I know the top reviews as of today (early November 2020) are really harsh towards this season and say it's worse than its two prequels, but as someone who's more drawn towards the plot+drama aspect of this anime I have to disagree with them. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I liked this more than the previous ones, and most things in this season are better or equal in quality to season 2 (FnK). It's not perfect. Quite frankly, far from it, but from my personal perspective it's a corrective experience to many things I felt were wrong with this anime. So, to the details:  STORY (this will be longer than I usually give for a section): I'll minimize the spoiler for the previous season as much as I can, but I'll assume you already saw it so odds are you'll infer what I'm talking about. If you don't want anything that could remotely spoil the previous season (keyword: PREVIOUS. No spoilers to this one) please skip to the art section. Sadly I didn't feel this season that there was an event that left me shocked like the event in the end of the episode where they entered the academy trying to burn it, but I'll admit, they improved. The story has a bit more depth to it (despite some irritating borderline-filler moments in the middle, more on that in the ""enjoyment"" section) and in hindsight the introduction of the key character in FnK's finale seems like a smart move, despite appearing controversial in the first half of the season. The main characters seem to act a lot more like an ensemble which I personally liked, because it seems to shed a light on some of the supporting characters as well and makes them crucial to the story. More on that later. The villains are still a bit boring compared to other anime of the same genre, however I do think that after the quality drop in season 2 they seemed to partly recover. It doesn't make up the fact they're boring and their scenes are boring to watch, but there is improvement and I hope it will improve even more in the final season. Another thing that bugged me is that this season, for the first time, there are minor plot holes. There are a couple of counterintuitive and counter-logical (if that's a real term) decisions made in this season that some viewers may find to be bizarre and annoying. And yet, somehow, despite the plot holes, many other things suddenly seem to finally make sense. One being the character of the relationship between Saito and Louise. Season finale is not very impressive this time, sadly didn't recreate season 1 properly, but considering the fact this probably builds up to the final season, I see it as a fair step. 7/10.  ART: I don't really see a big change excluding the one expected due to the season being released later in time. The sakuga isn't anything extraordinary here, but their background and location animation mildly improved. I gave the previous seasons 7/10, and even though there was slight improvement here, it's not enough to be worth an extra point this time. So 7/10 it is.  SOUND: Kinda worsened. The voice acting of most characters is as great as usual, which is definitely a plus, but some side characters are kind of a let-down. Fortunately their screen time is extremely limited. I prefer the OP+ED songs of the previous seasons over this one's. The soundtrack in general was fine, but I had higher expectations. In season 2 they seemed to nail the soundtrack pretty well, and this time, in some very specific scenes, this pattern was sadly broken. They literally reuse the same BGMs as in the rest of the seasons and I myself could tell that a song didn't match. I may be generous here, but due to the mostly fine voice acting and bearable soundtrack I give this a passing grade. 6/10. Hope it'll get better next time.  CHARACTER: Alright. It's very easy to impress me when it comes to characters after the clusterfuck that was season 2, but I genuinely can't understand why people don't see character development here. Let me start off with the characters that pissed me off the most last season - Siesta. It seems like it was at this part of writing the story where it was realized that the writer/s made a big mistake with Siesta, and now they seem to have not only gradually toned down her overly thirsty season 2 mentality, but also mix it with the storyline more elegantly. I LOVE where Saito and Louise are heading, both together and individually. Each one of them seems to reach some important conclusions they should have reached far earlier, especially Louise. Finally, unlike last season, the characters we know and like from season 1 are crucial again. I'd even go as far as saying that aside the obvious couple leading the anime they seem to be a moving gear for the story. One character we're all familiar with goes through a huge development. The reason I decided to give this 7/10 is because I look at it in comparison to past seasons. It's not far better than season 1, but characters' behavior seems to make sense overall, and even end up being relatable. In fact, maybe 7 is just a little bit too low, though 8 is too high in my opinion despite the great relationships and finally some sparks of depth after two entire seasons without it. So imagine it being sort of a 7.5/10.  ENJOYMENT: I can't believe I'm saying this, but except for the very unnecessary episode 6, I enjoyed this season a lot! I can't help it, despite the flaws it was just really fun to watch. Episode 7 was probably my favorite this season due to very nice combination of story elements, drama, and humor. Speaking of which - The humor is great this time and laughed more than in the past two combined which is extremely weird when taking into consideration that this is the most story-above-comedy oriented season yet. 9/10, and they're lucky to not lose more points due to the uncalled for yuri-fest in ep6 (watch the last few minutes of it though, they're important).  IN CONCLUSION; This season felt like it was trying to patch the wounds from season 2, and even though it has its weak spots and they're not hard to notice, the dots seem to finally start to connect, and the stage is ready and set for the finale.  Final verdict - watch it, and if you're pessimistic just approach it with the thought that it's there to set the stage for the ultimate conclusion.  Update after starting season 4: WATCH IT. IT'S WORTH THE 4TH SEASON";Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;ymir233;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ymir233;6;"I don't care how well a formula works, when it's repeated three times with no changes, it screws over suspension of disbelief. Although enjoyable with some fist-pumping moments, the third season is definitely a letdown from the previous seasons and I hope they make a fourth season just to repent for the mess they created here. I will start out with the small stuff because I want to save the story until the end.  Art is the same as the last two seasons, it's nicely rounded out, and for being a cute/ecchi anime, the fighting scenes are better than expected, giving it a score of 7.  I've always really liked the Zero no Tsukaima soundtrack and music cues, so although nothing but the OP/ED changes, I will give it a 9.  Story was weird - I mean, it's built around the characters' backgrounds, sure, and then we have the interesting development midway, but nothing is really fleshed out and the end of the season feels more like facing just another Robotnik boss after shoving Sonic through a million winding tubes in Hydrocity Zone. I wish the general war/story/etc could focus almost entirely on how it affects the characters because that's what ZnT is based around. This random plot in the third season doesn't really excite me at all and I'd rather endure the agonizing fanservice. This gets a 3.  Characters, right. So the main reason I did this review was the rant about the characters, so get ready. I seriously don't get why the makers of ZnT think it's all right to pull the same old romantic comedy junk without trying to develop the MAIN CHARACTERS one single bit. Yes, you can list all the things they've 'been through', but in the end, they're in the SAME GODDAMN PHASE that they were in at the end of Season 1. It's like they're daring each other - ""are you willing to go this far for me?"" or ""you don't like me that much do you?"" I mean...really? Being a Tsundere is one thing, but having chronic amnesia every episode is another. I thought I could endure it for season 3, but the first ten minutes of the very first episode almost literally made me spit out what I was drinking at that time because the fight that Louise and Saito had would be LUDICROUS to anybody else that had gone through what they had at the end of the second season. How does a life-changing event NOT lead to character development? ZnT is like the opposite of Clannad in the fact that almost all of the characters are completely inelastic except for maybe Agnes/Henrietta/Tabitha. In summary, I hated the fact that after three seasons, the ZnT crew were still not up to the task of plotting out a realistic relationship of any degree. The only thing that keeps me from dropping the character score down to a 3 is the Henrietta/Tabitha development, which could go so many ways, so good for us, and the Colbert coolness factor, kicking the character score up to a 7.  Overall, I still did enjoy it - ZnT is mainly the anime where you get some smiles from the awkward moments and ""aww""s from the cute moments and perhaps little else. I say perhaps because Saito's harem has ridiculous potential to not only enhance the viewer's experience but even the plot, both relationship and general, which gave me motivation to keep watching this thing. But anyways, watch this if you're a fan of ZnT, pray for a 4th season, and keep that suspension of disbelief locked in that cupboard.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Smithy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Smithy;6;"&ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; is the third season of the &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; anime, an adaptation of the currently still ongoing light novel series. As a third instalment, it is recommended to have seen the two previous seasons, else you may not fully comprehend some of the plot references or know the character's different pasts and backgrounds.  The first &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; series was quite enjoyable, while not particularly extraordinary it offered us a nice romantic comedy with an ill-tempered flat-chested tsundere female lead who was one of the characters that would help launch the recent popular movement where plenty of series each season feature that type of tsundere character. Many of those more well known tsundere female leading characters like Louise from &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; are voiced by Rie Kugimiya, a good seiyuu who plays those roles well but one has to wonder if she's not being typecast too much.  While I enjoyed &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; it definitely felt like the least good season of all three, an impression that is enhanced by the fact it seems more like some sort of intermission or a stepping stone meant to introduce new characters and new villains before embarking on a new large adventure.  In the previous season &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Futatsuki No Kishi&rdquo; we were treated to some more entertaining and gripping character development between Saito and Louise. That season also offered interesting developments and concepts about Halkeginia, where the story takes place.  &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; starts roughly where &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Futatsuki No Kishi&rdquo; left off, with our cast off on a search for a mysterious elf Saito and Guiche claim to have seen during the war with Albion. That elf turns out to be the kind, na&iuml;ve and ridiculously large breasted Tiffania. As one might expect Saito is easily enchanted by Tiffania's large bosom which leads to many jealous fits from Louise and oppai jokes abound in all of the following episodes. With Siesta already having served the role of the large breasted female who charms Saito with her bosom and makes Louise jealous with envy in the previous seasons, one could wonder if it was necessary to add another female character with an even larger chest to play on those typical jokes. Luckily they did not make Tiffania into another girl that is smitten for Saito, while she clings to Saito, it's clear she sees him as a friend. While still enough to enrage Louise, it never comes off as a true romantic pairing. As the opening sequence of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; suggest, this season does see another girl grow feelings for Saito, namely Tabitha.  Most episodes of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; we see Louise doubt herself, he lack of magical abilities and Saito's feelings for her. Arguably, this occurred in previous seasons as well, with several plots where Louise overcame her insecurities and was able to grow from there but by now it starts to become quite tiresome. Even after all that happened between them, Louise still doubts Saito's feelings and is unable to make her own emotions clear to him, which only worsens things between them. You could say Louise carries that burden of insecurity due to her inferior magical skills, but then you would also start to wonder how Saito can keep on coping with her like that. For the sake of decent storytelling they really should move on from there and focus on other characters their development or other traits in Saito and Louise. Personally I had increasing difficulty to really enjoy the series with Louise's incessant insecurities, it seems to drag on for too long and is becoming a bit much to bear.  Another new character we are introduced to is the happy-go-lucky blue haired Irukukwu, who is more than meets the eye. Alas she quickly comes off as mere fanservice to allow another moe large breasted girl to prance around in the series.  Princess Henrietta is featured less this season, nonetheless her character shows the most interesting and subtle evolutions. In the earlier episodes it is suggested she too may have romantic feelings for Saito, in part triggered due to the loneliness her position brings with it and her envy of Louise, who she sees as a strong, moral person that can take independent action by her own power, something she herself can not. That and some of the decisions she is forced to make, show a more realistic and three dimensional character in a series that else features rather generic thirteen in a dozen characters.  Most of the episodes are spent on Tiffania joining the cast, a new villain and his minion that come after Louise, and another few adventures. While there are enough events and action, it still feels like some sort of intermission chapter, meant to bridge the previous story and set up the next.  Animation by JC Staff throughout the series is decent, it never particularly excels or disappoints but is a solid average. More attention is spent on the cute girls and any fanservice scenes. The magic wielding action scenes in comparison, while still decent get less of a visual treat. Typical for the series are the vividly colored and crisply rendered characters, full of bright hair colors and outfits. There seems to be less effort in rendering the medieval backgrounds and world of Halkeginia on screen, which is a shame as such adventure filled series taking place in other realms can always excel by really immersing the viewer in their unique world.  The soundtrack of &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; is fair, it boasts an upbeat techno-pop opening song and generic tunes that accompany the series well but never really accentuate or help elevate it. Most goes largely unnoticed although the opening track manages to get you fired up and enthusiastic about the episode to come.  In all I would mostly recommend &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima: Princess No Rondo&rdquo; only to fans of the series and those who have seen the previous season and want to know what happens after those events. For the casual viewer, there are other series that would offer more laughs and fun. After this weak season, I ponder if I would pick up a fourth &ldquo;Zero No Tsukaima&rdquo; season if (or when) it were to come.";Mixed Feelings
2;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Pera;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pera;6;For me the third season of Zero no Tsukaima wasn't anything special. I loved both season 1 and 2, but the season was disappointing. The amount of girls that has joined Saito's harem has gotten out of controll. And it is frustrating watching.  Something that disappointed me most was that J.C. Staff seemed to be focusing on fan-service and the story didn't progress as much as it should done. And the story was very repetetiv. And the end of this season was far as saticfying as the two first season. If you love fan-service and some lesbian action you should enjoy this, but if you are like me that only gets embarrassed watching fan-service then this should be a problem.;Mixed Feelings
3;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;SmallTownN3rd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SmallTownN3rd;5;Full Disclosure: The first two Seasons of Zero no Tsukaima rank among my favorite anime of all time. But this season was a major letdown for me. First of all, the overall story and art maintain the same quality as the last two seasons, but somehow the characters and subplots have gotten considerably worse this season.  What follows is my personal opinion.  Let's start with the good: I liked the inclusion of Joseph, the new villain, what he want isn't clear, but that's the fun part! I have no objections to Tiffania, I like her personality and it becomes soon clear that she has no romantic feelings towards Saito. Her interactions with Saito and Louise are funny and she's a generally likable character, if a bit generic.  The Bad: In all honesty, Louise's treatment of Saito is getting old at this point. it's an overused gag for this series, and is only made worse when Siesta is involved. That brings me to Siesta. I really liked Siesta originally, she was a great balance to Louise, but I though that her interest in Saito would fade as Saito and Louise got closer. Unfortunately, Siesta has morphed into one of the MOST ANNOYING characters I have ever seen. She actively tries to interfere with Louise and Saito, and actively prevents any further development in their relationship. Her actions can only be defined as annoying. When Tiffania was introduced, I genuinely hoped that she would replace this eyesore. This season also tries to hard to become a Harem anime, but wasn't too sure how to do that. What resulted was no romantic development for most of the season. One does not simply switch genres.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Temere;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Temere;5;"Terrible tsundere and magical mishaps season 3. Have you ever had the feeling where you should have stopped a long time ago but you didn't and came crashing down from your peak? This is that crash.  The story for the first half seems to throw out the window what was learnt in previous seasons and go on its own trail for the good of doing nothing more than adding a new face to the already horrific harem. It does however have an evil working in the background that has been doing so for longer than the viewers realize and only now comes to light. More so even though the play of this series, it seems the villain isn't played out to their full game yet so they just filled in the rest of the season with more quickly blown over conflicts, cleverly concealed in what seems like a multi episode situation.  Art has more or less stayed same same as the previous season and thus not much can be noted on that front. However animation of the ""larger"" characters is a lot more fluid and carefree in their bounciness.  In the sound it lost the thrill of lengthy musical numbers and just became a lot of ambiance, whether that be guards chattering or a wagon strolling along. Which isn't bad, it shows they're doing something to fill is silence and for good reason too. The one scene of utter silence, when a character talks you can hear the background noise of the VA's lines and it's horrible!  Character development went absolutely nowhere. The end result is exactly the same as it started with, only with more characters added to the harem of the main character that makes you want punch the creators over how thick you can make a person. Seriously if that was an award, this anime wins hands down every time.  Enjoyment in the first 3 quarters of the season was dull. Same as season 1. However the last quarter seemed to up the ante a bit and get the viewer a little more interested. Even makes you laugh more than every episode prior. Then, much like the first season, when something interesting looks like it's going to happen, its all brushed over with in half an ep and you're left with a large sack of disappointment. Makes it worse when it's the last so called ""battle"" of the season.";Mixed Feelings
5;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Ukim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ukim;5;This is a story where there are two worlds,one is the world of normal humans and the other one's the world of magicians. A girl named Louise living in the world of magicians summoned a familiar (a pet) from the world of normal humans called Saito, by living together for long time they fell in love and bla bla bla...I think the some of this anime is copied from Harry Potter.  If you watch this anime, all you will get is a short tempered girl like one from Taradora and a foolish boy. Their words didn't go any further, from season 1 to season 3, all you will see is Louise get jealous when she finds that Saito thinks about another girl. What a boring story -.-. Actually there's just one thing I loved about this anime that is the fairy Tiffany and her voice ( same voice as Himegami Aisa, Ichinose Kotomi ,Oshizu ) aaa...gomen gomen, I got a little carried away .  Anyways, If you are suggested to watch this anime, say nai nai nai and instead go for Shakugan no Shana if by any chance you haven't watched it.. The story is a little bit more interesting than this one at least.  I've just finished all the seasons hoping it will get me some interesting stories,unfortunately I got too bored that I want to delete all the episodes.

6;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;iHateAnimeBro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iHateAnimeBro;6;Big expectations after a decent second season and big disappointment after watching Princesses no Rondo caused me to write this review.  Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo is probably the most boring season of this anime. After a really enjoyable first two seasons, we are getting the same, repeatable plot, that gets really weird as the season progresses and absolutely no character development. I really liked the Zero no Tsukaima series, because of the characters, but repeating over and over the same behaviors is just frustrating and gives nothing to the plot.  Basically: Louise is still a despotic princess, unhealthy jealous of the Saito, despite everything he did for her - absolutely no character development out there. On the other hand, Saito is still a philanderer. Every possible woman in range of like 100 miles from him is basically getting attached to him very easily, which pisses off Louise. You can get kinda annoyed by her actions. She's doing the same repeatable stuff to punish Saito. I get it, she's tsundere and all that stuff, but it is getting unenjoyable, because of her problematic personality. I know, it's harem anime, so it's expectable, but come on - because of that, the story doesn't progress at all. I kinda find Zero no Tsukaima more as an Ecchi/Romance, than Harem, as we clearly see Louise as Saito's main love interest.  I am honestly impressed by the fact that the creators managed to milk this story that much. Sometimes it can be felt like nothing more can be done with the plot, but somehow they did 4 seasons out of that.  The sound and art are decent, especially considering the fact that this anime has already 14 years. Fighting scenes are good. They are not really a big part of the series, but they are pretty enjoyable.  Overall, I think the proper rating for this season is something between 6 or 7. It follows the story from previous seasons pretty well, although repeatability is very much exhausting for the viewer. I can recommend season 3, only in case, you're pretty sure you'll watch Zero no Tsukaima F. There's no sense to watch this season if you're not a fan of the series. It's just not worth it. Even though I'm planning to rewatch the whole series, I'll make sure to skip season 3.;Mixed Feelings
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;apau;https://myanimelist.net/profile/apau;1;"Well, this review is filled with haterism, I tell you in advance, I absolutely LOVE Zero no Tsukaima, but the anime adaptation is pure shit, it's an insult to the original work, the light novels written by Yamaguchi Nobura.  I won't enter in much details, I'll only say that the story is invented, they're not adapt nothing of the novel, well, a bit maybe, but the whooooooooole anime of ZnT can be described in one word: Fanservice. Yeah, Fanservice, that and an invented story, and invented personality for the characters (Saito is my favourite main character! And in the anime he's just a fool boy! In the light novel he's a boy who fights for what he cares about, and have an adult mentality, in the anime he's just a fool teenager who loves to be surrounded by girls, how pathetic)  I will only say you one thing, if you're interested in the plot of Zero no Tsukaima: Read the novels, you can find them easily in baka-tsuki or in nyaa torrent, no worries, they're translated into english so you can read it without problems. J.C Staff it's an unique studio yes, all the good works that they touch are inevitably turned into pure shit.  Hope this review had help you to DON'T WATCH THIS SERIES and to READ THE LIGHT NOVELS XD  To finish the review I'll say that Zero no Tsukaima is my favourte light novel and my favourite ""otaku thing"" to somehow call it, and yeah, i think that Yamaguchi Nobura is the people most closely to God for me XD. They are really good and if you had watch the Zero no tsukaima's ""anime"" and was deceived for his plot, don't worry, it's completely different of the light novels so read it anyway.  Greetings.

1;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;--Kaori--;https://myanimelist.net/profile/--Kaori--;4;"This review assumes you have seen the first 2 seasons. This review may also reference some content in my reviews of this series. This review will contain spoilers.  The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses is S3 of this anime. While i got why the 2nd season was called what it was, here? S3 has no right to call itself by the name of Rondo. (A musical note fyi) and doesn't make sense. (Unless there is a hidden meaning like in the names for example) But putting that aside I have to say that is the LEAST of the problems with S3... first let me get this out of the way, this season does some things right, while doing MANY things wrong. Lets start out with what it does right.  1. Louise gets SOME character development (Emphasis on some btw) 2. They brought back Kirche & Tabitha (Charlotte) and made them MC (main characters) again, unlike in S2 where they were made side characters, sadly this isn't until the 2nd half so yeah... 3. They intro'd 2 new MC girls whom you'll prolly like, I did. They also intro'd a bunch of new side characters too whom imo, you could remove them from the anime and nothing would change much. 4. While I won't say, we get some surprises you may not see coming, really happy for one of those involving a certain character. 5. While the MC of S2 were made side characters in S3, they don't feel like we lost anything from them, well, that's how it feels to me anyway. 6. Reveals some plot points of whats been going on since S1 and also tries to tie up some of the plot points from S1 & S2 that were not finished.  All those points above sound super great right? Yeah, I'd say so, but even though i had a smile on my face a moment ago, I now have a frown because I know what am about to type... Here is what S3 botches... due note some spoilers will be mentioned, my apologies but I cannot do this review properly otherwise, however I will try to for as much as I can, still be vague, but some stuff i have to specifically point out what happens... hop out now or risk getting spoiled.  S3 picks up where S2 leaves off... except somehow time has passed (8 months though I forget if that's since the war started or since it ended as the Princess mentions one of the two) yet at the same time apparently not becus some plot points that one would discuss ASAP, rn't discussed either at all or till later... Yes for those who hated the war in S2 its done, over, ended off screen. So, DUMB. Like i myself didn't like some stuff that was just forced in S2, like the marriage (fyi, never mentioned here, but shown so it did happen) and how Saito became a murderer for the girl he loves which just felt so bad and forced in that scene where he asks that question. The flower wilting meaning he died yet somehow came back to life got explained here and imo, was done poorly, more so because Guiche also died in S2 (off screen, shown only through him telling what happened) and he made the same story of how he was saved as Saito did, yet Tiffa had to use her ring to save Saito and she isn't able to revive anymore because the ring lost its power. Based on what was said and shown, it seems like the ring was a 1 time use only item, so here we have a plot hole involving Guiche. I read a review that the anime is its own adaptation, while the LN are different, I can certainly believe it and that would explain the plot hole here as it was just teasing Tiffa in S2 which was still dumb. I dunno if the LN and anime are different or not, but I cna honestly say I have no intention of reading any book form of this series, though am not into books anyway but yeah, S3 really burned me here. Anyway, with that out of the way, let's get onto the other problems this season has... which are significantly worse than what i just wrote... before that, almost forgot, the flowers from their wedding are never shown or mentioned again besides maybe in a flash back.  So, in S1 you know I loved Saito's personality because he was respectful to women, shy, reserved, would look away if a woman was naked in front of him. S2 however made him gawk and stare at breasts, clothed or not. ... S3 however... *sigh* let's just turn him into a cheating bastard shall we? Oh? Let's also make him a bigger perv than he was in S2 while we're at it! :D ... >:( I lost my respect for Saito in S3, Louise called hima water flea in S3, but me? I call him scum. It was just Saito I lost respect for. The Princess (Henrietta) lost my respect too. In S2 she only forced herself on Saito to fool the guards searching for her, while she wore plebeian's clothing. In S3 I won't say what leads to this, and i GET and understand admiring someone and wanting to be like them and i also get loneliness BUT! You crossed a line Hime and worse, Saito also crossed a line and legit straight up cheated on Louise, where as before it was mostly just staring, this one went FAR too far. Oh and, Saito already cheated by fondling breasts out of lust when he was asked too and ofc they weren't Louise's breasts. Saito is scum, and an absolute idiot. His excuse in soem of these sitches is ""I may never get a chance too"" and I don't give a CRAP, I actually feel sorry for Louise in this season, mean while Saito gets near everything he deserves in this season, what scum. Side note. Though i harp on him and others/plot point I mention/am about to mention, keep in mind I don't hate the characters, I just hate how they were handled in S3 and so on.  As if that wasn't bad enough, there's not much plot in S3, certainly not interesting plot... and that plot doesn't even come up till episode 6 or 7... the ""plot"" b4 that is just setting up new charcters, not bothering to explain why Elvs are hated and feared and ofc, pointless fan service. There is some comedy here, including a whole episode almost of yuri (You'd understand why it can be funny if you saw it, the sitch that unfolds is well, something lol) but then we still get inappropriate stuff like asking if Tiffa's breasts are real just because they're ginormous, which elads to her asking if they're real herself (I dunno hun, you tell me, you should know best after all, they're your breasts ya know :P) and crap like that, is just so dumb. Tiffa is not an idiot btw. So that sitch shouldn't have happened.   Ultimately there's more I am sure i could mention including the last episode's BADLY tacted on and forced plot to try to make the episode more interesting and strengthen bonds which could've been handled and done MUCH better without that, but I'll end it here. S3 ultimately has some good points, has some character dev and so on, but the bad things I mentioned here and how it ruins some characters for me are why i have to rate The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses (S3) a 4.0 out of 10.0  Onto the specials and S4 for me, here is hoping for better...";Not Recommended
2;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;3;"Zero no Tsukaima: Princess no Rondo  The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses    I thought the quality of the series could hardly go down until I saw the third season. And what was my surprise here? I am actually impressed with myself for getting all 12 episodes through.  All seasons were already just below average, but this season was lacking in every area. Although the first two seasons had at least a solid conclusion, this was not the case here. Fan service has been turned up even further than before.  The point that scares me the most are probably the two protagonists at the time. Louise goes through no change and is the same melodramatic crying habit and chews the same thing over and over again. Even if you add sad music to it, the scene doesn't get more emotional. The characters have no real depth, nor are their dialogues well written. In the last episode alone they just talked in the sand for almost 4 minutes.  And then there is the protagonist Saito. Not only that he has already confessed his love to Louise 10-20 times, no. He lets every woman close to him running forward, starts everybody on the breasts, feels aroused as soon as any girl jumps in, and doesn't get rid of here. But in retrospect, he wonders why the two pro episodes have a relationship crash twice. And honestly, we used the scene in the Louis explosion or both of them bitch, we've already had countless times. Individuality is a foreign word here.  Certainly, as long as you reduce your demands FAR, you can be satisfied with the work. He also has one or the other highlight moment when I thought ""Ok, that was actually amusing / cleverly written"" but these moments are in a massive minority.    Story  No lie, the plot is still there. But it has been pushed into the background so fragmented. 90% of all scenes are balanced either by comedy or by fan service. The plot amounts to 5% per season. And one cannot speak of a great plot so far anyway. However, there is at least potential behind it.    Animation/pictures Nothing changed since season 2 and stayed mostly dull. You still go to great lengths to animate your breasts like excellent jelly. I can still see where the budget is going.  Characters  The new character is also superior to the protagonist duo. Basically, each supporting character is a much more interesting character than the two actual protagonists. And it was the same with the new elf. However, nothing has changed in terms of the characters, it's the same result as before.  Music  The Osts stayed the same. The intro was very weak this time. The first two seasons had a slightly more individual intro.    Conclusion  Below-average performance no matter how I look at it. You can watch this title, but you shouldn't have any expectations in characters, story, or romance.";Not Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo;MAND4;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MAND4;4;"Harem oriented anime have always been about a bunch of girls getting off on either one guy or few of them. The formula still remains same in Zero no Tsukaima series with also some action packed scenario. What I liked about Zero no Tsukaima is the light-hearted mood it took, lots of indecent jokes and just the hilarity of its own stupidity. However, the third season of the series went just too far ... with everything.  [STORY] 4  - Probably the worst story in the series is really explained in only later 4-5 episodes whilst the others are mainly fillers or some pretty unnecessary stuff. The thing about the story is that ... it's plain ridiculous, predictable and pretty annoying at the times. I won't talk much about it in fear that I might spoil something, but regardless, if you're a guy/girl who wants at least a decent story in an anime, run away from here. Seriously, run.  [ART] 6  - Art is actually fairly solid; it's the same as in previous seasons, but it does the job. Being probably the best aspect of the series, the fights are decently animated, the characters are different from one another, there are some beautiful sceneries and stuff like that. All in all, fairly decent.  [SOUND] 5  - Even though the opening and ending songs aren't much of my taste, they were quite good actually. Aside from that, there are some great background music which sometimes hits the mood and ... well sometimes it just fails. However, I found that the voices of the characters were immensely annoying (especially the one from Louise). I don't know whether it's just me or not, but it's like that.  [CHARACTERS] 4  - I'm really not sure what kind of characters to expect when you embark yourself upon a journey for watching harem anime, but this show fails a lot in that aspect. The relationship between Saito and Louise was all cute in the season 1, bearable in season 3, but it's plain RETARDED in season 3. It's obvious that they're just dragging the series out to their maximum proportions, but that brings such failures to the light that you can't overlook them even if you want to. The characters might appear even worse than they are due to the story they're set in. Saito's harem keeps growing even though it shouldn't, he still likes big breasts, kissing every single girl he can, but, somehow, he still loves Louise. There's a silver lining called ""sense"" when creating a harem story and characters, but this Anime simply forgot that. Yes, most of the luvy-duvy situations are plain stupid and senseless. And those ""cute moments"" where we finally expect some kind of closure are just a waste of time for my eyes. They're on it like 2s and then someone comes knocking on without any apparent reason. I really wanted to like the characters, I really did, because in previous seasons they were quite fun to watch. However, all that “servant-master” thing had worn out even during the second season. It’s just plain stupid in this one … Don’t get me wrong; there are some likeable characters. There are few great developments regarding other characters, but the focus of the show, Saito and Louise is just embarrassing (and not as in “embarrassing to watch because of the awkwardness” … just embarrassing). I doubt I’ll force myself to go through the final season anytime soon because it’ll take some time to wash things out from this season.  [ENJOYMENT] 4  -You’d think that anyone could enjoy harem anime simply because it’s funny, right? Well, you’re wrong. Compared to the first 2 seasons, this season of the anime is simply stupid. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I failed at it – THERE’S ALMOST NOTHING TO GIVE YOU JOY. Maybe there are few moments with half-elf, later on with a dragon and its master, but that’s about it. It’s the same all over again – Louise and Saito seem to finally get things started, girl pops in, she leans her breasts on Saito, Saito blushes, Louise treats him like a dog – all through the 12 episodes. You can enjoy that, let’s say, in the first 2 episodes, but considering that that formula has been done in the past 24 episodes of the show, it’s really … bad. Up to this season, Zero no Tsukaima was one of my favorite (if not the favorite since I haven’t watched that much harem shows) harem anime and I deeply regret watching this season. I’ve read many reviews here that state that this is the worst seasons in the entire run, and I really have to agree. I can’t see how this show can get any worse … third season lost all of the anime’s charm, that goofiness and light-hearted story, and simply overdid the formula that was already overdone.  [OVERALL] 4  -I wanted to give it a higher grade, I really did because there were some really fun moments in the show, but it was impossible. Those few moments can’t make up for the rest of the show. There are only like 2-3 characters that I actually like now in the show (and one of them is the bad guy …), story is plain stupid, characters come back to life like in DBZ (again …) and the anime follows the same stupid formula that it had during the first 24 episodes of it. God damn it … it really makes me angry. The show could’ve been far greater if they only changed some things. Like, at the end of the second season, they could’ve emphasized the fact that Saito and Louse ARE MARRIED, they could’ve created a show where one fights for the one he loves without her harming him more than any of his foes. Bah … maybe those are just my expectations, but I really can’t understand why are there so many harem anime if they all use one formula. Cute or not, this season is by far the worst of the series. You can simply skip it and move onto the fourth one – I hear it’s a bit better than this crap. Hopefully, it is.";Not Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;7;"5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Needs a third season  As a whole, Zero no Tsukaima&rsquo;s first season seems better than the second season. If I didn&rsquo;t like the first season, then that would mean that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t like the second season, right? Then how come I like the second season more than the first? Read on and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.  The story obviously needed work. I think the problem was that they tried to fit in many different storylines at a time. There was Saito and Louise&rsquo;s relationship, the ongoing war with Albion and there was Anies&rsquo; story too. Each story would have been potentially better as stand alones, especially Anies&rsquo; story, but a combination of the three isn&rsquo;t such a good idea. All three at once can be too much, maybe one or two at a time would&rsquo;ve been better.  Furthermore, I&rsquo;m really getting tired of the Louise and Saito&rsquo;s love hate comedy act. It became so predictable &ndash; Saito does something that displeases Louise (usually looking at other girls), Louise brings out her whip, screams &ldquo;You damned dog!&rdquo; and beats Saito up. It&rsquo;s been like that since the first season. The only improvement is that both are more aware of their status, that Louise is a noble while Saito is a plain commoner, which is why they&rsquo;re still not official as a couple.  I&rsquo;m a little disappointed that there was less screen time for the characters from the first season. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of Zero no Tsukaima fans were disappointed to see less of Kirche, Tabitha and Guiche. A good side effect from that was more exposure for Henrietta - She was barely seen in the first season so I didn&rsquo;t like her back then, but the second season showed a different side of her which made me like her more. I also like the new characters, Anies and Julio. Anies has such a cool personality and background, while Julio is such a hottie. He is so much better than Guiche.  Visually, it looks the same as the first season - same colors, same backgrounds. However, I do think the character design looks different. I think the character designs look more crisp, but at the same time, the drawing became more inconsistent. I&rsquo;m especially glad that there was less fanservice, or rather, more tolerable fanservice in the second season.  Another aspect that didn&rsquo;t change is the voice acting. I&rsquo;m glad it didn&rsquo;t change at all since a lot of my favorite and famous voice actors can be found in the cast list. Rie Kugimiya (Al in Fullmetal Alchemist, Shana in Shakugan no Shana) and Satoshi Hino (Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana, Kouichi in Kimikiss) are still Louise and Saito. There&rsquo;s also Ayako Kawasumi (Ruriko in Gate Keepers, Ohno in Genshiken) as Henrietta, Yui Horie (Eri in School Rumble, Hanyuu in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai) as Siesta and Takahiro Sakurai (Shun in Gatekeepers, Cloud in Final Fantasy: Advent Children) as Guiche.  I also like the music. In fact, I think the music is better this time around. In the first season, the songs were too cutesy, but in the second season, the songs were more striking and had better quality. I really like &ldquo;I say yes&rdquo; by Ichiko, which is the OP. It&rsquo;s so different from all the other Ichiko songs I&rsquo;ve heard. I think it has more power and emotion to it, which makes it so special.  Despite of its many shortcomings, I still like it better than the first season. I thought it was more funny and entertaining, I like the new characters, and I&rsquo;m especially glad that there was less fanservice this time around. However, the main reason why I like the second season more than the first is potential. I thought the second season had more potential than the first, and I want to see that potential in a third season.";Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Nightships;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nightships;7;"As a sequel to the highly entertaining Zero no Tsukaima, I had expected a continuation of the first season with more fleshed out stories, more character development, and just overall better material than what Futatsuki no Kishi provided. Don't get me wrong, the second season doesn't fail, it still provides a decent story with plenty of comedy and lplenty of fan service to back it up, but what Futatsuki mainly lacks is consistency. I feel as though Futatsuki could have stood alone as an entirely different series, as it seems as though if the characters were placed in a situation where they met their first season counterparts, they would barely recognize themselves.  Story: 5 While I'd recommend watching the first season first (for obvious reasons), I think that really, it wouldn't be too hard to just pick up from here and start watching. This is one of the main problems involving the story as I mentioned in the introduction.  I'm almost convinced that in the Zero no Tsukaima world this time around, having boobs or liking them makes you dumb, as the only sane person in the anime for the second season seems to be Louise. Furthermore, Louise and Saito must be the most beautiful couple to ever grace their land, as every busty female character seems to go after Saito, and the handsome male characters after Louise. For every episode, be prepared to find Saito coming into contact with the cleavage of at least one female member of the cast.  The story doesn't actually get serious until the last two episodes, where it feels as though these last few ones could pass off as a continuation of the first season. In fact, I'd say that this is really the only saving grace for the story, and although the ending invokes an awfully convenient deus ex machina to wrap things up, the last episode as a whole was pretty moving and even made me a bit teary-eyed.  The second season more or less has transformed the series into a pure harem anime relying on fan service and fan of the first season to keep viewers, and for this genre, it does well. However, I feel that since that the first season didn't quite have this degree of females throwing their naked selves at Saito, that it didn't really fit in terms of the story.  At times, it is as though the story contorts itself in ways just to have Saito in a situation with a girl such that if he was walked in upon, it would look really bad, and of course, who but Louise should always walk in on these times. At least during the episodes, the story does progress some, saving it from becoming merely a mindless harem/ecchi anime. It is unfortunate that the story is somewhat weak and ending lacks any real conclusion, but it is good (I hope) that a third season is in the works. I should mention that at least the humor in the series isn't too bad, and also, like the first time around, the story is really predictable, but still fun to watch regardless.  Art: 8 This series contains some of my favorite character designs of any anime, especially Louise, who is just adorable; the female designs cater perfectly to those watching for fan service, and the male characters are handsome, as well. Some rather impressive effects and animations are pulled off during the series, especially regarding spells (with the exception of Void Magic). The coloring of the characters is rather pleasant to look at, and the rosy cheeks of many of the embarrassed females (particularly Louise) give off an adorable effect. Overall, I can't say the art is among the most picturesque I've seen, but it certainly doesn't fail to impress.  Sound: 8 I personally liked the very beginning part of the opening song, but after that, it just turns into your standard j-pop number, not particularly bad, but it doesn't really stand out either. Also, it maintain what they did in the first season in adding sound effects to the OP for the last episode.  I'm sure that many people will find the ED to be ridiculously annoying, but I have to say that I thought it was adorable and very fitting (of course, since the OP and ED were made for the series, but that aside). It is basically the perfect embodiment of what the first ten episodes will be like.  Besides the OP and ED, the music wasn't too bad overall, and fit in pretty well with the respective scenes they were in. Additionally, the voice acting definitely wasn't too shabby, either, with an experienced cast voicing many of the characters.  Character: 7 This is perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks of the second season. It feels as though nearly all of the female cast hit their heads on something hard and now have an unquenchable desire to make Saito the object of their affection. Perhaps some of the new transitions are understandable, such as Siesta's newfound boldness, as it was seen briefly surfacing in the last season, yet instances like Episode 6 involving Henrietta are just plain ridiculous and seem forced. It is fortunate that Louise maintains her character, however, Saito seems to have changed from the average (slightly more than average in terms of bravery though) teenager whisked from his home to a standard anime pervert who drools at every sight of cleavage he gets despite the fact that he is (somewhat unofficially) together with Louise. Thankfully, he manages to regain his old self in the last few episodes but it's rather distracting having this &quot;new&quot; Saito prancing around. It seems as though the characters have actually regressed, rather than grown and developed like they should.  The budding relationship between Louise and Saito is sweet and fun to watch, although it's greatly stunted by the rough humor that is placed into nearly every episode, and doesn't really make any real leaps or bounds until the last few episodes, although there are a few scenes earlier on that are rather...risque, almost.  It's nice that they added new characters, but most aren't properly developed, and furthermore, that means less of the characters that you've already come to know from the first season. They gave back stories to many of the characters, such as Tabitha, and it's a shame that they didn't build on them more. The one exception would be the story surrounding Colbert-sensei, but I won't go into details as to avoid spoilers.  In summary, it's all your favorite characters from the first time around (plus a few new ones), just a bit more comical and perhaps perverted than before.  Enjoyment: 7 More or less, I found that my enjoyment of this anime was hindered by the excessive fan service and it's new extreme harem feel it had that contrasted with the first season. If I had watched Futatsuki no Kishi for it being a harem, I'm sure I would have loved it, however, I was hoping for more of the goodness that comprised of the first season, and was rather letdown.  Overall: 7 By the end, I'd have to say that the only reason I kept watching was for Louise, and in hopes that the third season will be better. If you've viewed the first season and liked it, then you should definitely check out the second season; if you haven't seen the first season yet, then I'd recommend it to you. The second season doesn't quite live up to it predecessor, but it's not too bad in whole. Just don't get your hopes too high up. Also, as a harem, it succeeds with flying colors.

2;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;reb3llist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reb3llist;8;"Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi (ZnT2 for short) is a sequel to the adapted anime Zero no Tsukaima and deals with their stories right after the first season's ending.  ZnT and ZnT2, for me, is generally a breather away from the harsher animes and just to have fun with (similar to how I treat Hayate no Gotoku!) but the 2nd season has improved greatly in terms of drama and, well.. deteriorated in some departments  This season is actually good but the respectable male lead, Hiraga Saito, has gone from manly guy to pervert, I mean seriously, this spoils a whole lot of everything. Whenever huge boobs show up, he MUST notice it. Hell I don't even remember being such a perverted guy when I was his age, I know he's a healthy boy but MUST HE NOTICE EVERY BREAST IN THE WHOLE WORLD? The second thing, Agnes, a new character, almost literally took half the season away from us with her arc, although it ended in a grand fashion that started a chain of other dramatic things.  Let's get on to the real thing:  Story  Well, in this review, I am mostly going to compare this season with last season and maybe some other shows too but I won't be comparing it to the higher standards.  The story is pretty average, the first arc, a girl has village burned, wants revenge, yawn. Its ending was rather epic win though, I have to admit. Second arc is about the war, this arc is quite a bit more awesome because of everything there.  There is pretty much nothing wrong at all with the story. I brief you no more, no less for it is pretty much that. The whole thing with Agnes, although pretty interesting, is not totally that great compared to the 2nd half. Seriously, I was thinking of giving this season a 6/10 with that arc but the 2nd arc totally turned it around for me, it was like the impact player in a football match that won the match for the team and that half did it.  There was also another aspect I liked from the series. The fact that the character development of the main pairing didn't take a full 2 seasons (AHEM Shakugan no Shana) really pleased me. Or maybe that was the novel itself. Either way it's still a contributing factor but that keeps the score at average.  6.4/10  Characters  I have always loved Hiraga Saito for his manly acts and healthy teenager behaviours because well, we don't get a lot of that in Animes. He's unique, you can say. For example, you can see he's not that generic when you see someone like Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana (although he isn't totally generic, you get the point) or some other wussy from some other Animes (although Yuuji is actually not a wussy after he got used to life with Shana)  Aside from the last badass episode that made him King Badass alone in the series, he hasn't gone all too badass himself.  Hiraga Saito has been, as I've hinted, toned down to a perverted badass (but not those bad people types who raep women) who cannot live life without huge boobies dangling around his life in every corner. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will encounter breast hams at every corner of the street. If you are Hiraga Saito, you are Dr. Boobs - no, you are Mr. Boobs. If you are Hiraga Saito, you will be beaten/exploded to death by over-used slapstick stuff from Louise.  Alright Louise is definitely a tsundere. I might be biased because I kinda like tsunderes when they get really dere dere (e.g Taiga from Toradora!) but trouble is she's almost tsun 80% of the time. The 20% of dere-ness are nice moments but then 10% of the tsun will come out from the aftermath of the dere which results in over-used slapstick which is getting frustrating sometimes. There are people who love this and I say to you,""DAT WAS FUNNAY LOL but please, the internet is serious business. I know you're joking with me >_>""  During the most dramatic episode I've ever watched in the series (which I cried at, yea lol I'm a sissy and I'm a guy), after the sweet moment, for no reason at all, Hiraga Saito said something about huge boobs. What was the result? Does he ever EVER learn? Louise makes him explode and we see another slapstick that ruins the mood YET AGAIN. Brilliant directing [/sarcasm]. The slapstick immediately reverted me from butthurt sissy mode to normal, a bit pissed mode. It had such a huge effect but they totally ruined it by including another routine slapstick crap. How charming.  There are also some absurd changes. Siesta, from a good and like-able girl, has gone to a camera-whore, almost literally. She is not afraid to walk around in a bunny suit with cleavage in front of Saito because, oh, you know, it's for Saito and she's convinced slut = win.  The queen is still the same like-able queen. She hasn't changed much and all her actions in this season has not made me note of anything different at all. She's still the same queen in my opinion, the only time Henrietta went totally ballistics from her original character was in her ploy to draw out an enemy and that was actually justified so it wasn't too unexplainable to me (aside from, oh.. you'll see).  Then new characters Julio and Agnes. Julio, to me, is one of my favourite types of stereotyped characters. He's the cool-headed nice guy who knows everything. He knows what and what not to do and is knowledgeable in the arts of teasing too. In a sense, you can compare him to the cool guys from other romance Animes you know (e.g Ikuto from Shugo Chara, Nomiya from Honey & Clover) but he generally radiates more friendly aura than most of them.  Agnes however, is a different case. I didn't care much about her. Oh sure if she was more beautiful I'd pity her more but that still didn't justify the ridiculous amount of screentime her repetitive story got. I know it's impressive and all that your village got burned and shitloads of revenge is stuck in your mind but why take more than half a season? The arc's ending was awesome though, Agnes in my opinion is not really needed, she comes off as someone you don't even care about at the end of the day.  Then previously focused-on characters like Kirche and Tabitha are left out a lot more with the long arc although they were both regulars in the first season, that's a real pity given that Kirche was definitely a fine favourite of mine. It's also a pity imagining Tabitha's seiyuu going through all the trouble as going to the recording sessions and only to record approximately 3 lines an episode (and I'm being generous here).  The quality went more down-hill than it went up-hill for me, 7/10  Art & Music  The art is still very much the same, Shakugan no Shana-esque maybe, since the whole cast does seem Shana-like and even the animations too. The art is OK and deserves a pat on the back for fine consistency.  The music is also well done. I am planning to get the OST sometime later but honestly, I still find SnS and Toradora!'s OST to be better (I'm only using those 2 animes because they are both tsundere-themed and feature Rie Kugimiya as well). The music was well-suited for everything. From the silly and funny moments, to the overtly-over-over-over-over-used slapstick to the saddening dramatic moments, it blended well. Usually it takes good emotional music to make me cry with a scene and this Anime is probably the 2nd one in my book. Maybe that's because I watched the whole thing in one go and maybe because I don't really like watching fully romantic stuff (e.g La Corda Passo D'oro).  The voice acting was not bad. Kugimiya Rie has lived up again to her title of ""Queen of Tsundere"" as her voice brings in the adjectives pampered and childish into mind, just like how Louise acts. Although I didn't like Yuuji's voice in SnS (who has the same voice actor with Saito, if you haven't a clue) too much when he's hurt and doing stuff (you know, the cracks and the heaves and the hos and the breathing in breathing out when he's shouting and/or yelling) but Saito's voice is really well done. No fault there. Other voices didn't bother me either. Excellent ones in my opinion are Henrietta, Colbert, Kirche, Julio, Siesta and probably her cousin.  8/10  Direction & Enjoyment  Now here lies some problems:  I have no goddamn idea.  What the hell is up with the boobies.  I mean seriously. I see boobies everyday and I don't go around staring at them perversely every single day of my life. That is how Saito has degraded into, your everyday huge-boob-lover. I cannot get what the hell is the obsession with boobs that this guy has. I know he's a healthy kid, but please know more shame, what the hell are you doing staring boob after boob as if you're on a relentless task of seeing every big boob you will ever encounter in your life?  And what is the after-effect of this boobspotting sport you ask? Oh I don't know, ANOTHER ROUND OF OVER-USED SLAPSTICK MAYBE? This ruins the mood. Especially in some episodes when Louise went dere and they had a nice couple moment with each other, boobs are mentioned or something akin to that and boy oh boy, here comes the wonderful slapstick. Go to hell slapstick, it was kinda funny the first time but not the 300th time (for example, in season 1 episode 9 where she drank the love potion, there was slapstick at the end, I could live with that, it was reasonable, what is NOT reasonable is the f-ing ridiculous reasons she would beat him up for). Some people love this, I don't get it, the joke's on me huh?  The drama is also very good ever since the end of the first arc. It was especially in its prime at the grand finale (that was the one that made me cry). The other ending of the first arc was also really sad to me. The new-found dramatic points in this season, when compared to the first season's drama, is a great improvement.  The relationship though, is progressing at a good pace but in some cases almost totally ruined by, again, you must be bored of hearing this from me, the ""I has a boobs trauma because I has a flat chest and Saito is a boob fetish LOL!"" slapstick. Sigh, so low.  Almost every time, the direction turns to huge tits. I don't get what's so funny about huge tits being shoved around my screen the whole day. I know tits are great, tits are fun but STOP SHOWING ME TITS PLEASE BECAUSE I WANT ANIME, NOT TITS. If I were looking for tits I'd go to a bar or something. Hell even Shakugan no Shana never focuses that much on Yoshida's TITS, except for Shana-tan Returns because, well, it is a PARODY so they focused on her ridiculous boobs but in the normal episodes, her tits are not mentioned a million times. The first season had a number of tit-savoury mentions but those weren't that bad. The director must've looked at the storyboard and said,""Hey! WRITER! WE NEED MORE TITS DAMMIT! ANIMES AREN'T MADE WITHOUT TITS YOU KNOW! What the hell is anime without TITS GODDAMIT? Oh I know, stinker anime!"" Go figure.  You director, must have a huge boob fetish to make the series become a boob-fanatic festival. You know you could just go to those sites and quench your thirst but don't put tit after tits up the screen and make even worse slapstick jokes.  8/10  Overall: 7.7/10 (not average)  If you've liked the 1st season and you like drama, the last half of the season will totally redeem everything you've watched in the first half but just watch the whole thing because it's not really itself without watching the whole thing.  I know lots of people are saying the 2nd season is far less superior than the 1st season but the last half of this was worth the score because I love teh drama :)  In any case, if you love the drama in season 1, want more Saito x Louise-ness, totally gay for boobs and over-used slapstick, you will definitely like (or maybe love) this season, depending on your preference because some people think the first half was too much crap for the other half to handle and blah blah blah so who knows, it's pretty much preference. I recommend you try it first. I only love the last half of season 2 more than season 1 in general because of all the built-up drama but the score suffers from the immediate boring old slapstick right after the effective drama. Meh -_-  On the other hand, if you hate every Tsundere character on the face of the Earth, hate season 1, hate drama, hate the love-hate relationships of the couple (Saito and Louise), totally despise slapstick and are traumatic of huge, surreal and impossible boobies and the booby-watchers, then you will hate this season 'till you cringe  tl;dr 1st review kthxbai!";Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;sugarplumfairy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sugarplumfairy;7;This isnt a review as such, but a comparison to the first season (as this is what i wanted to see when i was looking whether to watch the second season or not)  well the advantages is that its a continuation of the anime - so you see the characters again, more action, romance etc. theres also more characters (which are more your confidence determined rock solid women), you find out secrets, and the princesses character is developed more. i found the animation more crisp in the second series as well. the storyline at the end was more emotional and more action in the second season as well. it did still continue the good humour, storyline and humour too.  however, there were many set backs. firstly the humour was much more ecchi. (though that could be an advantage for some). some acts got a bit tiresome after a while (mainly the constant whipping of saito). also i thought the characters changed slightly - particularly saito, who - in the first season - was your average kind, lovable character who's in love, changes to become quite perverted in the second season to the extent of annoyance, and start to question whether he really loves louise or not. on the other hand he becomes more serious at the end which makes up for it. another major change is siesta - the once gentle, kind, shy servant girl now becomes the determined rival to saito's love, which is quite annoying. also, some characters in the 1st season - tabitha and kirche especially, are hardly mentioned. their character (as well as louise) is hardly developed compared to the first season. personally the storyline was was worse than the first series - though that is expected as its hard to develop after youve had the good old girl meets boy and falls in love. the romance is still there, and does develop slightly, but is not focused on much (except towards the end), instead there are 2 other arcs, which seemed a bit too much to juggle in the one series. the overall storyline was quite predictable, apart from the end (which was pretty good and made up for the past). the action was more guns and machines centred rather than magic, and rather than school-based, it is battle-based. (though that again, could be an advantage)  overall, the second series was pretty good, though it lacked ever-so-slightly slightly compared to the first season.;Recommended
4;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Tekky99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tekky99;7;"Length: 12 episodes Original Airdates: 7/07-9/07 Demographic: Seinen Genres: Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Ecchi, Romance, Supernatural WARNING: Contains several HIGHLY sexually suggestive moments.... though no nudity.  Plot Synopsis This sequel is a continuation of the previous season, not long after the war. Louise and Saito seemingly getting along now since she knows that he had given up his only chance to return to Tokyo for her. The story continues as Louise begins to use Void Magic from a mysterious secret book she had recieved from her majesty Henrietta, while a new villain has appeared in town causing trouble. (From Anime News Network)  Personal Opinion This is another one of those &quot;shift in quality at middle&quot; animes. Though this time the shift was HUGE... Okay so first thing first... the cons... and the biggest one of them all... THEY CHANGED THE EFFING CHARACTER PERSONALITIES!!! I mean in the first season... Saito was the typical lovable loser... he rarely did anything to make us not like him... This season... it's all different.. he's a HUGE perv. As for the other personality change, that would be Siesta... she goes from a good friend to the object of jealousy. Also other characters lose their spotlight, especially Tabitha. The other con that i'll mention is the objectionable scenes. In the 4th episode there was moment towards teh end that could be described as &quot;hentai with clothes on&quot;. Again this much ecchi elements weren't in the first season And more of personal peeve... the relationship btw Louise and Saito doesn't seem to advance AT ALL!!! Now for the pros When the show got into the 2nd half of the season... it became REALLY good. It added drama elements and action. In fact episodes 7-9 had probably one of the best arcs i've ever scene. The finale was also quite good... quite epic and moving.  I'll still be watching the 3rd season... hopefully it'll be more like the 2nd half of this season...  So overall.. 1st half - 5/10 2nd half - 9/10 leading to... 7/10  Similar to... Same list as first season";Recommended
5;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Temere;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Temere;7;Cheers! To a seconds season with more explosions than a Michel Bay movie! No but seriously that school should invest in bomb suits…  The story of the second season seems to be a lot more aimed at character development under the impending situations that is picked up where season 1 left off. Despite all that’s going on, there still seems to be a lot of times you’re not sure if you’re watching a bad harem, magical romance or cringe worthy comedy. However within all this, it was much better paced out than its prequel even so, there are the occasional parts that a very easily predicted  The art and styles at first glance don’t seems to have changed much. But upon closer inspection background and scenery seem to be a lot better than simple cell shaded pigments that look like an elementary schoolers painting. Effects on magic usage in some elements have not changed where others, namely fire and… explosive void failures, have been given a bit of love in the effects boosting.  Music took the leap of a lifetime and it seems to have paid off. There is so much more original music in this than its predecessor and its very pleasing to note. The action episodes lasting over the space of a few episodes each instead of 3 in 4 episodes, allows us to take in a better lot of musical pieces at length instead of being given a large chunk of half minute sample sounds.  Character development is a lot more in depth in this season with a few new faces and significantly more family back story for both new and old characters alike. You will come to laugh, cry and even detest some returning characters while their pasts get explored more and new characters that have a deeper bond, with the older ones, than you may think.  Overall enjoyment was very off on at the start but almost brought me to tears in its finale… Only to have it ruined by an incredibly stupid ending. Was it supposed to be comedic? Because it backfired, majorly. Anyway, throughout the 12 episodes, it will make you laugh, it will make you cringe and it will make you wonder how stupid can the writers make a character. Even still, it was a major step up from season 1;Recommended
6;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;VelocityWaffles;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VelocityWaffles;9;Honestly I love the ZnT series, there's just something about it, I can tell it wasn't some rushed second season, they actually sat down and planned it. What I liked most was that they found a way to continue the plot in a way that continued the first one with the war, I'm just glad they didn't make a whole new story that came from nowhere which can be an easy mistake to make and people should really apreciate that more. Some people like to nit pick at it and complain but thats just because they want to have something to whine about, if one things fixed then something else is wrong, just be happy we're getting more seasons. The ending really got to me, I loved seeing them finally admit how much they really care for each other, and what saito did (not spoiling it) almost made me and a lot of other people cry. while there are some smaller stories within the story going on I say just use your brain, a lot of people wanted depth now there's a little and they can't handle it, make up your minds. ZnT is great for everyone if you want laughs prepare to fall over rofl-ing, if you want a good story this one is well thought out, and if you want characters that are almost real then you're definately in the right place. Idc if there are animes with similar plots out there because this one does it right, time and effort were put into it, so sit back and just go along for the ride. btw stop complaining about louise whipping saito, it has never failed to make me laugh and I find it almost a must along with blowing him up.;Recommended
7;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Saruwatari-san;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saruwatari-san;8;To be honest , i was quite shock at how well the second season is . Even though i hate when the fan service events pop up because i felt like these fan service on Zero no Tsukaima always happen like every 5 minutes . I don't hate fan service . What i hate is how many times does these fan service always shows up . If it were like 4-5 times , i wouldn't mind . Although this fan service stop a bit after a bit of episodes . Anyway , back to the review .  Story:8 The story on the second season tells us after the events that took place on the first season . Louise now know that Saito have given up on coming back to his own world . Not long after that , Louise receive a message from the queen herself about the war with Albion . New villains . New comrades . More fan service . More cute adorable female characters . What could go wrong ehh ? Anyway , compared to the first season , this one improved a bit on the story plot .  Art:8 The arts and animation are the same as before . Does have some beautiful animation . Again , the arts for the character here does have some flaw that i wish they will improved it on the next one .  Sound:9 Same voice actor and actress . The OP and ED were nice . I like the OP better because it have this thrill effect when i hear it .  Character:8 The characters from before were shown less on this time . I guess they trying to focus on some new characters maybe . Not that i mind or hate or anything . Now , they presented us with some new characters like Louise sisters , Cattleya and Eleanor . Cattleya was the nice sister type while Eleanor was the 'Not gonna show my true feelings' sister . Basically , it means what she did may seems harsh , but she just want to protect her sister . You will understand when you watch this . Anyways , there are a lot of new characters here but the one that did make me cry because how well it was made is gotta be Jean Colbert . His death was enough to make me feels sorry for him although he was only as a secondary character . The characters plot was fine and all .  Enjoyment:9 I enjoy this anime just fine . From the first till the last episodes . The comedy here are as always funny . With how stubborn Saito is with his huge boobs problem . Not to mention how many times did Louise smack him , electrocute him , whip him , you name it . Saito just doesn't learn the point here . Never mess with Louise . Like i said , more fan service , a lot of funny events , does have some crying moments and an epic battle at the last episodes .  Overall:8 Does have a lot of improvement than the last one which i gotta give them a credit for doing that . If you love the first season of Zero no Tsukaima , then you will love this one without a doubt .;Recommended
8;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Fuu-nyon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fuu-nyon;8;Well for starters let me just say that I've just recently gotten into watching anime. As a 17 year old boy, I never really figured that this show would appeal to me. In fact, when I listed the few that I had watched and liked people tried to dissuade me from this genre.  I ended up watching it after marathon watching TTGL and Code Geass for the first time, and then feeling really depressed at the end of both of them. I wanted something silly yet enjoyable and I figured I would give this a try.  At the beginning of season one I was like... lame. I can't stand Harry Potter (bear with me, I'm not saying its a Harry Potter knock off), so I was kind of put off by the whole magic school thing. But I stuck through it and ended up watching the whole first season in two sittings. After the first few episodes the characters start to develop a little more, as well as the story. By the end of season one I was watching it for the story more than the comedy.  But enough about season one. ZnT: FnK took what the original season did with the story and made it 10x more thrilling and enjoyable. They kept the silliness exactly where I wanted it the whole time.  I'm not ashamed to say this: by the end of FnK I was extremely emotionally invested in this shenanigan fest. Obviously I don't want to give anything away, but the end of this season had me on the edge of my seat, obviously not in a way Code Geass did, but in a less serious but just as enjoyable roller-coaster ride.  Anyways, I know nobody probably reads reviews for this season, because you'll only be watching it if you saw the first season and liked it, but in my opinion this one blasted the first out of the water.  Now I'm conflicted though... how am I supposed to enjoy season 3 knowing its the last one?;Recommended
9;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;DubAwesome;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DubAwesome;10;"Season in mainly about the war between Albion and Tristain. But don't understand this wrong, Its not ALL war. Because there is Comedy in this anime (LOTS OF IT) and it also has its serious and intense moments. And some moments were you just think WTF! this anime has it all! An amazing story, good art, and most importantly, well something That I feel is important that a lot of animes lack, Deaths of characters that you just love. Now dont get me wrong, I'm not for characters dying, but it gets all too boring when you can predict what happens in an anime. and this is not one of those animes. which is exactly why I love it so much.  The Genres of this anime or season are; : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Ecchi, Fantasy, Magic, Romance, School life and of course Harem! Now that is a lot of genres. and usually I dislike having many genres in an anime especially because it confuses me quite often, its understandable for animes which have a lot of episodes like Naruto. But for a 12 episode anime to fit this much in one season its really hard to do, or better yet, its hard to make it work well. But despite all that this anime did a really good job.  Next im going to be talking about the soundtracks and the music, Im not sure about all of you, But this is something for me that is really important in any anime. If the music is not good and cant suit a certain mood, I probably wont watch the anime, Unless the story has me blown away. Music is what adds emotions to not only animes but also movies, This anime did a very good job on soundtracks and how they used them So in the field of Soundtracks and Music I give this anime a 9/10 The reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because my mind functions a little different and I think other instruments could have been used. I will show you guys an example of what I mean by that. So I will take a soundtrack that is the same piece, but is played with a different tempo and different instrument, Some of you might know this soundtrack.  Here is the First Sound track: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zj4VQy9k30  And Here is the Second: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKYquaCRfIg  So I hope you understood what I meant by that. Moving on.  Next is my perspective on art. The artwork on this anime was all too good, It could have been better, But in my opinion it could have ruined some parts in this anime, so staying in between cartoon and a little more than mid realistic was a good choice so Artwork gets a 10/10  Next I want to mention the characters. While watching this anime I felt like there are a few characters that should not have been added. or at least should have had a different attitude to what they have. But progressing further into the anime, I did not feel this way any more, mainly because I got used to it, and also because I started thinking that this anime would be a little suckish if they were not there. Characters get 9/10  Next will be the enjoyment: I feel that this is an anime that anyone will enjoy, while watching this anime I did not once look away to play with my rubix cube, or start kinda drawing on my desk or the nearest piece of paper like I would usually do, It was interesting and enjoyable throughout, there was never any boring moments at all So enjoyment also gets 10/10  Lastly I would like to mention the actual story, There has not been a single anime that has less than 26 episodes in one season which is this breath taking. This anime is absolutely amazing and I cant believe that I hesitated to watch it for almost a whole year now. Absolutely incredible, there is not a single word which can defy how amazing this anime really is, Because it truly is amazing! 10/10  And overall rating for this anime is a 10/10";Recommended
10;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;TrappiTurtle;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TrappiTurtle;8;"I was reluctant to watch this series. It was on my to watch list for about a year. But tonight i've watched the first two seasons through and through and now i'm telling myself that i should have watched this so much sooner.  The story really reminds me of fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. And in a lot of ways it is. To simplify, Zero no Tsukaima is like an opposite of fullmetal. Where fma had a lot of action and little romance, this has a similar story that is heavy on the romance and light on the actual action. And there's a purpose for this. Fma most likely had a budget 2 maybe 3 times as big as the producers here. Thus we don't get a masterpiece like fma but it's still a really well done anime.  But i do have some gripes with this show, especially with this season. It seems like most of the action at the end was really seriously cut off. The stuff you do see it pretty awesome, 1 v. 70,000, he kicks ass. But like i said before, the producers were probably like, ""ok guys, this is really getting pricey, wrap it up!"" but you know...in japanese.  Another small small gripe i have, is that i wish they would use the familiars a bit more like in a battle or something. The only ones we really see are the dragons...and the others are more of a plot device. And whatever happened to the fat kid with the owl...did he die?  Anyways, i think this is an anime definitely worth looking into if you're into romance with a good story.";Recommended

12;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;animeBee1ver;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animeBee1ver;7;1st season was better.  No matter how good improvement the animation of this season is, the story must take precedence.  The characters became a bit perverted, from my notice, compared to the 1st season. the hero tries advances to girls that would haven't been done in the previous season. the heroine blushes to some handsome character, suddenly helpless against stranger's advances. both demeans the encounter, moments and experience they had on season 1.  though the comical side is still good, the characters were changed if not destroyed for the sake of the story. If they were to remain unchanged, it is apparent they take up an advance in their relationship, the producers unwilling to take for the continuation of this franchise.  In this season, more battles, inferred slaughters, introductions to viscous demented characters, but always in the end, did not go out of bounds from the usual kind of endings in each story, still the same as the first season in this regard.  ps. sometimes, less is more, and more doesn't always mean less.

13;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;CookiesOnFridays;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CookiesOnFridays;7;"Season 1: 6/10  The continuation of the 'Familiar of Zero' series, 'Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi' fairs slightly better than the first season in some aspects, but not by much. The previous season had some problems with one of the said problems being an uninteresting story. Another problem to address from the previous season would be the uninteresting characters, however this second season makes an attempt to spice up the story, and it does itself some justice...  Story: 6/10 Much like the first season, the second season of the 'Familiar of Zero' series doesn't really have much of a exciting story. The story is still very cliched and predictable. The last episode of this season was a little like that of the first season, which lead to me saying, ""Of course."" However to the shows credit, it did attempt to spice up the story by introducing a few new characters. One of these said new characters is named Agnes, a knight for Henrietta; the queen of Tristan. The show reveals that Agnes had a terrible past and is looking to seek revenge against the person that made her endure that terrible past. This leads to one of the shows major fixes, which is character development.  Character: 7/10 If anything, the second season of the show revolves around the character development between some of the characters such as Saito x Louise, and Agnes. Agnes wasn't that bad of a character, if anything she was probably the most memorable supporting character out of all of the other side characters. This is because the show teaches us about her past and what motivates her to achieve revenge. But besides Agnes, what's REALLY refreshing about this second season is the development of the relationship between Louise and Saito. Despite this relationship building being mostly in episodes 4, 10, 11, and 12 of this season, it was refreshing enough. The love-hate humor is still there, but because of the development between Louise and Saito, it made the humor more enjoyable because it makes the person watching this think, ""She really likes him, and she cares for him."" and vice versa with Saito.  Art: 7/10 The art factor of the season didn't change all that much, there just wasn't anything spectacular and eye catching. However, a memorable moment, at least for me, would be the flash backs of Agnes's past with the scenes involving fire. Was it memorable because it stuck out like a black bead in a container of white beads? For me, this was the reason why it was memorable. The animation for this part of the season was just a bit better then the rest of the other episodes.  Sound: 6/10 Regarding the section of sound, there wasn't anything memorable or worth talking about. To the anime's credit, the sounds were used appropriately when needed and gave the scenes the mood of the situation.  Enjoyment: 8/10 Despite this anime still having flaws, I fairly enjoyed this anime. I really enjoyed the last three episodes where the critical point of development between Saito and Louise bloomed (see what I did there? You gotta watch the last episode to get it.) Despite the ending being sort of like deus ex machina, it was still fun to watch.  Overall: 7/10  This second season of 'The Familiar of Zero' is good. It fixes some of the points that were needed to be addressed in the first season. The points being character development, and art. Though the show still needs to fix its mediocre story, sound, and character development of the side characters (with the exception of Agnes).  As much as I would love to recommend the third season of this show, I don't recommend it to everyone. I for one, being a fan of the show, watched the third season. The third season is similar to this second season of the anime, but with even more character development between Louise and Saito with the addition of an arc regarding a certain mage. If you are a fan of the show and want to see the Louise x Saito pairing grow, I recommend you watch it. If you aren't a fan of the show, I recommend you watch at least episodes 1~5 and maybe episode 7 of season 3. Who knows? You might come to enjoy it.";Recommended
14;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;xsupakoreanx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xsupakoreanx;9;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, the sequel to the previous season is the continuation of the epic saga of Saito Hiraga and Louise Valliere.  The invasion of Tristain has been pushed back thanks to Louise and Saito and an ueasy calm settles over the land. Louise begins to practice Void Magic while Saito, having given up his chance to go home to Japan, tries to find ways to fill his time. But the wars are not over. The peaceful lull is but the calm before the storm, and soon Queen Henrietta must make a terrible choice between a temporary peace and a preemptive invasion of Albion. Either way, Tristain is soon to be embroiled in war once more, and “Zero” and her Familiar will be right in the middle of it.  The story is relatively new in some ways. New characters are introduced like pretty boy Julio Chesare, headstrong Agnes Chevalier de Milan, nasty Eleanor and precious Cattleya Valliere, and finally the seductive Sheffield. The continuation of the story is pretty new and brings a new sense of adventure in the series. I must admit though, Louise seems much more colorful and bright in personality compared to the last season with a black-and-white personality and obviously annoys some viewers at times.  But the lackluster it holds is the lack of character importance for previous ones like Kirche, Tabitha, Montmorency, and Guiche. Some of them are just completely forgotten, hardly even referred to at times. The whole series mostly focuses not only on Saito and Louise's feisty relationship, but more on Agnes' past and her ambitions to avenge her past along with the mysterious history behind Mr. Colbert himself.  Even if this was lacking in more story content, at least it made up for having some complexity in the plot, with some dramatic feelings in that one pivoting moment for Agnes to figure out what really happened in the past. This compensates that Zero no Tsukaima really isn't a two-dimensional show, it's got some good stuff in it. Even the pace to this anime is very smooth and flows perfectly along with the humor that includes Saito's naughty pleasure in cleavage and romantic comedy.  The animation and art were good and very consistent. Background music was not the most impressive but it was pretty decent. Voice acting was good as usual, so I have to give props to the studio for at least making sure it continues to look and sound good.  Honestly, season 2 starts off pretty much routine—and then I found it hard to sit through. First off, the relationship angle is fine between Saito and Louise—no problems, but the storyline seemed lack luster from the first. Maybe I expected too much. With the addition of newer characters—I had hope such like Julio and Louise’s Siblings. Fortunately—the last part was the only good part about it.The last scene was the critical moment in the season...not much to say but it's just a visualization of how beautiful Saito and Louise's love is.  I give Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi a score of 9 because of how good it was to connect the series as a sequel. It left me a great feeling of satisfaction to once again to be worth my time to watch this. As I am a fan of romantic anime, this is probably one of my favorites to keep on to. Once again, this is yet not failed to disappoint me ever!;Recommended
15;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;SuzumiyaHaruhi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SuzumiyaHaruhi;7;--MY FIRST REVIEW. PLEASE BARE WITH ME--  Story: I felt like the first season had more story into it. The second season had plenty of fillers, in my opinion. In the begginning, it was okay. Nothing was really happening. The story picked up abit in the middle. Near the end, however, it became more exciting, but there were some parts of it that you could have lived without. The ending of the last episode was touching, until the moment got ruined, but I'll let you guys figure that out, I wouldn't want to spoil for those hardcore fans.  Art: I enjoyed the art in this anime, it was very nice, and easy on the eyes. The designs were simple, yet they are excellent and appropriate for this kind of anime. Think about it, this is an anime that is surrounded by magic. You wouldn't want to see overdone graphics that makes it look worse, dispite the fact that it would be fully detailed and would have so much going on.  Sound: Exceptional sound. Good magic sound effects. I think the begginning and ending was a nice touch. I didn't get tired of listening to them both.  Character: The characters developed in good ways, than others. Louise became slightly more consious of her feelings towards Saito, she became more jealous, and has an ability of a magic that was thought to never exist. Saito, on the other hand, has become more of a pervert than I would have liked him to. His chest obsession has put me in positions where I became frusturated with him because of his growing perveted ways. The other characters such as Siesta and the princess became more developed in this anime, and are adding on to the story.  Enjoyment: Saito pretty much killed half of my enjoyment, his growing pervertedness just ruins it for me. But I would like to say that I enjoy ZnT alot, and the third season doesn't look as bad.  Overall: I would have given this a 7.5 if I could. This is an anime series worth watching. I would highly reccomend it for people who are open in the idea of a magical/slightly Harry Potter-ish anime with a good story, humor, fanservice GALORE, and interesting characters.;Recommended
16;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;ethann;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ethann;8;The second season of zero no tsukaima poses a diffrerent story from the first whereby a battle is being fought between two major parties creating another epic battle towards the end of the series, with a similar cast and a few new entries.  The story was better than the first in my opinion, because it moves at a slightly faster pace not having to introduce too much on the characters. There's an even greater amount of romance in this series as well as drama. Again as the first it does not feature your cliched magic school academy in fact, it moves further away from that in the second series and focuses more on the war that breaks out.  The art was the same as the first so there int really much i have to say about the art of the series, other than it was flawless but not exceptional.  I personally loved the opening of this series it was so touching and sentimental, but again no insert songs(not that i remember), had there been any it would have left a deep impression on me since the drama and romance was much more significant in this series.  The characters carry on from the first story wth a few new ones coming in, for an anime with only 12 episodes i think they managed to give some depth to the new characters by focusing on them in certain episodes. In this series the relationship between Louise and Saito is brought out more and a level higherand this is especially evident towards the end of the series which was quite touching and sentimental, also there is a new couple which i won't spoil for you.  I definitely enjoyed this season if not more than the first, the comedy still prevails to quite a good level which does not interfere or make the story lok childish. Even at the end, i found it quite hilarious and suitable ending to the series, of course there are some questions that are left unanswered, but the fact that a third season is coming out already solves that problem.  Overall, The season was better than the first as they did not have to spend episodes introducing the characters again, however, as said of the first season, the series should be made longer as it lacks depth in some areas, but seeing that it is meant to be a romantic comedy its ok that there is a lack of seriousness in some cases, yet the true story is still brought out well with a good balance in the serious and comical side of the show, no doubt if you loved the first you will definitely enjoy this series.;Recommended
17;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;XydenicSky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/XydenicSky;9;2nd season of Zero no Tsukaima is not as bad as it's first season. I personally think that the 2nd season is better than the first..  The Story, it obvious Zero no Tsukaima had a very stupid storyline chucked in with cute characters and etc. In fact, the plot is the totally messed up, or even worst, theres no plot to the story, it's totally about saito and louise's love and how they mate each other =O  Art's not bad, I liked it. Probaly one of the strong point of Zero no Tsukaima. Characters are well drawn, although I prefer the manga version, which far more kawaii than the anime version x3  The sound are fine, although there are room for improvement on it. Actually of all the 3 season of Zero no Tsukaima, I liked this season's opening the most, motivated by some parts of the show heh heh heh.  Characters are 50/50 to me, some are good, some are bad. The main reason for me to watch this show's because of louise and saito, louise's one of the best tsundere I ever seen before.. Saito is not bad though, although i really hate his pervert-ness, blah. Siesta is just.. irritating!! The bad guys is just.. retarded. Forget this show if you are expecting some big action from the bad guys because they can't do a shit at all.  Enjoyment is... again, mixed. I can say nearly half of the episode are enjoyable, and the other half is not. The only worthwhile to watch this showto me is in fact... episode 4 and 12.. probably that the only 2 episode that made this season a good season.. otherwise I would rate this as 4 instantly. Siesta is such a annoying ass, why does she have to show up and ruin up the lovely atmosphere between saito and louise? Arghh!! I can't believe shes a character in the anime made to purely destroy your enjoyment (and make louise jealous).  Well in overall, it's not bad... you got to watch the last episode though.. It's epic and you will never regret it, that episode (along with episode 4) drags the score up, I'll give it a 9!!;Recommended
18;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;--Kaori--;https://myanimelist.net/profile/--Kaori--;7;The Familiar of Zero: Knight of the Twin Moons is S2 of this series and pretty much continues from where S1 left off. If you're here from my review of S1, then let's get what you came for out of the way first.  The good news is, Louise is more tolerable now, I often don't have a problem seeing her abuse Saito. Why is that? Well... thats the bad news... sadly the creator or whoever did S2 changed the respectful and reserved Saito into a pervert... (Disclaimer: Maybe he was always that way in the manga/LN? I don't read so can't say, if so then he was changed in S1 and changed back for more accurate adaptation in S2) Remember I said those abuse scenes are done for laughs because the pervert gets what he deserves? Yeah, that's why most of the time it didn't bother me... the other reason being is most of the time she isn't using a whip anymore (Btw that got upgraded and used only once in S2) but instead using her magic which explodes so yeah, more funny now and much mroe tolerable than in S1 where it was just abuse, here its for actual anime humor. That said half the time it isn't his fault still (Misunderstandings and jealousy) And disclaimer in case you didn't read my S1 review, it's never ok to abuse someone irl nor is it funny, in fiction that's a different story and varies depending on the sitch. Anyway, although Saito is now a perv, I half suspect he's doing it on purpose to make Louise jealous but that's not confirmed yet and is just my theory. Hopefully S3 confirms my theory, I wouldn't count on it though being confirmed ever.  The other bad news however for S2 is that in S1 we got to know and love/like characters, sadly, most of the OG cast are mostly side characters now... that really sucked but given the direction the anime went, while introducing new characters for the plot, it's understandable. Now for the GOOD news. The anime is no longer predictable. I mean sure you're going to know SOME of whats coming, but a LOT of stuff, I did not see coming. That + the more serious story really made S2 stand out FAR above what S1 had, but not everyone will like the direction the anime took. The good news is the new characters are just as good (and maybe better) as the characters from S1, even S1 characters got some development like Siesta for example. (Ok, she got a LOT of development, she was mostly bland and just there in S1, NOT HERE!) Yes S2 is a BIG improvement over S1 and imo makes watching S1 more worth while given how good S2 was.  That said S2 does have its own set of flaws, such as in one episode we see the death of someone, a character who loved that character that died then shows up the next episode seemingly back to their normal self. If you couldn't tell yes it was clear days if not weeks had passed and thats the thing am talking about here. It sometimes feels like we're missing an episode or in another episode why aren't these characters bringing up THAT? (Louise's house episode, just so you know what am talking about here) There's prolly more stuff but those are the major flaws. And now if you haven't seen S1 please stop reading because S1 spoilers are now going to be mentioned, feel free to finish reading this review if you see the end of S1. So, S2 is good, often times REALLY GOOD, but not everyone is going to like that war is now a thing and its been brought into the plot of the anime. It did make the anime better but there were times it didn't work. The characters in S2 however are what SELL S2, big time. Even Louise though she hasn't grown much, has gotten more likable and become a slightly better person. I really don't have much else to say about S2 due to spoilers so i'll end it here. I have no Love score this time like I did for S1 (See my review of S1 to get what am talking about if you wanna know) because S2's score is also the same score I would use for the love score and i don't use both scores if they match up lol Anyway,  The Familiar of Zero: Knight of the Twin Moons (S2) I rate a 7.0 out of 10.0. Only reason it wasn't rated higher is due to the flaws I mentioned + them making Saito a pervert (Though if you can get over him being a pervert in S2, then that's one less flaw);Recommended
19;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;CuteAndFunny;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CuteAndFunny;7;The second season I felt loses its charm of what made the show interesting.  The comedy becomes watered down and is benched for more serious tones of war and some philosophy it tries to push on you then completely ignores it in the end.  You lose basically most of the supporting cast from the previous season, which they themselves barely had much depth to them in the first place, this would have been a good opportunity to flesh them out. Instead a bunch of new characters appears and they take up a decent amount of the story with their own problems to be solved. They weren't bad, but it felt like they were also just casted aside for the most part too.  One big thing is many of the characters really feel like they changed immediately right off the bat from the first episode. You notice mainly in Saito, he becomes a lot more of a perv, and Siesta's personality is that of obsession and that's all she's got. Louise becomes even more tsun and jealous at every step made.  There were so many misunderstanding cliches which resulted in Louise disciplining Saito and I read it does not end throughout this series. Saito of course doesn't help, in-fact he actually becomes a worse person in my eyes with how he acts and Louise's short tempered reactions impact the plot which is bad.  The ecchi factor as you can expect is increased a decent amount from the previous season and often feels unnecessary or out of place because of Saito blatantly going for it.  Overall, I simply am not a fan of war archs in fantasy rom-coms they often feel rather forced throughout and have trouble with balancing both comedy and war with more serious tones. The show was really promising and was generally at times fun to watch, but it really takes a turn when you realize not much happens as you continue. Along with the ending which was really good and bad, if you watched it already you should know what I am referencing.;Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;moozooh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/moozooh;6;"I suppose it's inevitable that Futatsuki no Kishi, being a second season of Zero no Tsukaima, will be compared to the first in one way or another, especially since it's pointless to start the series here, but I'll try to appraise its own merits as well.  As implied by the ending of the first season, FnK is a direct continuation of the story. Several new characters are introduced almost immediately, and, while I don't have anything against them, I'd like to point out that they (most notably Agnes) take up quite an amount of screen time with their own subplots, leaving less for the overall story. Thankfully, they aren't dragged out for too long. Particularly refreshing is the noticeable advance in Saito and Louise's relationship, during which several important questions are raised and decisions are made.  The animation is done on a fairly high level for the time, although it's not anything outstanding: characters still talk out one side of their face and all that, many scenes lack smoothness—just like in the first season, all things considered. Some scenes, particularly those of burning villages, are pretty nicely done. (I swear I'm not a sociopath!) The sound work borrows most themes from the first season. They're fine for what they are but still come off a little generic. New opening and ending are somewhat enjoyable, definitely more so than those of the first season IMO.  As for the characters, the previously known Academy residents (Kirche, Tabitha, Guiche, etc.) have much less screen time. Not sure if I like that; personally, I'd prefer to see them some more. New characters are passable, if a bit queer-looking. Siesta is still there, being apparently dumber than previously. Yes, everything has to be sacrificed for the sake of fan service. (sigh) On that note, what is particularly annoying about FnK is that fan service has increased in quantity, but definitely not in quality. Saito's obsession with boobs might've been funny at first, but the obviously contrived situations become old very quickly. You might not even notice it at first, but by the last episode it will come screaming in your face. Then again, the finale itself is too silly, anyway.  All in all, with FnK Zero no Tsukaima keeps being a good addition to your collection as long as you enjoy fantasy harem comedies with a questionably high amount of hit-and-miss fan service. Many will laugh, some might even tear up; overall I think the second season is almost as enjoyable as the first, barring the certain cheesiness and an overall drop in the quality of the comedy. However, it might leave something to be desired when it comes to the story progression, so I sincerely hope they won't drag it out for too long. Any further decrease in pace coupled with an increase in fan service could easily ruin the show. (Editing this paragraph from the future: It did ruin the show.)";Mixed Feelings
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Pontifus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pontifus;6;"I thought Zero no Tsukaima would provide nothing more than shallow entertainment, and I was quite wrong ... but its sequel, I decided, couldn't possibly live up to the standard set by the original. After all, Zero's effectiveness as a story may have been a fluke, a fortunate accident.  Fluke it was not, all told. I'd still recommend the series to anyone whose tastes seem to run in the general direction of fantasy/harem romance/politics. But despite its strong latter episodes, Futatsuki no Kishi does suffer from a few weaknesses its predecessor managed to keep to a minimum or avoid entirely.  Plot: Again we join Louise and her hapless familiar Saito at the Tristain Academy, where their relationship has grown marginally stronger. I have no complaints with how the whole inevitable Saito/Louise pairing is portrayed at first; we're given the impression that things have moved forward for the two, despite Louise's fondness for brandishing that riding crop, and it's an impression we need to be given if we're going to believe in the two as a viable and vital couple. When relationships hit a standstill in the real world, of course, things tend to go sour very soon after.  That said, one of the weakest points of the plot is its handling of the central romance. Louise and Saito make progress with one another in fits and starts, alternating between trite slapstick and almost extreme affection. It's the slapstick that bothers me most, partly because there's so damn much of it, and partly because the plot occasionally has to contort itself in unlikely directions simply to land Saito in unfortunate positions of lechery. Too many episodes are devoted not to progressing the underlying series of political events in any significant way, but to progressing Saito toward a pair of breasts, and Louise toward Saito and said breasts at just the wrong moment. And when they do get along, there are one or two moments of startling physicality that may make it a little difficult to fully appreciate (understandable as these moments may be, Saito and Louise being healthy teenagers and all).  Don't get me wrong, though. Futatsuki no Kishi does have its truly sweet moments. The last episode really nails it, but as it's the last episode, I'll refrain from singing its praises too loudly here.  Due to Futatsuki's focus on the central romance's sporadic twists and turns, the political storyline suffers -- a real disappointment to me, as the two arcs seemed to work so well together in the first season. The first half in particular often interrupts the continuity with breasts, Saito's appreciation thereof, and Louise's resultant disapproval. The shift toward politics in the second half feels like an abrupt temperature change at first, seemingly for the production team as much as we viewers, as the general organization of episodes seven and eight came across as a bit shoddy to me. When the suddenness levels out, however, we get a solid final four episodes. If you were a fan of the politics in the first season, hang in there; it's ultimately worth it.  Characters: I have two major problems with the characterization in Futatsuki, the first being inexplicable personality shifts. The first season gave us a surprisingly strong cast, and I looked forward to said cast developing further from where they left off, but this isn't always the case. Saito, for example, seems at times to have been demoted into your average, everyday pervert. Siesta's resolve to wrest Saito's affections from Louise isn't surprising, considering her acts of momentary boldness in the previous season, but her willingness to throw herself at Saito is a bit disconcerting. These divergences don't seem to be indicative of the kind of change one thinks of when discussing character growth.  Secondly, I didn't appreciate the marginalization of some characters. New characters Agnes and Julio ultimately earn our interest, but season one set Kirche and Tabitha up for a bit of explication, and we hardly see them at all this time around. I feel bad for Tabitha's seiyuu, having to make the trip down to the studio to record a grand total of three or so lines. With Tabitha and Kirche out of the way, it goes without saying that Guiche and Montmorency don't get much screen time, either.  On the other hand, those recurring characters who are further fleshed did good things for me. I couldn't help being interested in Colbert's history and plight, and Delfringher, who has to be the cleverest talking sword in all anime-dom, is even more hilariously pithy than before. Even Henrietta shows her many good and bad sides this time around.  Setting: Tristain Academy hasn't much changed, and, had the majority of the show been set therein, the place may have gotten old. Fortunately, we're introduced to a variety of locales as things move along -- a surprising number, really, considering how much of the plot is fanservice-centric (Saito doesn't let circumstances keep him down, so to speak). Our heroes visit such settings as an underground vault, a snowy mountain, and Louise's ample home, traveling between Tristain and Albion, the flying faux-Britain.  We also gain insight into the general level of technology with the introduction of Tristain's musketeers. Despite this title, the guns employed in Futatsuki are decidedly similar to rifles, in terms of accuracy; it seems that magic coexists with a higher level of technology than was previously made clear. By implication, this tautens the dynamic between aristocrats and plebeians, as those not gifted with magic are proven to be perfectly formidable marksmen. Perhaps the aristocrats' control is not as total as it seems.  Art: Futatsuki brings back the same clean, simple, Shakugan no Shana-esque art style as the original, retaining its reputation as the pastel equivalent of Shana's darkness and fire. Interestingly, the animation itself alternates between very good and shoddy, particularly where fight scenes are concerned, but it balances out in most episodes to be more than acceptable. I'm happy that J.C. Staff decided to forgo the use of 3D computer graphics in rendering flight sequences; such graphics have their place, that place being Last Exile and not here.  Sound: Based on music alone, I would have rated Futatsuki below its predecessor in the sound department. Music throughout the series often comes across as generic action fare, and besides, the opening and ending themes didn't do as much for me this time. Maintaining the score at 7, however, are certain scenes in which the voice acting is absolutely dead-on. Futatsuki's all-star vocal cast definitely delivers.  Verdict: Personally, I prefer my shows to be solid from beginning to end, rather than loaded with meaning, progress, and spectacle in the final four episodes. Either way, Futatsuki no Kishi turned out to be worthwhile thanks to that final stretch, particularly for a viewer who enjoyed the first season as much as I did. It's ultimately worth your attention as a follow-up to Zero no Tsukaima and a segue into the forthcoming season three, but be warned that it has its shaky spots.";Mixed Feelings
2;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;strikerbolt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/strikerbolt;5;"I will be very honest here: I enjoyed the first season immensley. I thought it was creative and unique, and proved that the story could get much, much deeper. Admittingly, I had very high expectations for the second season, and I walked away greatly dissapointed. Art/Sound: Pretty much the same from the first season, but this time around it was very clear they spent more energy on the art than the story. As far as sound goes, it isn't memorable, but it is fitting for the right scenes. Story/Character: I'll be brutally frank, there are about at most 4 episodes worth watching (possibly 3). A large part of the story this season revolves around a recently introduced character (Agn&egrave;s Chevalier de Milan) who though is shown great detail, also portrays no growth whatsoever. *SPOILER: Expect character death because of her, and her not feeling guilty in the least, which most definatley led to me going &quot;W...T...F?!&quot; END SPOILER* If you are expecting a story about our main characters Saito and Louise, you'll surely be disappointed as I was while you watch them basically take a back seat. On the topic of our main characters, I had expected some sort of change of character or growth from either Saito or Louise once the second season began. However, this is only evident in previoulsy stated 4 episodes worth watching. Enjoyment: The only saving grace of this season is the final episode where Saito does something incredibly f***ing GAR (aka badass, awesome, etc.). That, and the promise of a new season. Those are the only two reasons to watch this. Overall: If you decide to remain a dedicated fan (like me), watch it once, if for the story of the upcoming third season (and the final episode is pretty awesome). The art is at least pretty, and the humor (though occasionally dry and repetitive) should at least get a chuckle out of you.";Mixed Feelings
3;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Andristian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Andristian;6;Futatsuki no Kishi, the second season of Zero no Tsukaima takes us back to the magical world where Louise and her familiar Saito continue their adventures. The first season was pretty entertaining and that hasn’t changed much in the second one either. The problem with season two is that most of the episodes follow an individual plot and build up the main storyline slower than what we have encountered in season one. There’s action going on, sure, but the whole bang starts during the last few episodes. Some may not care as much, but it will undoubtedly turn off a couple of less tolerant viewers.  Surprisingly enough, Saito and Louise’s relationship hasn’t changed much. From the very first episode it seems that they’re back to square one and Louise quickly goes back to whipping Saito as if nothing ever happened between them. I didn’t appreciate the lack of progress very much and Saito doesn’t help much either: even though he confessed his love to Louise, he keeps staring at other girls’ boobs and keeps the perverted thoughts coming. There are some nice little touches here and there, and there are a lot more significant scenes that depict the intimacy between Saito and Louise.  There are also a couple of new characters introduced and some really add some edge to the overall feel of the series. First you’ve got Louise’s sisters Eléonore and Cattleya, who seem to start playing a significant role in the anime, but are later overlooked and neglected. Cattleya is of more of a gracious and good willed character than her other sisters and only resembles Louise due to her pink-coloured hair. Eléonore, on the other hand, is just as scornful and arrogant as her younger sister and she’s even got her own whip!  By far the best character introduced is Agnès, the captain of Henrietta’s musketeer force. She is portrayed as being a tough military leader and her skill in swordsmanship is quite impressive. Many will consider her as being a tomboy and she does have a small story arc going on for a couple of episodes. Her presence throughout the anime is indeed significant and she does give the audience a nice break from Saito and Louise’s tiring situation. Another new character would be Julio Chesaré, a transfer student from Romalia who starts showing affection for Louise, which in turn leads to an interesting and funny conflict between him and Saito. There’s an entire episode devoted to his development as a character, but he turns out to be of little importance after that.  The most negative thing about season two is Siesta’s character, which is completely butchered throughout the entire series. Many will recall her as the goodhearted love interest of Saito and a lot actually preferred her to Louise during the first season. There’s an obvious change this time around, though, and the character is completely butchered in season two. The kind and delightful girl suddenly turned into a lying and manipulative bitch that will do anything to sabotage Saito’s relationship with Louise and win Saito over. Not nice, not nice at all.  As mentioned before, the story doesn’t progress too well and there are a lot of things that lack balance and don’t make too much sense. It’s still entertaining, though, which is always a plus, especially when you’re talking about anime. There are also a lot more ecchi scenes during season two – there are never enough anyway! The final episode is much more powerful and climatic than the one in season one and there’s a lot more emotion involved this time. There really isn’t any reason to skip Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi if you’ve seen season one and there’s enough entertainment to keep it from failing, even though it’s not as proficient in substance as the first season was.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;mikozee;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mikozee;6;"Loved the characters.  Hated the direction the director took in making the series.  It's like they tried too hard to mix rom-com and action-adventure, and they ended up with a bland concoction that appeals to neither fans of either genre. They should have just picked one and used the other as a supplement.  Including season 1, we're currently 25 episodes into the series. So far, there are far too many crucial questions that have been left unanswered, such as: What is a Void mage? Why is it important? Why was Saito chosen as the reincarnation of Gandalfr? Why is Louise the only Void mage to appear in centuries? Why now, as opposed to 10 years ago or 10 years into the future?  Back story aside, let's look at current questions: Has Louise made any progress as a Void mage? Has Saito learned to harness his inner power?  Important development questions like these are left unanswered, nor are they shown. We don't see either characters making progress. In an anime like Zatch Bell, we see definitive progress being made -- When Zatch improves through battle, we know he improved because we SEE him learning a new skill that are later actively used. Louise has a book of Void Magic. We see her use it once, and that's it. Has she learned any new skills or progressed further into the book? We dont know, because it's not shown.  Other characters who are seemingly important actually end up having little to no relevance at all. When Julio was introduced as the 3rd member of Team Zero, I thought, ""Awesome, another character to finally add some dynamic"". Instead, he's been useful exactly twice, had maybe 1/10th the amount of lines even Siesta had, and hardly played a relevant role. No development with him is made, or shown on screen.  Instead, silly scenes with Siesta are shoved on screen on practically every episode, despite it not furthering the series in any productive ways, and the plot dealing with the war is just dashed in as a side story.  As stated at the start, I love the characters. Louise is like a magical version of Taiga from Toradora, and I love that. Saito is a perverted high schooler, who acts the part very nicely, though, it does get old once you see him doing the same thing (and getting beat for the same thing) an over abundant amount of times because the directors just can't seem to decide on what they want.  That said, I still did enjoy the series, but these criticisms just keep me from giving it a high score. The series had so much potential and it really makes me sad that it's been squandered away.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Nightscream;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nightscream;3;"Everything I said of the first season applies for this second season, except that there are less &quot;laughing times&quot;:  &quot; The story is another clich&eacute; that we've seen a lot and this time it really is bad. The main story has as many plot holes as you can imagine (without taking into consideration how bad it is itself). The visual quality is really bad taking into consideration that it's not that old of an anime. The character development is almost non existent and for the ones that do develop it is really bad. A lot of characters make an appearance without the proper relations to the story and that makes it almost idiotic. Except for one case, everyone is either good or evil so you know where it's going to end with anyone. The music is really stupid and even though it goes with the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the show it could have been a lot better (believe me, I'm being pretty generous).  Nevertheless, the reason I enjoyed his show despite all and every bad aspect is because of it sense of humor. Almost every episode had me laughing and thats the only reason I finished it.  So if you really don't mind those incredible bad aspects and you want to laugh a little then give it a chance.&quot;";Not Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi;Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;3;"Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi The Familiar of Zero: The Knight of the Twin Moons    The second season and what I feared happened. The first season was mostly acceptable, simply because the fan service seemed irrelevant and was covered by subtle humor. Now we have even more rpants, asses and breasts without end.  And it gets worse, the mentioned humor has almost completely died. The jokes consistently only of ""Some girl grabs Saito, Saito feels sexually aroused and stares at her breasts. Then Louise comes in and spams"" EXPLOSION ""in the low budget format. And that was it, repeated this every episode. And yes, it goes on in the other seasons.   The only reason why this season has not slipped further with the rating is the last 3 episodes and especially the final fight. One can certainly not speak of drama here, since the characters have no real relationship. However, the implementation was not bad and the atmosphere of the finale was right. Under different circumstances and with a different author, this would even have been a potentially successful ending.    Story  Nothing changed in the plot. The war continues, mostly in the background and only towards the end of the season do you find relevance for this as the main topic again. Apart from that, everything is again the everyday perverse life of the protagonists.  The background story in the area of episodes 6-8 was okay though.   Animation / pictures  Are a bit better than before. However, still not an average level.   Characters  Louis becomes more understandable from episode to episode without irony, while Saito can barely control his sexual drive.  The supporting characters hadn't changed, apart from the fact that they hardly had any screen time.   Music  Just like the first season we have a more individual intro and the Osts are basically the same.   Conclusion  This season had two distinct strengths that outperformed the first. However, everything else was a complete downgrade.";Not Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima F;matonyan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matonyan;9;"Well, this is my first review, and I don't think I'm good at writing them, but I'll give a try.  I've scored the three previous season to 7, mainly because it was repetitive, and there was not this thing that embraces your mind and take you to an other world. And then, I've watched this season, the final one. And it is perfect. Louise is becoming more and more mature, even if she keeps her tsundere style which is still funny (although it annoyed me a lot of times, but hey, it's who she is after all). For Saito, it's approximatively the same, he's growing too, and we really see their relationship evolving...  About the scenes, there is a lot more romantic scenes than before, which is wonderful because their kind of different from the previous season, there is something that makes you feel good, and you're happy for them too in some way. Since I was also obsessed by the magic scenes with void magic and all that, you should know that there's also a LOT more of these scenes, and I found that they were much more impressive.  I'm also noticing the OST which is just full of epicness (special note for the song ""Passion"" which I'm listening right now).   I think they did a really good work, this season embraces the whole series, and every episode makes you feel wonderful and the two final episodes are just so much awesome that you can't accept it is already over, and then you see how it was just a nicely dream in which you will go back someday...";Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima F;theazntiger;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theazntiger;7;"Zero no Tsukaima F is the final season of the series and it features a young boy Saito getting abused by his master Louise. Stuff happens, Saito is extremely indecisive about his relationship with Louise, stuff gets fixed. Nothing new is really found in this season and I won't go too much into detail about the summary because hey, you should have seen the previous three seasons before you watch the 4th one, no?  So about the story.. heh. If you have seen the previous seasons, you'll have a pretty good idea what happens. Some stuff happens, maybe some random fanservice here and there, filler episodes randomly thrown in out of nowhere, a problem occurs and is solved with usually an unrealistic solution that probably has some plot holes. And by plot holes, I don't mean ""look very deep into the anime"" ones, I mean ""wtf how did they just do that it didn't make any sense at all"" kind of plot holes. It takes the fantasy genre to a whole new level and again, not in a good way (SPOILER example: Saito stealing a fighter jet from a military base in 2 seconds). Some of it can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the season was rushed but all in all, they really did not need some of the fillers; it was just a waste of time. If you're one of those people that like to have an intricate plot with plenty of BAM moments, this is not the anime for you. The plot is lackluster and very predictable. The ending was a perfect example of this. Personally, I thought the ending was very predictable but it fits the anime. Having said that though, ZnT is NOT about the story. If you have been watching this for the story, then I got news for you, choose something else to watch. The story here is just there to have at least some ""meaning"" between each episode, nothing special.  Al-right, the characters. The characters are again, nothing special. An abusive tsundere, some boobs, some more boobs, and a loli. This anime throughout the seasons has shown no character development, Louise and Saito were supposedly married at the end of season two but Saito is still an indecisive guy and Louise still blows him up. Usually this would lower the score as dynamic characters are always good but the thing is, it's what the anime is known for. This is why most people have continued to watch though the seasons. Sure, Saito will piss you off every time he ogles some girls breast because he completely lacks self-control or some other stuff that ticks you off. The non-changing character foils that have been constant throughout all four seasons is the selling point of this anime. You don't watch this to see some well thought out strategy like Death Note or the plain awesomeness of Steins;Gate, you watch this too see Saito getting blown up by explosions and the tsundere Louise being her usual self and the relationship between them. I will have to say that it will probably get tiring if you watch this in one go.  The sound doesn't really do much considering most of the BGM is just reused from the previous seasons. In some cases, it certainly does help set the mood and I loved how they reused one of the openings during one of the final episodes. The energetic OP also adds towards the enjoyment of the anime; it fits the mood. Though the EP isn't bad, the usage of it is certainly questionable in some cases. Something some by Rie Kugimiya doesn't really fit certain situations if you know what I mean.  The art wasn't really exceptional and doesn't take away from the anime itself. Not much to comment on this as it doesn't feature any special art style. The battle scenes were too short in my opinion.  I'm a Louise fan so this is probably biased but I really enjoyed the series overall. If I was to use by biased score, this would be a 10/10 just because I'm a huge Louise fan. That's kind of the thing with this anime, either you'll hate the characters (I don't think many people expected much out of the story anyways) or come to love em. The story was really annoying at certain points because of the number of episodes that were just pointless. They could have easily just spent a couple of minutes or not even included certain parts (really didn't need a episode dedicated towards the crowning of a queen) of the anime. The ending however, was probably the saving grace for this anime. I personally value a conclusive ending opposed to some random harem ending. Overall, I think that this season manages to set up the end of the series only leaving some minor plot holes. Watch this with a grain of salt in mind.  Feedback is appreciated as this was my first review.";Recommended
2;Zero no Tsukaima F;Benducky;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Benducky;7;I thought i would dislike this season after that mediocre third season, but surprisingly this is the best season of the entire anime, everything is improved and i for once didn't find Louise and Saito's realationship pointless and annoying.  Story On this season, there's just two stories to follow, the mission that the queen Henrietta gave both to see what the Pope wants from them and the other story is the finally growing relationship between Louise and Saito, finally there's not hate-love between them, but more love, more romantic and that was good after a step back in season three.  Art & Animation The art and animations really improved, it was colorful and brighter, and smooth, it was the best of the four seasons, the overall was very good.  Sound The sound was the same, with little changes but still was good.  Character Finally they developed Louise and Saito, and it was a big improvement, the other characters weren't behind on improvement neither, finally we get to know more a lot of their background, overall it was very good.  Enjoyment The only season that i enjoyed a lot and wanted every season to be like this, because i felt like they restarted and improved everything on a good way, the ending left me wanting more, because they finally are together and trusth eachother and i liked how Louise changed from being the kind of tsundere that i hate to a calm tsundere like Taiga when she was with Ryuuji.;Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima F;CareBear69;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CareBear69;8;"Zero no Tsunami F is the final and last sequel to ""Familiar of Zero"" series. I am very excited to review this show as this was also a pathway for me to enjoy and love anime. Please start with season one.  Zero no Tsunami F and it's prequel may be your classic harem with a Tsusendere and a average boy as your main character with lots of girls surrounding him but this is worth the watch. Giving this show a 8 was a solid score surrounding this series as a whole but could have exceeded my expectations even more.  When looking at the 2 main character which are Louise and Saito. You can really say that there relationship is funny, cute and overdramatic at certain times. When the manga was being adapted into an anime I was surprised that it lasted so long with four seasons completed. Tbh I think everyone had a thrilling ride watching this show.  Knowing this was a romantic comedy with a magic theme that had been included gave it a refreshing feeling to the viewer as each sometimes episode contained a element of randomness which gave us a comedic and light refreshing feel towards the show.  The anime begins by continuing to describe the adventures that follow the ""Hero"" Hiraga, Saito and the ""unique women"" called Le Blanc de La Vallière, Louise Francoise Better known as (Zero Louise) whom has a funny but cute relationship. Reference to the first season is where Saito appears from the human world to Tristein Academy.  This anime includes other genres such as comedy and drama that is centred around the main characters. The magic and dramatic elements are given at unexpected moments but that builds up the enjoyment. This however creates a very unique and always different situations between the main characters, but when we observe this situation we can a new picture that is created when a new cloud always get painted over the old. When watching the show you know these characters have a sense of little or no maturity at all (Really pushing it Louise there) and gives them the ability to tackle new challenges with awesome but hilarious methods. This type of lifestyle gives a pretty accurate description of the whole anime and it is pretty different from your usual romantic comedy that we occasionally see from time to time.  I find the pacing of the show to be slow/moderate in the viewers point but I am not judge. It tells us a story in a suitable manner that is executed with minor or no flaws at all. This allows the viewer to be entertained with none or little mood swings. If the series was any slower or faster I might have to change my thoughts on the shows progression.  Being a romantic comedy anime, It all comes down to Familiar of Zero being able to give us comedic and straight in the face lines. The interactions between different characters gives us different moments in were we just laugh hysterically or cry. You can relate to the characters emotions shown by facial expressions and the uneasy movement they might produce. Being a comedic anime I am certain it will make you laugh and give dramatic moments where you will not feel at ease.  Zero no Tsukami is a good way to enter a romantic comedy where you will be laugh away. When the audience try's to understand the characters I think they will judge them by there personality and how they interact and develop new bonds and feelings which tighten the show all together. This gives the audience a small feeling of the characters current emotions. The comedy and drama may not seem new to most but with the addition of random twists and characters gives light to a whole new drama. on Classical comedy being one of them, It depends if the viewer has enjoyed it in which it has altered the opinion of the viewer towards the series. However having some magic included will also draw the audience closer and will have a significant influence on there overall opinion of the show.  Again having not read the manga I wouldn't presume that the anime is way off from its paper counterpart.  Having magic integrated into the show gives it a new light.  The anime try to tackle the development of relationships between characters through dramatic or random situations and through interactions and actions done by the characters which little by little develops more and more. The difference this show has compared to others of the same genre is how the characters are portrayed and overly influenced. We see the story from the main 2 characters however there is parts that give the views of the other characters as they encounter new challenges and develop new feelings towards them and others. Thus telling us Zero no Tsukami gives us an enjoyable watch to take in and remember. The design of the characters is well based given the date for this show and its prequel with little or some difference in facial features and expression.  The setting is wonderful and gives us a magical theme by the use of different light schemes and scenery. The colour used is simplistic and elegant giving a bright view of the setting.  Concluding this review. Zero no Tsukami was giving a different feel compared to its recommendations. I did not know wether I was gonna enjoy it or be completely bored and mad but I am glad I am safe as this turned to be an very good show whom anyone can enjoy no matter your age.  Thanks for reading";Recommended
4;Zero no Tsukaima F;SovietPsycho;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SovietPsycho;10;"Let me just start from the top... hopefully all these emotions and thoughts racing in my mind will still be there by the time I'm done writing this but. I had not expected much from this show, this what almost felt to be half-assed show with nothing in it. Of course... that's when I first started. Looking back now, this show had absolutely been one of my favorites. How the jokeful beginning, although what back then I had thought to be (when i say beginning i literally mean the first episode) god awful had only contributed to the over all beauty of this anime. This is one of the few animes that I felt had wrapped up very nicely. There was no""wait, can't there be an episode where they do this?"" Everything had been fulfilled in this anime. The serious moments had only been uplifted as the jokeful ones were meant to be. To be honest, I'm glad there were this many episodes, around 50. Because with this, you can almost feel the full impact of the entire anime. The love between Saito and Louise, their moments together, how they grew to be fond of each other and literally couldn't live without each other. You could feel the steady tension, the rising emotions and feelings. It had felt like you WERE saito, as each episode (throughout the entire series) had shown you a little bit of their lives. Each and every part, their fights, when they didn't like each other, when they missed each other, when they loved each other, and everything. This had all contributed to the overall feel of the anime, leaving you with this almost heart ache when the serious moments do come. As I'd like to point out clearly, you could feel the steadiness of the anime, like as if it never skipped. You don't see them liking each other out of the blue for no reason, you reason with yourself how they got to like each other and it makes sense. It's not a surprise when you see them admit and say ""i love you"" because you could feel the steadiness and pacing. After finishing this anime.... I do believe I must call it a flower anime, or some corny stuff like that. An anime that, honestly, in the beginning you don't even know why you're watching. It seems to be horrid and god awful and this shouldn't even exist. However, when you finally finish it, or the more you progress into it, the more you realize that every past action is simply meant to bring about the beauty in the next. It's a snowball effect, and that's why at the end you're left with a big giant freakin snowball in your heart and you are left in a room alone in the dark, where you just realize you finished a beautiful heart-felt anime. (or maybe thats just me). Here's how I recommend this anime, it will only be beautiful and amazing if you watch this from start to finish. Every screentime ever scene every everything had feelings and emotions that would later bloom. If you are not going to watch this anime from start to finish. Don't, cus otherwise if you don't, it is the shittiest anime ever. However, from start to finish, at the end of the day, I could not help but add this as one of my favorites. (also, i had added this to an overall of 10 because, the story and character interactions i simply could not help but feel that this anime is worthy of a 10. Also, this is an overall review of the whole anime. I hope this will still help you in watching the last season or not though.)";Recommended
5;Zero no Tsukaima F;pakin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pakin;8;Zero no Tsukaima has been going on to it's fourth season now, and personally i think it's not better or worst than it's other seasons.  the story, is i think 8/10. i like the plots and every thing, since it makes some exciting moments and all, but mostly i think it's just the romance, and ecchi that i think are most appealing to Zero no Tsukaima. there's just A LOT of romance, and ecchi much more than action or comedy. anyone out there who doesn't like these stuff probably shouldn't watch it, or rather you shouldn't even be reading this since there's three seasons before this that you may quit already if you don't like harem. all i could say is that it has some, very little sad part, in my opinion, because of how annoying the argument between Louise and Saito is, rather than the feeling of sadness of their arguments. there might be people out there that totally disagree with that, but i'm just getting it out there. the fighting scene are pretty nice. Well though out of how they fight, how the groups interact and connect to others, especially the ideas of the final weapon, what they used to fight. i it should have more feelings to it, than just fan service.  the art was pretty ok.. giving it 7/10 probably is the best i could. the pictures and all were very cute and nice looking. the background, the characters designs were just great, but the most thing that i think is lacking are more of the smooth movement of the art. sometime i think the part of a character, such as the hair just move like a paper... note very sooth motion to it, and it doesn't quite look natural, or realistic to a normal hair, even though it's not normal hair anyway... the color and designs of all things were nice, but in my opinion it needs a little more smoothness to the movements of the characters.  the sounds are great, 9/10. it has a nice soundtrack to it at the right moment, whether the situation gets in a bad, or a good mood. the sounds pretty much fits in most of all things in the anime, and it's very accurate in terms of how it would actually sounds in the reality.  the characters could be good or bad depending on your own thinking, 8/10. as of that most character to me is pretty normal, but in every anime there are just some characters that just annoys the heck out of you, making you wish there's not just that character. but those characters are just a need thing so that it would probably make other characters looks better. Louise is just one of the character that just is annoying. this is probably debatable since there's a lot of different kinds of people in this world, and i think she is, is because of how she act, or what she say to Saito. i'm not a big fan of Saito that much too, since even though he have an important role, it doesn't even look like he's even trying in anything, such as, he barely even practice much. he does but not much, since if you had watch what happens in the near to last episode, he has shown to be pretty weak still. he's only strong probably because of the things that support him, such as his sword. so far the only person in Zero no Tsukaima that i don't quite like is just Louise, since she can be a lot of a bother, and of course her words are just both cute, but mostly irritating.  overall i think this anime is worth to watch. if people like anime that has romance as its genre i think this might be a great anime. it's very enjoyable, relaxing and sometimes it just takes your minds of stuff, like for example i'm writing this review after finished watching this anime, and totally forgot to do the project that is due tomorrow. if you finished all the other seasons and finally going to watch this final season, i hope that you will enjoy the most of it, but don't get into it that much, that you might attempt to do the thing at the final episode with the plane and the moon.

6;Zero no Tsukaima F;heipo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/heipo;8;After completing the previous three seasons of the show, I will say the final season lived up to my expectation, with significantly more story development than the season 1 and season 3. Zero f begins by finishing off the cliff-hangers from last season, followed by a few light-heart comedic episodes, and finally develop into a final, climatic arc. If you are a fan of the light novel, the last arc is probably not to your liking, as it derives significantly from the book. However, if you have not read the novel, the arc is quite satisfying, especially the ending. The ending is perhaps one of the most complete ending (as in no loose end) I have seen. Overall, if you have watched the previous three seasons, this season still retains what makes the series great, the comedy and the ecchiness. An improvement over previous seasons is an increase in character development (which will be more apparent if you have watched the previous seasons). If you have not watched any of the previous seasons, I suggest you give the series a try if you are a fan of comedy or fantasy.;Recommended
7;Zero no Tsukaima F;Yamete_Kudasai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yamete_Kudasai;8;How an anime goes from good to very good.  I rated the previous seasons as following: Season 1: 6 Season 2 and 3: 7  The main reasoning behind this, being that especially season 1, had insanely rushed material, and the plot felt lacking.  Season 4 is a whole different thing, and I am going to explain why.  The plot/story in this season starts off well made, and interesting. I rushed through this season faster then any of the others. I kinda feel that the whole plot and storytelling style grows on you. You kinda realize that this anime was never ment for slow-paced plot with huge details in how the world works (Log Horizon is a grand example of this). It's also not all about the realization of the style, it's about the presentation of the style in this season, that makes it better then the others.  For one of the few times in this anime, I have actually understood most of Louise's actions. I have understood when she got mad at him. (Because, be honest, who didn't hate the guts out of that girl in the first 1-2 seasons? Atleast I did. I was actually so mad at her at times I was hitting my PC.) The example here comes from when Saito kissed someone he shouldn't have. And there was no explaining against it. After all, it's a harem anime, so stuff like this will happen, but I felt that the way Louise and Saito handled it felt rushed and left them both with a weakened relationship. This did not show at all, as their relationship is basically rising every single episode in season 4.  Many people are giving this season a -1 for lackluster episodes. I am mainly thinking about the mid-episodes where Louise, Saito, Tabitha, and last but not least Siesta is at their mansion. These episodes, are episodes I really like. For me, a person who really falls in love with characters, these are golden. I really enjoy just watching the characters enjoy themselves, and I really enjoy watching Saito and Louise getting together. I personally give more positives due to the season having time for relaxed pure good-feel episodes with lots of HILARIOUS harem.  In this season, I believe everything improved. Especially the humour. I was actually laughing quite a lot. If you have already finished the season, I am especially thinking of when Tifa enters the room and can't fit her dress on, Louise goes to help, and her dress just falls off whipping her boobs out. Saito's face really got me.  Not just this, but now that Louise treating Saito as a dog became more rarely, it got humourus when she actually did. And as the season progressed in many ways, I also had the feeling that he deserved it. Not like he did in the first seasons, where in my opinion wished Saito to dump Louise and go away with Siesta.  Siesta is one of the best developed characters in the anime if you ask me. Her personality is so easy to spot and is really amazingly developed in a way that you feel like you really, really know her. She is a very humourus character. I can't count how many times she made me laugh this season, and each laugh made me love her more. This one scene, when Louise and Siesta is talking about what I remember as potentional enemies, and Siesta brings up Tabitha's dragon. When Siesta impersonates the dragon, is the best Siesta moment in my opinion. (If anyone has a YT clip or gif from this, please PM me as I really wanna see this again.)  As it goes for the op song in this season, I have to say I am a bit disappointed. It did not live up to it's previous season 3 op, and of course First kiss from season 1. FIRST KISS KARA HAJIMARU!  The ending was for me, settling. I love endings that leave you fed up (not in a bad way) with the anime. There are no questions to be answered, and everything went as you had hoped. This ending had that, and I loved every second of the last couple of episodes.  As an ending to my review, I thank the developers of this anime for an amazing ride. I am very glad I picked this anime up, and I am very glad I continued watching after a lackluster season 1. This anime and especially season 4, have given me tons of laughs and tears. Tears of sadness and joy from the last episode.;Recommended
8;Zero no Tsukaima F;pacdmaster;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pacdmaster;10;*As you read please note that the familiar of zero and FOZ are the same thing as Zero no Tsukaima*  As a finale of a (to say the least) LEGENDARY series in the familiar of zero i had very high expectations. I say that my expectations were above met. You should already know what the familiar of zero (FOZ) is all about but if you don't go ahead and watch the first 3 seasons before you read this.  Story-9/10 With all the annoying things from the 2nd and 3rd seasons (most having to do with being repetitive) I say do it again, push the boundaries of love (and viewer morals) as far as they can go and see beautiful things come from it. I say that the plot is great but i don't know how many times i seen the same dang recipe in which you screw up then you make up and from that it's it only flaw. But there were some new twists here and there.  Art and Sound-10/10 I cant say that i'm a big critic when it comes to sound but i like both the opening and closing themes. As well as the background music that fits the mood of the scene. All animations were crisp and clean and characters were all looking up-to-par.  Character-9/10 Characters are probably one of the hugest advantages over animes. I got to say i did not like some of the characters from the start (I'm looking at you Mr. de Gramont) but over time they start to build on you and you accept them. But some characters i think get in the way with the plot and friendships too many times.  Enjoyment-10/10! If i could give the enjoyment anything higher i would, but a 10 would have to do. Ah the memories as i look back at this season is such feeling of overwhelming joy. You will laugh, you will be in a state of awe, you will maybe even shed a tear. YOU WILL ENJOY THE FAMILIAR OF ZERO!  Overall-10/10 This anime shot to the tops of my favorite list for many reasons, it was funny and had romance, loved both of the main characters, and the exact last moment of the last episode led you wanting an extra episode (which can be good). It was just a excellent conclusion to a even more excellent series. If you for any reason are thinking about ignoring the conclusion then DON'T!-Dennis;Recommended
9;Zero no Tsukaima F;Zhango;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zhango;7;I have watched the first three seasons of the anime, and was actually awaiting the final season of Zero no Tsukaima witho a lot anticipation. I will address each of the following elements in order:  Story (5)  The plot of the final season is borderline nothing special to a disappointment. The character interactions are just basically repeated. The females that were all gaga over Saito continue to fight for his love and every episode has its share of big boobs. I was very disappointed in the way the story line tossed away the struggle against Joseph, King of Galia. Compared to the stories behind the previous seasons, the final season seems like it's composed of 6 legit episodes and then 6 fillers.  Art (7)  The artwork is the same as it has been in the previous seasons. I never regarded the art in this anime a masterpiece, but I didn't hate it either. It's alright.  Sound (7)  The music does get very repetitive depending on the style of the scene, but the previous seasons of this anime have already prepared me to expect this so there wasn't any disappointment there. Given the mediocre storytelling, I guess the makers complimented it with mediocre sound choices.  Character (7)  Some new characters are introduces and they are as cliche as you will find them in any anime. If you have seen previous seasons, then the characters remain pretty much the same as they were.  Enjoyment (7)  It's definitely enjoyable. I don't think anyone was expecting a masterpiece out of this one.  Overall (7)  Viewers may find this season a bit disappointing if they were anticipating it. Upon closer examination, the final season is really what we all expected: a light, entertaining, cliche, conclusion to the Familiar of Zero series. Not too good. Not bad. Meh.;Recommended
10;Zero no Tsukaima F;Karffebon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Karffebon;9;This is a great ending, to one of the most enjoyable anime out there, the story is not the most complex, but it is simple and different, and it follows the previous seasons very well. This season had a lot of romance too, and some nice action scenes Zero no tsukaima F concludes the story in a great way and like I said it may not have the best plot or characters, but it is very enjoyable and fun to watch, the mix of comedy romance action and fan service is very good, if you don't like ecchi it might annoy you, but if you got over to the last season then it won't be a problem. Story(9/10) - Great, has a good ammount of romance, it has a great ending and yu get to see character development. Art (9/10) - pretty good, beautiful characters, good animation but not perfect, some details on animation make it a 9 instead of a 10. Sound (8/10) - Great voice acting, the music is good but not great. Character (9/10) - Even though they are cliche, they feel unique in some way or another, and each character gets some development even though it focuses on the two main characters, we get to see more about the princess and other characters, wich is pretty nice. Even tough louise may get boring at sometimes, she is still very enjoyable. Overall (9/10) - One of the most enjoyable anime to watch ever, even tough it may be cliche at some times, it will be enjoyable and fun to watch till the very end, and the beautiful romance between the two main characters is a plus.;Recommended
11;Zero no Tsukaima F;Drew7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Drew7;8;Zero no Tsukiama is a harem with lots of ecchi.  That is probably the deciding factor on whether people will watch this series.  For those of you that enjoy watching a guy win the hearts of the ladies and get some fan service in the process..Zero no Tsukaima is a light-hearted journey of consistent humor that never really changes.   As for the entire series. S1 and S2 are both good. S3 was terrible (it honestly felt like a waste of time and without purpose). S4 goes back to being as good as S1 and S2.  S4 (F) Wraps up our plot. Ends our journey and overall will leave you likely satisfied and if you've watched the previous seasons the ending is fairly guessable, but good.  Why does this anime get a 9 overall from me?  It was a fun anime to watch. I loved the plot in S1 and despite a bunch of overused humor throughout the series it was a decent watch.  Characters were the best in S1 and S2, S3 and S4 leaves only small changes and is more about the plot and humor.  Sound. Average. Nothing really to remember, but not terrible.  Art. A fun and light style that works well and looks good.  Story. Ok lets face it. The story in S4 is complete crap. I gave it a mediocre to be nice. Its not really the reason we watch this anime though.  Overall Zero is a unique journey that many viewers will enjoy.;Recommended
12;Zero no Tsukaima F;YRUBetter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YRUBetter;9;"The fourth and final season of The Familiar of Zero, where to begin! Im one of those audiences that can really get into an anime, and the fourth season did a very good job in hauling me back in, after the second season let down and the third season sort of comeback, i had my disbelief's but I am more than glad I stuck with it!  For those who are questioning if you should stick and watch the final season I am telling, no, I am begging you to continue and enjoy it. Yes, the previous seasons had their ups and downs but after recently finishing the last season, let me say i can't find anything I did not truly enjoy about it. No stupid moments, no let downs, happy endings, the whole works, they delivered and I am so happy!  I am going to be biased a little, as I am a big fan of harems and rom coms', I don't know why but they just click with me, I am just saying that as I might get more than a little carried away here. I was definitely not expecting all of the various relationships through the series. With most harems, yes all of the characters have one or so episode about background story and how they fall in love with the main character, but I love how through all four seasons of The Familiar of Zero, everyone develops continuously, they aren't shoved to the side. Yes this does not have anything about the final season, so why talk about it? I want to comment about how all the characters, and how they all end up happy with only one of the characters being paired up with the main character. In most harems, I find that all of the girls who are ""not chosen"" are left on the spot, with only an episode about how they are let down and not really touched on anymore. The final season did more than a wonderful job at concluding the romances through the various characters, and they are not left on the spot all alone just being a ""third wheel"" to the couple. Its hard to explain without getting into detail so I suggest watching and learn what the heck I am talking about!  The final thing I want to comment on is the second final episode, I am not going to spoil it but something happens. It angers me very much the writers made it out to be the way it was, however, I also praise them on the wonderful work they did at how they did it and how they finished it with the final episode, I am very happy they made me jump my seat screaming at the computer, and I hope that future anime's that I watch draw me in, in such a peculiar manner that the Familiar of Zero F did.  Overall well done, you have my thanks for another great anime!";Recommended
13;Zero no Tsukaima F;Saruwatari-san;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saruwatari-san;7;Zero no Tsukaima F is the fourth season of Zero no Tsukaima series . As the final season for this series , i gotta say that nothing change really . From the story plot , to the characters plot and mostly everything . It's like an episodic anime from season to season . That being said , it's still a good anime .  Story:7 After the event from last season , Saito now have to face Joseph , who is trying to have a war . After the most shortest battle ever with Joseph , war was stopped and peace is finally a dream come true . Tifa , the elf girl who tried to summon her Familiar , summoned Saito instead . This is where the stories of the rune of God's Heart , Lifdrasir begins . The story plot have too many flaws that i don't understand why didn't they fix it . Laziness could be one of the answer here .  Art:7 Basically the same as before . Nothing has been upgraded or anything . Got some nice 3D animation which is nice .  Sound:8 Same voice actor and actress . They got some nice OST that have a thrill effect . Same goes with OP and ED . I like the OP better .  Character:7 Nothing change like before . They introduce us with some new characters like Luctiana , another elf girl who have some connection with Tifa somehow , Vittorio Serevare , another void mage who is known as the holiness or Pope and more . They also got some more ''Melons'' boobs than ''Lemons'' one which is obvious . That's all really . Nothing change at all .  Enjoyment:8 From what i have seen , i didn't enjoy it much for a few episodes of it . After some more episodes , i enjoy it just fine . The comedy is as funny as before . The romance are kind of uninteresting here . Why ? From my point of view , what they tried to do is like this . Make the lovers , Louise and Saito of course , fight in some way like making Louise find out that the Queen herself , Henrietta , kiss Saito and making Louise cry . After that , they make up . Not long after that , they fight again . The cycle continues . That is not what romance or love story is all about . I think Romance are only serve as a side dish here . Good thing the ending was a happy one . The harem is as always , Harem-licious . The fight scenes are okay i guess .  Overall:7 As a fan of Zero no Tsukaima series , i can say that this is a must watch but don't put too much hope for this one . It's one of those anime where you're either like it or hate it . I like it but i wish they could have been better . Can't do anything about it now because the series has ended . What's done is done i guess .;Recommended
14;Zero no Tsukaima F;evilduck321;https://myanimelist.net/profile/evilduck321;9;"This is the first review i've ever done and it will be spoiler free, and even though ive watched anime that were arguable better than this i felt obligated to right this review.  Since this is the fourth season of the series im assuming everyone reading this has watched all four. But if for some reason your reading this and haven't i will say it is a must watch.  Most people will think giving this a 10 is really overrating the anime. But the reason it felt necessary was how this last season made it all worth it. when you watched (or watch) the first season you think ""ok that was pretty good, ill give the rest of the series a try"". Then season 2 comes around and you think ""well once again pretty good, but feels a little repetitive"". now season three rolls around and you like ""alright how many times are you gonna do the same thing, this is still entertaining but getting ridiculous"". But at this point dont make the same mistake i did and put off the last season. I cant really place my finger on what exactly it was, maybe putting all the time into this anime and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. But of all the anime ive watch (which at this point is about 100) this is the most satisfying last six episodes i have ever seen. it makes you look back at the last three seasons and think ""ok, that was definitely worth it, and really not that bad in the first place"". Most people who dont like this show cant see past the fan service or repetitive jokes, but if you can i promise it will be worth it.";Recommended
15;Zero no Tsukaima F;Zelie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zelie;8;"[ I said that this is a review on the anime Zero no Tsukaima , all seasons included ! I just thought it was better to do this review on the page of last season , here ] [ I also want to apologize for my bad English but I am French and this is my first review] First, I do not seem to realize that I watched four whole seasons ! I found it a lot, so you have to have time to spend . The positive point is that the characters and their feelings change over time, new characters arrive , the plot extends again, and again ... It is very difficult to give an opinion on the entire 4 seasons of this anime, because I totally do not remember any of the episodes. If I had to give an overall opinion, I enjoyed this series, even if the theme and the characters were a little too "" medieval "" for my taste.  [ SPOILERS ] I must confess that the first season, I really did not like the character of Louise ( I saw it as a kid a little capricious, still typing on his familiar ) . But the seasons , she became one of my favorite characters . Many times, she wanted to be nice to Saito, but she always found to fricoter with other girls (but sometimes there was a bit forced ) . I admired the attitude towards the Princess Louise Henrietta , she was extremely modest and very committed to his country. Like what, finally , she is a good person, who knows how to respect . After each of his personality . For me, Saito 's still obsessed . Always watching chest girls, without even listening to what they have to say sometimes! I understand he is a normal boy from Japan , not having had an education aristocrat , but still. I did not understand either why all the main girls fall completely in love with him ... ( Tabitha fell in my opinion ) I guess it is because it is Gandalf and he saved the country and beat all the bad guys. The good thing about this character is that it has a determination and an outstanding courage, who rarely lose . For other characters, I have almost every popular , I think ( at the tall blonde sister Louise , it irritates me one! Always make moral lessons ... ) After that, the love between the two main characters is real, despite the stories and deceptions. I found even more cute sometimes. The scenes in which they declared their love and everything, it was very romantic (even if it just after shouting at each ) . I must admit that, despite everything , I really loved the episode 12 of season 2 ... I found it sad ... and super exciting to the end! (even if it goes unfortunately twist) . This episod remain my favorite. For the end of this anime ( episode 12 , season 4), it was not really to my taste ... coincidentally, this is the day of solar eclipse. And then a plane with missiles, it does not fly like that is a snap! I found it a bit surreal . [ SPOILERS ]  To conclude , I think Zero no Tsukaima (globally) is a kind of fairy tale version of manga, a little futuristic, with lots of fan service. In fact it is a bit like the story of a prince who must protect a princess (unless it is a familiar and often beaten up because he is cheating ) . Frankly, I do not regret watching this anime . The 4 seasons of Zero no Tsukaima , I give 7.5 (This note does not appear on this site, it's a personal note). Yes , this is exactly the note should . In this season , I give 8 ( this is the note that appears at the top because I 'm still on page Zero no Tsukaima F). I have great hesitation to write this review . I just wanted to express my opinion because I 've seen a lot of people did. In the end , I just think a long comment. Sorry if you find me boring or dull , but I do not like magazines too serious . If you read it , thank you , if you have not read , I do not want you at all!";Recommended
16;Zero no Tsukaima F;TabiNoTochuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TabiNoTochuu;10;Zero no Tsukaima was a series I started on a whim. I really didn't have too many expectations for it.  My love for this series has grown since watching the first episode. Since then, I've finished the rest of the seasons and anxiously awaited each episode of the Final season as it came out. In my honest opinion, this was the best season out of all of them, mainly because it just met and exceeded every single one of my expectations.  Story: 9/10 Zero no Tsukaima F starts off where Princess no Rondo left off, but with a few new twists thrown in. First off was how Saito managed to become the familiar of both Tiffa and Louise, due to an accident. This newfound power come in handy, as discovered when Louise uses her newest void power. However, it comes at a heavy price. Near the end of the series, Louise does something that, I'm sure, made just about everyone scream out in frustration. She sends Saito back to his world. Overall, I thought the storyline was pretty good, but there was definitively places where it seemed rather rushed, especially in the last episode. (I really can't see Siesta, Tiffa, Tabitha, and Henrietta getting over Saito choosing Louise THAT easily.)  Art: 9/10 If you've seen any other season of Zero no Tsukaima (Which I will assume you have), the art is the same. Nothing new, nothing old.  Sound: 10/10 The music in Zero no Tsukaima F is perfect in every way. The music itself, as well as the places where it's played, adds to the effect of the scenes very well. There is nothing at all to complain about here.  Character: 9/10 Being the last season, I really didn't think there would be any form of character development. I didn't know how wrong I would be. Louise decides, against her own feelings, and sends Saito back to his world. Saito, upon his return, actually (finally) conveys his true feelings for Louise, and asks for her hand in marriage (Cmon... we ALL saw that coming! :D). The only real complaint I have is in the end. I can see how the other girls after Saito would accept his choice, but not as easily as they did... (I'm not really complaining though, since Saito has to be with Louise. No exceptions.)  Enjoyment: 10/10 However sad I might be that this is the last season, I enjoyed Zero no Tsukaima F greatly. The mixture of fast-paced action, along with the new plot twists thrown in made the story extremely enjoyable. But, the part I loved the most was, you guessed it, the very end. Louise uses her void powers to bring them back to Tokyo! A happy ending for an amazing series.  Even though I anticipated what would happen at the last episode, I still can't help but just go D'AWWWWWW in the final 5-6 minutes. I loved it, it was amazing, and there's nothing else I can say but this. GO WATCH IT!;Recommended
17;Zero no Tsukaima F;iHateAnimeBro;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iHateAnimeBro;8;"Zero no Tsukaima F is just MORE than any other season of the series. MORE harem, MORE ecchi, MORE cute scenes, MORE wholesome scenes. Zero no Tsukaima F feels just better than any other previous season, however not in every aspect.  The plot makes much less sense than before. Fights seem to be forced, as creators didn't really have much idea, what can be done in this season. There are fewer fights overall and fight scenes are kind of more in the background than before. The story with the elves and dragon are absolutely from nowhere, making the whole story even more nonsense. A number of miracles and lucky coincidences during the story have gone up to the ceiling, even for an anime. Don't get me wrong, I like how often anime story is ""too perfect"" or ""too good to be true"", but here it is done to the unhealthy level. As I'm usually saying, I'm watching anime to have a good time, not to point out every mistake in the story, so I didn't attach much importance to this fact.  The whole story has its happy, cute ending, however, it feels a little bit rushed, while the middle episodes of the season are just fillers and give nothing to the plot. I feel like the last episode could be split in two, which would be much better for the overall story. The story is also way too much predictable (still!), but I think I am used to it now.  The characters development in the last season is great. Louise is finally a ""healthy"" tsundere (if that's even a thing) and isn't anymore annoying, as in the previous seasons. They, with Saito, finally realize and show their feelings (as they should), which makes the whole thing much more cute and enjoyable.  Art and sound quality are high. We see some changes in the art compared to the 3 previous seasons, but they are really minor, sometimes hard to notice (I still like the old art a little bit more than the new one). The sound was great throughout the whole series and there's no exception in Zero no Tsukaima F. It builds up the tension correctly, it makes the whole anime much more attractive. Nothing to add here.  Overall enjoyment is high (surprisingly after 3rd season). In some ways I liked the fourth season the most from the series, but also I have this kind of melancholic feeling for the first one. Both have some flaws, both are good in many ways. If you are not a fan of the series, you wouldn't probably find this season interesting too. I liked Zero no Tsukaima from the very first episode and I don't regret any minute spent watching this series.  Another fine anime to my ""rewatch"" list.";Recommended
18;Zero no Tsukaima F;Zephyrat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zephyrat;7;"*WARNING: Will Contain Spoilers* This is my review for the final episode of Zero No Tsukaima.  So, the final episode of the entire series of Zero No Tsukaima, it made me sad that it was ending, I really loved the series from season 1. The relationship that was built between Louise and Saito, the troubleshot Louise has in showing her love for Saito. Saito's love for her and his friends which Louise takes both the right and wrong ways.  Continuing on to the final episode, The Dragon is on its way to the Magic Academy to eat the two Void Mages (Tiffa and Louise). Saito; however, is trapped in the Human realm because Louise sent him back in order to save him! ""Sacrifices For Love"" which is a recurring theme throughout the whole series. Saito is down in the dumps and wants to go back and save Louise and his new ""home"". Luckily for Saito, there's a LUNAR ECLIPSE! Who would've guessed! Using the logic from the past series, if there's a Solar Eclipse he go back to the human world from the Magic world, if there's a Lunar eclipse he can go back to the magic world from the human world.  They never showed how Saito got that Fighter Jet besides him getting dropped off at the air base, so we can assume he got passed all the security peoples. So he flies towards the Lunar eclipse and VOILA he's back in the magic world, hooray! Louise is almost about to die, blah, blah, blah, Saito saves her, they kill the dragon, they get married, the end... Close cut ending nothing else happens. BUT WAIT! Louise takes them back to the human world and they explore and have fun, finally they go to where Saito used to live, Saito rings the gate bell, the end.  I think it ended abruptly, I wish they really showed the interaction between Saito, his wife (Louise), and his family. Hopefully they'll make a OVA showing this. I didn't really like the ending but one can hope that Saito gets lucky with all the girls, if you catch my drift ;) Forever Otaku...";Recommended

0;Zero no Tsukaima F;trillshit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trillshit;5;"The final spell is...! Explosion...again?  AUTHOR'S NOTE: With 4 seasons under its belt, Zero no Tsukaima has quite the history of being a popular anime. I'm not a fan of magic/fantasy animes but the first season impressed me enough to continue watching the 2nd and 3rd season. The reason why I want to take the final season into account is to wrap Zero no Tsukaima up in a package and show you why it fell into oblivion in its final premise.  STORY (5/10): It was expected. Before I even touched the first episode, I closed my eyes and used my clairvoyant magic to predict what this story would be about. Miraculously, I was able to stay ten steps ahead of the anime, as it went on. An anime with such predictable plot can't be enjoyed, as viewers like twist and surprises (unless, you don't...?). I was able to hold my patience for the 1st season, but I had already grown tired of the repetitive storyline at the middle of the 2nd season. I had hoped at the final season, the writers would come up with a well-crafted ending. No, it was not a well-crafted ending, in fact, it left me sitting there unsatisfied and possibly annoyed. For the last season, the writers somehow mustered all of their powers to create as much plot holes as possible, in order to create their own disastrous ending. Even with two worlds they could play with (the real world vs the magic world), the writers could not handle such large responsibilities and decided to keep Japan out of the loop until the very end of the anime.  There is no storyline in the final season. In 12 episodes, many of them were fillers, while the real plot felt like Groundhog Day, cases of villainy acts which are outdone by the magical words: deux ex machina. This anime should have been re-titled: ""Zero, the Duex ex Machina"" because that's all you are going to see in the battles in Zero no Tsukaima F.  ART (5/10): A lot of laziness. Since the final season mostly focuses on Halkeginia, we see copy and paste backgrounds and recycled animations. What were the production team thinking? I highly doubt the art will impress viewers, especially if you have been watching the previous seasons. It's the same old, same old. Dull and inexpensive, even the Academy, which looked detailed and beautiful in the first season now looks like a Barbie playhouse.  The action scenes aren't very moving either. And with half of the episodes being fillers, we don't get to see much action. In fact, the only notable scene in the final season is the final battle...though it's not impressive at all.  SOUND (8/10): Ichiko and Rie Kugimiya must be amazing artists (they are), as they were featured in the OP and the EP for all four seasons. I've enjoyed all of the OPs and EPs in the Zero no Tsukaima series and was pleasantly surprised that they were all sung by these two wonderful artists. The OP ""I'll Be There For You"" by Ichiko has an adventurous melody which keeps the viewers interested and pumped up while the EP ""Kiss Shite Agenai"" sung by Kugimiya is catchy and bouncy, which brings the anime to a nice close. However, it does get awkward when the anime begins to take its cliffhangers to a darker turn. The EP seems to disturb whatever emotions the anime tried to display.  CHARACTERS (5/10): Saito Hiraga has been our main hero of Zero no Tsukaima for four seasons. Throughout these years, I've tried to comprehend and analyze his personality and his growth. You want to know what I found out? He's a tortured boy, leashed and whipped by a girl who has a permanent, problematic personality called here in America...well, a bitch. Now, I know that may sound misogynistic but hear me out, ladies. I don't care how much you love your man, but if you have any of the personalities of the characters here in Zero no Tsukaima -- please get out of my face. That is extremely unattractive. And having to see Saito still fall for any of these characters is utterly baffling. Despite his mysterious charm towards Louise and the other weirdos in the anime, I applaud his loyalty and patience.  Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is our main heroine. Despite her fancy, bourgeoisie, exaggerated name, her personality does not match to that caliber. If there was a game called ""Tsundere"", Louise would be the final boss. A complete super-ultra tsundere, she may become your favorite anime character (if you're an M) or you may want to slap her upside the head and tell her to shut up (if you're an S). However, she does a cute side to her -- just don't provoke her or speak of, think of, or touch another woman. Whether it was a misunderstanding or your true intentions, our heroine will pour down her wrath on you before listening to your reasoning, no matter how convincing they are.  The villains in Zero no Tsukaima F are not interesting at all. Actually, if you technically take out the characters that have died off extremely quickly or allied with the hero/heroine, there is only one villain in the entire season, which is complete laziness on the production team's part.  I feel like we are supposed to learn from the allies and friends more than the hero/heroine. They are willing to sacrifice limbs in order to protect the main characters and we see this in each episode consecutively. Whether they are love rivals, or ex-villains, they always give way to the main characters so they can shine.  OVERALL (5/10): I've had my share of fun in the first and second season, but it has become too bland. It's like taking a lick of a never-ending lollipop (Tootsie-pop, anyone?). The Zero no Tsukaima series has given us the perfect picture of a well-versed anime with a lot of potential, slowly rotting around the edges. Although I've tried to recall the comedy and romantic moments, I couldn't fully enjoy the final season due to its poor execution.  *cough* Louise is overrated. *cough*";Mixed Feelings
1;Zero no Tsukaima F;Temere;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Temere;6;Well its been a massive roller coaster of The Magical Misadventures of Saito and friends. Still left to wonder how this managed to get a budget enough to make 4 seasons of it.  Season fours story stick to that of previous in the fact of when something happens it only stays for an episode, two if you're lucky. However the finale does hold out for almost an entire four episodes for the final climax of the season, a new record as far as this series is concerned. Doesn't stop the fact it seems like each episode could have been only 6 minutes long if you cut out all the pointless scenes.  Art, and the term is used loosely, has barely improved and in some areas it seemed to have gotten worse. Most notable on faces, half the time they lack any real emotion or they were so crudely done you cant see half of it. Then there's the little moments, such as hair waving when dancing, moves a hell of a lot more than it really should.  Music went back to its season 2 type. Good proper pieces that didn't end in just a minute or two, it lasted though the duration of the scene or battle. It however doesn't stop that some sounds and light pieces are reused a few times too many and still the faint lurking sound of background static during slow silent scenes, should you have ears and headphone acute enough to notice it.  Character brought in some new developments as there was one part it could have turned into a massive romantic drama scandal or taken a huge twist on the main characters love life. but it's quickly dismissed later on as if it never happened which is utterly mind boggling as to why something meant to be a serious thing is brushed off as a minor issue. And this doesn't happen just once, it happens a few times throughout this season, some worse than others but they're more or less treated the same way.  Overall enjoyment when going into this season was low. Personal note, i just wanted it over and done with and ended up taking a two week hiatus from it. But upon returning to finish the final few episodes, it was pleasing to see that it actually picked up on its action, story and drama to the point where it actually got rather interesting. Apart form the fact of the realism when obtaining such high grade weapons, goes completely out the window and more dead things return from the grave than a zombie movie, it was a much improved ending other previous seasons as greatly acceptable considering the disappointment of its predecessors.;Mixed Feelings
2;Zero no Tsukaima F;NoobSoul48;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NoobSoul48;6;This anime series would have been a 10/10 for me if not for one person bringing the entire show down.  That person is Louise. let me explain. (spoilers obviously)   This anime was a lot of fun to watch as far as the plot goes. good believable characters staying true to their character when events unfolded. You have saito, a badass mc with a dynamic harem who is actually decisive for once and can see why ladies fall for him...is what I would have said if he was actually the mc. No the mc is louise because she summons saito as her familiar and has the same problems like your typical harem protagonist. She is weak, indecisive, undeserving, and most of all stupid. Sure saito gets the spotlight but the bottom line is he exists for louise. The fact he can and did die while louise has that mc plot armor to save her ass after making stupid decisions time and time again kind of seals the mc deal to me.  Now before I get into why I just hate louise and how she ruins the entire series for me, I need to explain why I don't blame saito for some of the stupid things he does nor any of the other girls in his fake but rather dynamic harem. Let's start with Saito.  Here is a guy who has been summoned into a completely different world to serve as some girl's slave. He took it pretty well and even lives up to the title as familiar. He even dies for this girl and her world while at the same time, even washes the girl's dirty pantsus. Don't get me wrong, dude has flaws and does things he shouldn't that hurts louise but at the same time, I understand why he does such things. Louise is no doubt, abusive towards him and constantly rewards his attempts to please her by overreacting explosions. By the 3rd season, she starts kicking the balls which is never ok towards the guy you love and plain to have children with. The girls who were throwing themselves at saito were serious threats to their relationship by rewarding him when Louise should have been the one to do so.  Now to discuss why I don't hate any of the women throwing themselves at saito. The nature of saito's harem is very dynamic and just doesn't happen for no reason. It happens over time with each female having believable reasons why they want to pursue him when they know he is serious about louise. Hell two of the ladies fell off the harem wagon due to other interests/wanting to support another member of saito's harem. I have read many reviews/opinions/polls angry at these ladies for trying to get with saito but if one saw from the ladies point of view, it makes perfect sense for why they would go after saito which is they all, at some level, think saito can do better.  Queen Henrietta goes for him because louise doesn't treasure saito who could die at any moment like her childhood love did. Saito literally dies fighting against 70,000 dudes just to make sure they all escape and next week louise is casting explosion on saito as soon as he comes back alive to go home to her.  Then there is Siesta the maid(best girl seriously) who knows she has to be aggressive if she wants to win saito. In a world where nobles treat her like shit, Saito is a shinning star in her world. He is a man that did not care what nobles thought of him and treated commoners kindly. Just about every commoner treat him like he is their champion for his actions and it doesn't help he has earned himself a title that puts him in the same, if not, higher standing to nobles. To her, she constantly sees a good man being treated horribly by a noble and wants to free him like he saved her from a bad noble as well.  Tiffa is a shy sheltered elf girl that happens to cast phoenix down on saito. She didn't go for saito at first and the relationship between them was purely an innocent one. well more on her side than his but still. It wasn't till saito kept making an impression on her and helping her meet new people that feelings started to develop. For a girl who didn't have her own familiar yet, she was envious that louise got such a great familiar only for her to treat him badly in her eyes. All she ever saw was louise casting explosion/kicking saito in the nuts. It's no wonder she wanted to go for saito too.  Finally there is Tabathia/Charlotte who joined the harem wagon during the events in season 3 because of saito not only forgiving her, but also going to personally save her from her uncle. It may seem to make no sense for her to fall for saito but for me, it's all too clear and it leads to the final problem I have with louise. Tabathia knows she can be a far more capable partner for saito than louise ever was. Throughout the entire series, Saito pretty much did all of the work while louise constantly kept getting them into danger, Like running off into deep dark woods by herself, going to places where she is clearly the target, trying to beat people with her shit skills only for her to get captured making saito's job as a familiar way harder. During the time saito was training his knights, know what louise was doing? being pissed she doesn't get to spend time with saito instead of, you know, train to develop her new void mage powers. like 90% of plot could have been solved if she would have just trained. Know why when Tabathia saves them, she actually does it? it's because she read some books and practicing her magic like lousie should have been doing. So in Tabathia's mind, louise doesn't deserve a familiar like saito and because she works hard, believes she can protect saito better because she has been doing it since season 1.   That is why I give this anime a 6 because if louise would have just tried to be a better mage, tried to be less abusive, tried to realize that even though some fault lies with saito for not resisting these women harder, that he shouldn't be treated like that due to the women in question making moves on him, I would have enjoyed the series more. At least their relationship does mature a little in the 4th season but honestly, the story felt like, in the end, saito was going to get stolen and with very good reason.  anyway I do say it's not a bad anime at the end of it all and one should give it a chance.;Mixed Feelings
3;Zero no Tsukaima F;remembrance;https://myanimelist.net/profile/remembrance;6;I am going to make this a review about all four seasons of Zero no Tsukaima (while mainly focusing on this one) and I am going to try doing this without giving away any spoilers if possible. Zero no Tsukaima is an anime with incredible potential. What I mean by that is, if it dropped all the nonsense (fan service and repetition for instance) and focused on the story and such, it could have been amazing. It has some moments of clarity where it focuses on the story and the characters and when it does that, it is brilliant. (But it usually lasts just for a few minutes and that's a shame.)  Story:  Long story short, the story is basically about a boy who finds himself in another world, in this place no one speaks his language and he has no idea what's going on or how the got there. An accident gives him the ability to understand this strange language and he learns he has been summoned as a familiar to a mage and since most familiars are animals of some kind and a human familiar is (almost) unheard of, he is being threaded like an animal. By another accident he finds out being a familiar gives him special abilities. Basically an ability to use all weapons. So far so good right? Wrong, creators of the anime doesn't know a thing about storytelling. So usually the show is riddled by moments what a 10 year old would consider kinky and funny. This usually happens on every episode, several times. On top of that, this usually ruins whats supposed to be emotional moments. An act of heroism, an act of sacrifice, and boom, same nonsense about being funny and kinky. This is one of the rare shows that would benefit from a fan recut. Take out all the nonsense, rearrange some scenes and focus on the story a bit more. But I digress. As far as I understand, if the anime fallowed the original material properly, most of these issues would be resolved, but alas it didn't go that way.  Art:  Art is usually good overall. Colors can get a bit too bright or too dull at times, but thats to be expected. Not much bad, nothing groundbreaking, just fine.  Sound:  I wasn't able to find anything wrong with the sound other than some characters sounding annoying, so moving on.  Character:  How do I put this... Characters are fine but incredibly inconsistent. They seem to forget all about their past, their motivation and their abilities all the time. Also, there are many moments where character development gets abandoned simply to put forward the harem side of the anime. Which is especially stupid since the protagonist has already picked the main girl. Also, there is an issue with characters appearing once and being forgotten by the next episode. From what I gather, this is mostly do to anime not truly fallowing the original material where most of these issues not present.  Enjoyment:  You can actually enjoy this anime if you skip some of the terrible and annoying repetitive stuff. I tried watching it that way for the second time around and it really improved my enjoyment of it.  Overall:  This anime has great potential but fails to deliver because after a while it becomes incredibly repetitive. But if you have time to waste, it is a good enough anime to watch.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zero no Tsukaima F;Mantzy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mantzy;6;"Meh, so if you're reading this you've probably watched the other 3 seasons of Louise and chums, and if you haven't, watch those first. Firstly as you'll understand what's going on and second, as this show gets progressively worse with every season.  I can only rate it as mediocre at best and somewhat dissapointing. It may have been a while since I watched the previous seasons but I'm sure this season relied more heavily on fan-service. Which isn't always a bad thing, especially if you enjoy boob comedy (or lack of) and tsunderes, but if it's in lieu of a decent story then it can get a bit weak over 12 episodes. They probably shouldn't have bothered.  So yeah, watch it if you like Louise, Tifa or Siesta, or their seiyuus but other than that, it's a bit poor and really, as a swan-song, it could/should have been better.  I've given it 6/10; was probably being kind.";Mixed Feelings
5;Zero no Tsukaima F;--Kaori--;https://myanimelist.net/profile/--Kaori--;6;This review assumes you have seen seasons 1-3 and may reference some or all of my past reviews for the entirety of this series. This review WILL contain spoilers for Season 4.  Let me start off by saying I love/really like The Familiar of Zero series, if i didn't i wouldn't have watched the entire 48 episodes worth of it + the OVA and the other stuff in this series such as the 7 short episodes of the Tristain Love Theater. Side note, that's prolly canon, when and where and why it takes place no one can say, my review on it wasn't sure if it's canon and pointed out something but given what S4 did, i feel its prolly canon. Anyway, with that outta the way let's start the review...  The Familiar of Zero F (F for final because it's the final entry in the series) for me was a let down, and its ending was incredibly rushed. I've heard the manga for the series is much better and the anime changed up a lot, especially with people's character growth/personality, namely Saito, I'm unsure how true that is as I only saw it in a review and i ahve no intention of reading the manga (I'm not into reading books so its rare when i do) The The Familiar of Zero series itself has some contradictions and plot holes in its story and also after S1 changes how characters' personalities are. Whats more it pretends certain events never happen just to keep the characters mostly the same so yes, sadly there is little character growth for everyone which is a HUGH disappointment. For example, at the end of S2 Saito saves everyone by sacrificing himself. When he's brought back to life (Which the anime doesn't give much of an explanation involving how that ring did that and plot hole Giche cus he was revived too by that same person but that was never mentioned again), he returns to Louise, whom at the end of that anime has more or less admitted she loves him and can say such. In comes S3 and we're back to Louise: SAITO! YOU PERVERTED HORNY DOG! *EXPLOSION* Saito: AHHHHH! And this continues even through season 4... LOOK! I don't care WHO made this, or was responsible for crap like this. He gave his freakin LIFE for them, Louise KNEW this, was told HARD it was HER FAULT and SHE got him killed and NO ONE who actually LOVES SOMEONE that much would sit there and revert back to as if he didn't give his life and yes S3 confirms he did.  At that point character growth SHOULD have happened but NOPE! In comes plot points that are mostly or entirely just there to add to Saito's growing harem. In S3 Saito legit cheats on louise and i called him cheating scum. S4? He redeems himself somewhat, I won't call him scum but i will call him a cheater and an idiot. (It happens twice) Further more if that wasn't bad enough, the villains behind everything are just, treated as if they are a side plot. That was SERIOUSLY disappointing and they went out with such a whimper it was sad and yes they did die, I kept expecting em 9and another character that died this season) to return but nope, they're dead... not to mention the motive and reason behind why the king did all these terrible things was so bad and sad and just, cheap. He has no reason besides he wants to feel sadness and emotion. His title clearly proceeds him, what an idiot king.  As if THAT shit wasn't bad enough, let's tack on a world ending event plot that's shoe horned in in S4 and make it very cheap, pathetic and sad. Not to mention the final showdown was just, rushed. (I mean last we saw the elves' race was trying to KILL Saito and co, why are they now helping them? This is never sad and i DOUBT that world ending event would actually end the world once it gets what it wants...) This was just poorly done, as was the explanation for WHY Elves hate humans and why humans are scared of elves. Its never really explained properly and when it is somewhat explained, its only for the elves' side, not the human side (Theres a conspiracy/contradiction here)  Let's also not forget the promise Saito made tot he water spirit to return her ring is never kept. Yeah, I seriously was on the look out for that as I had a feeling it wouldn't happen when it got stolen. In S4 its never shown that i noticed, certainly not used or mentioned. So maybe he returned it to her off screen but nothing shows this or confirms this. Maybe it was done in the manga? Either way, it didn't happen in the anime. Further more, last we saw of Louise' parents her father was trying to kill Saito, why is he now ok with them marrying each other? This and the wedding/honeymoon was SO RUSHED it hurt that it wasn't done properly, we need 2-3 more eps, maybe 4-5 for getting the ring back to the spirit... Side note really quick, I guess the wedding Saito & Louise has in S2 wasn't legit, since they mention getting married here in S4. Gotta love dem plot holes and retcons even though it was never actually retcon'd :P  The characters that DO GROW significantly are done mostly off screen. E.g. Why was Zerbert no longer attracted to Saito and why is she now all over and only about Colbert Sensei? How and why did whats his name (The familiar to his holiness) have interest in others and became friends with Saito (To him, to Saito to an extent he still didn't like the guy early on here) and ofc his holiness himself, WHY the frick did he sit there and not help Saito and Tiffa when they were abducted? That's never explained. So many plot holes and shit not explained or properly shown.  I could prolly go on and on about this series many faults, but I won't. I won't explain what i did like about S4 either, but I did still enjoy it, however its faults seriously weigh it down and made it less enjoyable as a result. I rate, The Familiar of Zero F, a 6.0 and give it a Love score of 6.5, both out of a 10.0. I'm glad Saito and Louise finally got some actual character development in S4, even if it should've happened long ago. Ultimately I enjoy the characters and to an extent the world itself, but aside from that i can't tell you why i like this series, it certainly isn't for everyone and is certainly frustrating at times, but for some reason still enjoyable.  Bonus: My most fav moment in this series was seeing Louise in a catgirl outfit and saying she'd be Saito's familiar for the night while saying meow at the end. That pose, reaction and words were just so CUUUUTE!;Mixed Feelings
6;Zero no Tsukaima F;Olej;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Olej;6;Honestly, this anime is one of the better ones I have watched. I mean, there are quite a lot of animes of this genre out there and this is one of the better ones but this season wasn't really satisfying it is like they are still trying to put up the fact that Saito is Saito who loves being Saito and this basically means Louise is still blessed with the Blessing of First Girl from the story. Now let me explain my ratings  Story(3/10) Just like all other Harem Animes the plot barely moves every season let alone watching how it slugs through its plot every episode. Even though rushing through the episodes is just a sad thing to do towards all animes. But honestly, I will suggest this anime only to people who like to see a lot of the girls chest.  Art(7/10) Now, this animes art style is still pretty nice compared to some other animes as it still gives the viewers a sense of happiness with some cute moments animated well. But I still wouldn't give this anime a 10 because I didn't particularly enjoy this anime as a whole and even though this doesn't have anything to do with the review *whispers Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Bladeworks is still the best art wise.  Sound(5/10) The sound in this anime is still the same quality as with most others I have watched. So I have no comment. But just to tell you,the voice actress/actor are not so good as to allow to just listen to the voices and know the story.  Character(4/10) This is a Harem... Need I say more?  Enjoyment(8/10) I enjoyed this anime because I get to see Tabhita oh and Tabhita and Tabhita... Oh wait I can assure you this is a diferent reason Saito. Just Joking, Tabhita :D;Mixed Feelings
7;Zero no Tsukaima F;TDBanimefan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TDBanimefan;5;So I came back to this anime after years, and I do mean years, of not paying it any attention. Truthfully, I should have probably avoided it. This anime isn't bad, it's just average to a boring degree. Top that with it clearly being a product of its time, and you get an average anime with fanservice that no one should go back to. That being said, I enjoyed taking a trip down memory lane myself and there is some value in this title. Just not enough for me to recommend it. That sums it up if you want to stop reading, more details are below otherwise.  Story: 4/10 The story, if you can call it that, is built on a very interesting premise. A Japanese boy is pulled into a medieval world of mages by a failed mage student. He becomes her familiar and chaos ensues. Unfortunately, that is just about it for the intrigue. The characters their selves have weird motivations and don't feel real. The world is bland and largely unexplored or fleshed out. There is kind of a main plot, but it doesn't really come into play until later on. Without blood, death, or even injury it has no real grit. Nothing is really gripping for me and falls short.  Art: 5/10 Like the story, pretty bland. Noticed that the character's eyebrows can be seen through their hair, which seems kind of lazy to me. Animation is subpar too, with it being limited by time period and budget. Nothing bad though and, at times, it can be pretty interesting.  My entertainment: 6/10 While it was a bit painful to sit through again, it was just good enough to keep me entertained. This was one of the anime I watched when I was much younger, so there was a good amount of nostalgia for me. Plus fanservice. Always good to see.  Fanservice: 6/10 Shouldn't give this a high score here. All the fanservice is from one character. Just really liked it.  Overall: 5/10 Besides a trip down memory lane, I hate to inform you that this anime just isn't worth resurrecting. It was alright, for it's time. There is a reason why this anime did get sequels, but I can't imagine it gaining enough traction to become relevant again. No one is going to be looking back at this anime like Inuyasha, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, or any other anime of noteworthy. Goodbye Familiar of Zero, I will be one of the few to remember you fondly.

0;Zero no Tsukaima F;GeNESiS-P;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GeNESiS-P;4;"This is my first review, so lets start n_n Zero no Tsukaima F, maybe the worst season of the ZNT series, plus non of al the Zero no tsukaima seasons were never such a masterpiece, but this season, oh, this!... i never expected such piece of... poop. By the way, let's start by sections.  -Character: The same thing as the other season~ ""Saito-Kun i love you"", 2 second later ""Saito-Kun you stupid dog! EXPLOXION KJSJBHJKFDS!"" is really annoying and people get tired of the same thing, sometimes i wish that Louise would be less dumb and pick another one to, at least, make Saito jealous. Also, some of the enemies that are in te OP, they just appear in 3 chapters and they piss me off, they don't do Nothing!they just stand there because yes. The same with others. I think the only extras who did something in the anime were Tiffa and Siesta... But just in an echii way. Characters doesn't exist in this anime: 2  -Art & Animation: I really like the art, i've seen better, but is still something that makes it special, but the problem in this anime is the animation. Sometimes it get's really lazy, maybe animations were made with sony vegas (ba dum tss): 7  -Story: Is nothing new, i've already seen Saito dissapear and then appear again in the previous seasons, a lot of boobs and and the Saito-lovers and blah blah... Really tedious, at least the fight scenes were enough enjoyable to make me put interest in the anime: 3  -Sound: Nothing special, is not bad, actually is good, but is really forgettable: 6  And finally: -Enjoyment: Did i enojoy the anime? no, is as simple as that, no, i didn't enjoy it. The scenes who were comedy"" it was just a box about to explode of fanservice. In all the anime i just laughed at 1 scene. the fight scenes were really ok, if those scenes weren't tedious i would enjoy it more.  -Final Result: the anime is like this: First 8 episodes are fanservice-explosion-conflict-more fanservice- drama-conflict resolved-Fanservice-explosion That's all, the rest of the episodes are just drama-saito's gone-drama-saito's back- conflict resolved- fanservice again. Just like the Third season. It was a waste of time? Mmmmm... let's say yes: 3/10";Not Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima F;Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;3;"Zero no Tsukaima F. The Familiar of Zero F.     I actually had realistic hopes for the final season. Especially since the first 2 episodes were reasonably solid despite the fan service. But this season managed to teach me otherwise.  My conclusion is now as follows. It's a perfect example of descending quality that was pretty weak in the beginning anyway. Season 1 was clearly the best here and it has lost more and more. I can't decide whether season 3 or 4 can now symbolize the worst of the series.   The course of this season was a little different. Compared to the others, this season has had a solid first 2 episodes, whereas it got worse and worse until the end. The closing episodes of this season were therefore also the worst. Whereby it was exactly the other way around with the other seasons.  Besides that, I think it's impressive that this season has managed to make the others seem completely irrelevant. By 1. The antagonist ""King Joseph"" received a completely irrelevant conclusion and almost looked like a side character. And 2. the implementation of the prophecy regarding the ""magician of the void"" has been an abysmal joke. I wont go into Detail here, but it was just waste of ressources.  Spoiler ! - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Story episodes - fan service - even more fan service> a minor event -> you suddenly see Tiffa's nipples ( the anime suddenly need it? -> final boss spawns completely without context and meaningless -> finale begins -> a plot Armor after the other> end. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - - To be honest, I found it impressive and sad at the same time how massive the last episode was and the main thing was that something was brought to the table. They didn't even bother to explain anything and practically had the characters say ""I don't know how and why, but the main thing is that it worked"" - very aptly, honestly, that's how I felt for 4 seasons. -  This is just some amazing level. Only few Anime can be this pointless after all.    Story  You will certainly remember King Joseph, who was involved in all events between seasons 1-3. And also of the prophecy of the magicians of the void. Well nothing was made of it. Not only that Joseph had a completely irrelevant finale, which made all his previous actions appear like filler episodes. No, the prophecy was a bad joke too. Likewise the final fight and the conclusion. To be honest, I can hardly say anything about this, I lack words to describe it.  I don't know if the novel / manga had a different flow and was changed by the studio, but I really hope so.   Animation / images  No significant or positive changes, remained the same level as with the predecessors. Apart from the fact that the first episode had a slightly improved animation style. With Tiffa's breasts, however, they have cut their budget unprecedented.  Characters  In the whole season there was one scene that actually made me proud. It was Louis's decision and mindset regarding Episode 11 and its plot. Completely understandable and I like the way she acted. It was by far her greatest highlight.  Otherwise nothing has changed. The characters remained monotonous. There were still characters that I personally found likeable. Like Guiche, Kirche and ... even Tiffa, as long as she wasn't abused for her hardcore fan service again. Unfortunately, the character jokes remained enormously monotonous and offered no variety. The same thing was chewed on over and over again, just as in dialogues.  At least 20x the same relationship problems between Saito and Louise with no real results. Saito makes out with other women, Louise gets angry, Saito gets angry (expresses amusing comedy scene irony) and follows the relationship crash.  The new characters that you also see in the intro were completely irrelevant. By the end, they raised more questions than they could answer.  Music  To be honest, I find it a bit disappointing that the fairly solid Osts from Seasons 1 and 2 have so rarely been reused. One has often inserted into the alleged main scenes, quite monotonous East, which the scenes could hardly underline. Then I should have played the intro song more often as they did in episode 12, would have had at least influenced the atmosphere a little more positively. As a kind of puzzle / minigame theme that is inserted into character deaths.  Conclusion   You can look at this title, but you shouldn't have any expectations. Let alone, if you didn't like the first season, you should generally keep your hands off it.  Had this work landed in more capable hands, one could have created a very worth seeing anime from the setting and the plot.";Not Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima;Pontifus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pontifus;7;"I decided to watch Zero no Tsukaima because I wanted a leave-your-brain-out-of-the-equation sort of show, one I could sit back and watch without worrying about a negative outcome or depressing and/or disturbing complications. (Yes, for all my talk about artistic integrity and such, I do watch things for pure and simple fun sometimes.) Zero has most of that, but only to a point, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of depth this show manages to pull out of nowhere. I went in expecting another Nanoha, or the first season of Shakugan no Shana all over again, and what I got was something more akin to the comedic romance and character development of Love Hina supported and sustained by the political intrigue of Last Exile or Simoun.  Plot: An incompetent mage summons as her familiar a young man from contemporary Japan, and hilarity ensues. It isn't quite as simple as that, however. Despite an early focus on slapstick comedy, ecchi, and outright silliness, Zero quickly introduces a thin political thread, providing bits and pieces of flavor to make the world seem more alive. This thread smoothly escalates into a significant driving force of the show's events, perhaps more powerful, even, than the central romance.  And speaking of that central romance, it moves along at a nice pace -- neither too slowly nor too quickly for a 13-episode series. Exactly how it develops is for you to discover, but rest assured that it does not remain stagnant for long periods of time, at least in this season, as in Shakugan no Shana and its sequel.  Characters: The cute, borderline-sadist lead; the busty, libidinous rival; the surprisingly forthright maid; the bookish, quiet Nagato Yuki clone -- these may seem like stock characters pulled from the harem romance pool, and they certainly begin as such. As in Love Hina, however, we discover that these characters have histories and unforeseen connections, sometimes in far darker ways than I expected of this show. What's more, many of these characters actually change over time, as characters in a story should. Sure, the cast seems a bit crazy at first, but give them a chance. It's worth it.  And the male lead. Oh, the male lead. Saito's personality is what makes him simultaneously hilarious and divergent from the usual harem romance/datesim beta-male loser. We get the impression that he checks out every girl who crosses his path not because he's hopelessly desperate, but because he's a healthy teenage boy. Not that he's relegated to the role of lecher; he has his human and hero moments, too.  Setting: Our story begins in your average Harry Potter-inspired magic school, complete with magic wands and quirky professors, but soon expands outward to encompass an alternate-history, magically-endowed Europe plagued by the class politics of magocracy -- that is, magi over non-magi. Though the central country of the show is fictional (apparently located roughly in the Aquitaine region of France), several real-world European powers have fantastical equivalents, often bearing the Latin names of the modern countries they mirror: Gallia is France, for example, and Germania is Germany. This becomes clear when we see a map of the fictional land. This world maintains interesting links to our Earth, but I'll leave it at that for fear of dropping spoilers. It's ultimately a surprisingly cohesive fantasy setting, and one to which I wouldn't mind returning.  Art: Zero's art is reminiscent of Shakugan no Shana, also produced by J. C. Staff, and to a lesser extent Pani Poni Dash. It's a style that grew on me when I watched Shana. If you're a fan of more realistic art in your animation, however, be warned that you won't find it here.  Sound: Despite being largely digital, Zero's music never quite descends into full-on cheesiness, as Shana's music did at times, nor does it overwhelm you with anachronistic elements unsuited to the vaguely Renaissance-inspired fantasy setting. The opening theme is quite catchy, for a reason I can't place, and as a fan of Kugimiya Rie and Hino Satoshi, I have trouble finding serious fault in the voice-acting.  Verdict: I didn't think Zero no Tsukaima would end up being the kind of show I'd be quick to recommend, but, to my pleasant surprise, it did. If you're looking for a tale of politics and romantic comedy, and don't mind that the ride isn't entirely serious from beginning to end, give this one a shot.";Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima;ShionxChan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShionxChan;8;"This is my second review of an anime series. Please spare me. xD; I don't do many reviews on shows but I would like to review on this one. Since this series touched me a lot and its my childhood. :P  One of the series that expanded my variety of anime after Inuyasha and Shana.  Story:  You have Louise, your mage that possess terrible magic and a boy that came from another world. He has to deal with the customs in Louise's world and has to face many obstacles; and with war, I'm not gonna spoil. Or I will try not too. This series is a comedy, so it does have some harem/ecchi involvement. Though, I think this series would be better off without the ecchi and the harem. That way, the characters have room to develop.  So I would give the story an 8/10.  Art:  The art is very beautiful to look at. I love the character designs of the show; which made me want to continue to watch it. The fighting scenes was well done; with the graphics. I wish more anime would have art like this; and the art also reminded me of Shakugan no Shana. With Saito resembling Yuuji. :P""  So yes, 10/10 for the art. 8D  Sound:  Some of the music in the anime was really pretty, I liked how it worked well with the show. But I could NOT stand the ending themes. The opening themes were more--enjoyable. But I liked the second seasons opening the best overall; so the sound I would give  7/10.  Characters:  The characters could use a little bit more development in the show. Like everyone else has said; I think Louise should START to trust Saito more instead of beating the poor guy senseless; and Saito should try to control himself more around the women. But then again, he's a 17 year old boy and pretty much the only guy other then Guiche. But what disappointed me, some of the characters you don't get to know about. And they're just there.  Like Siesta, Kirche, Guiche, Montomorency. I probably spelled her name wrong, so shoot me. Lot of characters like those are so undeveloped, it makes me a bit sad that you never know anything about them. The only real characters that are actually developed are Tabitha, Julio, and Agnes.  I'm not saying that Saito is undeveloped since he does get stronger within the series and doesn't remain, ""weak,"" throughout. I just wish they would give more bio on Saito; like his past. Etc. But what puzzles me, I remember him in the first season saying he does not have a family. So that makes me wonder about him more.   But overall, the characters COULD use some improvement. To make a better series.  So I give a characters a  6/10.  Enjoyment:  The series kept me watching until the very end. So despite the negative things about the show; it still made me want to keep on watching more and was sad about the end of the series. The season I liked the best was the second and the fourth season. Since characters started to develop more then; but you still wish to know about them. :P  So Enjoyment overall in Zero no Tsukaima.  8/10.";Recommended
2;Zero no Tsukaima;vadeka;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vadeka;10;Story: .. not many plots in here and some are realy obvious but zero no tsukaima isn't exactly the kind of anime where serious and complicated plots would fit in.  Art: Its the usual anime.. looks good, can't say much bad about it.  Sound: The sound fits realy well and I loved the opening song :)  Character: ah.. this is anime is kinda wierd, first and for all.. don't forget that the main characters have the mentality of 12 year olds(not including the idea of punishment.. you will understand once you've seen louise angry) so.. even if certain things get explained and feelings start to develop.. there never is much of a change in the situation(which is good or else half of the humor in this anime would be gone) There will the occasional side story but the main characters are the main characters meaning that they will appear in everything and anything.  Enjoyment: warning: you could die while laughing realy, this anime's strong point is its humour and there are very few episodes in which this won't be seen.(make sure you get fansubs that explainsome of the jokes aswell)  Overall: I lost my voice after watching the entire serie in one go because of all the laughter(this probaply won't happen to everyone unless you laugh as much as I do) This is one of the funniest anime's out there and its worth a try(theres also a little romance in it);Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima;theeggman85;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theeggman85;9;"Wow, I really was not expecting this to be a good anime, but it turned out much much better than I thought it would. What looked like just an average &quot;I can't confess&quot; love story turned out to have something special in it, maybe because they got to the point within 13 episodes like most animes don't.  STORY: 9/10  The story is very unique, as far as I can tell. Louise can't use any magic, but on the day where all 2nd year students summon a familiar to help them, Louise summons a teenage boy from Japan, which is obviously another world from the magical world. From there it just kind of flows, and the fillers are very entertaining too (If they can even be called fillers).  ART: 9/10  I really like the eye styles in Zero, cause im big on those. Everything else is great as well, I didn't see too many cliches in terms of art (see character for the cliches)  SOUND: 7/10  To be honest, it wasn't anything special. I thought the theme songs were OK, and the music in the anime was good as well. Overall, it was just good. Nothing memorable or anything.  CHARACTER: 8/10  I am actually surprised that I am giving this an 8/10. In fact, this anime probably has all the cliche characters of every anime combined. The tsundere girl, the quiet girl, the playboy, the... uhhh.... slut. Yeah, and there's even more where that came from. But there's always a character for everyone to relate to, even though they aren't that deep. Maybe it's not worth an 8 here, but I guess this cliche cast really got to me.  ENJOYMENT: 9/10  Obviously since Zero is a romance comedy shounen-ish anime, the enjoyment value is going to shoot the technical values in the face. The way the story is executed is very fun to watch, and the &quot;I want to confess but I can't&quot; moments are perfectly spread and executed. It's hard to get that kind of a story right, especially with all the animes out there that have flopped and given this stereotypical plotline a bad name. The comedy is great as well, I found myself laughing out loud at some moments and laughing when I knew what was coming (trust me, you will also.)  OVERALL: 9/10  What more can I say? If you're into the romance comedy genre, I highly suggest you pick this up. One of my main concerns in the beginning was how childish it looked, but then I figured out the characters are supposed to be 16 (they look way younger... ?_?). Anyway, I would say if you don't like this anime within the first 3 episodes, this isn't for you. But please, just give it a try.";Recommended
4;Zero no Tsukaima;Tekky99;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tekky99;8;"Length: 13 episodes Original Airdates: 7/06 - 9/06 Demographic: Seinen Genres: Adventure, Fantasy, Comedy, Harem, Romance, Ecchi  Plot Synopsis Louise is a magician at the Tristein Academy, dubbed with the nickname &quot;Zero Louise&quot; due to her inability to effectively use her magic properly, resulting in zero successes. An upcoming test at her academy requires her to summon a familiar, a servant and partner to support her as a magician. Despite desiring a familiar that would be superior to her constantly mocking classmates, Louise ends up summoning Hiraga Saito, your average Japanese boy. Even with Louise and Saito both unwilling to accept each other, they have no choice. Louise cannot attempt another summoning and Saito cannot return to Japan, and so their life together begins. Based on the novel by Noboru Yamaguchi. (From MyAnimeList)  Personal Opinion I heard about this anime a little while back... though I wasn't completely sure if i wanted to see it or not. Finally, I was like &quot;what the hell&quot; and I decided to watch this. Indeed the premise, opening, and photos seemed to promise a fun, comedic anime. And for all intesive purposes, it was. However... it wasn't as funny as i would've hoped. Some of the jokes tend not to work. Indeed, I kept thinking that this show would've been better if it had a bit more action to tie in with the jokes. However, towards the end of the season, the action, character development, and comedy picked up and i really started to enjoy the show. As for things i liked, the biggest ones would be the voice actors. They're the same people from Shakugan no Shana.... so whenever Louise would yell at Saito, it was like a good deja vu. Also the animation is quite well suited for the anime.  Also as a note... there is a sequel series that has already aired. Zero no Tsukaima; Futatsuki no Kishi. And a 3rd season is confirmed for the Spring 08 season  Overall... enjoyable series... though fell a little short of expectations 8/10  Similar to... - Shakugan no Shana Both the lead characters are girls, and they both have a hard time expressing their feeling for the main boy of the series. Also the same voice actors.  - Fullmetal Alchemist  Both these animes had the parallel world idea, with one world being our own, and the other one having the ability of magic.";Recommended

6;Zero no Tsukaima;Andristian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Andristian;8;"Tsundere galore! Zero no Tsukaima (or The Familiar of Zero) tells the story of two lovers – or so we are told. This delightful anime takes place in a fictional world where magic is all around and aristocrats (in other words: the rich people; as opposed to plebeians, the average peeps) are being taught magic in school. We are introduced to a magic academy where Louise Francoise is having difficulty keeping her spells under control and therefore is being scorned by her fellow classmates who call her Zero Louise.  Things take a rather interesting turn when the day comes for the students to summon their familiars (some sort of special ritual where everyone gets to summon a magical creature that will protect them and be at their side forever) and Louise unwillingly summons a human plebeian named Saito, who seems to have arrived from another world. Although Louise is rather reluctant to accepting Saito as her familiar, she is left with no choice and must come to terms with the fact that she is no bound to Saito. Her “tsundere” side kicks in when she starts punishing Saito for little insignificant things like talking to other girls or disobeying her ridiculous commands, and he is forced to sleep on the ground and wash her clothes, among other things.  Zero no Tsukaima isn’t a particularly unique anime series, but it delivers everything your little Asian heart wishes for (I said that in a very non-racist way, believe me!) and much more. The characters are quite stereotypical and you’ve encountered them before if you’re even in the slightest familiar with Japanese anime. Louise is the typical tsundere who treats the guy like crap, but deep inside he loves him and they share a special connection. Saito is that guy who gets treated like crap but he somehow has feelings for her “master.” Then you’ve got a couple more supporting characters like Kirche who is more or less in conflict with Louise and keeps getting Saito into trouble for flirting with him all the time. There’s also Charlotte, the quiet girl who never speaks but is incredibly powerful and helps the others out at times. Siesta is the “good girl” who works as a maid in the academy and is more or less the third piece in the Louise-Saito-Siesta love triangle.  The characters may be cliché, but they are done to perfection. They are indeed predictable, but are used in a very modest manner and never exceed in cheap jokes or typical situations. The story seems rather simple at first, but as the plot keeps progressing more and more gets revealed and the little twists here and there make up for some excellent entertainment value. There’s enough humour to go around, but it never feels too much and is used exactly when needed. I was surprised to see how entertaining this anime actually was. From the very first episode, I was hooked and it never let me go. The pace in which Zero no Tsukaima progresses is also done very well and it never feels like the anime was rushing towards a certain point (even though the last couple of episode covered a great deal of story compared to the first ones).  I could ramble on and on, but that’s about as much as you need to know. It’s not a series that is going to break any new ground, but it is truly one hell of a fun trip and deserves every anime fan’s attention. I didn’t ask for much, but Zero no Tsukaima delivered everything I needed from an anime series. Looking forward to next season!";Recommended
7;Zero no Tsukaima;ethann;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ethann;9;Zero no tsukaima is set in a fantasy world where the nobles stay separately from the commoners and can practice magic. The story forcuses on a magic school academy for the nobles and on the day that they are to summon their partners, the female lead summons a boy from another world which is our world i guess, however, she believes he is a commoner from her world and treats him like a slave,little do they know that he will become the ledgendary partner or familiar that can own with a sword.  The story is unique as it differs from your usual fantasy anime, though it does inculcate the typical main chracter is drawn into another dimension theme it does not focus so much on that so it does not seem cliche. Also ifyour thinking of harry potter or something along that line then you are sadly mistaken, the magic is totally different. Also There is a good deal of romance in the story which is a plus for me. Also it gets more interesting when there are massive battles which make it more epic.  The art is quie appealing and suitable for a romantic comedy but there is no exceptional features.  The songs(opening and closing) i find are quite pleasant to the ears but there was no insert songs to bring out the mood especially since there is a good deal of romance and drama in the sho, so insert songs would have made it better.  The character is what make the show so interesting, each character has some kind of depth and makes the story very comical at times, especially since the male lead is kind of perverted so it gets funny cause the female lead will start blasting bolts at him whenever he is wth another girl. Also the characters do show maturity when the time requires it so its not totally spastical, which is what makes the story a good romantic comedy.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story because from the comical moments to the dramtic romance to the epic action clips, so it was quite to my liking though it is kind of short, it would be better if it was longer. But there is a second series so its okay. In fact i think it was a good decision to have two series so that each series will focus on a single arc and have an underlying plot throughout each series which draws in the characters.  Overall, the story is very versatile containing several genres to some depth,if you like romance then go for it, f you like fantasy then go for it, if you like action then there is something in t for you, so give it try it is definitely worth it, and if you like this series you will definitely love the second one.;Recommended

Ps i love to spell shit wrong so look out for that. So Zero no Tsukaima is just a really fun anime, that was just simply easy to watch and fully enjoy. The anime does a great job of making you care about the characters and makes you want to watch more. When i watched Zero no Tsukamina i have to just marathon it, i was hooked almost instantly. If you like Tsundere types then Louise is your girl and as far as the male lead Saito is a really like able character with some very funny traits. The comedy is all in good taste and is placed well though out the anime keeping for the most part a light hearted feel. Though that doesnt mean that there isnt a fair share of drama, the art style i feel was very well used to depicted so of the more heart wrenching moments of the which there are many. To sum up i really enjoyed this show, you can really feel yourself getting sucked into the story although the outcome might be easy to see, i would fully recommend watching this show  Hope my review was helpful Murphy;Recommended
9;Zero no Tsukaima;Fuu-nyon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fuu-nyon;8;Well for starters let me just say that I've just recently gotten into watching anime. As a 17 year old boy, I never really figured that this show would appeal to me. In fact, when I listed the few that I had watched and liked people tried to dissuade me from this genre.  I ended up watching it after marathon watching TTGL and Code Geass for the first time, and then feeling really depressed at the end of both of them. I wanted something silly yet enjoyable and I figured I would give this a try.  At the beginning of season one I was like... lame. I can't stand Harry Potter (bear with me, I'm not saying its a Harry Potter knock off), so I was kind of put off by the whole magic school thing. But I stuck through it and ended up watching the whole first season in two sittings. After the first few episodes the characters start to develop a little more, as well as the story. By the end of season one I was watching it for the story more than the comedy.  Definitely worth watching, no matter what genre you're into. If you can stomach the beginning you'll start to fall for it, I guarantee it. And if not, hey, you never know until you try.;Recommended
10;Zero no Tsukaima;BNL78STEEL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BNL78STEEL;9;Like mixing Harry Potter and harem anime! Zero no Tsukaima is set in a world where you are either a lord and have magical powers, or you are a peasant with no powers and must serve the lords. During a ceremony where the lords conjure up a pet for life (normally an animal), Louise conjures up a human boy from Japan named Saito. She treats him like dirt, and forces him to wash her clothes. How will Saito survive in this new world?  The art is very poor in this anime, and at first the jokes are really lame. But if you can get past the first episode the storyline develops into something that is well worth it.  P.S. If you do decide to watch this series, just know that the next 3 seasons were not dubbed due to it not selling well in English. There are subs and the series completes with the 4th season.;Recommended
11;Zero no Tsukaima;UsaraDark;https://myanimelist.net/profile/UsaraDark;8;"Is this anime worth your time? Most likely  Anime is a way of expressing a story, which is what it was mainly invented for. This anime does a good job of doing it.  Story - 8 The story of Zero no Tsukaima is pretty complex, yet simple to take in. There a lot of stuff being set up such as a slowly changing sky, which I didn't even notice was changing until it had importance. Our main character as the synopsis says, Saito cannot return to the real world, so he's stuck with whatever occurs throughout the anime without being able to do anything until he accepts the fact that he can't go back and embraces where he is now. I would call one of these stories a 'passive' story, as things just occur with the main character just reacting with what happens. With a 'passive' story, the anime would rather be dull. However, with several plot twists that occur, all I can say is, ""Wow, I had a bad feeling that would happen"". Some of the plot twists are a bit obvious, while others are very, very slight. This is how you keep a viewer interested, by keeping them engaged, trying to figure out the story.  Art/Animation - 8 Although this was made in 2006, the art is fantastic. I thought I'd be annoyed with the old school 'huge shine on eye thingy', but it never really bothered me as it actually personified them. No real issues here, nothing too fancy either. Just some simple fire, water and such. As for animation, I'd say it's above average. As for animation, there's nothing fancy here either. Just enough animating to make sense of what's happening. Not very good fighting choreography, however, but you can really feel the power of attacks sometimes.  Sound/Music - 9 I really enjoyed the background music of this anime. It added so much light/dark to the anime where it was needed. As for sound effect, all were fine and sounded realist enough for me to give to an A. But again, how can we call magic sounds realistic? The sounds just 'work' for the occasion, sounding strong when it's strong, and weak when it's weak.  Characters - 7 There IS a HARDCORE TSUNDERE character in here. There's a reason as to why she's tsundere, unlike some anime... Please don't drop animes because a character has 'this trait'. It ruins a lot of good animes out there, including this one. The characters are pretty consistant, but my main problem here is that there isn't a good amount of background information given for the main protagonists, but they give a big background check of a side character. Perhaps she has importance later on, or she's just a filler arc for the anime. We may never know, but this opens up more story telling later on in the episode/series. This might be just me, but I like to get intimate with with main characters to try to relate to them more (no, not that intimate).  Enjoyment - 8 I watched this series straight, with breaks to get food, go to the bathroom, and stretch. I wasn't on my toes while watching, but I was always watching, trying to understand characters, origins, and purposes. I was never bored while watching this anime, since each episode presents something fresh and a presentable pace.  Overall - 8 I liked this anime, and I definitely wouldn't say I hated it. If you've ever seen Shakugan no Shana, then you'll probably enjoy this anime. I actually never liked Shakugan no Shana, but there's something about this one that makes it a lot more enjoyable. It probably has something to do with the relations the main characters have and the two worlds.";Recommended
12;Zero no Tsukaima;reneecm07;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reneecm07;8;"Zero No Tsukaima is, in my opinion, a good anime i'd recommend to people who like watching adventure animes with romance,magic and comedy in it (like inuyasha). I'd say there are some scenes which are a bit perverted and are rated, but that's what an ecchi anime is, right?  Story:  A wizard named Louise Francoise Blanc de La Valliere isn't exactly your average wizard. She is lousy at performing spells and when she attempts to conjure one, something ends up exploding. During a sacred school ritual where she is supposed to summon her lifetime companion and protector called a familiar, she ends up summoning a Japanese human,Saito. In the end, Louise is stuck with Saito whether she likes it or not and vice versa. I'd say the story is a common one. The main protagonist who is supposed to be someone &quot;special&quot; is a failure at being so, yet later on, you get to know that actually, she's got lots of potential and is stronger than most of the othersl. After all, she's the protagonist and protagonists are always heroes, right? The boy (Saito), being a protagonist, has somehow got to have a role,too and has therefore also an awesome power. Both of them fall in love yet there is always the third wheel so it becomes a love triangle.. same old,same old... But i still give it a 7, because the story develops fast and there are some unexpected twists as it goes along.  Animation: I find this anime's animation good; i like the way the characters are drawn, and the backgrounds and surroundings are spectacularly done,too. (for me)  Sound: Its sound is ok, the openings and endings i enjoy, and the sound effects during the anime have a good-timing; not an overkilll, but the anime doesn't lack sound effects either.  Character: I like Louise's personality a lot: strong, confident and sometimes stubborn. Her character development is good... But what i think lacks is Saito's personality.. i mean, she treats him like a pet, yet he lives with it..? it would've been better if he'd at least disobey her a bit.. you'll see what i mean after watching some episodes.  Enjoyment: i enjoyed this anime a lot, it's one of those animes where you can just kick back and relax, while trying to control yourself not to hit the tv when something exciting happens.  Overall: I think this anime deserves 8 points overall; the two points i don't give it are due to the lack of the story's originality... don't get me wrong, the story's very good, but it's kind of predictable... that's the only problem.  I'd recommend this anime to anyone who is a fan of adventurous,funny with a romantic feel animes..";Recommended

If I had to describe this anime in a word, I would use the word ""Simple.""  It doesn't have particularly long running arcs or major plots or complex twists and turns. It doesn't make you think in depth about what could happen next as it's relatively predictable and it certainly does not have a complicated romance plot.

15;Zero no Tsukaima;xsupakoreanx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xsupakoreanx;9;Zero no Tsukaima is a very enjoyable anime series that was well worth the time to put into. It's one of those animes that had a lot to tell in 49 episodes, not rushed like some animes that only have 20+ episodes, sometimes leaving viewers in dismay of how short a good show could be.  Zero no Tsukaima begins with the main female protagonist, Louise de La Valliere is the dunce of her class in Tristein Academy for magicians. Several years of unsuccessful attempt after attempt at casting spells, each resulting in violent explosions, have earned her the nickname of “Zero Louise” from her classmates. However, on the day that her class must summon a familiar each for themselves, Louise summons a commoner from another world: a young boy from Japan named Hiraga Saito, ultimately forming a bond and becomes the main male protagonist.  Visuals in general, including sound and artwork is somewhat not the best as I would anticipate. It's not Final Fantasy-ish beautiful with breathtaking quality, but I would say it's pretty decent. Not much to say since there's not much to be bashing about it.  Characters, creatively crafted for some, maybe a few were kinda cut-and-paste deal with some of them. I took great pleasure and joy in seeing Saito and Louise make names for themselves going from Zero's to Hero's both in their own rights. I can say I felt sad for some characters, especially Siesta because she is in a one sided love with Saito while Louise is in the way. But there are some redeemable characters like Guiche, Kirche, Tabitha, they're just the perfect supporting side players in the plot, sometimes shining in some scenes with some epic fights. As a honest guy, I liked Kirche a lot, especially because of her sexy looks and most of all, she's just perfect in the typical harem anime. Although they're not unique characters, their personalities are just humorous, especially how Saito is a pervert along with many other characters to sum it up.  The replay value is not the best for some out there in my opinion. Some might not enjoy Harry Potter-esque shows like Zero no Tsukaima, but this romance comedy is just classic! I have found myself literally crying from laughter because of how funny some moments can be. Every episode makes me look foward to the next, leaving a feeling of satisfaction. I will admit some things in this anime can be predictable, but as a person who finished the entire series, this one is a keeper!  I don't believe in perfection unless it's something like Final Fantasy VII or Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, but this anime is just very enjoyable. Perfect length to be an amazing series in 49 episodes, not rambling on like Naruto and Pokemon. And this is a very cute anime, especially on a person like me who has a penchant for romance series. This is fantasy based, so if those seek some more realistic ones, I would recommend ToraDora or Kaichou Maid-Sama, or even Angel Beats. Deep down, I really suggest you guys to give this one a chance, just once! This anime might be kinda awkwardly funny, maybe even cliched at moments, but the whole anime is very heartwarming and emotional! Some characters can be bland, one-dimensional, but the loving relationship between Louise and Saito is just beautiful in this romantic comedy!;Recommended
16;Zero no Tsukaima;powerofemo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/powerofemo;8;"Zero no Tsukaima. One of the few unique animes i watched that let a ""classic"" impression off me. This anime is an example of an fantasy romance done right. As far as the story goes, as guess you could think of it as Harry Potter with the addition of familiars. Even though the story isnt original and isn't all that great, i guess its the world that get's introduced that leaves an good impression. It's a world of magic with wands, dragons, talking swords, lizards, giants, gods like gandalfr, It's a huge world. One of the reasons you get attracted to the anime is to find out and learn more about the world itsself and that drives you to keep on watching. The art isn't anything special. It's not bad, but i wouldn't say it's a masterpiece either. Lets just leave it as good. The sound is decent. I liked the second opening and the fourth opening stood out to me, but other than that, the music was ok. The characters are one of the strong points of this anime. Saito, the main character, gets transported from Tokyo, to the magic world. Having a lot to learn about the new world he's in, there leaves a lot of room for character development, which the animators do a decent job at. Louise, starts off as your typical tsundere who treats Saito as a dog. Character development is done well and she goes through a drastic change in the series. There are other noticeable characters as well but lets just leave it at that for now The romance of the series isnt the best but is still decent. The romance is cute, but it gets annoying how Louise becomes jeolous at every single girl that goes after Saito The story,art, and enjoyment would be an 8,sound a 7, and character a 9, giving it an overall score of 8";Recommended
17;Zero no Tsukaima;skylarhawk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/skylarhawk;7;"I began Zero no Tsukaima since it was labeled as a fantasy, but it quickly brought out the ecchi fan I had never known!  The story follows a chain of somewhat ridiculous coincidences that kept me laughing continually as the series went on. There was good drama and occasionally some fun adventurous/actiony pieces.  Characters: Honestly, the characters did it for me in this series. You have Louise, who works very hard to keep up a good face and prove herself a worth mage, while continually failing. You can see how she takes out her feelings of shortcoming on Saito, whom she has a love hate relationship with. Then Saito, who is just the unlucky guy who fell out of the sky into Tristain who is struggling with understanding the world he is now stuck in, and understand his feelings for his 'master', Louise. Then throw in Siesta, the good girl-better choice-adorable servant; Tabitha, the silent-studious-super power; Guiche, the womanizing-overly confidant; and of course Kirche, the always horny-boobs. Throw them all in a bag, shake it up and there's bound to be plenty of room for laughs.  Story: The story, I'll admit, get loose at various times. There is always the sense of Saito trying to discover what his place is in the new world, and how to get back to his world. Then there is the ongoing battle of who Saito should be in love with along with his feeling that he should protect everyone regardless of their class. It takes the series a little while to develop a genuine evil-antagonist, which makes the overall story sail better (now that all the characters we like seem to have a common goal) but up until that point, I was willing to forgive that thanks to all the constant mini-fights between the characters.  Drama: I loved the awkward feelings and uncertainty that were present in almost all the character relationships. I won't lie, I occasionally got mad a Saito when it seemed like he finally smoothed things out with Louise, only for him to fawn over someone else, but without his endless distractions, the fun and funny tension would have been gone.  Themes: The show is a comedy-ecchi more than anything else, but there are a few deeper themes present in the show that make it further interesting. What role does pride play in how we live. Equality amongst people of different classes. How do we communicate love to the people that matter to us. Most of the themes appear only fleetingly, but they still make you think for that brief moment.  Overall, I really enjoyed the show. Zero no Tsukaima: * delivers on the drama * catches the watcher's curiosity (both in story and in characters) * provides plenty of laughs  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good, misguided love story.";Recommended

But god damn when it wants to hit emotionally it does so in a very well-paced fashion. Genuinely is a guilty pleasure of mine and if you want to turn your brain off and watch something that has some story and a bit of emotion thrown in once in a while, then I can't recommend this show enough.  Don't get me wrong, the story is interesting and is a lot more investing than a lot of other ""other world"" type anime, but it does require a bit of getting used to. The characters are dumb and childish a staggering amount of the time, but moments of realization and bonding genuinely feel real and within the scope of their characters.  One thing that shows itself throughout the 3rd and 4th seasons is that, tragically, the author passed away and so the story is paced awkwardly for a few episodes here and there; however, I still think they managed to tie up loose ends very well.";Recommended
19;Zero no Tsukaima;Krex939;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Krex939;10;"i decided to write my first review,and i choused the anime that made me enter the anime world.  At the first look at this anime you might say ""its the lame type of harem/echii anime"".With that i disagree.This anime conteins a lot of comedy,awesome story and a controversed love story betwen the main characters(louise and saito).There are other characters that are destroing(without any intention)their relationship,but,even with that obstacle,thei manage to remain togheter(sorry i kind of mentioned the description of the whole series).Now about the story.In Tristain(hope that is how you write it :) )as a wizard you must summon a familiar(animals,but not in our case)that will stay by your side until one of you dies.Louise the worst wizard in the school summons a guy(that is when Saito comes in)named Saito.Their relation started as a master-slave one but after adventures and other things they come to fall in love.  These are the basics of this anime.If you want to find out more its up to you ;).I hope you'll like this anime as much as i did(i was destroyed when the anime ended)  Thanks for reading!!!";Recommended
0;Zero no Tsukaima;jet2r0cks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jet2r0cks;6;"I can&rsquo;t say I liked Zero no Tsukaima as much as hormonal, pre-teen male otaku out there.  Plot-wise, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a revamped version of Maburaho. Other than being produced by JC Staff, the two series have other things in common. First off there&rsquo;s the setting &ndash; both series are set in a magic school. There&rsquo;s also the harem anime aspect &ndash; Louise, Siesta (my favorite!) and Kirche are all fighting over the token loser male character, Saito. Finally, there&rsquo;s the ecchi. It&rsquo;s a good thing that the ecchi in Zero no Tsukaima isn&rsquo;t as heavy as Maburaho&rsquo;s.  It was a stable ride for me during the whole series. There were no high points and low points. Let me reinforce my first point by saying that if I were a guy I would probably like Zero no Tsukaima more. Louise&rsquo;s tsundere antics would probably captivate me, and Kirche&rsquo;s presence would probably get my temperature rising, but that will probably never happen. As for Saito, he didn&rsquo;t really catch my attention. I did love watching his fight scenes but when he&rsquo;s not fighting, he&rsquo;s quite bland. Tabitha is too reminiscent of Yuki Nagato for me, but she&rsquo;s not as cool.  As expected of JC Staff, the animation was good enough to satisfy me. Everything was very cutesy though &ndash; from Louise&rsquo;s pink hair (as well as the bevy of pastel color schemes throughout the series) to the Pokemon-ish familiars (except Saito, of course). The CG was lukewarm, and it&rsquo;s a good thing they used CG minimally.  Apparently most of the voice actors of Zero no Tsukaima also worked in Shakugan no Shana. The most notable name would be Rie Kugimiya, Louise&rsquo;s seiyuu, who is known as a tsundere seiyuu. She was Shana in Shakugan no Shana. There&rsquo;s also Satoshi Hino, Saito&rsquo;s seiyuu, who was Sakai Yuuji in Shakugan no Shana. Other name worthy of mentioning is the very well known Yui Horie, Siesta&rsquo;s seiyuu and Takahiro Sakurai, Guiche&rsquo;s seiyuu.  I like the music too. The opening and ending themes were both j-pop-ish, which can be a good thing. Both songs were very cutesy and catchy, and I liked both. As for the BGM, I&rsquo;d say they were decent tracks. The BGM was fitting to the mood and feel of the series, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s THAT good.  While I wasn&rsquo;t that pleased with it, it wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. It started and ended on the same note and consistency is a good thing for me. I might watch the second season just to see if I&rsquo;ll like it more.";Mixed Feelings
1;Zero no Tsukaima;megara;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megara;6;I\'ve always had a weakness for magic schools - like Harry Potter\'s Hogwarts. That\'s my main motivation for watching this anime. And who wouldn\'t want to be suddenly thrust into a magical world from a boring life, right?  The story\'s not as lighthearted as I thought. Immediately there are the ecchi elements and the political conspiracies that surrounds the characters. But other than that, you get what you expect: the marginalized boy and girl who suddenly become the hero and heroine, seemingly more than what they were initially shown to be.  Nevertheless, Zero no Tsukaima is a fine anime. Nothing too extraordinary, but not that bad either. Maybe the problem is that it was too short and we never really got the whole picture. Hopefully the second season will be better.;Mixed Feelings
2;Zero no Tsukaima;TakaCode;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TakaCode;6;Hello everyone Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger here and welcome too, my next MVM Entertainment anime review.  This time I will be reviewing the anime The Familiar of Zero.  Now unlike my Shakugan no Shana review where I reviewed all the seasons I will be only be reviewing the first season of The Familiar of Zero.  Why you may ask well one I only own the first season of The Familiar of Zero on DVD and secondly at this time of the review I have no interest of watching and reviewing its squeals and from what I been told from my mates told that the squeals for The Familiar of Zero are not that good.  Now The Familiar of Zero are quite a polarising series because I see people whom love the series or downright hate it with the burning passion.  What do I think of The Familiar Of Zero?  Well let’s find out shall we.  Story.  thumb-1920-128765  The story of The Familiar Of Zero are set in a magic school called Tristen Magic Academy where my main heroine Louise are a second year student their. Sadly, for Louise her studies in spell casting are not good at all and all of her attempts at magic end up backfiring in an explosive manner which has earned her the nickname “Louise the Zero.” Too, add insult too, injury in her latest failure in the mystical arts occurred during the familiar summoning ceremony were sorcerers age expected too, call forth an animal companion. Instead of summoning something great like a Dragon or a bear, Louise summons up a teenage boy from Tokyo named Saito and from their the relationship with Louise and Saito beings. Personally I found the story of the Familiar of Zero too, be pretty enjoyable for the most. Sure it kinda cliched at times but for what it are its enjoyable too, watch. Also the comedy of the Familiar of Zero can be a hit or miss for some but for me the comedy are enjoyable too, some degree but the gag about Saito having too, washing her panties gets really annoying as the season progresses. As for the World Building it’s actually quite good. It does a good job exploring the magic aspects, beasts and society of the Tristen Magic Academy. Lastly the pacing for this season are good and it really help the season because not only this are more of a character driven series but it also builds up too something in the last couple of episodes of the first season.  Overall the story are decent but enjoyable.  6/10  Characters.  Now I been told from my mates that Lousie are the worst tsundere girl and too, be honest she’s not that bad. Sure at times she can be annoying with her abuse behaviour too, Saito and also she are loud and whinny but for the most part she’s a meh character overall. I can definitely see people hate her but as for me I found her too, be tolerable at best. Next we have are Saito whom are you typical generic ecchi shounen, brave, protective and never wanting too, give up. I have nothing else too, say about him because that’s what he literally does in this anime. He’s a generic character whom does generic things. The rest of the character cast are also generic ecchi characters whom also do generic ecchi things. But hey least they enjoyable too, watch unlike the cast of Love Hina. In short this character cast are nothing but generic.  5/10  Art/Animation.  Visually The Familiar of Zero are decent with a standard looking world and character deigns. Sure theyre are some good actions scenes every now and then but the most part the art and animation are standard tier expect for the fights.  6/10  Sound. The soundtrack for the Familiar of Zero are actually good and it really fits with the mood and atmosphere of the anime. It’s honestly the best thing about this whole anime in my opinion. We got some great tracks such as Good Friends, Louise's theme, Gandaaruvu, Seiso, Hajirai and those tracks alone made this anime more enjoyable. The opening are great and very catchy and the ending theme are cute but are not that catchy.  Now for Sub or Dub.  The dub are honestly mediocre and all of the voice actors did a decent too, mediocre performance on the roles. As for the sub. Rie Kugimiya as Louise was great and it was easily the best performance from this anime. As for the others are fairly standard. If you planning too, watch The Familiar of Zero. Go with the sub because the squeals don’t have a dub opinion at all.  8/10  Final Thoughts. The Familiar of Zero are a generic but enjoyable time-waster series if you have nothing too, watch. The story was meh, character are mediocre too, decent, art/animation are decent, a nice soundtrack and the dub are okay. Personally I don’t think this show are that bad or great too, be honest because this show are just decent and harmless. Only buy The Familiar of Zero on a sale because buying the Familiar of Zero brand new on blu ray. along with its squeals are like buying Assassin’s Creed Unity Notre Dame Edition on launch. It’s totally not worth it too, be honest. I currently own this on DVD and I brought it for £5 which are the most appropriate price for the series for this.  I give Familiar of Zero a 6/10 (It’s your everyday generic ecchi series that are enjoyable too, watch if you have nothing too, watch at all)  The Familiar Of Zero are available from MVM Entertainment in the UK and they currently licensed all four seasons on DVD and Blu Ray.  Anime recommendations  Shakugan No Shana  KonoSuba  Toradora  Dog Days  Slayers  Hayate The Combat Butler  Rokka no Yuusha   For my next MVM Entertainment anime review I will be doing a straw poll of what anime you guys want me too review and if that anime wins I will review that anime. Please stay tune for that. Alternatively you can visit my profile and go too my straw poll link and you can vote from they're.

3;Zero no Tsukaima;RakiRaki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RakiRaki;5;To make it as blunt as possible, you probably shouldn't watch this show unless a) you're under 16 or b) you're unreasonably obsessed with Louise.  The premise of this inane little harem romance is that a boy called Saito from modern Japan is sucked into a fantasy world named Halkeginia by an incompetent tsundere witch girl named Louise and becomes her familiar. He is subsequently beset by numerous confessions of love from such starkly original characters as a large-breasted vixen, a demure maid, and a Rei/Yuki clone, but of course, this story is about Louise, and it's her who he ends up with. There's some sort of plot involving a Staff of Destruction, and then later on Louise almost gets married to a moustache, and then the Rei clone goes crazy in the third season, etc., but this show's main focus is putting the male protagonist into WACKY situations like that time he accidentally touched that girl's breast and then Louise used magic to blow him up! Or maybe she whipped him and called him a filthy dog! Oh, those crazy kids!  Unfortunately, I am in the grossly unenviable position of having watched this as a teenager and have therefore become inextricably attached to Louise, who I will not hear one bad word about. In her defence, Saito is hardly an ideal partner either. Case in point: the fourth and final season, in which Louise and Saito move into a house together, and he insists upon inviting the maid character along with them, not only to live with, but to share their bed. Said maid had at this point been thoroughly flanderised into a sex-obsessed bimbo with nothing on her mind but Saito, and had made it clear to both Louise and Saito that all she wanted was to jump his bones. If you expect a romance that actually progresses, look elsewhere. This is a show for teenage boys, and few outside that demo are likely to appreciate it.  On the other hand, the romantic development for the first and second seasons is solid enough despite the inevitable harem stupidity. Beyond that, the show is occasionally funny, but more often than not bland and overly reliant on the antics of the stock characters. By the end of the whole series, the humour is wholly absent—or rather, the writers had no more jokes left.  Subtract all of my points if you don't have lewd thoughts about Louise.;Mixed Feelings
4;Zero no Tsukaima;iklone;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iklone;5;"STATUS FILE:[ imgur.com/m0PvQNw.png ] OTHER STATUS AT BOTTOM  THIS IS A REVIEW OF ALL 4 SEASONS: ZnT, FnK, PnR + F.  STORY The story starts in Hogwarts with a young witch named Louise. There is a ceremony being held for the students to summon their 'familiar' who will stay with them as their servant for the rest of their lives. All the other students have already summoned their's, ranging from fire salamander to a giant diglet. However, when Louise, who is renowned for being shit at magic, tries she summons a fricking human. Even so, everyone seems to thin this is the short straw and Louise is not impressed, which doesn't make sense since he is by far the most useful out of any of them. Anyone, for the rest of the anime Louise and her familiar (Saito) go on a load of wacky adventures with elves, dragons, airships and loads of BDSM. After fucking around and saving the world once or twice the story just ends. Without closure on just about anything except that Louise is most definitely a sadistic freak. SPOILERS[Remember that fucking ring thing with the water fairy? Yeah, so do I, but the authors didn't] However, there is a possible reason for not many people shitting all over this anime too much. The original LN author, Noboru Yamaguchi, died before writing the last two books, leaving his kouhai too attempt to finish things up. And so I guess this time it can be forgiven, as at least Saito x Louise got pretty much canon, but then again, it was from about episode 6 (out of 50). Another, important plot point is the violence shown. Us anime viewers are well accustomed to people being shot, cut in half, and killed in many ways. However, for whatever reason I, and many other viewers, found some of the stuff in ZnT hard to watch. And it wasn't the actual fight scenes, as they were very toned down, but the sheer amount of tsundere-induced domestic violence, Saito is subject to intense uncensored whipping sessions which he doesn't even seem to mind all that much. However he does get Louise back by performing the most dramatic male bitch slaps ever to come out of anime. [youtu.be/5-ncqu5rYcY?t=25s] Glorious.  The cast is as big as you'd expect from a 4 season anime, the main character is Saito, who I'd rank slightly higher than your average MC, but still incredibly flawed. But he can fly a fighter plane so that's cool. Louise is the main heroine and love interest, who is an A class tsundere, and extreme caution should be taken when in the range of her whip. Saito also acquires a respectable harem, including the maid Siesta; dandere Tabitha; literal slut Kirche, oppai-elf Tiffania and Henrietta, the queen of the entire country. There are a load of others, but honourable mention to Jean-sensei, who was the best character up to and including 'the event with him as the main part of it'. Afterwards he is just as shit as most of them.  The plot was decent, however cannot be enjoyed by anyone who remembers anything before two episodes ago or has any interest in world lore or continuity in general. Also (very) decent fanservice.  PRODUCTION This show is a very JC-style one, with that showing in the animation. A standard, unchanging reasonable quality, albeit with slightly dodgy looking action scenes. Not much to say on animation though, it was decent but nothing special by any means.  The OST consisted of four OPs, all of which very nice. The EDs were of a higher quality than your average, with ED2, 'Suki Kirai! Suki!!!', being the best Sound Track of them all. The total track size is relatively small, but not noticeably.  CONCLUSION If you like long romances, vanilla fantasy and tsunderes or you just enjoy yourself a good bit of BDSM, then watch it, if not then don't force yourself too. Just watching the first season is cool too, as it wraps up pretty nicely in and of itself. If you've seen similar shounen JC Staff shows like Shakugan no Shana or Railgun, then its on the same street as those.  Maybe if the author decides to make like [CENSORED] and pull some bullshit 'not dead' shit then he could Saito bitch slap that faggot who fucked up the ending. Rest in Peace.

5;Zero no Tsukaima;Nateal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nateal;5;"Well, here comes Zero no Tsukaima, a harem-type anime with a tsundere for a main heroine. Another harem anime? Haven’t we had enough of this already? Yep, here’s another anime with a cliché characters, a subpar plot, and a ridiculous amount of fanservice. What? Seriously? Yes, seriously. Zero no Tsukaima is just another one of those terrible animes that people would consider crap. But why? Wasn’t J.C. Staff the one who made this anime? I mean, J.C staff was pretty successful with Toradora! Wasn’t it? Well you see, Zero no Tsukaima is one of those “failures”, so to speak. It failed in almost every aspect and is actually a terrible anime despite its huge fanbase. Why is that you ask? Well, I’ll give you the reasons why. Also, I would like you to know that this would be a review for the entire series and not just for this season. Now let’s move on to the review.  Story: The all-important story. Every anime needs a good, gripping story to entertain its viewers right? Well unfortunately, Zero no Tsukaima( which I will just abbreviate to ZnT for simplicity’s sake.) failed to deliver this all-important part of an anime. To tell you frankly, it had a great concept of what it was going to be. A simple summary of the story would be that Saito, a normal, everyday teenager was suddenly dragged into an unknown world and made a familiar by a magician nicknamed as Zero Louise, due to her lack of talent in using magic. It then turns out that the reason Louise can’t use magic efficiently Is because she only excels in a special, legendary type of magic which is void magic and that Saito is the knight of legend, Gandalfr. From that simple summary, one can guess that this would be an epic tale about two legends, trying to fulfill their destinies while encountering numerous hardships along the way, all while developing a romantic relationship between the two. Unfortunately though, the author just decided to go “Fuck that shit, who needs a decent plot when we got a tsundere main heroine, a pevert main hero, lots of tits and an entire harem at our disposal?” Yes, this is exactly what happened to ZnT. Instead of creating an intricate and enjoyable story and focusing on developing the plot, they just decided to give us a crap ton of fanservice, tits, a harem, and then proceeded to screw up the plot and rely on half-baked comedy and tits to try and hook its viewers. Although this would have worked if done correctly, even the comedic side was done half-baked. One of the running gags in ZnT is that the MC, Saito, is an idiot who cannot seem to be able to hold in his boner and literally just drools of every boob he sees, and then proceeds to get dragged into the most awkward circumstances, and then gets beaten up by Louise. It was funny the first time but after seeing it in every single episode that had a scene wherein the MC interacts with a girl (which is like every fucking episode) it got old so much that it only served to annoy me every time it happens. So yeah, the comedy part was pretty horrid, but what exactly happened to the plot then? Well, as you would expect, the plot turned into a complete mush that only serves to further Saito’s harem(I would explain his harem later) and to create more opportunities for them to insert their stupid gag instead of actually developing the plot. I mean seriously, the plot had more plotholes than there are pimples on a boy going through puberty and had as much plot development as a porn flick. Yes, it’s that terrible. But seriously though, the series doesn’t even have a proper antagonist. In each season, a new antagonist is introduced, then they try to set up a scene where the MCs will fight the antagonist, only for the antagonist to be killed/go MIA in an instant, never to be seen or mentioned in the story ever again. So for short, not only doesn’t ZnT have a proper plot, it also doesn’t have a proper antagonist. The last thing that I would like to mention is about the lack of details and proper explanations in ZnT. Now, this is a common problem among a lot of animes, but ZnT just took it to new extremes. There are so many instances wherein inexplicably unbelievable things just happen. It seems that every time something bad happens, some incredible “coincidences” just happen for some reason. Like for example, in one instance, MC Saito is trapped in a room with only a brick wall separating him from his enemies and apparent death, but then guess what? MC Louise “accidentally” learns teleportation magic and teleports him and his friends to safety. Such ridiculous plot armor only exists in fairy tales, and in my opinion it is completely retarded to even try to incorporate them into anime. To sum it all up, I give it a 4/10, just because it is utterly ridiculous up to the point that they might as well add “the power of love” as one their plot armors. Oh wait, they already did, Stupid me.  Characters: As I’ve said before, ZnT is an anime focused on making scenarios wherein they could add ecchi and add more members to Saito’s harem. As such, one can expect that the characters are really bland. For one, there is ABSOLUTELY no character development in this anime, none whatsoever. I mean seriously, the main character Saito, a perverted, two-timing guy who has as much sex appeal as Makoto from school days is still the same character he is four seasons after he appeared. Louise, a tsundere loli who only is Saito’s master and supposed “lover” is still the same stereotype anime girl who always gets into trouble and has to be saved by Saito. Then there’s Siesta, a typical maid who becomes a bitch after she falls in love Saito turns into a slutty bitch after who does absolutely nothing but press her boobs onto Saito in hopes of getting noticed after four seasons. After that, there’s Tabitha, your typical silent, mysterious girl stereotype that has as many expressions as Kristen Stewart who is still the same girl she is after four seasons, with the exception of being able to blush and sneaking into Saito’s bed while hoping to get laid or something(no really I’m serious). Then comes in Princess Henrietta, a stereotype girl who seems refined and stoic outside, but apparently has a habit of seducing our MC Saito whenever no one’s around. And finally, Tiffania, your typical air-headed girl with huge, f-cup boobs that always gets into “unfortunate” accidents with the MC is still the same air-headed girl with huge tits when the story ends. You see, there’s your problem; The supposed main characters are all bitches who could all have had a good, deep personality in them are all reduced into mere bitches who fight over Saito’s attention. Now, although there a lot of instances wherein their characters could’ve been fleshed out, like when their back story is explored in an arc, what the anime does instead is to make the girls seem all helpless and make Saito save them and as a result, they fall in love with him. Heck, I even think that some of the side characters have deeper personalities and are more fleshed out than the actual MC’s. I mean, Agnes and Colbert, two side characters had an ENTIRE arc dedicated to them just to reveal their back stories and were actually given a good introduction and excellent character development, all done with good execution but were just thrown away into the sidelines, only appearing thrice or four times in each season after their arc were finished. Now, there’s the problem. Instead of focusing their efforts on developing the main characters, they put their efforts in developing characters that would barely appear in the series while they could have given all that effort into fleshing out the main characters or even at least removing Saito’s inability to reject a girl’s advances especially since he’s already in a relationship. And top it all off, even the antagonist are just plain terrible and don’t stick around for long, as I’ve mentioned before. With all of those blunders, the only score I could give it is a 3/10, since pretty much every character are just about as interesting as one of those singing birthday cards; fun at first, but just damn annoying and noisy later on.  Animation: Pretty much the only good thing in this anime. Animation was smooth and shiny, just the way I like it. Although just like everything in this anime, there is always something lacking. The action scenes are so dull, it’s almost a bore to watch them. While fight scenes are supposed to be epic and adrenaline-inducing, the fight scenes in ZnT is just about as dull as watching someone else brush their teeth. It’s so slow that it almost look like it’s from a children’s cartoon show. So even with the animation, I can’t give it a perfect score due to the failure on the part of the animators, so instead I’ll just give it a 7/10 and be done with it.  Sound: There really isn’t much to say about the sound except that all of the BGMs were reused from the first season till the end and that the openings are pretty much sound just the same, only with different lyrics. 7/10  Enjoyment: Despite all of the negative comments I put up there, I actually enjoyed the first season. After that though, everything went downhill and my hopes of seeing a new masterpiece were completely shattered. But still though, I will take into consideration that I enjoyed ¼ of this anime so I guess giving it a 3/10 is good enough.  Overall: In conclusion, I would like to say that Zero no Tsukaima could’ve been a great anime. Unfortunately, all of that potential was wasted on a subpar plot, mediocre characters, and lame humor. To all those who are planning to watch this, only watch it if you are a die-hard tsundere fan or just watch the first season since the rest are crap. Overall I give it a 5/10.  If you have any comments, please post a comment on my page. I will gladly receive any criticism, good or bad and I will try my best to reply to your comment.

6;Zero no Tsukaima;CookiesOnFridays;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CookiesOnFridays;6;Do you like tsundere girls? Do you like recycled jokes about boobs and the main character getting caught in misunderstandings and getting blown up in almost every episode? Well this is just a few of the things the first season of 'Zero no Tsukaima' has to offer...  Story: 5/10 If you were preparing yourself to watch a pants dropping fantasy show with a stunning, jaw dropping plot line, you'll be fairly disappointed. To be honest, there's not much to talk about regarding the story. Throughout the season, there wasn't anything fascinating or amazing about the plot line. If anything, it was pretty cliched and predictable. With regards to the ending, it really felt a little like deus ex machina and was kind of abrupt.  Art: 6/10 There isn't much to talk about in the art department. There wasn't anything stunning or jaw dropping. The animation was decent and fluid, so there wasn't any eye sores throughout the season.  Sound: 6/10 In regards to sound, there was nothing memorable. None of the shows tracks were ear catching or stunning. However, the sounds did set the mood well and were used appropriately. (Additionally, in my opinion, the opening song wasn't that great...)  Character: 5/10 The characters were very generic and cliched. You have this tsundere girl named Louise that later develops feelings for Saito Hiraga. Then you have Saito, a generic, Japanese boy that takes the sword and saves the day, totally uninteresting. The side characters don't really do much but add to the stories humor and, occasionally, plot line. Despite there being character development, there wasn't a major impact. The character development felt like the show took a sticker and placed it over table.  Enjoyment: 7/10 Despite the show being just a decent anime, I found myself enjoying this show a lot more then I thought I would. Something about this show made me want to watch more. Was it because of the shows harem? Maybe it was because of the shows 'misunderstanding' jokes? For me, I enjoyed it because of the pairing. Saito's and Louise's personalities are totally opposite which lead up to some humorous situations.  Overall: 6/10  This first season of the show is decent. The art, sound, and voice acting are all decent. All except for the story and the characters, they were pretty mediocre.  HOWEVER, this is just the FIRST SEASON of the SHOW. I highly recommend anyone that gives this show at least a 5 or 6 rating to watch the second season. Though, in my opinion, the second season doesn't fix all the points, it makes an attempt to correct them. And one of the HUGE fixes they make would be in the character development between Louise Françoise and Saito Hiraga. This is a huge point that made the second season of the show, Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi, worth watching.;Mixed Feelings
7;Zero no Tsukaima;Yamete_Kudasai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yamete_Kudasai;6;Saito... Louise.... Saito.... Louise...  The anime's genre itself really suits me. I am a huge fan of Fantasy, Magic, Romance, Adventure, Harem and *cough* Ecchi *cough*. This is why I picked it up. And honestly, I don't know what makes me enjoy this anime, but I do.  The Saito and Louise relationship is a relationship that I really like, but at the same time really hate. If I were Saito, I wouldn't put up with being treated the way Louise is treating him. He still does, and to be fair, Saito isn't the perfect guy either, considering the harem going on and him not really understanding what Louise wants.  Nonetheless, the relationship progresses in a good way throughout the season, and even more in the next one. And there are really some touching moments throughout the season, which I must say I really enjoy.  Now, it comes to the plot/story. Here I must say I am not too impressed. Suddenly, a big problem erupts, and I am thinking: Ok, this will take some time to fix. 10 minutes later: Oh wow it's done already. This is pretty much how much of this anime goes. And for some parts, it can be good, but for others, you wish you would see more epic fighting/magic then you already see.  I can understand why this anime isn't liked by everyone. By some, it might be dull, boring and not entertaining, but for people like me, who really enjoys watching just a goodfeel anime that makes you go aww and yay, with a huge touch of fantasy/harem and some ecchi and some small touches of magic/fighting, I would recommend the anime.  It doesn't really live up to it's genres the way to be expected, but I am still watching episode after episode of this, mostly to see how the relationship of Saito and Louise is going to develop, and the story is at times also very exciting.  I will give this anime a 6 purely because I am enjoying it, but it's far from amazing.;Mixed Feelings

9;Zero no Tsukaima;snivek101;https://myanimelist.net/profile/snivek101;6;EHH.. ok I guess nowadays I really only watch anime to kill time because I have no money to go out, so I pretty much have become accustomed to the same old cliche. To start off the story was relatively good for only 13 episodes. The way they slowly added pieces to the puzzle definitely kept you enthralled. However, despite this the story was totally predictable and you had almost the whole story figured out about half way to two thirds through, again it was only 13 episodes so I guess that might be reasonable.  The character models where pretty good I think. Louise' light pink hair almost made me overlook her incredibly overbearing, selfish personality, which is a common thread in anime of this genre. The background animation was so so at best with rip off's from Harry Potter.  The opening theme wasn't too bad and worked well with the story's basic premise of literally starting with a kiss. The background music was actually quite appealing and gave life to some of the short lived fight scenes.  The characters are where the anime looses points for me. The anime is utterly cliche with the same nice guy, mean girl act. Why is it that in 70% of the anime I watch the main protagonist always chooses the girl that treats him the worst, in this case the female lead treats the protagonist like a pet. For example, for all 13 episodes the male lead (Saito) sleeps on the floor on a stack of hey without even a blanket, while the female lead (Louise) sleeps in a luxurious queen size bed. The developers also focus to much on cheap laughs through excessive and unnecessary violence from Louise. To be honest it's not funny and it's just plain annoying I don't understand how they came up with 3 seasons. In a nutshell Saito is a cliche Mr. Nice Guy character who really has no real reason to even endure or like Louise, but still ends up with her in the end, even when there was another character whom he liked and was treated way better by. I just wish once that the protagonist would fall for the underdog instead of the romantically cliche female lead.  Despite it's clear faults I did have a few laughs and overall did feel good after watching it. However, This isn't something I would watch again. Well then again I probably will watch the 2nd season. But trust me their are loads of anime out there with way more depth than this one.;Mixed Feelings
10;Zero no Tsukaima;Mercsin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mercsin;5;"Before you start reading, I will first say that this review is an overall review to the whole series, not only Season 1 in particular.  Now onto the actual review:  It was a fun watch. It was interesting and funny enough to keep me going, but it's missing something special for me to say that it was magnificent. I have to say though that Season 2 'Zero no Tsukaima: Futaki no Kishi' was the best. It kept everything to a good balance and the ending was amazing. Only to be spoiled by its sequels. Season 4 'Zero no Tsukaima F' was a close second. It tried to replicate all that was good of Season 2, but you can't expect the audience to fall for the same thing again. BUT what Season 4 had was a good and solid conclusion to the series.  TL;DR - Wouldn't recommend it, but a good watch nonetheless. Stopping after Season 2 would make the experience better.";Mixed Feelings
11;Zero no Tsukaima;Kelraz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kelraz;5;"I have to mention that I only watched this aime until s3 ep5. So the review is until that point where I just could stand it anymore and dropped it. I'll prevent spoilers.  It is kinda a wet dream of every SJW fantasy. A male MC which is leashed, wipped and put into chains while still in love with Main Girl.  For season 1 you really need to endure ep2...I think that's the point where most ppl just did drop it.  And tbh it doesn't get better from this point onward. The same jokes are recycled like 1-3 time per episode. The Male MC looks at a female and will get wipped/punched bloody by the Female Tsundere. Yeah and that's kinda all the interaction they have in 3 seasons.  There are a few scenes which should be sad in both s1 and s2 but it just doesn't work at all because you know the male mc will get slapped the next moment by the female mc and that kinda ruins the mood. Every single ""serious"" moment if you even can call it that is ruined by it and you just roll your eyes in cringe way before it.  The action scenes are so badly done it could even be a powerpoint slideslow and it would make no difference. Hell even the most absurd CGI shows did it better.  There is no character devolpment over 3!!! seasons at all the female MC is still abusing the male MC in the most horrible ways possible while the male MC is a dumb shounen character which refuses to kill anyone even in a full out war and getting plot armor and even hyper plot armor and a new harem in s3. ;> Starting with S2 the male MC suddenly becomes also a horny douchebag all of a sudden. There is no explanation at all but, yeah good writing. Seems he likes big boobs more than anything else out of nowhere just for the abuse jokes from the female MC.  So if you ever want to put a male on leash and treat him like a pet while feeling superiour I am kinda sure this show is just for you.";Mixed Feelings
12;Zero no Tsukaima;zaz_the_last;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zaz_the_last;5;art = meh. I'd give it a 4. Nothing special there Characters: cliche and mainly made to pander into stereotypes. Let's not talk about how terrible the villains are. It felt like no one was even trying to be interesting. Story: most of it is dead obvious, but the way the real world mashes up with the magical world is interesting enough for me to give it a 5. Political intrigue does ensue, sidelined by cheesy plot, fan service and pointless shenanigans trying to make up for the bad characterisation. The romance feels forced for the most part. If you're looking for something to pass the time while being brain dead, go for it. Perfect for little kids, I suppose?;Mixed Feelings
13;Zero no Tsukaima;Temere;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Temere;5;Magic is cool. Everyone loves magic. Having real magic, the stuff of fantasy is almost every child's dream.  Zero no Tsukaima is a rather hasty story that looks like it was at first originally to be a much longer first season as most of it is character development that suddenly, half way through, turns into everything is happening and then ending again all within one or two episodes leaving the finale rather lack lusting as you expected something more spectacular than was given. It opens a lot of question and leaves a lot of them unanswered as they go parading around the place, learning of many things but never really question why.  Art is fairly par as nothing really stood out in its 13 episodes. colors and cell shading is basic stuff and even the scenery looks made of the same stuff not being something of awe which is rather lacklustering considering how much landscape is shown.  Music is subtle but decent. It's used to empower the scenes and convey the correct atmosphere, but not at a pace that makes it stand out which isn't a bad thing. However it is noted there is some stock sample music which is rather disappointing. Sounds are rather basic as reused multiple times which almost makes it seem this anime had a low budget to start with,  Characters left a lot to be desired. There is still much untold about the main characters and the only back story we've heard is of an MC's classmate. However the development between the Hero and Heroine is easily seen and steadily grows.  Enjoyment was so-so. It makes you laugh but it also makes you wish it would sometimes move on to something more meaningful or interesting. Don't be surprised if you reach the last episode of the season and wonder is that really all there was. It produced such a beautifully large potential story then cut it off at the hips with such a sudden ending;Mixed Feelings
14;Zero no Tsukaima;es-tu_stupide;https://myanimelist.net/profile/es-tu_stupide;5;This had so much potential. If this anime wasn't such a harem comedy type, it could have had such a good plot. I know i shouldn't be expecting anything too great, but honestly, this could have been really cool. If it incorporated a dramatic or more intense serious mood, it may have been really good. What I DID like about it was the fact that he can use any earth weapon, especially the Zero (history buff). well, its decent for being a harem, ecchi, comedy anime, but it could have had a better story. If it took itself a tad more seriously like Chivalry of a Failed Knight did (which was a pleasant surprise), it would be a 9/10  Overall, this is a 5/10 for me, not that great.

15;Zero no Tsukaima;Melonsoda1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Melonsoda1;6;"I have a friend that really enjoys shows that have the tags ecchi, harem, and school in it. And at one point, I did as well. One day a few years ago, he recommended a show called ""Familiar of Zero"" because he can't read Japanese for shit. I never got around to it, because I used crunchyroll mobile which didn't have the first season of this show. So a few years pass and I decide to watch this show because I literally do nothing else with my life. So I watch this show, and I don't think I've checked my phone more in one sitting. The show wasn't necessarily bad, it just was so ""meh"" that I couldn't help but be bored. It wasn't bad enough for me to have fun laughing at it, nor was it amazing enough to keep me invested throughout the entire series. I have heard from my friend that this show is ""really funny"" and from other sources that it's a ""comedic masterpiece"" or so I've heard. I laughed like 1...2? I think I laughed like about 1 1/2 times if you lower my standards for comedy as low as the girls in Kirito's harem would go for the Kiri-dick. I watched this while talking with my friends in a discord chat and my friend was asking if it was funny or not. I replied with a question. A simple question. ""Is this show supposed to be a comedy?"" There were little to no jokes to it, I don't know why comedy is a tag. I think that's enough bashing on the comedy, I'll move on to a part I actually did like somewhat, maybe, not really, I'm grabbing for anything that doesn't make me look like an asshole for not liking this show. The characters in this show are...decent at best. I've heard Louise is a great tsundere, but I can't find myself interested in her. Maybe she gets better in the later 3 seasons this show somehow got, but that's not what I'm here to review. She comes off as this flat(not the way you're thinking) tsundere that's about as deep as the characters in PSO2 the Animation. She acts like a typical tsundere in one scene, then she shows some dere. Then, she's back to the tsundere. The switch between ""tsun"" and ""dere"" isn't bad, it just is ""meh."" I don't really care about her as a character until far too late into the anime. It's so far into the anime, I'm not sure how weekly watchers even made it through episode 5. Louise isn't the only problem. Saito is as flat as Louise's chest. We don't learn much about him at all. Was he a shut in? We don't know. Was he a functioning member of society? Pfft. Why're you asking me? We just learn that he was walking on the street, and then he runs into a portal thing that no one else can see. Then he's in a world with wizards. That's the extent of all I remember, so if anything more happens, then this show couldn't keep me invested in the plot long enough to even pay attention to the details. Backing off of Saito, we can delve into the side ""characters."" I wouldn't call them ""characters,"" I'd call them ""drawings will voices that move in a fancy way."" I can't say much about them. We have a deadpan, a stick with balloons for tits(every highschool dxd girl except Koneko), and then we have conceited guy that does nothing. They don't get enough screen time or dialogue for me to feel anything towards them as characters, much less the people they're supposed to simulate. That's all I can comment on the characters in this show. Now moving onto the plot. The plot is pretty much summed up to ""he was summoned into a different world, and now he wants to go back."" Then it's hinted that other people were also summoned into this world. It goes nowhere with this for the rest of the series except when the ending hits, and it's kind of satisfying? Then the series pulled an Attack on Titan before it even came out. It shoehorned in some politics to keep the show running so maybe they can keep the viewer invested. I really hope shows drop this shit, because it just prolongs the show and keeps the viewer from watching the interesting aspects they came to watch. Overall, I didn't really enjoy this show(because it wasn't obvious enough). I don't particularly recommend this show to anyone, but if you're bored and want some half assed romance for an entire season to finally(maybe) get into the good parts, be my guest. I originally gave this show a 7, but I think I'll move it down to a 6 upon further inspection.";Mixed Feelings
16;Zero no Tsukaima;Katsu-chan-rolo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Katsu-chan-rolo;6;"I was lead to Zero no Tsukaima through Toradora. I have a weak spot for Tsundere's. I personally liked Louise. She was such a great character and had the most character development.  Zero no Tsukaima is the first anime that left me questioning whether I enjoyed the ride or not... In my opinion, I feel like the progression of the story and the way the characters are conflict in so many ways. It was overall slow and Louise, the main female character, despite having lovely development, lacked story. In most episodes, she was just there and used when needed, she had a few episodes where she was used for comedy relief, well she was mostly used for comedy relief. She did, however have romance plots, but even those lasted over two episodes before being pushed to the side by another female character that needed attention. We all know romantic series have always been a tricky, unforgiving genre; you make one mistake and the story slowly begins to crumble, I believe this is one of them.  Zero o Tsukaima was, is supposed to be a Romance/Fantasy/Sci-Fi anime and where it succeed I Fantasy and Sci-Fi, it failed in romance. Sure all the female characters had their crushes and such, but nothing really got to me. I believe I read somewhere, "" Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.""  To make it as blunt as possible, this is one of the few that shouldn't be on the 'To watch' lists. It is an anime that should be watched whenever you're bored or something. I wouldn't necessary say, don't watch it, the Art is amazing, beautiful and the sound/music is just as beautiful. But the plot and growth. Blah.";Mixed Feelings
17;Zero no Tsukaima;thebadrat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thebadrat;6;"Here's little critique I made a bit into season three after not being able to take holding in my growing frustration, so obvious spoliers (They're very light spoilers which won't necessarily ruin anything)  Bit of critique, They seem to make a point of making it a cliche of Louise nearly every episode saying something along the lines of “Oh Saito! Why me? Why do you choose me?” It makes it hard to watch at points. Since he’s a teenager it should seem plausible he would act like one instead of instantly obeying her from the begining. And even at this point when he seems to have much more freedoms he continues the cliche. “Because you chose me of course!” I suppose it would help if we knew about his background when he lived in Tokyo, but honestly “I’m not an aristocrat, I’m not worth anything” has been said several times too many within the span of just a few episodes. Thevshow would be much better if he, while still Louise’s famiiar, was able to form some sort of relationship with other characters without being interupted everytime because they feel that Louise has to be in every scene. She’s a bit of an obnoxious character. I understand she is supposed to be a tsundere character, but that doesn’t excuse the fact the only relationshio building is forced between the two charactes. Tabitha seemed to be an interesting character, her alone could make an entire anime series herself from just her background story showed so far.  Characters:  Almost each and every character that needed to have it was given a decent background or at the very least some recognizable trait. For the most part none of the characters were entirely obnoxious. Except for Louise, everyone had what screen time was needed. Louise is a very cliche character, which is fine because it's a good cliche. It's everything else that's bad. Whomever made the series decided they reaaaaally liked Louise and decided to stuff her in nearly every scene, which wouldn't be so bad if every scene with her wasn't the same thing. Either an explosion because Saito was being a perv. A kissy scene with Saito because ""Don't leave me Saito"", or in general something that just doesn't sit right with me.  Saito is interesting and I'll keep his short. Very cliche, boy meets magic girl by summoning, falls in love with girl and says he'll never betray his feelings for her. And does it every other episode. If it wasn't for Louise getting stuffed in every scene he may have been to actually be able to develop a relationship with at least ONE character. Tnis ruined his character development, as character development is done best with multiple characters at once which can't be done if his master is placed in every nook a cranny of the series.  As for my final review I though it was average, it definately gave me something to do after watching Toradora, which means it's not a complete failure.";Mixed Feelings
18;Zero no Tsukaima;FallenEmpyrean;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FallenEmpyrean;6;"[No plot spoilers] After watching the whole first season I can't help feeling that I've only watched an intro for the second season.

If not for her I would have rated this anime as a 8 instead of 6. She feels the entire time like a thorn. I kept trying to enjoy the anime but that girl kept on being annoying. Ok I get that maybe that's how she was supposed to be, but, as a viewer, I don't like being annoyed by watching a character. They tried to pull off a two-sided character, but all I saw was a weird unpleasant combination.  Otherwise, I enjoyed the ""Pokemons in Hogwarts"" story.";Mixed Feelings
19;Zero no Tsukaima;kickmesign;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kickmesign;6;"Story: 6 The story could have been better. It dragged on for too long and some parts, and really struggled to try to be funny. Most of the time I figured, ""Oh the writer wants this to be funny. It was hardly worth a chuckle, that's too bad"". The characters do stuff with magic and have magical pets that are not that funny either. The magic serves it's purpose for the most part, but it mostly serves as a mask to try to keep the show interesting with its mostly lack-luster ability to provide humor. So the story gets a 6 which is like a D in the American grading scale for barely passing.  Art: 7 Importantly the art is clean, even though it is a bit simplistic. Sometimes simplicity can be a good thing, but it was a little too much. Like the magical pets, is that beautiful man's pet a mole, or is it his poo?  Characters: 6 The characters could barely hold my interest, they were very generic and just above the threshold of tolerable. In other words just very average. The characters and their interactions were integral to the enjoyment of this series. Though they are not very likable, yet dislike able at the same time. When they talk and I am supposed to laugh, it makes me not really want to laugh, but sometimes I smile for their minuscule glimmer of charm.  Overall: 6 Zero Familiars is a show that tries to be funny, but falls short in many of its comedic setups. Though the characters are a bit generic, they are the driving force behind the anime and pass by their small amount of merit. In nutshell, this show is just as average as they come. Also the title can be misleading, it says zero familiars but there are familiars everywhere. But it actually refers to how much this anime stands in comparison to other familiar anime in its genre.";Mixed Feelings

Plot: 3/10  Familiar of Zero is an anime about an ordinary boy named Saito that is forced to be a magical slave to an obnoxious twat that summoned him from Japan to the far away land of extremely generic fantasy Europe. Here he must learn to adapt to his odd new life and learn about the various types of magic users. I am not going to go really in depth with the plot honestly. It soon becomes a very generic harem show and the plot is NOT going to blow you away. Here is a summary of the plot: Louise the witch treats Saito like crap, the abuse is played up for cheap laughs, Saito uses his magic sword wielding ability to do something heroic, he still gets treated like crap. rinse and repeat.  Characters: 3/10  The main male character Saito is exceedingly bland and Louise is the least likeable female lead I have seen in a long time! There are also plenty of supporting characters, but there really wasn't anyone I liked in this series. Usually I can find a couple characters I like in even the most mediocre anime, but here I got nothing.  Art: 5/10  The art is pretty good since this anime had a decent budget. It was based on a successful light novel that I can only assume was somehow better than the anime.  Enjoyment: 3/10 if you aren't a masochist, 7/10 if you are.  Remember in early 2014 when Japanese men were drooling over the uniformed hottie Natalia Poklanskaya and some Japanese youtube poster stated: ""I want her to yell at me and step on me""? That is this entire fucking series in a nutshell. It is a fantasy for Japanese teen masochists who want to be dominated by hot European women. I'm not a masochist, and I don't see white girls as an exotic fetish, so I really didn't find anything to like in this series besides a few decent slapstick moments. The comedy sort of works in a few places, but mostly it is just obnoxious.  Overall: 4/10  I have met people (including one of my best friends) that thought this series was a comedic masterpiece. I REALLY don't agree with that assessment, but the series at least does some things right. The art is decent, the music is decent, the voice acting is fine. However, I felt that overall this was a very mediocre series that I wouldn't recommend to anyone...unless once again you are in fact a male masochist.";Not Recommended
1;Zero no Tsukaima;Anomylix;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anomylix;3;"Warning: Minor spoilers (that don't really ruin much at all), as you'll see the majority within the first two episodes.  This is a review for all four seasons, posted here to warn you of how much pain you might be coming across. I've watched some pretty bad anime but Zero no Tsukaima and its sequels are very high up. I was spurred to finish it by the suggestion of a friend saying it got better and because I can't stop what I've started. Note - This is my first review and my opinion, think of it as you will.  Story 4/10 Over four seasons half the 50 or so episodes could probably be considered fillers. The storyline itself jumps from one sudden and convenient issue to another with not much really linking it together. Zero's subplot of the apparent romance between the Mage and her familiar attempting to progress yet the situations they pop up in are beyond repetitive and dull.  Art 6/10 Nothing amazing and nothing awful, nothing about the art really bothered me nor drew my fascination.  Sound 6/10 See the above  Characters 3/10 Here's the best bit. Within most anime that have two MC's, you'd hope to like at least 1 of them. Nope. As shown in the synopsis, Louise is a mate whose powers are lackluster. Her apparent talent that is picked up involves the overused ""explosion"" spell that is seen at a minimum of 3 times an episode. Her other talent is kicking the other Mc in the balls, as well as being an unsympathetic, trust/confidence lacking, angry, wannabe tsundere who never fails to be annoying. Saito, realistically, is just as bad, as someone who got transported from Earth to a different planet/universe, and immediately treated like shit (or a plebian) he, throughout most of the series, can be seen as someone without a backbone, who is probably a masochist considering he's so loyal and loving to a bitch that assaults him. Worse still, the 'assault' gag is so overused he just becomes a complete pushover whose only motive is to 'protect' someone who struggled to even comprehend his situation of being in a different world, and can't actually reciprocate his love 95% of the time. Funnily enough the best characters (with spines!!) were the supporting cast, Siesta, Jessica and Kirche, who actually had a personality and were enjoyable to watch. Later supporting characters are too, won't reveal names, but they somehow make you wish Saito picked a girl that, I don't know, actually and obviously likes/loves him. (P.s, this should have a harem tag instead of romance). All in all, don't get too attached to two boneheaded mc's, you'll be disappointed.  Enjoyment 3.5 I did like some of it, mainly when the supporting characters were largely involved with pissing off Louise as a team, otherwise I struggled through this when I usually finish a season (12 eps) a night rather than taking me two, dreadful, weeks.  Overall 4/10 Please be careful watching this (though hopefully I've put you off), don't expect anything to get better, Saito will always get caught being with someone else and the most overused gag ever will waste your time.";Not Recommended
2;Zero no Tsukaima;Splitter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Splitter;3;"This one's gonna hurt, folks. My lowest review yet, but you should expect that from a series that capitalizes entirely on cliches without an ounce of originality or effort in any single field. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Zero no Tsukaima.  Getting the technical bits out of the way, Zero no Tsukaima was average in audio and visual. No memorable BGM, forgettable OP, and an irritating ED, but the performances were rather pleasing in some cases. Rie Kugimiya plays the standard tsundere role well, but shines better in scenes where she's interacting with someone that isn't Saito, where her other sides become more apparent, such as when she is with Henrietta. Unfortunately this doesn't happen often so it's mainly tsundere all the way. If you're into that, you're in luck. The rest of us aren't. Yui Horie and Ayako Kawasumi also turn in some decent though generic performances as Siesta and Henrietta respectively.  Visual is just inconsistent. The character designs are very simplistic and basic with not much detail or imagination. While its very average most of the time, it becomes incredibly fluid at the oddest moments, such as a scene early on where Louise chases Saito around in front of Henrietta, or again where Saito fights Ward. Because the animation is so generic the majority of the series, these random bits of fluidity are suprisingly pleasing, but give a lasting impression that the series has been half-assing it.  Indeed the series did half-ass it, and what better proof do you need than the characters? Rie Kugimiya typecast aside, mostly because it did work here, these characters border from stereotypical archetypes like Kirche to downright ripoffs like Tabitha, who is completely stealing from Yuki Nagato from her hobbies to the exact way she talks. It's like they told the seiyuu ""okay, now for this character, sound EXACTLY like Yuki Nagato from Haruhi.""  Yet the biggest offender by far is Saito, one of the most irritating Mary Sues of a harem hero I've ever come across. Not only does he manage to attract nearly every girl to him even though he does nothing for half the series, but the plot decided to give him the ability to defeat anyone he faces, and the one time he does lose, he goes off and sulks about it as if he thinks it's his god-given right to defeat everyone.  I mean, look... you have a fantasy world with magic and swords and dragons, so some special powers are to be expected, but the series actually gives Saito full deus ex machina capabilities by the end. It's disgusting how much this show gives him just so he can keep winning. The world of magic itself is no better. For a story relying a good deal on magic, the foundation of magic in this series is terribly simple. I will admit the cross-cultural ""magical artifacts"" were slightly amusing but even that grew tiresome.  The setting's relation aside, this series just doesn't know what it wants to do. It starts as a romantic comedy, then quickly shifts to a magical adventure without so much as a single notice. I also give no positive marks to a series that sets up a possible arc, then ends it after one episode with no resolution or purpose other than to show Louise in a bustier. Note that Louise in a bustier had nothing to do with the setup.  The best reason I can give for why this series was green-lit back in 2006 would be the boom of anime adapted from light novels and the birth of tsundere fandom, and it shows. There's so bad it's good and there's so bad I want to see just how bad it can get. Zero no Tsukaima is just bad. It's littered with cliches that have been run into the ground for years before this show, and the only new gag it can conjure up (horsewhip) just isn't funny no matter how much the series pushes them. Though Rie Kugimiya gives a solid performance and some of the world elements are intriguing, its desire to cater to every possible audience with a complete lack of direction or effort make it nothing short of a failure. If you're not a sexually-frustrated teenage boy who hasn't yet developed a distinction between good and bad anime, avoid this one.  Overall, I give Zero no Tsukaima a 3 out of 10.";Not Recommended
3;Zero no Tsukaima;Karpman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Karpman;4;"Zero no Tsukaima should be an enjoyable action anime based in a majestically magical world, sadly it executes the premise horrendously, clinging to repetitive comedy and a subpar plot. The characters were written poorly; this is evidenced by their shallow nature and monotonous interaction, of which Saito and Louise are the worst offenders.  So, Zero no Tsukaima (after this abbreviated as ZnT) has a premise of a modern Japanese boy who ends up in a fantasy world after being summoned by her master, who happens to be a young, petite girl, with a fiery attitude. And with these two not getting along too well, this should set things up for a nice rom-com, right..?  In practise it gives a different result, the slapstick humour is overused and literally milked down to the very last drip. As a show which relies on its comedy, it should be a lot more variable. But because it lacked in this department, it often came over as annoying, this form of comedy has been used well, just not in this show. If you repeat the same guy getting hit by the same girl for doing the same troublemaking, you are not get any more fans from it.  The other part ZnT tries to attract its fans with is action and fighting against the forces of evil, now it did this a bit better. Though the plot itself was far too simple to be properly praised, the way it executed its action and the fact that it could get serious for once, meaning some actual romance ensuing, which came along with some cheesy lines by the protagonist was one of the few things I have enjoyed about the series.  The plot itself, which was put on a side track, is mainly about the two protagonists overcoming the tests they are given at their academy, and how they deal with their ""growing"" feelings with each other.  The art-style is simple and quite easy to grasp, it suits the rom-com style it has. The animation is good, but nothing special. Not a lot to comment about this particular department.  The sound, which can be split into 3 different categories, Opening and ending themes, voice actors and general SFX. The first category, I think the opening fit the anime quite well, of course, it is all up to you whether you liked it or not, but if you enjoyed the anime a lot, the chance is a higher that you liked the themes and soundtrack it had as well. On the subject of voice actors I would like to stop a bit, since this anime contains what many have dubbed to be ""The Tsundere Queen"" in it. Now personally, I am not the biggest fan or her voice or roles, it is a little bit too high-pitched and comes over as annoying. Saito's image as a Louise's dog and maybe a slightly foolish teenager is well played by his respective voice actor. Other than that there is not too much to to be said. The SFX is something which is done, there is noting extraordinarily odd. So it is hardly something people can discuss about.  Now I will move on to the characters, which is my biggest disappointment of this whole series, there is not much in this pile of badly written characters I can give praise. So we have our main male protagonist Saito, who like I said earlier, came from the modern world, we know and live in. The first flaw I would like to give is, there is no desire to go back to his home. Does this person have the worst life in the world or something, normally, at that age. One would like to go back to his home. This is, in my opinion, a piece of bad writing on the aspect of backstory and character depth. By not making them have a past, they are very shallow, and this depth-ness is what distinguishes the generic character from the fleshed out one.  The second character who is ripe for some founded criticism is the main female protagonist, who is awfully loud & obnoxious. I would go as far to say that her character has been written in a way, that it effectively negates any progression this character could go through. When some kind of advance happens in the terms of romance between Saito and Louise (the main female protagonist), it is immediately undone by some kind of slapstick moment.  The rest of the cast is not worth a lot either, they have a low amount of motivation and hardly any depth as to why they should fight the protagonists, aside from the whole evil organization stuff.  The conclusion, is it worth watching? No. There is a lot of stuff which did this setup and plot better than this series, the positive point is that the second season is done a bit better, I might say that is worth watching.";Not Recommended

MAL users prepare your collective anus for what is possible the longest and most rantiest review you will ever read.  The first half of the review, the episode deconstructions, should only be read by those who have actually watched the show since it won't make sense otherwise.  ****************** DISCLAIMERS! ******************  - Do NOT take this review 100% seriously. While I will say that I personally hated it, it is completely fine if you do like it! I am only poking a bit of fun into, IMO, a very badly written story.  - Do NOT read if you do not wanted to be spoiled since this is extremely spoiler heavy.  - Do NOT read if you do not like profanity since the review is covered with it.  - This isn't really a disclaimer but more of heads up. Since this review is huge there will be grammar mistake and stuff so please forgive me!  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode one ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • Main character is retarded. His reaction for being abducted is very calm and abnormal. • He gets thrown the main chicks clothes and presumes its seduction, then acts like a retard (seriously what was he doing?). • He just sort of stands about having been abducted, his thoughts contradict his actions. • Why is everyone already an asshole in this show, so a human is forcibly made into familiar without consent and everyone is OK with that no questions asked. • The main chick is fucking insane. She is just platinum mad for no reason. • Of course she has to kiss him to seal the ritual. Well lots of things wrong with this. Firstly why was this not explained/shown beforehand? And why a kiss? To make their relationship deep and shit? • Why was the teacher not informed of the crazy chick beforehand? Why should the teacher just expect to believe her students for no good reason other than it won’t end well? • So only after he understands her words he decides to run away instead of asking for help/guidance, logical. O and he comes past one obstacle and the first thing he does is crawl. You have to be stupid to think that would work. It also undermines his whole situation. Does he take being held captive by a “cult” as a joke? • So the asshole with the rose starts levitating the main guy. What a dick. I mean that is one scared human (I think?) and he just playing him like he is some trash. Do the people not understand he is fucking human?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode two ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • So the main character is chained up. Firstly I have to question the ethics and humanity of Louise since she clearly gives no fucks about our main guy. She seems mentally unstable, after all she go into fits of massive rage and treats her own species like shit. Like would you even treat a familiar like this, even it wasn’t human? • Now she starts striping in front of him again. Ok so why does she think of him as a familiar and not human since he looks human and kind of acts like one? Does she have no shame? Also how does she expect him to wash her clothes if he is chained up? • O and our main guy once again shows us that he does not take the situation seriously (he has been taken away against his will) by just acting like an idiot when is throw some panties. • Also the main guy is a submissive little bitch. • Louise won't even dress herself. I mean that really is the epitome of lazy • Main guy seems to have adapted pretty well to the surrounding. I mean if it were me I would try everything to get the fuck away if I were being held AGAINST MY WILL but that’s just me you know. Also does this guy not care about his family? He has not even thought about them. What a guy. • Blonde rose guy again shows us his assholely when we find out he is dating two women at once. God is everyone in this show like this? I mean I have still to find one character that is likable. • Shounen power for the win. Got to have those cheesy speeches before you fight you know. • I also like how convenient it is for his powers to start working. So how much plot armour do you have? I’m betting a lot. • See more evidence that Louise is indeed mentally insane. She now has no problem taking care of him even though only at the start of the episode she was convinced he was just a familiar. Like what exactly changed? Because he had a fight with a “noble” and THAT made him look more human?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode three ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • Tsundere bitch. • Well I mean I was already pretty sure but our main character is of course a pervert. How original. How edgy. • And I shit you not I think I have experienced the most cringe worthy “song” ever. Like you can tell the writer but a lot of thought into that. Also even our main guy is a dick. • WOW. Main guy so smart. His thought process “OK so she has let me off the hook so I think I will continue to make fun of her even though she is crazy and risk not getting food”. Our hero, what a guy. • I had a feeling red hair chick was easy but really you want to bang that guy? I mean you have spoken to guy like once and you already want his dick? Makes sense. • This show is yoke right? She is in love with him? Kiddingz me? • This show never amazes me… that is all. • So not only is blond rose guy a cheating bastard but this bitch as well? Whelp. • This Louise character is truly a bitch. So after taking him away from red hair slut she proceeds to tell him she is going to treat him like a dog rather than human. HOLY SHIT. She has yet to treat him like a proper human thus far having chained him, eat food off the floor, etc. If she thinks that this is how a human should be treated she is utterly out of her mind. • Now she starts whipping him. This bitch needs to die. She is just awful to the people around her. I mean the reason doesn't even make sense, he is late due to something completely out of his control and she is “jealous” so she whips him. The writer is doing a great job hear making us hate all these assholes. • Seriously you’re going to put your hands there on her chest rather than her stomach? Like are you retarded? • So both of these chicks kick him the face when he says even something a little bit out of line. What a good way to show their love. • Also I’m pretty sure they are both complete idiots. The sword starts talking smack and they assume it’s him even though it sounds NOTHING like him. How smart. • These characters have no redeeming qualities. Main dude is a pervert, he is an asshole, and he complains a lot, retarded and one indecisive bastard. • Louise is a tsundere… I have nothing more to add even though I could.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode four ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • The bouncing boob sound. This show is truly classy. • So the maid is of course one of those people with low self-esteem until our main guy comes along. Like really I’m sure you would continue absolutely fine without him. After all there is nothing to suggest that you couldn't. After all the world building has been extremely poor so far. I know next to nothing about how anything works. • So our main guy know red head like him but still chooses to go into her room. If you are not going to give her the goofballs then why go in at all. Like to like to see her tease you but then be like “na fuck you bitch gunna now do the same thing to your rival”. What a guy. • O shit drama. Maid now has work for someone else and main guy, knowing her for only a few days will of course do something. • Typical bad guy who is a dick for no reason. • I like how the main guy just waltz into red head slut’s room and demands her treasure, explains nothing then goes into a fit of rage. Smart guy I swear guys. • Much romance. So deep. Shame this guy gives no fucks. • This main guy is hard to watch. Why does he just go into any situation head first without thinking about shit? He irresponsible and selfish. Nearly got bitch punished which he seems to care for so much (even though she is a bitch).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode five ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • “I could wash your panties live” – That main dude • Seriously though he is either retarded if he is serious or a masterful troll. I’m going to bet on the former. • So my understanding is that ALL the jokes are basically sex/echhi ones. God at least try to be original. I’m going to bet that they going to beat a dead horse to death with these jokes. • Yes! More harem bait in the form of the princess… didn't see that one coming. • So queen and bitch meet each other brace each other and state they are friends and only then does main guy ask “do you know each other?. Well of course they fucking do, they just said so! • How can no one notice the massive fucking golem? I everyone blind? • How am I supposed to take this show seriously when it trying to have a plot. OK so where the fuck are the guards when the golem attacked? Why can bitch break through the barrier being a n00b while the golem cannot? • It’s not your responsibility bitch buts it’s not the guards either since we don’t have any… • End episode with cliché #5923. You know the old I didn't run away because otherwise I wouldn't be an ‘insert relevant’ otherwise.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode six ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • Yhh bitch don’t even think about being nice to my familiar. O familiar I’m going to hit you for not rejecting one the few people who are nice to you. I mean god why doesn't the main guy understand? Because I certainly don’t. • OK. Time to use the logic hammer. So the princess is going too held accountable because of the lack security around the academy and it being around the princess. OK so security must be outright bad since whoever decided to concentrate the guards in a single area is retarded. Like someone could just come from the side, the sky or some angle and give her the deaths. What is stopping them since no one would see them until it’s too late. After all a fucking GIANT GOLEM was only noticed when it made a huge crack in the wall. And why would the princess be held accountable. Doesn't she have someone who deals with guard formations and whatnot? Why would they make her do it? • Wait so they just let red slut into the meeting no questions asked? Doesn't she have like a class to attend? • OMFG. So the headmaster asks who wants to go after the thief and of course those more suited for the job decline like pussies but agrees for the STUDENTS to go. Wtf what if they die? Will the headmaster just be like “o well”. I’d be OK with this if any effective world building had been established. But through the stuff I've seen so far this just seems completely retarded. • Lol that justification for letting them go after her. Ok by my logic Louise shouldn't go since she can’t do magic and is a massive liability. Headmaster states that he has HEARD slut is good at fire magic. So what? You’re going to let her go on hearsay? And from what I have seen her fire magic is no match vs golem. And I can’t comment shy girl since she is bland as all hell. We are TOLD she is a knight (how dull) so I guess that means she is good to go. • God those boob shots. Please have mercy on me. Common misconception (probably not to those reading) but boobs of that size and magnitude are actually just distracting rather than attractive. Like 1/7 would not fap. • OK so they go into the shed/house thingy to check for clues/staff and proceed to not check… apart from shy girl. So main guy and slut and fucking useless but hey shy girl good job. You’re like the only character to not piss me off. • So Tony appears and wreaks shit up and they attack it to no avail. Was I surprised? Of course not, their attacks where going to be fucking useless. • So bitch just stands their makes a silly speech about what it means to be a noble because of some pride she has. Is she stupid? Her pride nearly got her killed if it wasn't for our plot armoured Saito (main guy = Saito). • Holy shit. Main guy bitch slapped bitch. I have no complaints. 7/7 • She claims that she will be made fun of if she runs. She is mentally unstable I know but come on you would rather die than live and be made fun of a little? • Fucking shuonen fights. So boring if you know they no chance of losing in the slightest. • O man that twist. Shame I give no shits about her or the people she is trying to kill. Also how did she go from bitch to evil bitch with basically no foreshadowing other than HAIR COLOUR? • And we don’t even get to find out why she stole the dam thing. Real. • Fuck off main guy you have barely even tried to get back home so stop being so sad fuck one those harem girls you have. Jeez. • You are a fucking liar you do not want to go back home so shut your whore mouth. • Does this guy enjoy being someone’s servant? I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why he likes her or being a familiar since he is treated mostly like trash.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode 7 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • So the episode immediately starts off retarded with our main guy misunderstanding a kiss on the hand for kiss on the lip. Like bitch clearly stated kiss her on the hand. I mean this interaction isn’t even abnormal from the planet he comes from dammit. • Around 7:10 seconds. Why does this exist? • Please Dilan-sama have mercy on my soul. I don’t even know anymore. • So the slut who washes the dishes wants his dick already. Why?!? What about this guy makes all women want to fuck him. So according to outside sources this guy is a 4/7 on the “would you bang” scale. I don’t think a 4 warrants all these girls wanting his penis. • More assholes again. Of course the tax collector is just a dick for no reason other than to make Saito look like he actually cares. • “I’m the only one who is allowed to touch Louise” #Creepy #ThisStillSoundsCreepyWithContext • O shit what a tense cliff-hanger. I’m am literally on the edge of my seat. /sarcasm  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode eight ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • O look the boob groping “joke” while riding a horse. I swear they used that already… I will tell you what is wrong with this. Firstly holding someone’s chest rather than their stomach is just awkward while riding a horse so it makes no sense from a functional point of view. Also you are that much of a fucking pervert that you can just touch her pancakes. What a dick. This is actually one of the view times I am OK with her giving him abuse. Asshole deserves it. • Who hugs likes that’s? Just seems uncomfortable. • Just a general thought not related to the episode, I still think that tsundere bitch is completely broken in the head and the way she treats main guy is evil but I think I at least understand some of her anger. This guy is completed retarded and unlikable so I can get the rage. • So bitch has the most obvious feelings for main guy and is in utter denial. I am both understanding and totally confused. So does she actually realise she likes him or are her words not representative of her thoughts? Why does she like him? He is selfish asshole and is boring and unfunny. I mean hell, bitch herself probably abuses him for some of these reasons. • Wait shy girl and slut are actually friends? Is this real life? Why? They seem to have absolutely nothing common nor do they even speak much to each other unless she is needed for the plot. • Gawd, trying to use the sad story tactic huh? Seems grossly out of place in a light-hearted anime about boobs. I mean this will probably go nowhere and shy girl will only serve as more harem bait. Also this scene wasn't very impactful as it just kind of happened out of the blue with basically no foreshadowing. Like everything just seems to blown way out proportion with the music and crazy mum. • HOLD THE FUCK UP. Am I missing something or did I just go full retard? Did the mother of the shy girl drink that potion of mind rape knowing it would mind rape her? Why did she simply not throw is away? She clearly knew it was bad since she took it away from her daughter so why did she herself drink it? This make absolutely no sense what so ever. • Wait she can beat a three-headed dragon but not a golem? And without a familiar? Much consistent, so logic. • I think one wanting a bath… or for that matter keeping ones self-clean is universal to the human race not just the Japanese. Do you think the rest of us just roll around in the dirt? And yes this is such an insignificant thing but fuck this guy. • The maid is too fucking docile. Like really do you not understand the concept of bubbles? Could you not foresee someone being in that water? And why stand that close anyway? • He’s having a fucking bath what do you think he is doing? It’s not hard to piece together. • Wait a second! Did maid put bath in quotations as to question what a bath actually is? Baths and washing ones-self exists in this word right? • OK didn’t she have a pot to transport? Was she like well I’ve broken it so I can stop working now? She is just going to leave it there? Also main guy if you don’t intend to give her the goofballs then man up and tell her to gtfo because toying with her (since you know she likes you) is a dick move. • And he upset bitch. What a guy. He likes her right (I’m assuming he must since this a predictable harem/echhi show)? Why does he fuck around with women he is not interested right? • Not really sneaking if you rage talk to yourself out loud. Also isn’t talking to yourself like that a sign of mental instability? Telling you guys she is mad in the head. • So knowing that bitch is in “love” with main guy, even if it was accidental, will main guy do? I’m guessing he will mess around for a bit a toy with her some more. That is our main protagonist friends.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode nine ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • OK so this is a love comedy magic fantasy things so I get love potions a one those things that just exist in these kind of settings but is just seems highly unethical to use one of these things. Doesn’t forcing someone to love you beat the whole of someone loving you? And with consent? Also why does blond girl want blond rose guy to even like her? I got the impression she hated him? Since you know he is a dick to her. • O gawd everything this blond guy says sounds like it came out of an 80’s cheesy romance movie (not that I have ever watched one, just speculation on my part). He is basically as 1 d as you get. His personality is a potato. • Honestly I think one of things that most annoys about this anime is how its setting has potential. So you basically could explore a massive amounts of things/themes within the setting like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? How sad • Real! Love potions are forbidden by law. So how did blond bitch get a hold of one? Does she not care both the law and human ethics? She seems a like a pretty horrid person. • Blond girl doesn’t even look like she cares she forced some to love someone else without consent (this sounds stupid but it forbidden by law no?). • I like how they can leave the academy no one even cares/notices. Like they have places which they stay in so I assume they are supposed to stay on campus right? I mean don’t get me wrong if you want to leave campus no one should be allowed to stop you but isn’t it board daylight so wont classes be on? They are going to be punished for skipping class’ right? • The “comedy” is so bad in this show. I don’t really like to judge shows on comedy since I don’t understand Japanese comedy but this is just outright bad. So blond guy is “drowning” right and unlike any normal person he just continues to flap around like a retard other than just swimming to the edge since it literally like a meter away. Also can’t he just levitate himself out of water or something? • Has main guy killed before? He seems awfully ok with just killing a bunch of people for a tear. Given they are probably a bunch of assholes but I know I wouldn’t want killing a bunch of people on my conscious. Unless I’m misinterpreting eradicate for another meaning other than kill then this guy is an even bigger asshole than I could have ever though he would be. • I don’t understand the love potion. So let us assume the only thing the potion does is make someone fall in love with you and nothing else is changed. Bitch already was in love with the main guy… the only difference of not being affected with a love potion is that she was unable to share her feelings. Now that she can share her feeling why does she act completely different? She should still have that same bitchy personality but know she is just clingy and paranoid. A love potion shouldn’t cause her to have an entirely different personality. • Main guy treats bitch like she is 3 or something. “Be a good girl and stay there.” How condescending can you be? She is probably around the same age as you. • Wait a second was that a… decent plot twist? Don’t get me wrong everything is so shitty at this point that I can’t feel happy about but it was foreshadowed last episode so I don’t feel completely cheated it was them. Still though, shit characters and awful plot still make this bad moment. There is still NO tension or drama so it is just… disappointing • I feel like this is a little too serious over a fucking love potion in a comedy romance anime. • It’s one of those intense cliff-hangers guys. The mysterious man is named Cromwell, o shiiit.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode ten ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • See this is what annoys me. We have these “Germania” and yet we know nothing about them. So how am I supposed to feel when she tells bitch this? I take it that this is bad since she clearly doesn’t want to get married but honestly I feel nothing. I know nothing of Germania or the fucking country they live in. • This entire scene is out of place. To my understanding this show is a comedy harem show not a show with a plot and characters that matter. Like why would I care about any of the stuff they are talking about? Even for those who like the show this scene is just weird. I don’t know about any of the politics or nations or anything and the writers have decided to show us the worst way possible… by telling us rather than showing us. How am supposed to feel like any of this has meaning if I don’t get to see/experience it? How am I supposed to know Germania is really “barbaric”? • Well of course our main guy has the most powerful element: void. How exciting. • Cliché #4128 “You know, I will protect you” speech. I mean really now does such a thing have to be said? Shouldn’t it be a given that you protect her. I mean you might want to just reinsure her but could you have done it in a less cheesy fashion? • Again lack of foreshadowing has prevented any potential drama and interest from happening. This Ward-sama has come out of nowhere and is bitch’s husbando to be. Only problem with this is there was no build up or tension so I don’t really care. I also know that things will just resolve in nice knotted bow so yhh. • He is a nice guy huh? I bet you haven’t even had a conversation with him yet so you know not enough to make such an assumption. • Wait just a second? NO guy would do what this does if he didn’t want to give bitch the goofballs. Lying bastard. • I could be totally wrong and I legitimately mean it but I’m going to put money that ward-sama is not a nice guy. • I think another reason I don’t care they are getting married is that main guy doesn’t actually care. So why are they making a big thing out of it? Would be way more interesting if main guy actually tried to fight for Louise’s love. • Much drama. So original. 7/7 would watch again • Why are they suddenly fighting? This has come out of nowhere. No logical build up or anything. This makes no sense. What even is logic? • So main guy loses to Ward-sama and Ward-sama is like you are unable to protect bitch. While I agree somewhat with that statement it is still a little off. Firstly how to expect some teenager to beat you? It’s not exactly fair is it now. Also just because he lost to you doesn’t mean he will lose to others. He beat a golem your statement “you are unable to protect bitch” is inaccurate.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode eleven ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • He is crying? WHY?!? Are you just a giant pussy because you got beat in a fight you agreed to? • This guy just makes me even more fucking mad. This is actually one of the most awful characters I have ever seen. Even when bitch tries to cheer him up he just acts like a little emo bitch. Get over yourself and grow some balls. • O no Tony is back. Also really the clichéd #5331 evil laugh for no apparent reason. • This Ward-sama is fucking creepy. Why does he feel the need to whisper I will protect you into her ear? She not only heard you the first time but if you really felt the need to tell her again wouldn’t you have done it in a more normal way? A way that makes you seems less creepy. • FUCK OFF! ALL CAPS MODE ON! WHERE THE FUCK DID RED SLUT AND SHY GIRL COME FROM. WHY ARE THEY HERE? HOW DID THEY KNOW WHERE TO COME FROM? AND WHAT VERY CONVIENT TIMING! • Attacking from the side lol. She very clearly attacked you from the front. Mad coz bad? • You yoking me? She can just jump into the air and teleport off. Amazing. • How the fuck could red slut find out where they went? The only people who knew about the trip where the princess and those on the trip. So who could she have asked to find out? It couldn’t have been princess since she must have left as soon as she was done. Was it magic because that would be waaaay to convenient? And just because she said it took her all day to find out does not make it a valid reason. • Main guy again being an asshole. He asks a question the inn keeper and he answers him. And only because the answer was not specific enough he has to throw a fit and slams the desk. What a guy. • Real. She somehow heard Saito’s voice over an impossibly huge distance. I guess that makes their relationship deep and shit now? • Lol. “There is no one here” Suddenly 10 guards in front of your face. How could you miss them? • What? Now there is a war? And an organization pulling the strings? You are just making this shit as you go along aren’t you? • FUCKING CALLED IT! Ward-sama is a bad man. How predictable can this show get! • And they make bitch in need of help. Cliché #1 “Damsel in distress”. If you’re going to you use this please add something original otherwise you are a complete failure of a show. • Pls no more cheese in my face. Pls no more extremely convenient timings or cliché dialog. • O no you killed the guy that only have 2 mins of screen time! Masterful writing and timing. What a twist! Seriously though how do expect me to feel anything for this guy? I couldn’t care less since I don’t even know who he is. • Right so this guy just wants to marry bitch for her personality? WHY??? Explanations are in order right? It would make sense if you wanted to marry her for political power or something but this just makes no sense. • Jesus penis more ass pulls. Suddenly he has the power to absorb magic and make his sword stronger for no reason other than heart power? Why bother have him fight at all if he is just going to auto win? It’s like playing a game on very easy when you have already completed the game on normal. Like why play the game on very easy at that point. You already know how to play the dam thing. • “If we linger why any longer we are done for” say that while lingering. Why don’t you just move then? • OK so they kiss at the end. I kind of don’t mind this since it’s not in your face and shiz. Shame the characters, setting, and everything about the show sucks.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Episode twelve ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • I don’t think you can take full responsibility here. How about the people who hired Ward to be the guide. Surely it was there job to ensure that he would fulfil he his duties and that the fact he was unable to shows they hired the wrong person. • I like how the show is regressing rather than progressing. At this point the climax to the finale should be getting bigger. Why the episode has started with more echhi/tsundere shenanigans is beyond me. Why is it slowing down with only two episodes to go? • I fucking hate main guy. The asshole kisses bitch then acts like nothing happened. Why is he in denial? Also at this point he MUST know bitch likes him. So why does he just run off with maid and not explain anything to bitch? You are at the very least friends so the least you could do is explain why you are leaving. Jeez • Explain to main guy why is it ok that you don’t tell her? It’s not like you had to go right then and there I’m sure she would have given you time to talk to bitch. • OK so it’s going to be like that huh? You’re going to deny that you like bitch for whatever reason. You writers make me sick, just making main guy be in denial for no logical reason other than to keep this haram shit going. Pls stop writing. • Why does he look like he actually wants to go back home? This guy has barely said or done anything to even try to get back. I’m sorry but he is just a walking contradiction. • More random sad moments that come out of nowhere! So the princess was in love the prince? Where did this come from? And why should I care? I barely knew either of the characters. • How do expect him to mass produce gasoline if he doesn’t even know what it is? Do you even know how it’s made? Because given the technology this world has it seems to be it would be pretty hard to obtain.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Last episode ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  • Weird that they add a bunch of new sound effects to the OP of the last episode. I don’t really get it since they sound out of place since it doesn’t flow well with the sound already there. • “I will take command of our military” – Princess. OK time to use the logic hammer again. So the show has failed to present anything that would suggest you would be good at commanding an army. If anything the anime has suggested you would be an awful candidate for such a job. After all remember when that golem attacked the academy and you thought it would be a good idea to concentrate all your troops into one super dense area so you didn’t even know you were being attacked? It seems to be you are horrible at strategy and tactics. GG WP! • Notice how half of his memories are ones of either abuse or sadness with bitch. See how their relationship is mostly artificial with no real weight? • That is the most underwhelming invasion I have seen. One ship? Kiddingz me? • That outfit the princess is wearing seems pretty impractical. What is she going to do? Seduce her enemies to death (which to be fair might not be the worst plan…)? • OK I thought the invading parties numbers where underwhelming but the defending side is a joke. How am I supposed to take this war seriously? Also why the fuck is bitch there? She can’t possible defend herself against trained soldiers. Won’t she be a massive liability? • Why is blond rose guy still in his uniform? This show is retarded. • I have no more yoke to give. I don’t understand anymore. The impracticability of both flying a plane and using his sword at the same time. • Where are the defending sides’ mages? Don’t they have any? Why is just Tony a problem? • Even more retarded stuff. Why doesn’t she make a new golem? Why was she not burned to deaths since she was covered in the oil? • Ward-sama has map awareness of a potato. Isn’t this guy to be an elite fighter? Why didn’t he see that dragon attack coming from a mile away? • Of course Loiuse happens to be super op and have the most broken magic in the world. How interesting. See this is just boring since we know that it’s just bound to work with no consequence. • Did bitch just mass murder everyone on the opposing side? Given the attacking side where a bunch of dicks and I don’t think they had a chance to surrender but still… • So after all he has been saying about how badly he wants to get home he fucking doesn’t? FUCK OFF! You lying piece of shit. I guess this is just a middle finger to your family huh? “O sorry guys I’d rather flirt with a bunch of girls than be with my family”. Our fucking hero, what a guy! • Cliché villain is beaten just like that. What an ending you know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Since I have a lot to conclude I will divide the conclusion into multiple sections.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So this is where most of the problems lie in this show. A decent show at least depends on characters that are likable and this show has no likable characters. I will deconstruct the ones that matter and give my opinion on how they can be improved.  Saito - This is possible the worst character of this show... or of any show. He fails even the most basic traits of a good character. He is not relatable in any way having basically zero charisma, being an asshole for no reason, flirts around with a bunch of women even though he likes Louise and she likes him back, indecisive, rushes head first without thinking about it, etc.  He also doesn't care much about his family which he basically never mentions and never feel homesick yet always makes the claim that he wants to return home. Not only is this a contradiction but it makes him come a across as a heartless asshole.  What the writers could have done IMO is have him talk a little bit about his family. This would not only make him come across as a more likeable and relateable guy but actually proves that he wants to go back home.   Louise - Her character is just a complete and utter mess. I don't like the tsundere archetype since these people don't actually exist in real life so its hard to relate to them however if character development/history is explored and developed enough then that is perfectly acceptable.  Her tsundere ways are, however, not even remotely explained so she just comes across as a crazy bitch. Had the writer just been bothered to give even a small explanation then her character might have been bearable. And personally I would have toned down the crazy a bit.   No other characters are worth talking about since they are just 1-D cardboard cutouts.  My overall score for characters is 1/10.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Story ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The story is abysmal if you can even call it a story. The structure and flow and completely nonsensical. It basically does its own thing when it likes and how it likes it. Since I cant describe the story much beyond the synopsis because it is so random I will not bother.  Instead I talk about how how the story could be improved. For one the story could actually have a sense of direction by using, for example, the goal of the protagonist to get home and his journey. It can also explain some of the themes its premise presented like social classes and mage rankings. You could also have that conflicting theme between choosing the people you have come to love in one world over the people you love in another. You also could have a had a theme on how difficult it is to adapt to a new setting when you are so used to an old one and how those people around you can help you. It also could have had a theme of what is more important in this world: being human or familiar? (taken from episode nine). By using these the story could be great!  Story gets a 1/10  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Animation, art-style, sound, acting and all that jazz ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Honestly all of this stuff was alright but not great. The animation was alright apart from the fights which where just very unimpressive and uninspired.  The art was kinda OK. Backgrounds where actually pretty decent but character designs where mediocre. Saito's in particular was bad, just being very bland and generic just like his character. At least SAO had amazing visuals to make up for its awful writing.  Sound was decent. That is all. Voice acting was also decent. No one stood in particular but no one was bad.  Overall: 5.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My enjoyments/final thoughts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Alright so I hated this anime but at the same time I also quite enjoyed it. Yup. It was fun ripping it apart and being honest I can kinda maybe understand if someone liked this.  Enjoyment gets a 7/10  The main reason I rate the show so low is because of the potential it hard to better than the average with its intriguing setting and possibilities. But because it failed it has made me sad and mad.  The show gets a 1/7. WOULD NOT WATCH EVER AGAIN!!!!!!;Not Recommended
5;Zero no Tsukaima;animeglaze;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animeglaze;2;Story 3/10 The story starts in a magic school where the failure of a female lead summons our protagonist to be her familiar. A magic school is a wonderful ideal in theory however this is not used in any sort of effective manner. It uses magic in the story but only for minor bits of action and torturing Saito so it takes the fantasy out of it. It quickly devolves into a bland, tasteless harem comedy that really isn't even that funny. The characters have no really explored back-story and feel like they were picked out of a harem character pool of cliches.  Art 6/10 I have no real complaints about the art. It doesn't blow you away but it's pretty decent.  Sound 5/10 The sound wasn't bad and the OP was pretty good. The ending song however leaves much to be desired so the score takes a beating in my eyes.  Character 1/10 I would have given a lower score if it was possible. This score does not take into account voice actors. First the protagonist, Saito, He has no depth to him at all. When he was being tortured he took it like it was no big deal and he had no real inclination to run away after the first time. He is then found to love the one character who treats him like crap. Next we have the main female character, Louise, who is also said failure. She is a character with absolutely no good points whatsoever. She is without a doubt the worst main female character I have ever seen. She is advertised as a tsundere but we quickly find she is just a really horrible human being. She made the anime go from harem comedy to glorified torture porn, BDSM, etc. within two episodes. She tortures, starves, and verbally abuses him in a way that goes from funny to cringe-worthy in halfway into the second episode and it never really goes back to funny. She has tons of pride but no fighting ability whatsoever. She makes herself fight all the time and then ends up having to be saved by the very guy she tortures on a daily basis. The rest of the characters really only serve as a way to give Louise new reasons to torture said MC.  Overall 2/10 The art and sound are decent but do nothing to make up for the story itself. The plot is boring and where sometimes cliched does not mean bad this story makes it worse. The characters though are what truly makes this story truly horrid.;Not Recommended
6;Zero no Tsukaima;sen_mcgrath;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sen_mcgrath;4;"I enjoy a good romcom every once and a while, and if it can be combined with another genre to create more or better situations, then all the better right? A situation, setting, and characters can make a romcom really good, even if it's taking an old concept and adding in a new element.  So we get Zero no Tsukaima. the story of a noble mage from a magical realm and her familiar, a human from our world. Sounds like a good mash-up like Inuyasha, Shakugan no Shana, or any of the many magical girlfriend animes out there. The problem is, this series, though it combines familiar elements to make something new, it does not seem to work well. While I loved Baka to Test for combining slice of life high school drama with monster training, this simply did not do it for me. To be honest, Zero came off as cut and pasted together, with nothing really original to offer.  Plot: Louise is a mage in training in her second year who must summon a familiar as part of her curriculim/rite of passage. In what seems to be a freak accident, Louise summons a normal boy from our world in moddern Japan. Hilarity ensues?  Most of the plot revolves around Louise and the boy, Saito's relationship. Saito struggles with wanting to go home, Louise struggles to prove herself a strong and capable mage, and the two go on various missions together. Oh, yeah, and boobs. It seems at every twist and turn there is some woman with a large chest who is inexplicably attracted to Saito. Misunderstandings ensue and Louise whips Saito with a riding crop in an attempt at slapstick comedy. Besides, we've seen this in almost every other romcom harem comedy. Boy meets girl, boy sees other girl in suggesgive situation, original girl beats ever loving crap out of boy. This might be funny once or twice, but the joke repeats, and repeats and repeats on a loop throughout the whole series. Lather, rinse, repeat. And when a relationship does start to develop between Saito and Louise, Saito still seems to be interested in other girls. Rather than using this for actual conflict or drama, it results in, yep, more whipping. No development of their relationship, no understanding, just whipping. Louise doesn't even bother switching up punishments, or using other gags as punishment.  As for the magical school element, many have compared this to Harry Potter. I would sooner compare it to The Worst Witch. In a magical school, Mildred Hubble is the worst witch, unable to perform even the most basic spells and earned the nickname 'Worst Witch' from her peers, and later discovers she, in her own way, is in fact quite powerul. Sound familiar?  The story takes a turn about halfway through and tries to add in a little political intrigue. Tries. In the end, it doesn't really accomplish the backstabbing, coat and dagger politics of Last Exile or Le Chevalier D'Eon. They seem to be trying, adding in familiar, historical and mythological elements to the story. Unfortunately, they are often full of holes, poorly executed, or seem to come completely out of nowhere. Let's take Tabitha for example. The quiet bookworm friend of Louise's school rival Kirke is revealed to be a Princess from Gallia. She might have inherited the throne too, if her father had not been murdered by a faction that wanted to put her father's brother on the throne instead. Her uncle also wanted Tabitha out of the line of succession (which would not happen with Early modern primogeniture laws in which MALE heirs suceed) and one of his supporters tries to kill her via a glass of poison. Her mother gets wind of it and...alright, seriously, if someone tries to poison your kid do you A) Take the poison away from her and use it as evidence to bring the bastard to justice B) Take the poison away from her and dispose of it so everyone will be safe C) Take the poison away from her and drink it youself inducing a lifetime of mental scars for your child and leaving her to fend for herself when you become and insane vegetable. Tabitha's mother and parent of the year chose C. Political intrigue? Yes. Well executed? No, not really.  What really grates me about this series though is the History parallels. Each country has an Early Modern European counterpart. Gallia is France, Germania is Germany and Albion is England. Might be original if I hadn't seen it in Trinity Blood first. But in the Albion subplot, involving a revolution, involved elements that personally offended me as someone with Irish heritage.  A romcom with excessive panties and gags about boobs, brought up Oliver Cromwell.  Not Cromwell himself, but his equivalent in a parallel universe. That still doesn't make it acceptable to me though. Some might say I'm butthurt over something that happened hundreds of years ago, but this to me is serious. Oliver Cromwell slaughtered 25-40% of Ireland's population, and became the closest thing to a military dictator England hand, led an ultra Puritain regime that banned Christmas, staughtered Catholics by the thousands, and these people had the absolute gall to turn him into a villain in an anime romcom focusing on panties and boobies. Next time, let's imply something about Hitler, shall we?  The Sound was something I kind of liked. It was nothing special, but the European flavor brought out the exotic location well. The J-pop opening was cute, and fitting with the cutesy style of the characters and the romantic comedy premis, and the ending seemed to sum up the character's feelings as well. If you have a choice between sub and dub, pick sub. The English voice track left a LOT to be desired.  The art was reminissent of moe and seemed to have a slight influence from nineties fantasy anime like Escaflowne. The animation was nothing mindblowing, but it stayed at a consistently good level throughout the whole series, never really dipping in quality. Character designs are pretty standard. There's the flat loly, her big breasted mature rival, the book worm, the playboy, the fat kid, the old wizard, the normal boy...we;ve seen them before, and honestly they did not try to do anything really new or unique in the character designs.  As for the characters themselves, they might as well been pulled out of a stock folder. The young girl who has useless magic and turns out to be a sort of 'chosen one'. The busty and sexually mature rival to the smaller girl who's main motivation is sex/love. The bookworm with a tragic/interesting past who rarely speaks or socializes. The playboy. The perverted old man. The normal everyman for otaku boys to project themselves on. Villains whose main motivations are being evil for the sake of being evil (seriously, they take over a kingdom, and slaughter the royal family, and we have no idea WHY. Also the Cromwell reference. I won't forgive this series for that.) None of the characters seem the least bit original, and their dialogue is completely cliched.  As for Enjoyment, I know a lot of people like this series and I can see why. There's something here that almost everyone can enjoy. Girls can get into the romance, guys can like the fanservice and explosions. At the same time though, it's all usually underdeveloped, cliched, or unexplored. I suppose this might be covered in later seasons, but in this one, nothing really gets resolved. The good guys save the day, but the show's main focus, Louise and Saito's relationship does not seem to have changed since day one. Saito screws up, Louise beats him, end series. For those who like the cliches, good for you and you will probably like this. For me, I didn't, I explained why, and please respect that.  Warnings: Panties galore, boobs, boob gags, mild language, character death, fighting, explosions, abusive relationship, reference to debatably genocidal miserable wretch of a human being who slaughtered my ancestors.";Not Recommended
7;Zero no Tsukaima;Jahxxx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jahxxx;2;!Spoilers but you will need to read this b4 you watch 100%!  OK, so i could write a complicated review about why i disliked this so much, but im to lazy to do that so here it goes   Story: Fk of Dude gets pulled out of some dimensional arse, and is just told to deal with it. AND HE FKING DOES. Well ok, but then he becomes the servant of some little bitch, AND HE AGAIN SEEMS TO BE OK WITH IT. And she treats him like an animal, not a human for some odd reason i cant wrap my mind around. Then there's all of a sudden this Void magic, and MC is apparently the familiar of the only void mage ever, even though he just got pulled out of the arse. But they apparently think we wouldn't realize. Its so dumb that it hurts. The most original part of this was either the slut or the pedo tbh.  Art: The only good looking character is the red haired Slutty chick, so that's that but not so bad i guess.  Sound: I wanted to kill myself after hearing the dub, so i went sub. BUT I GOT FKING SURPRISED WHEN THAT WAS EVEN WORSE. The bitch sounds like a 4th grader who has parents with more money then fking Justin Biber.(and she sounds like a fan of him) aka garbage get out of my face.  Character:Ok, wtf. It was so fking hard to watch after like ep 8 and i kinda began to hate it... Mostly because of the Bitch, and the MC. Mc clearly loves the flat chested bitch for some odd reason, even though he has someone like fking Siesta and that just pissed me of so god damn much. He's a fiking pussy for not fking that red haired hot chick, who actually was nice to him and offered it multiple times. Then they at the end get a fking moment and he forgets that he wanted to fking leave. Like cmon. And why i didn't just run away from such a dumb bitch is beyond me tbh. He like, legit just got pulled out of his everyday life by some bitch and he accepts it. jesus fk i hate him.  Then there's the ungrateful bitch who takes MC for granted and legit abuses him daily. MC puts up with her bs and does not give a fk, which also blows my mind. She loves him aswell obviously but shes still a stuck up little bitch against him. She legit makes him sleep on the fking floor, like are you dumb he has saved you multiple times and is a OG badass(and pussy) but you treat him like garbage. Fk of ya dumb cunt.  Enjoyment: I enjoyed watching hentai more then this, not just pleasure but all around liked.  Overall: Suck my dick, i wanna die.;Not Recommended
8;Zero no Tsukaima;Nightscream;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nightscream;3;"The story is another clich&eacute; that we've seen a lot and this time it really is bad. The main story has as many plot holes as you can imagine (without taking into consideration how bad it is itself). The visual quality is really bad taking into consideration that it's not that old of an anime. The character development is almost non existent and for the ones that do develop it is really bad. A lot of characters make an appearance without the proper relations to the story and that makes it almost idiotic. Except for one case, everyone is either good or evil so you know where it's going to end with anyone. The music is really stupid and even though it goes with the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the show it could have been a lot better (believe me, I'm being pretty generous).  Nevertheless, the reason I enjoyed his show despite all and every bad aspect is because of it sense of humor. Almost every episode had me laughing and thats the only reason I finished it.  So if you really don't mind those incredible bad aspects and you want to laugh a little then give it a chance.";Not Recommended
9;Zero no Tsukaima;samjjms;https://myanimelist.net/profile/samjjms;4;*SPOILER FREE REVIEW* I often wonder how Zero no Tsukaima received 4 seasons of production.  Story 3/10 The plot of the show wasn't terrible, but many ideas weren't original at all. There was concepts that was blatantly ripped off from other sources, which was pathetic. Furthermore, a good portion of the season was used displaying the characters as they ventured on their whimsical affairs, seemingly oblivious to the actual plot. The pacing was nice and consistent, though the plot twists were glaringly obvious and failed to captivate.  Art 7/10 The art was clean and the animation was smooth. Nothing that stood out though.  Sound 5/10 The OP and ED was completely forgettable.  Character 2/10 This show had 2 main characters, following Louise and Saito. Both were terrible main characters. Saito is the epitome of bland. He had next to no redeemable qualities, nor interesting character traits. The only distinctive trait was that he was a pervert. Moving on, Louise is easily among the top most dislikable female leads. She is annoying, abrasive, arrogant, dogmatic and terribly temperamental. Yes, she is that bad. There are only two actual love interests, and the other girls had half-baked relationship development. Speaking of development, almost every character failed to have adequate depth. Zero no Tsukaima would be a stereotype heaven. They used every cliché in the book, causing the characters to give off a flat and uninteresting feel.  Enjoyment 2/10 Every moment was awfully predictable, and coupled with the illogicality of the characters, this anime really frustrated me.  Overall 4/10 Zero no Tsukaima was dreadful, and I would not recommend it.;Not Recommended
10;Zero no Tsukaima;D0g0n2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/D0g0n2;3;This show makes me freaking mad.  This show features a character by the name of Louis, she's arrogant, she treats the main character as her possession, sees herself as better then others because of her noble lineage, whips the main character when they cross her in even the most minute way to the point were he has open wounds all over his back and she apparently does this so often that she buys an improved whip, she never gets better not really at least, her character development is a lie, and she is never punished. But worst of all this wretched person is the main girl, she's meant to be a tsundere. Her straight up abuse of the main character is meant to be funny, because abusive relationships don't need to be stopped if it's a women abusing a man.  Their are other cute girls of course, girls who like the main, but no it's Louis who gets the boy. This little brat with her inflated ego, and her blood stained whip.  Is their anything else memorable about this anime. Ehhh not really no the world is pretty damn generic, the main character is so generic I can't even remember his name. They have a few interesting ideas here and their but their nothing to write home about. but the worst part is their need to maintain the status quo it doesn't matter what happens we always come back to the status quo and as I said Louis doesn't improve. Does it look like she's improving? Wait a few episodes and she'll be back to her bitchy self.  Anyway the anime is largely pretty forgettable, and it makes me more pissed off then any other anime in existence and I have watched a lot of anime.;Not Recommended
11;Zero no Tsukaima;EvilMayDie64;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EvilMayDie64;2;"Zero no Tsukaima is a fitting anime to watch if you are a lolicon masochist with a S&M fetish and your greatest dream in life is to have your face pressed under a girl's boots. If you're not, you might find it as an overly sadistic attempt at a slapstick comedy with an absurd romance, a bit of ecchi and the average boy getting a harem formula.  Generic Ikari Shinji knock-off Saito gets summoned into a fantasy world to serve as the familiar of a zero-talent loser mage, Louise. This fantasy world has a Middle Ages social setting with nobles, who can use magic, and peasants, who can't. And feudal kingdom setting to build up some background political drama to avert attention from this show's main theme. Anyways, Saito is instantly labeled a peasant and finds himself forced to become Louise's slave. And except for a few magic tricks he uses, thus getting Siesta (a maid, best girl) and Kirche (noble girl, slutty but decent compared to the female lead) to droll over him, and a few situations where he makes a difference, Saito is nothing but a loser with a strong Stockholm Syndrome who doesn't even want to return to Japan that much. As for Louise, I can only say that if most main girls are irritating with their tsundere antics, she is downright the worst female lead I have watched in a while. Louise is not even a tsundere, she is just a spoiled child too indoctrinated by her feudal status that she fails to even regard Saito as a human being, much less try to understand his circumstances, coming from a world where humans are equal in rights and chances. Either too hot or too cold; she lets him see her naked or even dress her up while she would wipe or even starve him at the slightest mistake. Good luck in getting some cheap generical prophecy and politics for a plot to cover that up. I was only able to find Siesta slightly likeable out of all characters, even though she is more or less the typical Japanese maid (she is of Japanese origin through a great-grandfather, as to have that trope make more sense 😂).  I won't comment on the animation, considering this is a 2006 anime after all, as for the sound, I wonder if it was there in the first place.  So, you're a masochist and want an anime to fulfill your domination fetish? Suit your needs.";Not Recommended

13;Zero no Tsukaima;Dinkleberry;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dinkleberry;3;"This series was difficult for me to get through. This was recommended to me since I enjoy fantasy and a good romance series. I figured this was right up my alley. Boy was I wrong.  I was never a big fan of the tsundere-type characters, though it hasn't ruined a show for me, at least not until this series. Louise is one of the worst main characters that I've seen. Her male counterpart is bound to her, so she literally treats him like an abused dog. I'd be fine with this series if the characters matured over time, but the lack of ""dere"" from Louise just makes her seem like a spoiled bully all throughout. For me, a perfect example of tsundere done right, would have to be Taiga in Toradora! She's all ""tsun"" at the beginning but grows softer/kinder as the series progresses, unlike Louise in this series.  Saito is no better. He saves her time and time again, but the dude lacks a spine when it comes to her. He allows her to beat him, he flirts with other girls, even though he knows that it will result in further beatings. Then he comes back to her with hearts in his eyes because he really cares for her. Other women are practically throwing themselves at him, yet he's head-over-heels in love with the bully that has trust issues.  Writing this out, it sounds more like a love story between a sadist and a masochist, which isn't for me. I just don't understand this sort of relationship.";Not Recommended
14;Zero no Tsukaima;YumoS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YumoS;4;I watched this anime because i wanted to see another isekai anime in a fantasy setting. The overall quality of the anime is very poor. The story is very simple and the characters are like the animation 2 dimensional. They dont improve or grow. They are stuck in this endless cycle of repetition. Making the same jokes, making the mistakes and daily routine of the same events.  I didnt enjoy this animation but was forgiving in the hopes that at the end we will see some grand finale which was an utter dissapointment to say the least. I cant understand the high score of this and have to come to the conclusion that it means nothing and that the average anime consumer has no ability to evaluate the quality of such media and likes anything that makes some stupid fanservice to have anything to show for.  If you enjoy quality anime then dont waste your time with this poorly made abomination which calls itself anime. If you like to be stuck in a time loop of mentally ill girl who abuses the horny and dumb guy who likes to be treated like a dog, and shows her panties all the time then go for it.;Not Recommended
15;Zero no Tsukaima;WeebKal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WeebKal;4;"So this review is for those coming from Toradora, because ""it's also about the relation of a tsundere and her dog"".  If you are looking for another anime with great character development, secenes that will make your heart melt and, you know, actually something happening in the romance category, just don't even bother. I won't go too much into detail (still some spoilers ahead), but for the general idea of what the main's relation will be at the end of season 4, it is enough to watch the first 4/5 episodes. Nothing changes. No progress. At this point I am pretty sure the creator just forgot to add character development.  There isn't a real story either, no general goal, stuff just happens, the characters (appart from some minor exceptions) don't really show any motivation like you might expect from this genre (""Oh we need to kill the demon king or whatever""). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for this show it just results in every episode being detachted from every other. I once (in a later season) tried skipping ahead a few episodes and it didn't even feal like I missed anything important.  The only thing that is good to okay is the art and sound design. But that doesn't save the show from a lack of everything else.  I wanted to care about the characters, especially the mains relationship seemed interesting at least. But oh boy, I'm just gonna Rick Roll myself, so I won't be let down as hard as I have by this show.  So yeah, don't watch this unless you want to start hating every character you once felt some minor attachment to.";Not Recommended
16;Zero no Tsukaima;Resting_Bonfire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Resting_Bonfire;4;Zero no Tsukaima  The Familiar of Zero    A little hint for everyone who watched this Season. If you didn't like the first season, then stop watching it right now. Everything that comes after this one (mostly Season 3 and 4) will probably hurt you a lot. Because this one was actually the best Zero no Tsukaima Season.  I watched the anime for the first time in 2010 and was actually well entertained at the time. Now I have looked at it again to allow myself a better judgment.  Well, what did I expect and what did it cost me?  -  Zero no Tsukaima has a pretty solid setting for an isekai with a pleasant background idea. The actual plot that takes place behind the seasons is at least there. There are some sympathetic characters and a few subtle comedy scenes.  However, this is not only the first season of the series but also the best in terms of quality. This season, the characters have at least approaches and some personality. In the following seasons, the fan service dominates and the protagonist's intelligence finally ends in the basement.  It should be noted that the series has real potential. Unfortunately, the work was not in able hands, which is where this result came about.    Story  The plot is halfway satisfactory, provided you lower your standards. There is some conflict about the nobility, issues related to the war, and the actual everyday life of the protagonist. The implementation is poorly mediocre. Mostly all of it, but spread over the seasons, which means that the plot is extremely minimal for each season.     Animation / pictures  Below average. Movements were blurred and full of still images. Fights and scenes have no charisma or dynamism. But hey, you could hardly hold back your budget for the fan service scenes.   Characters  This is where the characters in this work had their climax, everything that comes after this season has been a bitter descent.  Saito was still an acceptable protagonist, at least in part, and had some normal traits. In the coming seasons, he's just a tail-controlled dog.  Louise is just unbearably annoying this season and all of her actions are completely irrelevant, uncomfortable, and dull. Her train of thought, however, is a bit more interesting, as is her compulsive aristocratic pride. In contrast to the other seasons, it is made up of the two protagonists, at least the more pleasant one.   The supporting characters are at least humorous this season and you shouldn't get used to that because it's only like this season. From season 2 onwards they have hardly any screen time and if they do, it's completely flat. Church and Tabitha are particularly positive. They stand out above the rest of the characters.  Music  The intro has its own individual style. The Osts are also quite suitable for this title and can particularly subtly underline the comedy scenes.   Conclusion  This season actually has some kind of charm, in the end. A lot of potentials were certainly wasted here and a lot more could have been created out of it.;Not Recommended
17;Zero no Tsukaima;Norm72;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Norm72;3;"Again ... how the heck is this anime on all the ""best isekai"" ""best romance"" anime lists?  Ok just start with the good things first: animation (that's all) No joke ... the animation quality is the only valuable thing here.  The plot is ok but more like meh. Filled with cliches. SPOILERS ahead: To be perfectly true i really enjoyed the isekaied soldier/weapons line. That was great.  BUT. The characters are like the ones in those cheap soap operas. There will be no real character development, just the cliches (forced as heck). There is no single character worth to mention. The MC is a simp, totally unreasonable, maybe some brain damage from the portal? The MC ""heroine"" is a whiny piece of human junk. I know it's just a fantasy, but even after the last episode i can't really identify the genre of this series. Like there is no real romantic development, no great fight scenes with consequences, they do not reveal much about this world or the history of the MC, the plot goes nowhere. Feels like a series of filler episodes.  ""best romantic anime"" my arse ... there is no likable character in the entire story except the familiars and the perverted old guy. :D When i fist saw him in a funny scene i was hoping for some trash humor but no ... not even some guilty pleasure for me.  The music is nothing mentionable either. Don't believe the big anime list web pages, doesn't worth watching at all.";Not Recommended
0;Zero no Mono;the_seventh_l;https://myanimelist.net/profile/the_seventh_l;5;"Story: Basically, a guy with no name who attends college is obsessed with sex -- mainly, sex with women. He bumps into a preppy girl on the way home and winds up inside her apartment, when -- what else? -- sexy times commences. Only it's more kinky sexy times than anything else. And did I mention his snazzy pick up line? Throwing a jar full of semen at her. Nice. Between that and the ending which is all kinds of messed up, it warrants a 6/10. Story brings nothing original to the table, but it's not completely devoid of ideas.  Art: Art is possibly the worst thing when it comes to Zero no Mono -- and for a hentai anime, poor art is a killer. The character designs are boring, the girls' bodies look rather the same with the exception that part of preppy girl's body has bandages on it. The guy looks like a filler-drawn version of Rex from Yu-Gi-Oh!, which detracts from any fapping experience you could have with this piece. Not to mention during some of the sex scenes, it becomes blindingly obvious the animators got lazy and just looped small parts of animation to make it look like they did more work that they did. Art gets a 4/10 -- at least they kept it consistently mediocre, right?  Sound: Sound is pretty good. The voices for the characters, especially the main male's VA, sound rather fitting for their roles. The standard moans &amp; groans during sexy times are all right, nothing special. Background music is classic hentai soundtrack, complete with wailing sax and low-key piano. 7/10 is the sound, making it probably the highlight of the anime, technical-wise.  Character: Everyone is rather cookie-cutter in terms of characters: there's the bored sex fiend, the preppy girl looking for kinky sex, the nonunderstanding teacher, the nameless couple having sex in a deserted area. Even the supposed plot twist of the true nature behind the preppy girl isn't very shocking seeing as she had acted that way since her first scene, but meh. At the very end, the main character seems to have a temporary change of heart -- is living only for sex a way to live? -- but savor it while you can, for it leaves as soon as it arrives. 5/10 for character.  Enjoyment: I enjoyed myself watching this as much as anyone would, I suppose, except I couldn't stop thinking things like &quot;how can he stick his hand up that far without breaking something?&quot; -- in other words, there wasn't a proper suspension of belief to truly enjoy this anime. Not to say I hated it, it just seemed like I took more pauses than usual due to the plodding nature of the piece's pacing. 6/10 for enjoyment.  Overall: It's a short OVA piece that isn't a total waste of space but has too many detractions to make it a quality piece of hentai -- namely, the animation and the characters. But the techniques executed during the sex scenes, not to mention the Jar O' Semen and the twist at the end, might be enough to warrant a watch purely for the lulz. In overall, I'd give it a 5/10, and suggest it only to those bored and looking for a truly mindless hentai or just oddly curious at the basic idea behind Zero no Mono.  Also, throwing your own semen at a random girl on the street = worse way to pick up chicks ever.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zero no Mono;Etoile_sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Etoile_sama;3;"I watched this hentai awhile back, but I can always remember it as being the worst one I've ever watched.  Put shortly, it sucked.  Sitting there watching it, I could not even believe that something could suck so much. You'd think they'd make up for the crappy story by AT LEAST having nice art and graphics, but there really aren't any redeeming qualities about it. Actually, it could have been a vice-versa, they could have made the story better if they knew the art wasn't going to be the best, but if they did, I would not be insulting it in this way.  The characters are just plain idiotic. Nothing about them made them the slightlest bit likeable. In a sense, they were just outright deranged. The main character was a piece of shit pervert wannabe rapist (no surprise there) and he runs across an equally perverted sadistic girl who actually tries to make herself seem like a masochist, when in fact she's just a conniving bitch who tricks the main character. In a sense, it's like a just deserts for the main character, since he is in fact a major douche, but seriously, that ""major"" twist at the end wasn't even enough to make up for the terrible plot.  I was really waiting for the moment that it would maybe get better. Admittedly, I went in knowing it wouldn't be the best, but I did not think my expectations would be disappointed so terribly. The description here actually gives it hope for being somewhat interesting, and I will give it that the whole idea of throwing cum at a girl and having it work out in your favor was an odd, but interesting component, but it really wasn't enough to pull it out of the steaming pile of shit it had landed on.  Really, watch this if you want a few laughs, 'cause I can admit to chuckling a bit at how outrageously terrible it was. Seriously though, don't go in expecting anything great, it can't even be defended by saying that it was understandable for it to be shit because of the time period it came out in, I've really watched better hentai from the same time period.";Not Recommended

0;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;KitsunehimeMilhi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KitsunehimeMilhi;7;"I'm kind of mad because I had my review started and than I accidentally closed the browser. I guess I'll be writing it again. Luckily, I wasn't that far.  Grimoire of Zero certainly has brought out mixed feelings among the viewers. Many people really like or even love the show, while many others, like myself, just like it. There are also the people who just don't care for it that much. It's good either way, but it does have its ups and downs.  The story is simple. Zero and Mercenary meet unexpectedly after Mercenary falls from a hill top above where Zero was camping out when he was being chased by witches, I believe (I actually forget the details concerning his fall from weeks ago). She forms a contract with him than and promises to turn him into a human, as long as he helps her find the Grimoire of Zero, which is a book she created that is filled with tons of magic spells and has spread far throughout the land. The book was stolen from her and she want sit back before it falls into the wrong hands. The two also meet Albus,a young witch in the group, the sorcerers of Zero. The three of them start their adventure and ht some of their initial walls. The first half of the show is a lot more character driven, which was a little dull at times because the anime seemed to be concentrating on simple stuff like that instead of on finding the grimoire of Zero and advancing the story. Luckily, the second half shows more of the conflict surrounding the war that is close to breaking out between humans and witches, and has many plot twists throughout the scenes. It could be a better story, but at least it was satisfying and ended on a really good note. The best part about it is that it feels like an old time fantasy adventure due to how the spells are cast and the backgrounds shown. The beastfallen designs make a nice touch though. I'd give a story a 7 since the quality rounds out nicely despite the ups and downs in the story.  The art is kind of like the story. It really makes the show feel like an older style fantasy adventure. The character designs, backgrounds, and other art pieces are not always the greatest out there, but the category as whole is good. A few of the background are done really well, especially some that I noticed in the final episode, while some others are just ok. The clothing is definitely of some typical fantasy designing, but it helps show the character's personalities really well and it is still designed nicely. The animation is pretty fluid too. Overall, a 7/10 in deserved.  The sound is my favorite part of the show. I expect a fantasy to have some really good music and Grimoire of Zero doesn't disappoint much in this department. The opening them is quite good, while sounding silly at the same time; it fits very nicely though with a few of the overall simple themes of the show, and it does have nice visuals. The background music is more fierce during the battle scenes and the more conflict based scenes. Other times, it is just some good music that compliments the mood in a good way. I'll give the category a 7/10.  The characters are kind of a difficult area to talk about. They are not the most special, but they leave an impact. Thirteen is kind of a basic antagonist and trouble is always around him, but he does a good job at being part of each side of the war he basically started, which is not something many antagonists can pull off. Zero is a young magician who might easily be the most powerful magician in the world of the show, seeing as how she made the spell book and that action lead to many people throughout the land learning how to use magic. She doesn't try to control people with force and enormous strength though and she is more kind hearted and it doesn't take a whole lot to please her. She is kind of cunning though and she interacts very well with Mercenary. Mercenary is more a tough and rather stern individual until he grows more acquainted with his master, Zero, and breaks out of his shell. He is different from other beastfallen since he doesn't use his look and or position as a soldier to get what he wants. He has a simple dream of wanting to open his tavern. Albus is an ok character, but she doesn't have as much of an impact as the three I mentioned above, and she just kind of seemed to be present at many times without there being a need for her. I don't think she needed to be incorporated into the main traveling crew as often the way she is, but would fit better if there was more of a use for her early in the story. The other characters are not really main people so I'll leave out. Overall, the characters are rather fun to watch and stand out in their own way, despite not being the best out there, so 7/10 it is.  My enjoyment earns a 7/10. I didn't always like every episode as much as another, but overall, I had a fun time watching the anime and some of the scenes were really good. It has a very satisfying ending too, even though the show has a short run time. There is more to be discovered in the world, but every main conflict brought about is solved before it ends.";Recommended
1;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;Mike98;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mike98;8;"So, the first (wrong) thing this show did was to overestimate the capacity of people to make the difference between Mahō(魔法) - Magic and Majutsu(魔術) - Sorcery. While they are kind of synonyms they have the same difference as normal Alchemy and Alchemy with a Philosopher's Stone. The top review of this series makes this (retarded in my opinion) mistake and makes a lot of comments on the fact that the series is stupid because ""how could witches exist before magic if magic was invented by a witch only recently"" (Jaden Smith anyone? No?). Well, it is stated, SEVERAL TIMES, that they used sorcery, not magic. Damn, the white tiger (I'm bad with names) even says: ""This magic is very convenient because until now you had to draw circles and make sacrifices"". Also,(this is not a spoiler) regarding Zero's ability to negate magic, (now this is a spoiler) SHE GODDAMN SAYS she made mistakes in the Grimoire on purpose in order to be able to be stronger than any other magic user.  Anyway, I felt the need to clear that up. Now the review:  Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho (Grimoire of Zero) is a fantasy anime. It's set in a world where a civil war between witches and normal humans has created countless victims and it's currently destroying the nation. The series is centered on Zero, a young witch that revolutionized witchcraft by giving birth to magic and Mercenary, a beastfallen (humans with the appearance and strength of animals), and it follows their adventures to find (the stolen) Zero's Grimoire that holds the secrets to magic.  The series is sweet, short, and the only complaint I have is that they seemed to go out of their way to produce a loli-ish character (must find a way to appeal to those otakus, amiright?) when the girl needs to be over 15 for the story to make sense. The art isn't amazing but I'm more of a story guy so it didn't impact my enjoyment too much. The sound though, it's lacking. A good soundtrack would've made this anime A LOT better.  All in all, Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is in no way an innovative, never-seen-before anime. The whole fantasy setting has been done so many times it's almost impossible to come up with something new. But who cares? Do you never eat the same food twice? I like binge watching fantasy anime with an accent on magic and I feel like this hit the right spot. It doesn't even need a second season, it's fine as it is! If you like magic and fantasy, this anime is a nice thing to watch.";Recommended
2;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;PyraXadon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PyraXadon;8;"These days, witches are regarded as practitioners of magic and act as the female equivalent of wizards in what would be considered as the pop culture norm for magic. While their original existence no longer has any place in society today, the history of evil witches, people who have made deals with the devil and practice witchcraft still lingers in the ugly recesses of history. With that said, what would happen if you put both of them together? To create a world where in a sense, both the meaning of witches in history and pop culture come together?  Story: The Grimoire of Zero story starts us off in the land of Wenias, a place plagued by those who practice magic known as witches and men who born as animal known as Beastfallen. It is here where we meet a certain beastfallen simply known as ‘Mercenary’ for the entire series (and for the sake of simplification), a self-explanatory character that does the mercenary work of killing witches for hire. On one trip through the woods, he comes in contact with a little witch by the name of ‘Zero’, who tells him that she is on a journey to find what has been stolen, her book of spells, the Grimoire of Zero.  Taking up all twelve episodes of the series to cover just the first book of the original LN series, the adaptation becomes an intriguing story with many facets to its characters, as its main duo of large tiger man and tiny witch protagonists act as a faction-less duo that do practically whatever they want so long as it benefits them and their goals. We’re given a realistic depiction of the reaction to witches in our own history put into a fantasy setting, which to me is a good way to shape up the main conflict. As a result, the show allows the audience to view both sides of the main conflict, testing many of the other characters’ morals and actions while providing a good blend of action and humorous character interactions to aid in filling out holes that the main plot leaves behind.  Adding to that is characterization. Personally I feel as though the show does have some imbalance with how it chose to develop its characters. Due to the nature of the show having two ostracized groups of characters in its society (Beastfallen and Witches), the show primarily focused on the witch characters and the witches’ struggles in society rather than the Beastfallen. Our main protagonist doesn’t really get the time of day aside from a couple choice moments in order to be ‘developed’. Aside from that, the rest of the series is devoted to the problems that the witches in Wenias face and their on-going war for freedom from oppression.  Despite that problem, the show is one of the most well paced series that I’ve seen in a long while. Taking account as many details as they could, White Fox managed to create a series that neither felt boring nor too rushed to watch, letting things continue as they went along at an even pace so that every moment felt engaging. Many times, I felt as though the episodes were too short because I was so engrossed in watching it.  While less eventful than the climax and many other sections of the story, the ending manages to cap off the first main arc of the series that acts both as an ending to the entire series while being open-ended enough to welcome a second season if White Fox so chooses to do so. Not really a big fan of how many things were thrown into exposition, but I guess to develop the whole scope of the story’s events, they had to make a couple things via time skip to make things a lot easier.  Overall, despite its imbalance with who and what it chooses to characterize, Grimoire of Zero was a show that was gripping from start to finish. Having a simple plot that was explored to almost its full extent, the show managed to be both engaging and entertaining to the end while providing good world building that mixed in the central conflict of the series. Every episode felt too short for me to fully appreciate, and it left me wanting more. My only complaint really is that there is no second season. Please White Fox. Do it.  Overview: + Well-paced story + Simple, yet effective plot - Who they characterized was imbalance - Ending is a bit…uneventful comparatively  Characters: As mentioned before, the show’s plethora of characters act as members of one side or one motive while our main characters act as a ‘third’ or ‘faction-less’ group that gets involved with their own sets of goals in mind.  The first is Mercenary; the giant fluffy tiger man that despite having a giant FFVII-esque sword, is actually quite soft and fluffy on the inside with a pension for cooking. Being a Beastfallen, Mercenary is a character that despises witches and dreams of one day curing him of his beast curse and opening up a pub once he’s human. As a character, Mercenary is very much a character that sits in his own morals but doesn’t act outside of what he isn’t involved in. As such, he’s less of a by the numbers fantasy protagonist, and more of a ‘does whatever he wants’ kind of guy, which fits into the story perfectly. He acts as the more grounded character of the duo and gets some significant change once the series starts picking up and his more ‘lone wolf’ demeanor softens up.  Then there’s Zero, the tiny white-haired witch who enjoys the simple things in life: food. Comparatively, Zero is the freer, more airheaded member of the main duo, as she had spent her life in a cave up until her book was stolen, and lacks any kind of basic knowledge of the outside world. Rather than being a ditzy klutz (mostly), Zero is a calm airhead simply because she doesn’t know anything aside from the intricacies of magic, leading to a majority of the show’s comedic and enjoyable moments due to her hilariously blunt nature and lack of what would widely be considered as ‘common sense’. As such, she has something of a unique identity that when mixed with her mercenary, creates fun character interactions between two quite likeable characters.  For the supporting cast, we’re treated to a myriad of characters who act as players to the bigger stage of the kingdom of Wenias, as most if not all of them have some kind of affiliation to one faction or another in the war for magic. As such, characters like Albus and the Sorcerers of Zero are clearly defined to think one way while the royal kingdom and its citizens think the other in order to give clear definition on their opinion of the matter and thus easily explain the overall conflict of the scenario. While less interesting than our main protagonists, the majority of them play their part as the background scenario well, which is the most you could ask for in a series featuring two clearly defined sides. The only one of the supporting cast that differs from this rule is ‘Thirteen’; a character similar to our main protagonists as he only does what he believes is right/based in his own goals and a compatriot of Zero.  Overview: + Very intriguing main protagonists + Fitting and clearly defined side cast  Art: Produced by White Fox, Grimoire of Zero has the clear fantasy look that the studio has used for previous projects in the past (such as Re:Zero, for example) More or less standard fare in terms of the quality of this day and age, the animation and art quality for the show is good, but not overly amazing or budget breaking.  I do however want to bring attention to the various forms of magic used in the show, as the intricate circles and various effects of the spells enhance the art quality to truly feel like a fantasy/magic show. Additionally, and this is more personal than anything, the character design for Zero is amazing. It’s the right amount of complexity and really fits with the overall aesthetic of the show.  Overview: + Nice touch on the magic usage +/- Standard art  Sound: “Hakkensha wa Watashi”, the OP for Grimoire of Zero is a whimsical rock song that helps provide an adventurous tone to the travels of our main characters and contrasts the more serious tone of the magic war in the series. Personally, I feel like the song itself isn’t all that memorable, but it is a good track that’s been on a few of my own song loops.  To contrast, the ED, ""Hajimari no Shirushi” is a laid back piece that relies more on strings and light piano to elevate a sense of wonder in our characters’ journey. Accompanied by a children’s book graphic, the ED feels a lot better than its OP counterpart, as it has a nice style to it that gives us a nice contrast everything that the show has given us up until this point.  Overview: + Good tracks + Memorable ED  Personal Enjoyment: At the start of the season, I always handpick about a dozen shows to watch/review for the season. Some are ‘obligatory’ as I watched and reviewed a previous season of it so it’s only natural that I do the same for subsequent seasons, and others are those that I personally find intriguing. As a fan of fantasy, I found Grimoire of Zero to be interesting at first glance. Before I knew it, it had become my most anticipated show of the season. The overall plot had more to offer than just a simple magic-based story and had a lot of aspects that meshed well with each other to culminate into what we have. I was so sucked into it that I was left wanting more, and I really, really want a second season of this because I really want to see more of Mercenary and Zero’s travels throughout the world plagued by magic.  Did I enjoy this series?  I think I may have enjoyed it a bit too much, but you can’t really blame a guy for having a preference, right? Personally I found Zero to be the highlight of the series. Her character was always such a joy to have on-screen, and I always appreciate a unique character to help tell the story.  What didn’t I like about his series?  Albus was really the big stickler for me. They admittedly do play a big part in the series, but I just kinda found them annoying with their constant, constant preaching for their look on everything while I just sat there wanting to see something else involving Zero.  Would I recommend this series?  If you’re a fan of fantasy of magic, I would highly recommend watching this. It has a unique enough identity large enough to completely separate itself from a majority of the cookie-cutter magic-based shows, showing that original ideas really can be successful. The main characters are interesting, the entire plot is fleshed out, and it has such nice pacing that it feels almost like magic that this kind of even pacing can even exist in this era of rushed adaptations.";Recommended

6;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;FerretWithATea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FerretWithATea;8;"To start off i enjoyed my time with Grimoire of Zero, while it is not an anime of the year let alone season it is a good use of time to watch.  Story:The story was fine, it starts with our protagonist the catlike ""Mercenary"" fighting a witch and stumbling upon another witch(Zero).  He joins with the lather witch do to necessity; and forms a contracts by blood. And the former(Albus) because of his contract with the Zero.  Like many high fantasy style animes/stories the plot follows resolve around the fate of the world. In this case the story follows the conflict between those who have magic and those who do not.  Story:The art is reminiscent of older works in the medium. Which while normally jarring fits with the simplistic plot commonly found in shows of the past.  Sound: The sound was neither terribly good nor bad, The sfx fit the actions of the characters but the sound track did little to affect the mood of the scenes. To subdivide my sound score of 7 i would give it an 8 for sfx and a 6 for the sound track.  Character: The three and later four protagonists of the series all have interesting stories as well as unique but relatable characteristics. The jive together well but the underlying relationship between the two primary protagonists can be heavy handed at times. The main issue i have with the characters of the series is the villain the the end of the conflict with him. It feels out of the blue and unsatisfactory.  Enjoyment: The series regardless of its faults and short comings is enjoyable. It is fun to watch and each episode leaves you wanting to continue on.  Overall: Grimoire of Zero is a great anime to watch, especially between seasons or while waiting for your primary show to release a new episode. It is a great watch if you are not looking for an avante garde piece of a detailed convoluted plot. if you enjoy a simple show with relatable characters, and a simplistic but good story and art then your time is well worth investing in this show.";Recommended

To be honest if 13 stayed a villain until the very end I would have like things better. Characters were very big for me. I think the reason I was enjoying this anime so much was because of its characters. Zero personality was just something I want one female character in every anime to have. Mercenary was also someone I enjoyed with his tsun attitude. Overall I kind just love the anime but I won't say it was the best.;Recommended
8;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;D27;https://myanimelist.net/profile/D27;7;Spoiler free!! This anime is kind of well what should i say (kind a cute!!) has lots of kawii!! moments ...well has a decent plot so...if your looking for a fantasy anime it fits the bill...and might get a bit plain in the middle and in the end so dont expect too much from it the chemistry between MC(the tiger ) and zero is nice some thing very similar to beauty and the beast .....but with different bonds. So if your having a hard time finding a decent anime you should watch it...dont expect to much...has fine not too good action ...and sometimes things go way to positive..;Recommended
9;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;reon58;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reon58;7;Hey. I'd like to leave a review here. My ranking system is explained on my profile.  Story - 7/10  The story was a typical conflict between different groups. The story had nothing very special to it. The main twist was decent but was predictable due to certain shots from earlier in the anime. The story was slightly better than most anime with the premise due to the involvement of Beastfallen, a certain race which is treated as inferior to humans (Revealing more about them would spoil the plot.). There was decent character development.  Originality - 5/10  Not Original. Plus points for the Beastfallen though  Animation Quality - 7/10  It had a decent animation quality. Nothing too special.  Sound effects/Music - 6/10  Same for the sound. Standard  Profound message - 6/10  There was a standard moral of equality, justice and so on. I went in expecting for at least a bit more.  Overall Enjoyment - 8/10  Did I enjoy the anime? Yes. Even after all the shortcomings, this anime is still quite enjoyable. From technical aspects, it's just a standard anime but, watching the anime still fills you with happiness. :)  Final score - 7/10;Recommended
10;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;scottishrob13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/scottishrob13;7;I really wanted to give this show a better review because I was loving it...for the first 3/4. I think it suffers from the same things a lot of the 12 episode series out there do. Basically, the world was fairly well developed, the characters seemed interesting and had room to fill out their history. The plot was intriguing, with mysteries to solve. Then you get to the last couple episodes, and the whole thing kind of vomits up all of the answers and exposition you never wanted, combined with a rushed ending that magically ties up all of the loose ends but really leaves a lot of holes in logic. It even feels like the writing takes a hit in those last couple episodes, like they either didn't have time to polish the script, or they were too rushed to cram in exposition and it hurt the dialogue. Ah well, it's still an enjoyable watch, it's just too bad it didn't have more time to flesh out the story and let it wrap up at a natural pace.;Recommended
11;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;RnckO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RnckO;7;"I think many reviews didn't do justice to this piece of work. Hence I created an account to write for this review.  My first thought after I finished the show was : It makes me remember Spice and Wolf.  -------------  There is a reason why this show has a rating 7.2 or above 7 while the reviews has mixed feelings about it.  1) The plot and characters are standard and nothing special. (Rating : 7 standard) ----- True , but it doesn't mean is has no depth. The whole story has a simple and VERY BASIC background settings..... but the depth is there hence you don't see shitty rating of 6.9 and below.  *** Trust me , you will find similarities between this show and other big names simply because it has good basics. Just like how all good romance genres has certain similarities with each other.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  2) Depth (Rating : 8 Good) ----- This is NOT a show that tells you ""For some and no reason people can use magic and conflict arises from it and blah blah blah"".  It(magic) has a profound reason behind it to exist and took years of effort and studies to took hold yet despite what it seems , conflict still arise regardless.  Throughout the series , the settings explanation is done in a well eloquent manners and THE BEST OF ALL : It tells the tale in a very very heartwarming tone like a mother's love.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  3) Plot Progression (Rating : 8 Good) ----- At every turning point , the decision making is being made clear. There is no ambiguous decisions that was made half-hearted , every turning point has a good reason.  ** Well , except the way some or if not most characters' introduction scene that is.... but otherwise the story flows well.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  4) Character (Rating : 7 Standard) ----- There is no stupid and spoiled brats throughout. Although some characters changing heart might have been paced too fast , but it can't be helped.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  5) Art and sound (Rating : 7.5 Standard+) ----- Personally I have nothing to complain over it. Medieval time Bgm setting is usually soothing to my ear in a natural way without flashy sound effects, like birds chirping in a garden just the way it is.  As for why I gave it extra 0.5 instead of 7........ because the heartwarming scenes are nicely done even though its nothing flashy/extravagant...... its just.... warm....  -------------------- Overall : 7.5 ( Good+ ) Its a well done show , it wraps up nicely without any huge plot hole.  By well done , I mean it has the very basic and standard aspect of Magical Fantasy genre just the same as any other higher rating Magical Fantasy anime like Shakugan no Shana or The Irregular at Magic High School.  All 3 of them shares similar characteristic of giving its magical power a good background explanation and progresses without over relying on overpowered strength alone.  Except it is presented it in a simple yet profound setting.  A standard heartwarming masterpiece for casual viewing indeed.";Recommended
12;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;Lozarak;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lozarak;8;the Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is quite interestin for me, at first i thougt it your tipical anime fantasy were the protagonist find someone and that one is the chosen one to save the world or kingdom from the force of evil, that was i thougt at first but then i see the story of the series and it pretty interesting. it feel like i watchin a origin story or a sidequest story because it doesnt feel like a big quest to save the world type like i usually see in anime but it doesn't bug me at all. it ok and it a original story instead of something generic. overall, i want a second season of this anime and it was a original idea. see you on a another reiew.;Recommended
13;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;asimwolverine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/asimwolverine;7;The story was great and had the potential to be a really good anime but it lacked the punch and the thrill of adventure and the suspense and mystery of the man behind the walls. I would have loved to see a little more adventure along the way and it would have been great if the mystery remained a secret till the end. Art was good and the characters were good too but in the end, it left me feeling dissatisfied. But it was quite enjoyable. So I will suggest you give this series a watch and see it for yourself. Loved the character of Zero.;Recommended
14;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;Traxdize;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Traxdize;8;The story was very decent I might say. There was some plot twist there and there, but it was mostly predictable anyway. I have nothing much to say about the story. The animation was done by White Fox, Re: Zero's studio so I expected it to be good. I was a fan of the art style. The heroine, Zero's art was done by Shimakaze's (Kancolle) artist and I'm a big fan of Shimakaze. So naturally I liked the design. I'm not a furry, but Mercenary was well designed. I love the opening. Period. The voice actors did a great job. Although most of the characters were well-written. Their interactions were mostly cliches. But I gotta say that I love any interactions between Mercenary and Zero. I really enjoyed this series. The Loli and the Beast was a decent series.;Recommended
15;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;Luis-Adolfo-Wolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Luis-Adolfo-Wolf;9;This is just based on my likes, and since I've not watched many other fantasy anime shows, that'll influct in this review.  (Also, I'm not and expert on English-language, sorry).  In the therms of story, this is not such unique, since souds like a story that any fantasy-themed story would have, but that doesn't have to be bad, actually I liked it, since it makes this show feels like some kind of Midaged Novel, the story about witches against humans, with beastfallens added is something that anyone who wrote a midaged fantasy would make, but that doesn't make the story bad.  The artstyle is something I really enjoyed, character desings and the scenarios are very well done for my taste, maybe some anime I've never watched has better art, but I really like this artstyle, specially the main cast desings, which are very pretty, and I feel they feet very well with them.  Music is good, and kinda reminds me an RPG game, maybe not Final Fantasy, but Fire Emblem or Dragon Quest (haven't played so much games of thouse franchies anyway), but it fits the stage.  Characters are very likeable, specially the main characters, Zero and Youhei make a very funny and cute pair (have to admit I ship them, they'd make a very strange-yet-cutie couple), but have to say that character development on some of the main cast as Holdem and 13 is rushed, in that way, the anime should've had more chapters to develop them (and I feel should be overall longer).  Enjoyment is very well done, since when we see jokes, they're very funny and well done, a very good example are the first three chapters, that play with the Zero's rough and a little bit prissy personality, as well as her ignorance of the world's common rules, also taking Youhei in a very fun way (if you haven't noticed it, I really like them as characters, they're amazing), also, fights are overall well done, and the series doesn't fear to show blood, not a gore-level, but it's the fair amount of it.  Overall, I enjoyed this series at all, but mostly because I like mideged fantasies and kemono-like characters, also, Zero and Youhei's relationship is one of the most spectal-keeping part of the show, I recomend, but know that many people will feel this as a generic fantasy anime, which I don't care, I just enjoyed it and that's all.;Recommended
16;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;AnthraxHierarchy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnthraxHierarchy;7;Alright, so this is fresh just finished the last episode. With the way it ended, I won't be surprised if there's more, although I don't know how long the manga is either so I could be wrong, but even then I wouldn't be surprised if the manga has more coming. Anyway, this anime had a pretty good story, I did feel due to the shortness it was a little underwhelming, but I'm counting on another season coming. This anime was pretty funny throughout and had some good references in it. The story overall was a little bit confusing, but that's alright anime does that sometimes and it doesn't always make it bad where you have to watch it again to fully grasp everything, other parts were kinda cute too. The one negative thing I'd say about this anime is there simply wasn't much action in it, I was hoping this would be a more action filled adult anime. Surprisingly the dialogue was somewhat mature, but there was pretty much no blood, conflicts were minimal. A bit too much story centric for my liking. I was kind of tempted to give it a 6, but I'm conflicted. I'd probably give this anime a 6.5 in total. That said keep an eye out for the possibility for a season 2.;Recommended
17;Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho;Pairedecar09;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pairedecar09;8;Grimoire Of Zero is a an pretty interesting anime to watch.  Story 8: The story is pretty good, though it's does leave out some of the important details that are explained in the light novels.  The animation is produced by White Fox, for which I am a fan of because they do very good animation on shows like Re Zero Starting Life In Another World & Steins Gate.  The Soundtrack is pretty good but the opening soundtrack was different than I was expecting. That's not to say the opening is bad but I feel that a heroic fantasy theme would have suited the opening a lot better, though ending song is really nice.  One of my favourite character design are Mercenary & Zero. Though some some characters had bland design like Holdem. In the earliest trailer back in late 2016, his outfit was originally green but got changed to red so I think green would have suited him better because it goes well with his nobility background.  I like how the characters interact with each other & what they learn from each other.  I recommend this anime to those who likes to watch an anime that has a nice fantasy & with a more mature background & characters like Mercenary that are bit realistic instead being all fan service. Also you can read the light novels on zeromahouthetranslation website. Although not all of the light novels has been translated on that site but it is a good site to read & hopefully in the future it will get an official release & a 2nd season.;Recommended

I shall answer your question.”""This anime should have ended last... week. How come we're still... here?Will I finally become Natural Perm-sensei of Year 3's BL... class?""“Just give up on that, Asakura. Because there's still something we have to do.”“I… see.”The first work of the creator of the masterpiece Shinobi no Otsutome, is incredible. But the special episode released a week after the original series ended delves far deeper into existentialism and the cruelty of the circle of life than the original post-modern social commentary ever did. It is a beautiful thing to behold.With only two characters present, the titular Ishida and Asakura, Masao (the creator) can deliver a highly complex psycho-analysis of these five-dimensional characters. Ishida's tragic past, coupled with his incredible love and reliance on Asakura, makes for an amazing character, no, PERSON, that transcends the medium and becomes a real, human being. Asakura's denial of Ishida's wish to open a flower shop, that we saw in the earlier episodes, have deeply scarred Ishida and makes him question if Asakura does truly love him.I dare not say more to spoil anything of the beautiful interaction they have.The animation quality, while not of the same standard as the story and characters, is still better than anything we've ever gotten. Easily surpassing Ufotable's and Production I.G.'s best works. It is highly original and combines abstract shapes with realistic proportions, which makes for a highly enjoyable experience and a feast for the eyes.The soundtrack and voice acting is godly, with Rayli's Doki Doki Doku being the best song i've ever heard in two decades. The voice acting for the main characters is incredible, every sentence Asakura or Ishida uttered made me either want to cry or laugh, with the incredible range of emotions in their voices deserving of Nobel peace prices.My personal enjoyment of this episode was through the roof, and I demand that every single person on this planet (and the aliens too) shall watch it.You will be mesmerized, one second crying, another laughing, and another speechless. A true masterpiece deserving of every award on Earth.";Recommended
0;Ishida to Asakura Special;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;1;"There really isn't much to this special at all. In fact, it's really just the same exact copy & paste intro that each episode on the main series had, just with some different dialogue. The thing is, there's no episode after the intro, it just ends and says ""thanks for watching""I guess this is fine, but taken at face value, this special is not very special at all, it's really just a little bonus tacked on to a somewhat sub-par show. It's probably the weakest part of the whole series, to be honest.";Not Recommended
0;One Piece: Dai Tettei Kaibou!

Toei struck gold with this recap.This episode focuses solely on the Roof Piece nation, all fights no slow-paced reaction shots. It felt like a 24-minute-long Sakuga video honestly. Anyone can watch this and feast their eyes, bring themselves up to speed with what One Piece got going at the moment, even for Manga readers, it must be nice to get a bite-sized adaptation of all of those great moments.I would even say, if you're not a One Piece fan but are interested in getting into the series, you can safely taste the water with this episode action wise. Nobody can hate that.;Recommended

You just have to get used to it by now.Story:- Typical H-anime story. Nothing fancy about. Since when did we get awesome h-anime stories? Maybe early 2000s.Art:- Nothing to complain about. As usual Antechinus did a fascinating job. Even if you hate the story (especially ntr) animation will get you excited either way. So 0 complain there.Sound:- Sound is great! Antechinus H-anime's sound quality is amazing as ever. Not out of the world or anything. But definitely satisfying. Especially if you use Headphones.Character:- So this is the complain part for me. Antechinus always makes hot/s*xy character for their h-anime. But this time around both girls look same just hair design and color changes. Same body type, same facial expressions, same looking. Heck if they told us they are both sisters that would've been better. At least they could get away with this by saying they are sisters. Anyway I'm very disappointed this part. Especially for a h-anime A female character is everything.Enjoyment:- Not enough position this time. Especially 2nd episode. Same old position for 7-8 min straight. With cond*m, with bareback same position. That ruined our f*p enjoyment.Overall:- 7/10 for me.Tldr; please do note that I do not like ntr nor I hate it. I just watch h-anime for s*x scene. Don't really care for story that much. If I then I would rather watch Rom-com anime.Thank you!";Recommended

I was up very late when this came out, and when it did it- it was out for an hour already. I listened to this when I was like tired, about to fall asleep, and man, I could not go to sleep for about the next 30 minutes. Like, I was just thinking about the song the entire time. It's unbelievable, man. I did not think that a cute shark girl can make a song like this, like man. I was so surprised with the theme that she chose, and, somehow, she made it work very well. I was absolutely blown away.Through out the first time I was listening to this song, I was just in a trance pretty much. I was completely hooked. I was jamming out even though it was like super late. I wasn't really like head bopping or anything but I was like ""wow, this is really good"", and, I also really liked the assortment of languages she uses. Like, I think she even uses Greek at the beginning and the end which is really cool and somehow it fits. And also the Japanese and English it mixes so well in the song. There is also a couple different styles throughout it so it's not the same thing over and over again. It's just really good.I never thought that a VTuber could release a song that is this much of a jam, like, I- I listen to anime openings quite a bit and I- I think this is a lot better than many anime openings that I have listened to, like, just instantly became better than some of my favorite anime openings, which.. absolutely insane to me. This is a masterpiece right here. I- I’m about to show you guys this song. I’ve already listened to this like, so many times since it’s dropped, but, let’s just give it a listen right now, cause man, this song is so good. I’ll go through my thoughts..

It was a really beautiful song, correct me if I'm wrong, but I felt it was more of a introspective song than a judgement one. Gawr Gura, when I searched it up on YouTube, I didn't expect this to be such a big deal. As far my as N2 Japanese goes, most of the lines were top notch, the English part in between was really giving the dark/death vibe. I've never been attracted to squeaky and high pitched voices, but this singer/artist was really brilliant, brought out the entire feeling she had building up right in front of our eyes. I think I'll take out my old Miku DIVA and my old PSP from my attic and give a shot, cause REFLECT song reminded me of Hatsune Miku's voice and I'd love to give it another try.;Recommended
0;Reflect;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;6;The song itself is great, no doubt about it. However, there are two parts to music video – the music… and the video.Unfortunately, the video is not that great in this case. It consists mostly of 3D rendered background, or still images with added effects. The animation level is just above of picture drama. I also feel like the video sometimes doesn’t fit the audio that well, like in the faster parts of the song, the pictures are still going at pretty much the same pace.The lyrics are fine. Not on the level of Mori’s songs, but not meaningless either. The inclusion of Greek portion also gives it a nice flavour.So, as a good song paired with average video, I can’t really give this more than score of “fine”. The song really is catchy though.;Mixed Feelings

0;Elf no Wakaokusama;NoSurrender;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NoSurrender;7;For an anime that was made over 10 years ago, the story line is actually pretty damn good, I've seen this hentai a while ago, but I actually liked it. This is the kinda kiddy-grade anime a perverted 12 year old boy would enjoy, though Im not in that age range, my maturity level is ^_^;Recommended
1;Elf no Wakaokusama;Lil-Bird;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lil-Bird;7;Let's make this clear: I'm not a prude, but I refuse to throw around sexuality for the sake of titillation. Hentai is really not something I like to dabble in, and thus is only one or two drops in the bucket of anime I have seen. I get it that “porn without plot” is a thing, and that's fine with most people, but I'm one of those who would prefer it if there was a story that happens to have sex woven into it—and even then, there's no guarantee I'd like it anyway (I'm just that hard of a woman to please). Far as I know, not too many hentai do this, and especially when it comes to the main love interests being a married couple.Found one. (Thanks, TV Tropes!)STORY: Elven Bride's story is as simple as it gets: a human named Kenji marries an elf named Milfa, a decision that alienates them because of racial discrimination against elves (although it seems mixed marriages are frowned down upon in this world anyway despite it being a thing). After marrying in an empty chapel, the newlyweds have their first night together, only to learn they can't consummate because's Milfa's vagina is small, and any attempt at penetration causes excruciating pain. They promise they'll find a way while still living a normal, married life, or as normal as it can get with all the discrimination and close to no sex life.Even though there's only two episodes, it's clear there's an entire open world to explore. In one episode, we see harpies—actually, harpians—and townsfolk sneering at Milfa including three young boys who do warm up to her by the end. Then in the other, more characters come in that bring about entire questions as to how the world works and what kind of races there are, and even the kinds of magic used. Episode two is what gives us two racially-mixed women who take to Milfa quickly and set them up as possible friends for her. There's even a woman named Mitsuko who seems to have a history with Kenji (he calls her “Baa-chan”, even though she berates him for it), but we don't even get an exposition backstory about why they know each other.But what would definitely be more interesting, and it's something the OVA does touch on quite a bit, is the social issue with mixed marriages/relationships, although we only ever saw Milfa being discriminated. No one (outside of the preacher, I suppose) approved of the marriage between Kenji and Milfa, her parents didn't even show up. My question is: “Why are elves looked down on by humans?” This was never answered, and though we got a plausible answer by the end for why it is the parents were probably so adamant about their marriage (even though them being a mixed-race couple is most likely a big part of it), this leaves behind some gaping holes that definitely could've been filled with something, anything. It's possible if there were more episodes, this could've been answered, but as it is, we can just assume it's similar to our own racial issues.But I suppose for the most part, the heart of the OVA's story is the relationship between the newlyweds and their hardship.CHARACTERS: Our two leads, Kenji and Milfa, are pretty adorable together. While we jump right into them getting married, we have a sense that they truly love each other, and their love scenes are romantic, it's just that reality ensues, and they are saddened to learn they can't consummate. But even then, they are quick to come up with solutions to give them hope to live a normal life, and it strengthens their love. They do steadily come to accept it may always be impossible, but they make do with what they can.This really appeals to me as a hopeless romantic, for some odd reason. I won't lie that I feel a sense of... satisfaction, or at least happiness when a couple I root for get together and even consummate their love for one another. Yet it's not often I run into a story where a couple has problems in bed (and pretty much from the get-go), yet don't let it get them down as they know they'll find a solution, even if it'll take them a long time. In these two episodes, we don't get that solution, kind of, but I'm totally okay with it because Kenji and Milfa love each other regardless.If there was one thing that bothered me a little bit, it was in the first episode when Kenji was out looking for what's called “harpy ooze”, which is supposed to be like the ultimate lubrication. Well he finds it, but he had to be carried away by a harpian first because the harpian as it turns out need human males to produce more harpians, otherwise they just get harpies. (It's weird, and it's things like this that make me wish we got more information on the world because it's kind of weirdly fascinating.) The harpian who carried him away also happens to be a princess, and she seduces him, yet Kenji doesn't even try to get away, let alone tell her he's already married. Of course, he does end up getting the harpy ooze to take home, but he had to bring her to orgasm first—after he stopped himself from climaxing since he wanted to climax with only his wife.But clearly someone didn't realize that pre-ejaculatory fluid still has the potential to carry live sperm cells, soooooo... yes, a drop of seminal fluid can still get a girl pregnant. Guess the stars were lined up just right (or wrong... depends, I suppose) for Kenji that day. It's played for laughs, anyway, so I suppose I can let it pass.Episode two introduced us to Mitsuko, who feeds on life energy to take on a more youthful appearance (so she's probably a vampire?), Ion, a mix between human and jinro (so a werewolf, then?), and a half-hobbit named Noitie. There's not much to them, unfortunately, but it's possible that if there were more episodes, they'd be Milfa's friends. For what it's worth, though, I did like what I saw of them, so that's why I'm a little sad we didn't get more.We also got pretty much a “villain” in episode two named Perio, with whom Kenji has a history with, but it was just a quick set-up to give him the role of a womanizer before we see him having his way with one of his patients. Oh, he's a gynecologist, and he had opened up his own clinic just so he could have sex with frustrated housewives whom he seduces with magic, probably so they don't notice (or even care?) that his penis looks like a lamprey, which I think drains energy or something while still having penile functions. Unless it was nothing more than a visual metaphor, I don't know, and I don't want to think about it anymore.ART/ANIMATION: It's from the mid-90s, so it has that typical 90s feel to it, but the art-style threw me for a loop at first. Body proportions looked off to me to the point I thought it was going to look very rough and even difficult to watch, but it quickly grew on me. To explain, everyone appears to have some baby fat to them, at least in their faces, it's a little weird, actually. With Milfa, I can at least understand why, but Kenji was almost silly-looking with his head being overtaken by his wide torso. Then I realized he was pretty much a hero/explorer in this world (well, his job is he's a captain of the National Guard, anyway), and almost immediately, I was okay with it.The animation's not that bad, either, it flows nicely, and the sex scenes are rather smooth for what it is without showing penetration and even genitalia (outside of the aforementioned lamprey-penis-thing). The colors are rather muted at times, though, but I guess that's just a result of it being twenty-year-old cel-animation.SOUND: This is more-or-less an afterthought, if you ask me. The voice-acting was fine, nothing to really complain about here (it's just that only Milfa appears to have a listed voice actor, everyone else apparently went uncredited, although Perio sounds familiar and I think Noitie is played by Mika Kanai), but the soundtrack is hard to talk about. This is because I don't know how much of it was original and the rest being stock music/sound-effects that were distracting. The music is pretty forgettable anyway, so I can't tell you if it fit or not, I just remember hearing fanfare sound-effects I swear I've heard from old games I used to play on the PC.ENJOYMENT: I'm legitimately disappointed only two episodes were made, there was so much more to it that I could see, but will never get to learn. I know, it's silly to think about these things when it comes to something like hentai, but that was how the OVA presented itself. I actually can see this getting edited/toned down more to be more of an ecchi title, but with exception for maybe one or two scenes, the sex played a rather important role with the characters. Even if it was just edited to be heavily implied, we probably would've lost a little bit more to their characters.Also, how often is it that we get to have a married couple in the lead role being adorable together while also remaining faithful (for the most part) to each other? And in a hentai, no less (but this is most likely just me not having seen enough to know for sure)? The only other title I can think of is Futari Ecchi, although I preferred Elven Bride over FE's OVAs, personally. It'll probably also be the only one I'll openly admit to seeing outside of this website alongside Kite and Mezzo Forte, because at least I got that warm and fuzzy feeling watching it, which isn't something I've gotten from any of the hentai titles I've seen, and probably never will.But that's just the hopeless romantic in me, I suppose.;Recommended
0;Honoo no Alpenrose: Judy & Randy;Balsamina;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Balsamina;7;"Why am I reviewing this...?Okay well, there is only 1 other review as of the time I'm writing this and I do feel strongly about this show even though the rating itself is rather mixed.So the shallow stuff out of the way: this show was made in 1985. Let me repeat: NINETEEN EIGHTY-FIVE. Graphically, comparing this show to anything contemporary to the time of writing this review would be unfair, ye? So I'm going to compare it with other shows from around this time: Macross, Gundam, etc. Graphically, this show is ok. It's in fact got its own charm for what it is and actually a little reminiscent of disney cartoons. Yes, graphically, this show will remind you of disney... A LOT.A stern warning on the graphics: This show takes place on the start of World War 2. If you are sensitive to controversial symbolism, the symbols used by a good deal of the villains might put you off. I will note that the whole goal of pretty much all of the protagonists is to resist them though.Sound wise, this aspect does not stand out either. It's rather forgettable unless you like the style of music offered here (classical, the more bland kind, not the kind with dramatized flairs). Alpenrose is pretty much the only track that is worth noting but keep in mind how many times this tune plays throughout the show. It's not likely you will sing it or want to listen to it after the show's over though.Now the plot and characters...I'm going to start by noting that there is something charming about the main couple. Jeudi and Lundi (or Judy and Randi, depending on who's subbing it) are cute together. This is also all there is to them. This show has a lot of tropes precisely because it is old. The characters do not really grow either, they basically get chased their whole screentime.However, as simple/cliche as they are, they DO have their charm. This is further enhanced by the side characters, some of whom evolve their morals, others realize their feelings. Some never really grow but there are enough that do that all the story arcs have some sort of charm to them to keep you watching.The main issue in the story is that, the main couple being chased/hunted by various villains is also more or less all there is to the story. The staff totally did try to spice this up and add more depth and complexity; this is obvious given how the show could have ended on episode 11 or 12 but dragged on all the way to 20. However, given the chase-run nature of the premise, the story is basically stuck having to tell everything in separate arcs, some of which do not really have enough depth on their own to be interesting.That said, the show did more or less wrap up all its loose ends and if you can overlook the potentially offensive symbolism from the villains, this show has the charm of your typical disney princess movie.";Mixed Feelings
0;Honoo no Alpenrose: Judy & Randy;Welkin96;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Welkin96;4;Honoo no Alpenrose is a fairly predictable and by the numbers World Masterpiece Theater clone but that's not necessarily a bad thing since those shows were always pure , Had likeable characters and good moral lessons and this show is no different . I found myself invested in the first half of the story as the struggles the main couple faces and their search for answers amidst the WW2 setting were really interesting . Unfortunately the quality of this anime takes a massive nosedive after Judy resolves the situation at her homeBefore that the only downside to me was the amount of times they managed to escape from the comically over the top and almost Looney Tunes at times Nazi army because it clashed hard with how they portrayed them outside of those occasions . There's also 2-3 episodes that felt like nothing but filler but I would be able to overlook both problems if the final stretch didn't suck so badlyBeyond the show ending abruptly and never giving a proper send off to many of it's side characters , From out of nowhere a previous rather uninspired villain returns for no reason with a completely new motivation for his actions thus making the earlier conclusion in a previous episode feel utterly meaningless . Worst of all he gets a good ending despite never truly having a change of heart and only stopping because his plans were foiledThe first half and a bit more is worth it but the rest is just really bad with very few highlights like Tarantula for example .

0;Cheburashka Arere?;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;6;"Overview:It is time for another round of ""Is this really an anime?!"" The show where I review the most questionable entries on MAL's anime list and also try to determine whether or not they should count as anime. Last time we looked at the Transformers Movie from 1986. Today we will be looking at Cheburashka: the anime!Background:Cheburashka is a popular Russian cartoon character created during the 1960s in the Soviet Union. However, Cheburashka never gained the same international popularity outside the Soviet Bloc countries that the 1960s American cartoons did. Like with automobiles, the Soviets decided to protect domestic products by banning all foreign competition, in this case any cartoons from the West. Which is why Cheburashka is referred to by every Polish person I've ever met as ""that fucking stop-motion rat that the Russians forced us to watch!"" Despite the fact that Cheburashka is unknown in most countries and absolutely despised in countries like Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic etc, Cheburashka remains extremely popular in Russia, Belarus, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Cuba, Armenia, ...and Japan for some reason! For reasons that NO ONE knows, Japan is the only country that isn't a steadfast ally of Russia, yet absolutely loves Cheburashka. As a result, it was only a matter of time until Cheburashka got his own anime. This anime was written, directed, and produced in Russia, but used Japanese animation, voice acting, and music composition. By contrast, the Transformers movie from 1986 only used a Japanese animation studio and EVERYTHING else was American. It is questionable whether or not this is an anime, but it is fair to say it is MUCH closer than the Transformers movie.Plot:Cheburashka is a monkey like creature with giant ears that lived on a tropical island before accidentally falling asleep in a cargo box full of oranges and being shipped to Moscow. Once in the big city, Chiburashka has episodic, 3 minute per episode adventures with his friends. His most commonly recurring friend is the talking crocodile named Gena, who wears a bowler hat, plays the accordion, and often bemoans the fact that one's birthday only comes once a year. Each episode is an independent event and no effort is put into really developing the characters or creating an overarching plot. However, it IS very adorable and was aimed at very small children, so it seems a bit silly to be THAT harsh on it for being what it is.Art:The art is actually really well done in how it captures the look and feel of the original, even though the original was stop motion animation. This actually still looks and feels like a real Cheburashka cartoon, for which the animation studio deserves some serious credit.Sound:The Japanese voice acting is of course very cutesy and the soundtrack is what you would expect in a show for small children. It isn't exceptionally good, but isn't grating either.Overall:Sometimes ratings have to be relative and take into account the target demographic and primary objective of the series. This was a short sketch cartoon aimed at small children to get a few laughs and be cute and innocent. Did it accomplish exactly what it wanted to? Yes it did. Would I say this was one of the greatest children's shows I have ever seen? No, but it certainly wasn't bad. I actually gave it an extra point for not doing anything to piss me off, which children's movies and shows tend to do...a lot. Ultimately, I give this series a well earned 6/10.";Mixed Feelings

Also the fact this movie is basically the perfect conclusion to Lucifer's side of the overall story.Also, if you're reading this and wondering: ""should I watch this?"", yes, absolutely do so.

0;Monster Strike the Movie: Lucifer - Zetsubou no Yoake;elinwarrior;https://myanimelist.net/profile/elinwarrior;4;Where to start, the movie had good art, animation and was visually great with a decent soundtrack. However, thats where the positives end. The story had a strong believe in your friends type message, but the way the movie was ended felt sour considering the power of a certain magical item. The title and series lists Lucifer as the main in this movie but she gets very little screen time, instead we see oragon screaming at everyone and, unsurprisingly everyone ignoring oragon. There are some major plot holes but by the end it feels like they were just swept under the rug and the overall felt a bit lazy. The pacing was alright, the action scenes were good, but in between it felt very slow. Other titles in the Monster strike may have been better but this one I feel was a bit of a miss.;Not Recommended
0;Kaiketsu Zorori;kv195;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kv195;9;"Kaiketsu Zorori, based off the children's book series by Yutaka Hara had a very fun anime, even for an older viewer like myself.Story:The story is fairly simple: A anthropomorphic fox named Zorori wants to become an evil king and own a castle and marry a beautiful bride to succeed the goals he said to his deceased mother. Although two boars, Zorori, and Noshishi, tag along as his servants.It's a silly little story, but I rather liked it for the execution of it made it fun to watch in 52 episodes despite it's simplicity.Art:The art is actually good, nothing much to be said about it but it has a kiddy feel to it and is well-drawn for the most part. It's use of vivid colors and simple background art just fits all in very well.Sound:The sound effects were funny and good to say the most. Although the music, such as ""Zorori March"", was rather fun to sing-along to. So it was pretty fun overall.Character:The characters Noshishi and Ishishi may lack character development, but they do serve a purpose to get into Zorori's character depth. It wasn't the deepest, but it was fairly interesting to figure out Zorori and see some of him grow and somewhat develop 3-dimension-ally throughout the series.The large cast of characters appear at certain times too, such as his rival Gaon, but not much to say there besides a good set-up.Enjoyment:I really did enjoy watching each episodes. For all the reasons listed, it just fell in place to my personal interests and had made it worth the watch . All the silliness and some good comedy made me laugh, the somewhat suspenseful parts really got me into it as well.Overall:Kaiketsu Zorori is a hit-or-miss thing, but most likely great for children as that's what it was aimed for. For me, it was an anime for just enjoyment and relaxation for it's silly-fun story and characters. I felt it was worth my watch!";Recommended
0;Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2: Shiroki Ryuu no Miko;KuraKaze;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KuraKaze;8;This is basically the same story as Harukanaru 1: Hachiyou Shou but told differently with some details changed. Akane was brought into the other world by herself, the hachiyou were all originally from the other world. The hachiyou do not just blindly follow her simply because she's the miko, but she has to try to earn their respect in order to get their help. While there isn't a lot of character development (it is only 3 episodes), there was already more character depth than what I got from the enter 26 episodes of hachiyou shou. There is conspiracy, political tension, personal crisis/turmoil for the characters (eg: fighting between duty and personal choice). I am very sad that there is only 3 episodes with no continuation.In my opinion, this is a better story than Hachiyou Shou, and I would have loved for them to continue this version into a fully fleshed out TV series instead of hachiyou shou. The plot is more believable, the characters are more in depth, and the art is better.;Recommended
1;Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2: Shiroki Ryuu no Miko;NekoMinSeo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NekoMinSeo;7;"In short, I feel like this 3 episode series managed to achieve a lot of what the 2004 version didn't in 26 episodes...It's pretty darn cool.The original is pretty mediocre on pretty much all aspects and besides its movie i wouldn't really recommend any of it. THIS on the other hand has a lot of potential, it establishes the world and conflict quite well, especially when it comes to the guardians. They have their own lives and their own conflicts outside of the Priestess, which is why initially most of them are reluctant to join Karin, or even downright reject her.From the very beginning Karin isn't babied because she's the priestess, she's instantly faced with the difficulty and responsibility of being the Priestess of the white dragon, also with all the political and social consequences that entails. The feeling of isolation and loneliness makes Karin very likable as a heroine from the get-go, as well her modern way of being (such as playing ball with the nobles, something unheard of for a lady to do at the time).One thing I don't understand though is why the change of character design and names when it's obvious who is supposed to be who from the 2004 version. Like seriously, ThErE'S sO LiTtLe ReSeMbLaNcE IT'S AMAZING! *obviously sarcastic*I can't treat it as a sequel either despite the ""2"" in the title since it's basically the same thing, just an alternate setting of events. I guess that's exactly what it is and the designs were changed in order to maybe, either differentiate it from the original to make an entirely new experience, or maybe they thought it'd have been more marketable to introduce more bishies than keep the original cast...I wouldn't know tho. xDStill...very good.

Correct me if I am wrong, but this shit is not how dimensions work. I am fairly sure that mixing 3D people and 2D anime characters together don't magically create an extra dimension.Apparently the story itself is still very much 4-dimensional because it takes 'time' as the 4th dimension... by making it so that the story takes place in the past. How unique. I wonder why the concept of time doesn't exist in all the other anime... oh wait, it does. In Alice in Wonderland, Time was a person. At least that one was pretty original idea. Not sure what the folks who did this were thinking. ""Hey dude, Imagine if time existed in anime."" ""Yes, totally."" I guess some ganja was included.I give this a 2/10 because at least love doesn't go thru all 5 dimensions in this one like it does in the movie 'Interstellar' so it's not unwatchable.

0;Pandora to Akubi;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;8;Pandora to Akubi is a very lovely surprise to a weary anime traveller like me. Very clearly a passion project, I’m sad to see it go unnoticed in the western anime sphere. I put a ‘maybe?’ next to this show on my list of 2019 movies I still want to watch and that ‘maybe?’ very much stands for ‘maybe this will get subtitled’. Yet, as it does time and time again, the passion of a small group of creators I know almost nothing about, manages to reach halfway across the globe through the power of the internet, reminding me in the process of the power of anime. I’m not making that up, by the way. This anime is very much a love letter to anime, with it proudly showing off a bunch of characters from old Tatsunoko Productions shows from the 60s and 70s. I have very little idea how a project like this could come to be, but It seems to be linked to the 50th anniversary of the anime ‘Hakushon Daimaou’, and I guess a bunch of other Tatsunoko characters got caught up in the mix in the celebrating studio’s drunken stupor. Still, what ultimately matters is that this production shows off some real talent on multiple fronts and, though its presentation is somewhat inconsistent, it’s a real joy to watch.Pandora is a clumsy girl who, after opening a box, accidentally sends magical shards of ‘calamity’ across multiple worlds and, together with a goofy, magical girl named Akubi, travels through dimensions in order to collect these shards before bad stuff happens. This is very much not an original plot for an anime, but I don’t think it has to be. The creators of the show clearly just wanted a generic anime bullshit plot so they could fill it with fun stuff. Anime bullshit to facilitate more anime bullshit, that’s what this anime is and I love it.What ultimately makes this anime stand out, however, is that it manages to find an interesting balance between the goofiness of the premise and its main characters and some more serious elements. Especially episode one feels somewhat grounded in that the characters and setting are shown off more or less realistically. So when two girls claiming to be from another dimension to collect an evil stone that will do bad stuff, barge into town, no one takes them particularly seriously and the two of them are somewhat surprised about this. Yet no one makes a big stink about this and the only policeman in town, Speedracer, and his girlfriend genuinely try to be helpful, even if they don’t know what’s going on.What’s even more interesting is that Speedracer and his girlfriend Doronjo genuinely have some depth behind them. Speed put behind his dream of being a racer to protect the people of his home town, which is very much not a thing he would have done if he was anything like the speed we know from the original show. Doronjo wants to support his dream of being a racer, but she’s also being chased by her criminal past which might put the whole town in danger if she stays there. These characters feel very real and lived and put an emotional core behind an otherwise silly and baffling show. Sadly episode two isn’t as grounded and is overall a lot less engaging. What’s interesting is that the serious and silly nature of the show is present in the character designs as well. Our two protagonists are very cutesy and moe, but Speed and Doronjo feel like modern , mature renditions of the original characters in a similar vein to ‘The woman called Fujiko Mine’. I’m very impressed by how this show manages to fit these very opposite aesthetics under one character design style.And it’s not just the characters, the art in general in this show is stellar. The character art is very bouncy and animates wonderfully, the background art is gorgeous and stylized and the colour pallet is one of the best I’ve ever seen. Overall the art by itself is already wonderful, but then it’s backed up by a lot of fantastic animation, mostly of the very fluid, very web-gen kind. Seeing Akubi bounce around like a goofball was an absolute joy and there was some great action in the mix as well. At the end of both episodes the characters end up transforming into characters from gatchaman and yatterman and this results in some great fighting sequences accompanied by some equally fantastic music.I can very much understand that some people might not get into this anime the way I did, considering it’s very weird and it throws a lot of conflicting stuff at you. For me personally, this anime threw together a bunch of great things into a wonderful mix that really resonates with me. In an anime landscape that is dominated by very stale visual productions the colourfulness and the poppyness of this anime is a sight for sore eyes. The anime industry is composed of passionate people who row against the tide to be able to facilitate the creation of good anime, so when I see an obviously passionate production like this come out, I can’t help myself but be excited. Talented people making good shit, that’s what this show is. The world needs more passionate people making good shit. That’s what I preach.;Recommended
1;Pandora to Akubi;Bajar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bajar;8;Pandora to Akubi is a nostalgia-driven “down the rabbit hole” type of adventure action comedy movie that packs a lot of punch into less than an hour of runtime.Pandora is a cute travelling witch voiced by the ever adorable Ogura Yui and Akubi is an incompetent-but-eager genki genie-themed character voiced skillfully by the relatively unknown Amaki Sally. The highlight of this entire movie by far is these 2 characters optimism and positive attitude as they explore. You will smile and laugh along with these cuties as they unravel the mysteries of chaotic worlds and meet zany characters. If you are looking for some serious drama you are looking in the wrong place as most of the conflicts that arise in this movie are resolved in fun and simplistic ways that can fit cleanly into the short runtime with the typical anime theme of the “power of friendship” prevailing. After Pandora & Akubi resolve one conflict they are eager to jump into the next world and keep the fast paced action up.One of the main appeals for an older audience that may be watching this movie with their kids is the nostalgia-driven elements. The movie features dozens of characters from Tatsunoko's long and storied history of producing popular anime since the 1960s. Pandora and Akubi find themselves interacting with characters from Speed Racer (1967), Yatterman (1977), and Gatchaman (1972). As an ignorant westerner born decades after these series were popular this was not a major appeal for me. However I still feel a sort of nostalgia via proxy. I can tell these characters are old and beloved and that the creators are re-imagining them in a new context. This element of the movie as a sort of ultimate crossover between Tatsunoko franchises is a welcome addition for sure although from my perspective I would not mind a sequel featuring the main duo setting off on brand new adventures that don't need to crutch on existing IPs.Lastly I just want to comment on the art and animation aspect. The show is extremely colourful and the animation is bouncy and fluid. Overall the art and animation highlights an upbeat and optimistic attitude that the characters carry. Paired with the fun original opening and ending songs, the fundamentals are all here for an aesthetically pleasing experience.;Recommended
2;Pandora to Akubi;querempaz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/querempaz;8;Basically Tatsunoko Dragon Ball GT, without the annoying characters and forgettable plot, it is charming and a mix of a lot of old properties from Tatsunoko with that adventure/journey style of narrative were two characters need to settle their differences in order to get set amount of McGuffins or get to a place.Akubi is so cute, Pandora is a nice distinct character who clashes in the right amount with the genie girl. The mix of old properties and even the little action at the end of each part makes it compelling and engaging. Even if you only played Tatsunoko vs Capcom or remember some of the Tatsunoko Animes that were localized in English or in your country, I truly believe you will find some appreciation of the stuff here, the way they have written this in such creative situations also adds to the enjoyment even if you aren't the diehard Tatsunoko-fan.Final score 8/10 very good, this needs a sequel;Recommended
0;Innocent: Shoujo Memoria;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;7;Tags: Anthology, Loli, Rape, Small Breasts, VirginsInnocent is a very short, confusing story. After watching it three times I think this is the story… There are actually two short stories in this 11 minute hentai, the first called Memory of Love and a second called Sleeping Beauty.The first story involves a guy named Tengo who lost his girlfriend (Kawana) years before to some unknown illness. Now older and a teacher he is met by a young girl named Yasuda who claims to have past life memories of Kawana and proceeds to have an illicit affair with Tengo. In actuality, Yasuda has found Kawana's old diary and has decided to pretend to be Tengo's old girlfriend so that they can have sex.The second story involves a boy named Shinya and his girlfriend who had decided to spend her days sleeping until her father comes to see her. Shinya thinks she is permanently asleep and begins having regular sex with her as she pretends to sleep, all the while her younger sister is becoming more and more jealous of their 'affair'.There is not much more to it than that, this is a very short hentai and as I said, and from watching it a couple times I think that's the story. The animation is very nice and the characters look good, although it is censored and will probably always be both due to its short length and its content. They pack a whole lot of hentai material into 11 minutes, and the majority of what is on screen is sex. The first story is definitely a loli story as Yasuda looks like she is in junior high at most. The second story can be seen as a rape story since Shinya is having sex with someone he thinks is asleep, although you can argue that she is actually awake and thus can stop him any time she wants.Overall it was a decent, although slightly confusing hentai. I enjoyed the action and the girls were hot. Its worth the watch, even though it is short.;Recommended
0;Innocent: Shoujo Memoria;Revy2Hand;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Revy2Hand;3;Very short. While has the awesome animation style of Pink Pineapple. This shows so little of the characters from Akatsuki Myuuto's Innocent Shoujo Memoria (Innocent~Memories of a Girl~) manga, that it removes the why that made the manga such a good work. So while the sex scenes were done well It makes no sense with JUST the sex scenes. And at being only a little over 11 minutes long they didn't even use a fraction of the material available. Most other Hentai's manga's that get turned into hentai keep the storyline and character development. That's what makes Hentai for the most part different from regular just sex porn. This I feel was a poorly done not because of the art (which was again very well done despite being censored), but it took out the characters and replaced it with mindless sex scenes.

0;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;Prede;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prede;8;"Ah ""Hello Hedgehog: Domain of Murder"", this is an OVA that almost know one knows about, in the U.S. and in Japan. I wouldn't even know about it if it weren't for ANN's recent Buried Treasure article. I read that review of it, and it seemed interesting so I bought the DVD. I am quite happy that I did, because this is quite an undicovered gem. It's no masterpeice, but it's a very good series.Plot/Story7/10This OVA is based off of the popular seinen manga ""Hello Hedgehog"". Sadly the OVA did not become too popular, but lucky enough for us, Central Park Media licensed it for some reason, and even gave it a good dub a few years later. Anyway the story is very interesting. It's a classic detective tale, but the mystery behind it is very interesting. The story starts out with Detective Goro (nicknamed ""Hedgehog"" due to his hair) being asked to find a lady's long lost husband. He ran away from the family years ago, and she beleived him to be dead. But a recent wanted poster she found (how cliche) has a picture of him on it. There's a different name on the poster, but it's definitely his picture. This lady wants the detective to find her husband, so she can talk to him once more before he goes to jail. It's an odd request, but Goro takes the case ( a little reluctantly at first). The case leads him to the other side of Japan, and while investigating there are many twists and turns. The plot is pretty much a regualr mature detective drama, something we'd be more used to seeing in an American Live Action Movie, or TV series then in anime, but the change in medium is well welcomed. The mystery is very good, but not without it's faults. I wouldn't go as far as calling them plot holes, but there are some real problems with the story. Many things that unfold are very unlikely, which is normally a little forgivable in an anime, but I'll hold them to it for this, since they are trying to be very realstic. For one thing, why does this one man make so much more progress on the case the the entire police force? Another thing, why the HELL didn't the police grab this man when he was about to get on the ferris wheel (toward the end of the OVA), or one of the many other times they could have grabbed him at the amusement park!? Look I know they are trying to ""protect"" his son, but they are putting him in (physical) harms way by not taking him away from his father! Trying to protect him from mental scares is not a good enough reason to gamble with hsi life! Real life police don't act this way, and least I sure hope they don't. If an officer ever made the same choses that the officers make in this anime, I would expect them to be fired! They make some real stupid descisions toward the end...but I digress. Anyway because they allowed him to get on the ferris wheel, an illogical scene occures, which is a pivotal moment in the anime, and due to this it feels forced and illogical and loses it's point. The part with the husband/father in the bar also has some problems to it, and feels a little off. More time should have been speant explaining exactly what went on there. There are also some real leaps of faith needed to believe that the car crash scene would ever happen in real life. It doesn't even make sense that the family is magically holding on to a vine, when they were just in their car folloing down a cliff! Of course the father is the only one holding on to the vine and the kids are holding on to him, too! But besides the multiple problems with the plot, it's actually pretty good. The ending was decent and it told a good story. If your forgiving, and willing to not question a few major scenes, this is a very good mystery anime. Perhaps I'm a little to hard on the plot anyway. It's not that bad.Art7/10As Justin Sevakis says in his ""Buried Treasure"" review of the OVA, I wouldnt call the animation/artwork ugly and cheap looking, I would call it realistic and detailed. The backgrounds are great looking! Ok so it's not Cowboy Bebop, or Paprika, or something, but the backgrounds are very good for 1992. It didn't blow me away, but it's above average. As for the character designs, I really enjoyed them. Some would call them ugly, I would call them real looking and seinen inspired. They all have a rustic, personal look to them I'd say. I wish a few more anime series looked like this. It's not top level work, but it's not cheap or anything at all.Characters8/10While many of the characters actions (and non-actions) are very illogical (esecially the sons and the police forces actions, but even th e husband/father and wife/mothers toward the end), I still would give this about an 8/10. Many of the characters are realistic and interesting, despite problems with the others. They really show us a little bit of the way they live, and let us into their world a little. We learn a lot about these people in a short amount of time, which I think is a real feat. Although many of the characters feel tacked on and a little useless at the end, there's no one I really hated in the story, and I felt sympathetic to all of the. I felt like they were all decent or good characters.Enjoyment9/10I agree with Justin Sevakis on this one. It's so rare to see an anime like this make it to the US that the flaws are easily forgivable. It's really enjoyable, esecially if you don't sweat the small stuff (and think too hard about many of the major scenes). It's easy to like this OVA, and I'm very glad that I did. I think I may have been a little to hard on this OVA, because I really did enjoy it.Final Vertic:Now to sum it up. The story is great, with an interesting mystery, and great characters. There are problems with the plot, and illogical characters do harm the OVA, but it still comes out looking very nice. The music is decent, but forgettable. The artwork is great, and the character desings interesting. It's a good detective drama, with an attempt at realism, but does comes off a little forced. Great suspense story, and a good watch. This is not going to become your next favorite OVA, but you will probally enjoy it.

1;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;stonnyfor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stonnyfor;7;Domain of Murder is a simple old school detective story, and it was pretty fun to watch. Its just a single episode based on a random case from the manga it was adapted from.story: The story is about a private detective working for a firm taking on a case to find a disturbed killer. This story about the killer has a twist I have never seen in an anime before or anything else in matter of fact. It makes you think would we have done the same thing if we were in his shoes or what would we have done different. it might have not been the right thing to do but was it really wrong?.Is it fair for us to judge him on the decision he made. It will make you question your moral values and makes you think what did the victim feel when the killer had to make the tough decision. I know I am very vague about the twist behind the killer but I cannot ruin the little the story has(for the few that decide to watch it because of this review), since it is only 51 minutes. 8/10Animation: The animation has the old school feel. It kind of feels low budget but the animation is clean. It being low budget does not take away from the anime at all because I believe it goes well with the detective story. None of the characters are pretty or cute which makes ova seem more realistic. It also animated some great scenery from a couple of Japan's cities. 7/10Sound: I can't say I remember much but nothing annoyed me. Sub and dub both are done well. Decent background music. One thing I do remember is that they changed the dialogue and accents from the background characters, when Goru travels from Tokyo to another city. It is easy to recognize in the sub and probably not at all in the dub, but is mentioned in both. 6/10Characters: The main character is Detective Goru he is a private detective and works with other private detectives for a firm. To me it seems the other detectives and the people that run the firm are main characters from the manga but only make a small appearance in this ova and that is probably due to them only showing one case from the manga. The killer and other people involved in the case get well developed for the case so the audience gets a real feel of what these characters are going through. You get to know more and more about Detective Goru's personality as the ova progresses . 7/10I did enjoy it nothing really bored me when I was watching it. I wish they had done at least a few more ovas and maybe we could have gotten introduced to more of the main characters from manga. Like I said earlier it is really just a random case from the manga adapted into animated form. To me I think it is probably not even the best case or story the manga had to offer. I could just tell by watching this ova that the manga will have more interesting stories and cases to show. I haven't read the manga and don't plan to read it, but that's just because I don't really like to read.I watch a lot of anime and I don't really watch any american TV even though I live in America so I can't say for sure if the twist has not been done before. but I have not seen it before. I think you should give it a watch especially if you like some detective mysteries.;Recommended
2;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;8;"Rate an 8English DubbedAs far back as i can recall, detectives have joked about cases falling into their laps. The idea of having snow as a setting illustrates that point further. For you see cases are like the weather. Some times the endings/starts are like sun shine nice and bright. Although, they can always turn into rain/snow, miserable/bleak. A case drifted in a detectives lap and while he had multiple opportunities to brush it off he choose against it. Now, the question remains was that the right call? Simple to answer without the facts but like Aristotle said, ""The more you know, the more you know you don't know.” Which means there is no longer an easy answer for as the facts come in so do different paths and approaches. A simple detective story but come to conclusion be ready to share with all the characters emotions. A great movie at making one see beyond what is in front of the blizzard that surrounds oneself.Some things worth mentioning that i enjoyed-In terms of the introduction i covered how the use of snow was a nice touch. But i only addressed it in a metaphoric stand point. Snow beautifully covered the creative or imaginative form but danced perfectly to the literal beat of the heart of the plot. Yes, characters had a tough time in arriving to any form of conclusion but how the art portrayed this piece really pushed upon the viewer the feeling of uncertainty in something one can see. Something metaphoric lacks is sight. Yes, it can be imagined but having something worth seeing can be worth believing.- As for the ending i was disappointed but at the same time appreciative. I tend to want happy conclusions for those brighten up my day and don't leave me depressed. But the director, bless him wanted to outshine him/herself by doubling back to how this story originated in a somewhat unique form. Which in turn forced the blissfully ignorant side to make the same tough call.If i were to construct one element i wasn't pleased with i would say detail in the art. Although, mind you this judgement would be forced but i think that art wise could have been better. Anime in general is know for its moe(slang for beautiful) eyes but here there were some moments where the eyes were almost beady dots(second rate).";Recommended
3;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;ymasumac;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ymasumac;7;"The art and sound remind me of a Japan I never saw, but one the 匂い (nioi/perfume) of which I have sensed from dear friends. It's an older drawing style reminiscent of Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo and Master Keaton, backed by a kind of ""cocktail hour"" jazz, which sweeps me away to a simpler, more beautiful time in the world, and particularly in Japan.We have seen many of these characters before in melodramatic police shows, but somehow Inspector Yamagishi's remarkable seiyuu and character design managed to bring me to the brink of tears more than once, as though meeting his ""type"" for the first time.If anything, although it's in color, Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun ""feels"" more like a black-and-white 1950s Japanese movie than it does an anime. Keeping that in mind helped me to enjoy it more.This OVA already has several wonderful reviews, but I joined MAL today after watching it because the sacrifice it dramatizes of one of two children, and the repercussions, may have helped to inspire a superficially similar sacrifice in a later, darker, and more convoluted anime series called Monster.An unexplained disappearance, as well as Pangaea-sized guilt, madness, compassion, anguish, love, sacrifice, and salvation play parts as big here as they do in Monster.In 51 minutes, this OVA took me places, and presented me with a riddle I hope never to have to answer in real life, a riddle paraphrased not only in Monster, but during the first Hunter Exam of Hunter x Hunter--for which the correct answer is no answer at all.The plot feels archetypal, mythological, and helped to answer a long-standing question of mine.This OVA revolves around a watershed problem requiring decisive action, but to which no correct response exists, in which Toyama Tsuyoshi is, literally, ""damned if he does and damned if he doesn't"".To those who sometimes wonder whether we as a species are innately evil and, if not, what gave birth to evil, Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun provides an answer which, for once, feels right to me.A gem for those interested in slower, atmospheric anime which depict a vanishing Japan.";Recommended
4;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;BobSamurai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BobSamurai;7;*SPOILER FREE*This OVA follows a private investigator hired to find his client's husband. It turns out the man is wanted for double homicide, and she wishes to speak with him before he's arrested. What makes this anime so interesting is that this investigator travels across Japan following breadcrumbs he hopes will eventually lead to his target. But, instead, he discovers that these clues slowly unravel a psychological mystery of a man who suffers a mental break after being haunted by an incredibly difficult decision he made in the past.While I won't spoil exactly what this decision was, I will say that his survival once teetered on a morally grey dilemma where all outcomes are tragic. The PTSD resulting from this choice forever changed him and sent him down this dark path.Despite the anime only being 50 minutes long, they manage to create a good sense of mystery while gradually illustrating what the man's recent history was like while also making you question your own morality. In the beginning, the guy sounds despicable, but the more you watch, the more you realize that anyone could be placed in such a horrendous situation.Although Domain of Murder is a mystery that gets into the psychology of its suspect, I wouldn't describe it as suspenseful, at least until its climax. It feels like you're watching a random episode of a tv crime drama for the most part. You don't care about the protagonist because he's been introduced ages ago in content that wasn't adapted, and he also doesn't face any real danger. If you enjoy episodic tv crime dramas, then you'll enjoy this. However, I think most other people will probably find the OVA interesting but dry. There is an English dub I think is good. However, if you want to get the most out of something like this, I'd recommend the original Japanese audio.I give Domain of Murder a 7.5 out of 10. I recommend checking it out because it creates an engaging mystery in under an hour, plus I think it's produced well in terms of character designs and background art. To me, this anime feels like a missed opportunity to have a nice, short series because I'd love to see more along the same vein. The manga is titled Hello Hedgehog, and Domain of Murder applies to this specific mini-story. The manga series was also adapted into a Japanese live-action TV drama, but I'd personally rather just read the manga...if I could find it. Although Hello Hedgehog isn't all about crime mysteries, if each arc was written as well as this OVA, then I think it would make for a decent read.STORY 7ART 8SOUND 7CHARACTER 7ENJOYMENT 7OVERALL 7.5;Recommended
0;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;BlokeTokes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlokeTokes;6;"""Hello Hedgehog: Domain of Murder"" is an oldie detective short-film, being an adapted story from the manga. Although it's old, the art style is proportioned well and still looks good - taking on a look similar to Naoki Urasawa's art. The animation is also good and rarely wavers in quality control, while there is moments of stuttering due to not enough frames at times. The sound work is good to the ambiance and the soundtrack is also fair, with older music styles at times. A dub was created for this, surprisingly, and it's even more surprising how good it is. I went the dub route and could definitely say it's not the wrong way to go, as there isn't one ""ill-served"" actor (random quote from section on this anime from ""The Anime Encyclopedia, 3rd Revised Edition: A Century of Japanese Animation""). There is also no try-hard voice actors that speak out of a natural state (besides some brief workers), which deserves extra points. The characters of this short are also well-realized some of the time, featuring moments of interaction that feel genuine and are interesting just with that in mind - even if nothing much were going on. The mystery of the story is interesting too in what it leads to, and in some of the turns that come along the way, but the story is also in a way the weakest part of this short.With some believable characters and good English actors, it was just a shame that the detective case itself didn't end up with the same genuine taste in the mouth. The issue with it is that there are far too many assumptions that lead to the case's resolution. Some of these assumptions that are made are also inherently based on nothing, and are even biased into making one think a certain way about a situation that a detective should still be critical about - not finding every possible twist to lead the conclusion in the direction they see the culprit's motives and mentality from personal feelings. However, the assumptions do go in the detective's favor of course, but I never really felt impressed by his work. The only thing the detective really did as a solid move forward was finding a person related to the suspect to get information, along with finding an explanation for an angle of a wound. From there, further information was given by that same related person when it benefited moving the story forward - one moment literally being the related person to the suspect calling the detective right as the growing thought of a potential turn to the case brews in his mind, only happening to solidify his hunch for him to move forward with it. That type of scenario happens twice, but that isn't the only type of victorious assumption that is made. Two other assumptions are literally never backed with anything and are simply of the detective rebuilding scenarios in his mind to understand what happened - but with no real evidence to lead to his twisted conclusion of supporting how he hopes everything will turn out. There is also one, without a question, stupid decision that is made by the detective and the police near the end - and it happens so continuously that I almost want to say it was multiple stupid decisions. This decision leads to a bad situation that could've been prevented, but evidently leads into a nice conclusion with regards to why the whole case happened. And while that conclusion does feel good at being conclusive, the previous out-of-nowhere stupid decisions leading to it make it feel potent of contrivances. I would say some of the assumptions leading to developments as fueled by contrivances as-well, with regards to random information being fed from nowhere to make new thoughts feel plausible real-time.Overall, ""Hello Hedgehog: Domain of Murder"" was enjoyable and in-a-way better than I thought. I have been looking for something like ""Monster"" for quite a while and can safely say this isn't that, although the similar art style was nice along with the surprising work that went into this in visuals and voices. I feel that more adaptations of this manga would've been cool as there is no telling if there's better stories than this, but even if this were the average level - a show like that would still be enjoyable.";Mixed Feelings
1;Hello Harinezumi: Satsui no Ryoubun;kiki-jiji;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kiki-jiji;6;"Domain of Murder is an interesting anime to say the least. The audience is somewhat thrown into the story and are given the same clues to work with as the private investigator which I thought was pretty fair. As a 'psychological' anime it does fulfill that role and deals with some serious questions about the grey area of morality (specifically analyzing the concept of sacrifice to save another) and by the end you are left with the general message that the decisions we think are easy may end up being ones we regret for the rest of our lives, which is pretty damn psychologically mind boggling for a half hour movie. However, the movie had its ups and downs from the start.The art style is what you would expect of for an anime of this era so there are no complaints on that front, and the sound is a bit grainy but again, expected. The characters are fairly enjoyable, unique from each other, and have intriguing goals/motives that the audience can tell from the short amount of screen time they had. Now here comes the bad news - they completely blew the arc of the story. Just as things were coming together and the mystery was getting deeper, one character suddenly reveals a VERY important detail that they ""forgot"" to mention earlier, despite how very clearly important it was to the case. Not only this, but that fragment of the case could've been revealed in several different ways, but for the character to brush it off like ""oh right I forgot to tell you that the killer told me who his next target was"" is a *little* frustrating on its own, let alone how nonchalantly the character brings it up. This struck me as a lazy way of keeping the plot going but at the very least the movie didn't end on that note.The climax of the anime takes place in a theme park and was genuinely well played out in terms of twisting your mind and sort of making you sick/sad. To be as general as possible, they bring in two snipers who claim they aren't capable of taking the shot, the one man who doesn't want to take it is the only one who knows he can, and the decision of whether to pull the trigger is left to a character who thought the decision would be much easier said than done. The wrap up shortly after the climax is a bit too mushy for my taste but I'm hard to impress when it comes to endings.Overall, I think it was worth the watch! I give it a 6 out of 10 because, though I found it intriguing as a whole, I wouldn't place it as one of the best I've ever watched. I'd definitely recommend it to those who enjoy this style of anime or perhaps a sample of psychological anime for those who are wondering if they might like the genre, but don't want to sit through an entire series.";Mixed Feelings

0;Youkai Ningen Bem (2006);angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;6;As I have not seen the first version of this show (done in 1968), I have no clue if this is like the original or if it is created off. All I know is that it has a rather good feel to it. I love shows like this because it has an air of mystery and supernatural horror that always captures my attention but then has a superhero addition to it.The story has an interesting feel of old Japanese folklore about demons living among humans with the interesting vibe of trying to combat evil. It’s hard to explain exactly what this is because its somewhat a monster by week storyline, and then it has a few pieces that seem to give it a actual story driven feel of just a couple demons trying to be excepted and do what they think is right. It’s almost laughable because most of the stories are just human stupidity and them paying for it.I don’t really understand why the show is called Humanoid Monster Bem because it seems that the stories revolve around Bero mostly. In my mind, even though the characters are parts of the same person, if one is more the focus, then you would call it after the character that has the most screen time, right? The only problem I have is that he’s rather naïve and a little to trusting, although I understand why Bero is like that. He’s pretty much just a child himself and wants nothing more then to have a friend. When he meets Kira, a girl who despite seeing his monster form still wants to be friends, he tries anything he can to keep that friendship even when Kira’s parents try to pull them apart.Bera is rather harsh and loves showing off at times even though she can’t show her real form. On the other hand, she is rather loving and motherly to the people she meets and to Bero who acts a lot like her child. Bem is a lot like a old guy who knows more then he lets on to the other two. I’m somewhat surprised that they are supposed to be the same age because I would of sworn he was the oldest of the two with how much knowledge he actually has about monsters in this world.I was surprised to find that the more I watched this, the more I actually liked the episodes where they didn’t really have to fight and kill the monsters. There were some monsters that actually were just rather misunderstood like themselves. For example, the little goblin they called Imp from episode 5 only wanted to make friends and so kept the children of the hospital from recovering. When the group actually explained to him the problem with his idea, he changes his plan to actually help the children. There are other stories like this, though not many.The animation is actually pretty clean as to be expected of a show done in 2006. Bero looks a lot like Beast Man from Teen Titans. There are small things that bother me like in the English version, some lip sinking is done rather poorly and characters move a bit stiffly at times. There are times were we get CG images that look a little off. You can tell that they just don’t fit right. Other then that, the animators got a really interesting way of showing terror in the faces. It’s really well detailed.The music is actually rather catching and has a feeling of urgency in it that gets you pumped for the episode. The background music adds a feeling of the occult that I really like, making the skin on the back of my neck get goose bumps. The ending though feels a little out of place since its actually rather sweet and gentle. The Voices are all right, although a lot of them seem just standard. Kira’s voice is a little annoying to me along with a bunch of people who really don’t really show up except for only one episode.;Mixed Feelings

If it was left as it is, this could've been less than a 4.Forget the music, except the one part that caught me off-guard being ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", very unexpected and pleasant.Character - 4.Not much to say, it's just simply gag-repetition per character.

The girl shows up at the hardly-ever-shown guy's door, comes in, and has sex with him. Also, all three girls are still virgins who have just become idols.

I could never imagine another ending other than this. Tatsuya being out of the shadow of his brother and Minami devoted as ever to support him.If there was a nitpick within the movie is that the new characters are not that fleshed out, but acceptable for a 100 minute show.Overall, Touch will be forever in my heart as it reminds me of Brotherly love, Passion, funny skits, and the determination of Minami and Tatsuya to commit to one another as their future rolls to their new chapter.;Recommended

With time to draw out more content and make things feel less rushed both story lines really could have left Touch! as a champion of baseball and probably sports anime in general. Instead you get two sequel movies with way too fast pacing that feel akin to Disney straight to DVD sequels.

Selta is a city filled with some of the most contrastingly different areas. Houses range from mid-evil castles to small wooden huts, narrow canals act as streets in some areas, and not to mention the giant lizard and fish sculptures that line the city. Throw in some of the most detailed work since 5 Centimeters per Second, and you have a visually stunning background that never fails to draw a viewer in.In contrast to the amazingly detailed backgrounds, you have the characters. These characters are rendered in CG and have little detail to them. The CG is not the blatantly obvious kind you see in most anime, but a very subtle form of CG that allows the characters to move freely and in excess, unlike many other shows where the characters often stand in one place for a few minutes at a time. This CG style is so subtle, that I often found myself questioning whether it was even CG or not. I have no idea how the studio did it, but this is a very unique form of animation that I would honestly not mind seeing in other shows.Sound - 7/10The background music for Hipira-kun is practically nonexistent. However, this is more of a pro than a con. It gives room for the viewer to hear the sounds of the city - water fountains bubbling, clocks signaling the time, and footsteps across the surprisingly empty city streets.The voice actors are also spot on. Hipira's in particular is very memorable to the point where I can recognize him from various other series and movies.Characters - 8/10Hipira-kun is a show mainly focused on two characters - Soul and Hipira. Hipira is a scamp of a boy, often pulling pranks on his neighbors and being late to class. He symbolizes childish innocence and it's very easy for anyone to see their past in him.Soul is his friend who appears to be a tad more intelligent yet naive. He is shown reading difficult things to Hipira, but when it comes to more social matters he is slightly clueless.Enjoyment - 9/10This series is lined with childish adventures that you can't help but relate to. The short but sweet episodes can't help but enthrall its viewer into coming back for more. Throw in a bit of more subtle comedy that older viewers would be able to pick up, and you have a show that will either lure in viewers looking for a comedy or invoke feelings of nostalgia and happiness.Overall - 8/10It was a joy to watch this show. This is most definitely a slice of life show done right, and I would love to see another season. Hipira-kun's only major flaw is the fact that it only has 10 episodes running at 5 minutes each, totaling to about the length of two average episodes.If you're looking for a show similar to the popular Yotsuba&! manga, then this is it. I highly recommend it.;Recommended
0;Nandarou;Shioxus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shioxus;6;This was the other TV short by Ghibli, along with Sora Iro no Tane, to be aired in November of 1992.The art is more in line with what I expect from Ghibli than it was in Sora Iro no Tane, complete with an eccentric and immediately lovable mascot creature.Even though there wasn't a background song to accompany Nandarou, it's sound effects make up for that thanks to signature Ghibli charm.I recommend this for Ghibli aficionados. It's impressive that they can instill charm into something less than a minute long.Say what you will about Ghibli and Miyazaki, but they know how to catch a viewer's attention nine time out of ten.;Mixed Feelings

Its more about those girls getting violated in a very cheap and ordinary way. Besides this the animations are horrible. in a few scenes they just move the 2d pictures from left to right.

0;Karen;Animegrin245;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animegrin245;5;"Welcome to my review of ""Karen"" ! I will try to sum up my thoughts about everything for this hentai as briefly as I can!Story: 7/10The story for Karen well generic is still fairly solid. The main character, Okawa Ryo, gets blackmailed by her fellow cheering squad members through threats of leaving the team. The story works for what it tries to accomplish and it does it fairly decently. it does however not really break the mold, which is why it only gets a 7/10 for story.Art: 4/10Now we start getting into the bad. When I try to judge hentai on art, I always try to be as fair as possible and critique it based on the time it was made. Karen is fairly decent when it comes to it's art. If this was made several years ago, then I would definitely be praising the art. For a 2002 hentai though, it is simply ""ok"". Sadly I cannot say the same about the animation at all, it is absolutely appalling. The animation feels like it had no effort put into it and it can really turn you off from the experiences the art offers.Sound: 5/10Again, if this was made in the early 90s, this would be getting high praise. In 2002 though, I would simply consider it ""average"".Character: 9/10Finally! Back to something good again! The character of Ryo is truly done well. Her personality is truly formidable and her development was amazing as well. With everything being stacked against her in the plot, it makes it even more entertaining to watch her character!Enjoyment: 5/10The contextually parts of this hentai are truly solid, like the characters and story. But it ultimately, falls very flat due to terrible animation and lackluster art and sound design.Overall: 5/10! Average, don't watch it if you want to jack";Mixed Feelings
1;Karen;HarmonySword;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HarmonySword;6;When I first started watching hentais, this was one of the first I have seen, but this is a mixed bag for the most part.First is the voice acting. Having watched in both languages, the dub is better than the Japanese sub mainly because I liked Ryo's English VA. Even though Aki's makes her sound alot older than she looks, it also makes her sound much sexier, which is a huge plus for me. Also the music was ok as well.Story: It's typical in that Ryo must endure sexual torture to prove herself. Turns out it's more complicated than that. Nothing too revolutionary, but then again why are you watching hentais for the story anyway?Art: The art is decent for a 2002 video. Characters look good at times especially Ryo, but sometimes they are inconsistent. Like take Aki the red head cheerleader captain for example. She looks like 3 different people drew her and they decided to include all these different designs. So the art shift can be jarring.Content: The H content was a mixed bag. It's mostly Ryo being with other guys with one yuri scene in between, but that scene was pretty disappointing as the scene changes so quickly. I would have loved to see more of it or even expanded. And everything else is your standard H content.Overall: This one is ok. Nothing really memorable stands out like a Moonlight Lady or Bible Black, but I can say I liked Ryo's character. It's a shame it got wasted in a hentai like this and it's also a shame we never see her in a regular school uniform like it was advertised on the front cover. I feel this could have been another episode or two easily, but for it to be one episode only it's something you would put on the back shelf compared to the many other hentais that came before this and the many others that would come after it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Karen;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;2;"During one of the school soccer games, the cheering squad rebels against it's captain, Ryo, and threatens to quit in the middle of a match. To keep her squad together, Ryo accepts a series of challenges from her squad members. Will Ryo be able to complete the challenges? Will she be able to keep the team together, and remain the captain?I don't know just how many times in my viewing of bad hentai that I've been just flat out bored. Even something I'm not personally into should have illicited some sort of response, but there have been so many hentai out there that have absolutely bored the shit out of me.The art is mediocre, and the animation is barely there. The English dub is just flat out boring and incredibly forgettable and bland. The best way to sum up ""Karen"" is that it's just another hentai in the sea of hentai. And considering how many hentai out there are much better than this, there's literally no reason to watch this over anything else.There has to be someone out there that would get something out of this, but who is going to dig through the sea of obscure hentai and pick this. Even in 2002, when you couldn't just find hentai online with ease, there still would have been a couple of entries on rental shelves and in porn stores that would have been a better choice than this.I guess there is some mild variety in terms of scenes, such as a gang bang, and a lesbian encounter. But literally nothing about this one episode OVA was doing it for me, and hasn't been done better by a hundred other hentai. At least if there was another episode or two, I could maybe give it a lukewarm recommendation based purely on it's variety, like if the lead character ""Karen"" was challenged to have sex with the fans of the team or something, but as it is, this is probably one of the most forgettable hentai that I've seen. I literally don't remember anything about ""Karen"".Would I recommend this hentai? Not unless you happen to somehow stumble across this and were so desperate to find something that happens to cater to your specific tastes that you just had to jerk off to it. At least the hentai with hilariously bad dubs and atrocious animation gave me something to make fun of, or at least complain about. This just put me to sleep.";Not Recommended
0;Tokyo 7th Sisters: Bokura wa Aozora ni Naru;johnbradshaw;https://myanimelist.net/profile/johnbradshaw;7;"Don't look at my score. I score 7 because I really enjoy watching idol anime even though this show doesn't deserve the rating. It still has some potentials, it's just executed horribly.Tokyo 7th Sisters has quite an interesting premiere for an idol show. But it failed to make used of it. Set in the futuristic world, where Idol enter the ""ice-age"" after the legendary group ""7th Sisters"" disbanded. So now, Idol industry is in shambles, there hardly any groups left. Then we got to meet our lovely idols ""777"", a twelve-girls idol group with the hope of bringing idols back to its glory days.In my honest opinions, there are two major things that prevent this movie to be considered a good idol show. Firstly, for its lengths of only over an hour, it's not sufficient enough to introduce 5-6 girls let alone twelve. So they have to make kind of a PV at the beginning where they spoon-fed us the info and personalities of each girls. Damn that's lazy writing just because they don't have enough money to make this movie I think. Then the second problems, they should just get rid of the horrible cartoon villain, he irritates me to the bone and absolutely contribute nothing to the plot, they could cut him out and the show will remain the same.I figured this show need an entire new beginning section and at least 25eps anime to make this work and this will be an amazing anime for sure. Hire some competent director and make this work please.";Recommended
0;Tokyo 7th Sisters: Bokura wa Aozora ni Naru;Vaenny;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Vaenny;6;If I had 2 words to describe this movie, it would be: too late. And I don't mean that as a hardcore fan of idol shows. As someone who played every mobile idol games back in 2017, I can definitely say that as a game, it ranks up there together with your big name idol franchises. So it could've made it up there together with said franchises. I mean, the game already had an anime-style CG and everything, so it was only a matter of time until they made an actual anime out of it. Heck, the game came out in 2014, so there was plenty of time for this to come out. However, they might have taken too much time on this.Animation-wise, this was well-made. There aren't any dead frames or horrible background art. It feels lively, really. And the character designs are consistent throughout the entire show. If there's one aspect that this movie excels in, it's the animation.Now, as someone who plays the game (already at level 72 btw), I can say that the songs are catchy. But then again, it might be nostalgia talking, as most of these songs are played in-game as background music for minigames. So the music is entirely subjective in this case.The characters are... well, if you've seen one idol show, you've basically seen every character trope, and 7th sisters is no exception. What I will give it props for is how characters have their own dynamic from one another. So pairings or OTPs are out of the question. And thank goodness for that, cuz I don't think I can take any more shippings in every franchise.Did I enjoy it? Well, I did, but mostly because of nostalgia. Most people who aren't familiar with the franchise will probably just brush it off. But I assure you, without spoiling anything, that it tackles a subject in the idol industry that is a scary thought but is also an inevitability.Overall, it's a good movie, despite it being too late for the party. If you like idol shows, or waifus in general (cuz there's a lot of them here, and I haven't even mentioned the rivals, originals, and time-skip idols), then give this one a shot. It's not mind-boggling, but it's an interesting watch nonetheless.;Mixed Feelings
1;Tokyo 7th Sisters: Bokura wa Aozora ni Naru;NicoHolic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NicoHolic;6;"I believe a majority of the people who actually watched or heard about this movie are already fans of Tokyo 7th Sisters. Seven years ago when the game was released, it stood out as one of the earliest idol games aside of Love Live (which is the biggest franchise, even now). The franchise also took a lot of transformation, game wise (changing the game system entirely for a couple times), and story wise. They also showed signs of trying to take the franchise to the animated scene multiple times, through animating a music video with short story, to intermissions between anniversary concerts.So when the movie was announced, I was very excited that this would help expanding what I consider a heavily underrated franchise (subjective) tomore audience.Well guess what, this feels like they were trying to appeal existing fans more than introducing Tokyo 7th Sisters to newcomers.Maybe they tried, since the worldbuilding in roughly the first half of the movie is vague at best. Some parts of the story also feels rushed. As if they want to deliver the main plot, while assuming the viewers already understood the worldbuilding and characters beforehand (which yeah, the only few characters that get development are the bad guys. Everyone else feels textbook from the franchise's main info). So what we have left is an idol-ish feature length story that feels way too generic compared to other idol animes out there.Which is a shame, because the story writing is what made Tokyo 7th sisters shine for me. Just go play the mobile game and read the stories in it. ""Episode 4.0 / 0.7 / 5.0 / 6.0"" arcs really made it special and emotional. Realy woth reading.Back to the movie, the other big problem is that the movie did not showcase the songs and shows as much as it should. I get it, there's hardly ever any 'show' aspects in the game (unlike almost every other music franchise nowadays), but the song selection are not highlighted as much as...you know...a movie focusing on music would.If you're already a Tokyo 7th Sisters fan, you'd still enjoy this movie (and the fact that it took SEVEN YEARS for any animated story to materialize). But I'm highly disappointed that this could have been the magnet that gives Tokyo 7th sisters the love and popularity that it deserves. Instead, this would probably become another idol movie that did not stand out against other movies of the same genre.If you never heard of Tokyo 7th sisters before, seriously go play the game, go discover the songs, go read the in-game story. you'd get to appreciate Tokyo 7th Sisters more than watching this movie.";Mixed Feelings
2;Tokyo 7th Sisters: Bokura wa Aozora ni Naru;HalRyder;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HalRyder;5;Tokyo 7th Sisters was originally launched as a game in Feburary 2014. To take things into perspective,1. Love Live Sunshine had not yet existed2. Idolmaster SideM and Million Live were still new3. Aikatsu was still in its original iteration4. The original Pripara was launching later that year5. Wake Up Girls was just been released,6. The likes of Ensemble Stars and Idolish7 will be coming out in the following year7. Bang Dream has yet to even be thought of as a conceptWhat possessed the producers to make an aged game into movie in this day and age, when we have had a new idol anime every season, is beyond me. What would have been decently interesting 6-7 years ago as an anime series has now found itself in a pool of saturation. Because of the market saturation, none of the characters that are on the big screen have shown any form of characteristics, with me just reminded of similar characters I have seen dozens of times from other idol series.Furthermore, the generic idol songs of the mid 2010s do not shine in today's environment, when many of the other series have much better soundtracks.The cherry on top is how old school the animation looks. Many idol anime predecessors have shown how amazing concert scenes can be. In the movie, it almost looks like this movie was made in, well, the mid 2010s, when this anime would have been considered decent.End of the day, this is certainly not a bad movie in any sense of the word, but too little has been done to make it stand out in today's saturated market, and it is saddening such a big name cannot delivery a better movie to its fans.;Mixed Feelings
0;Tokyo 7th Sisters: Bokura wa Aozora ni Naru;SnowballP;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SnowballP;3;"Not good.Since there are no reviews yet, I guess I'll fire the starting signal. As a big fan of idol/band anime, I was waiting for this movie to get subbed since it aired (many thanks to the team of translators), but I've been greatly disappointed. Disclaimer first, I'm not a fan of the original Tokyo 7th Sisters games and this has been my first real exposure to the franchise, so I won't be able to say how faithful to the original or how good as an adaptation this is, just judging it as a standalone film.This is probably the blandest and most insipid idol anime I have seen; even moreso than the first Love Live series, which is saying a lot. The fact that the opening act of the movie isn't even animated and just some SD models over music is already a redflag, and it never really picks up.We get introduced in a fairly cool way (via a relay race of video presentations) to the group of 12 idols, of which exactly 0 get any character presentation nor development after the initial establishment of the anime archetype they represent. The cheerful leader, the aloof dark-haired girl, the ojou, the gaijin, the lazy bum who really shouldn't be working as an idol realistically, and so on. Instead of developing the idols, it goes for iCarly level writing by introducing us to Badguy McYuppie, who confronts the girls a million times to laugh like a maniac, belittle idols, and tell them how worthless they are, and how he's buying their stadium and... converting it to... other type of business. How evil!It's the cheesiest and most boring route they could have taken, and they of course did it. I'm not opposed to these kinds of characters as a concept. I like Kuroi in the 2011 Idolmaster Anime because it was an over-the-top, ironical take on these kinds of villains. I like Mishiro in Cinderella Girls because her actions actually make sense for a capitalist tycoon and isn't really confrontational, same with Shiraki in Wake Up Girls. But this is just utterly stupid, and unlike my previous examples, it also takes up the entire plot neglecting what should be the focus of an idol anime (or almost any story really): its central cast.If you want to watch it for some cute dance scenes, I've got good and bad news. The good one is that every dance scene is animated on 2D. The bad one is that there... isn't really dance scenes. I'm not kidding, they show us two live shows and they consist on the girls staying on the initial spot and doing a basic move while singing. There isn't any choreography, nor cool camera shots that make what is happening stand out. It's almost impressive they pulled out on this too. There are some nice insert songs along the way that I'm sure T7S fans would appreciate, at the very least.My very low score of 3/10 might seem offputting or too harsh, but I really didn't find anything enjoyable in this film aside from character designs, and is not even remarkable in that sense. I really cannot recommend it to anybody, not even fans of the genre.";Not Recommended

0;Gekka Bijin;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;9;"Gekka Bijin (Maison Plaisir) manages to pull off something amazing. To put seemingly impossible themes together and do it well: Comedy/parody with BDSM. Not that they made BDSM funny, but rather there are BDSM parts to the story as well as comedic parodies without the dark aspects of rape, coerced sex, and sex slavery often associated with BDSM genres. Think ""Love Hina"" but with a BDSM theme. The whole approach is light-hearted, humorous, and pretty ingenious I think. But just because it's funny doesn't mean they don't take their bondage seriously. In fact Gakka Bijin is all about shibari mastery ( the art of Japanese bondage).STORY 8The story centers around Seiichi, a high school graduate who failed his college entrance exam twice and has moved in a dormitory to study in order to pass his next exam. He moves in with, not surprisingly, a cast of female characters and begins to discover some secrets about the dormitory and its tenants. Sound familiar? (ah hem... Love Hina)Unfortunately Gekka Bijin isn't a harem per say. Rather, it is a love story with some intruding characters based on shibari. Because of this, Seiichi works really hard on becoming a shibari master with the help of some hilarious side characters.CHARACTER 9Seiichi is not your avaerage lame half-assed male protagonist who can't make up his decision on which girls he want's to get with, nor is he a neurotic masochist with a chip on his shoulder that likes to abuse women. He approaches BDSM as a hobby, an art to be mastered, and also a way of... helping people?! Yes, it may come as a surprise, but people are actually helped by resolving issues through Seiichi's BDSM. LOL, now do you understand the awesomeness of Gekka Bijin?Miyuki, the landlady, is beautiful, polite, warm, gentle, and seemingly refined wife-material that any college reject would fall for. However, she's a widow with a secret taboo passion she once shared with her late husband. Now, with her husband gone, there's a void with in her. Well, needless to say, Seiichi helps her fill that void and saves her from darkness with his BDSM skills.There is Seiichi's step-mother whom he shared a past relationship with and his little step-sister who is infatuated with her ""onii-chan"". There are tensions between step-mother and daughter and, once again, Seiichi saves the day through his awesome bondage skills. ""My hero!""Then there's Kasumi, the ""cucumber-loving"" school girl with glasses, who has the good fortune of living in the next room to Seiichi. She is constantly disturbed from her studies by the moans and groans coming from next door.Although sex-wise, involves only the above mentioned, there are a cast of interesting and often hilarious side characters that help Seiichi on his path to shibari mastery.ART/ANIMATION/SOUND 8The characters are nicely designed and good looking with a late 90's feel to it. The art is good and the animations are smooth. I would say, sightly above average over all. There are not much repeating frames. The voice cast is right on when is comes to portraying the feel of the characters. There are no off beat sound FX. The overall production value seems to be on the high end like with a regular 26 episode anime of the same era.OVERALL ENJOYMENT 9For you perverts, there is a variety of play: piss/scat/enema, incest (non-blood related), loli, yuri, dildo play, and a lot of bondage. Although it is uncensored, which is a plus, I wished the sex scenes were a little longer. I found it to be short and sporadic (but hot) through out the 2 episode series. For that, the fap value of this hentai is not really all that high, which is a disappointment to some. But what sets it a part is it's unique plot and approach to what is usually a darker topic and actually made me laugh (in a good way). There are no bad feelings or open ended conclusions, and wraps up quite nicely where everyone is happy and content.";Recommended

Obviously, the secrets are X-rated, but I won't spoil them for you.Art and animation is pretty nice compared to all the other hentais out there. The depiction of the sexual scenes is pretty good overall, just like the drawings of the surroundings and the characters, per se.Sound is decent, enough as to be listened to, at least.Character development...

It's not that their stories are very believable, but hey, it's a hentai so let's not expect much!Overall, if you like hentai, you'll enjoy watching this series, at least for the sexual scenes (Uncensored, obviously).P.S.: For the producers, just because it's a hentai, it doesn't mean you don't have to come up with interesting stories!

1;Gekka Bijin;Sakurai_Aoi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sakurai_Aoi;8;"This is the first hentai I've watched completely. And honestly, it was kinda good. I love the BDSM and shibari theme and how they tie into the character's relationships and development. I particularly enjoyed the first episode. It was interesting to see how Miyuki changed from start to finish.Episode Two, as enjoyable as it was, had this really weird ""It's not incest but it almost is"" type of story. It goes back to delve into Seiichi's life a bit, which I appreciate, but some people would definitely find the way they fleshed out his character to be off-putting. I sure did...It also has some possibly surprising visuals that may literally act as a turn off for viewers. Then again, idk if it can be surprising considering that this is a hentai. Anyway, the series has a good combination of humor and sex. Matter of fact, it was the humor that made me keep watching. I initially felt that the themes and concepts they dealt with could've been expressed in a more tasteful manner. And...they certainly could have been. Part of me still wishes that they did things a little differently. However, the back and forth between humor and crazy kinky sex remained consistent throughout the show so I would assume that this was the tone they set out for.The art and animation are pretty much what you would expect from the early 2000s. (Both are fine, nothing spectacular.) The music is effective in the moment but not very memorable. The voice acting was well done but beware of the high pitched moans (if you aren't into that).Overall, it's a good, silly hentai that will definitely catch your attention in one way or another.";Mixed Feelings

Seriously, why hasn't Popolocrois been released to the US yet or broadcasted on some children's channel like NickToons or Cartoon Network yet?! If there's any children's anime that SERIOUSLY needs to be exported to the US and introduced to American children, Popolocrois is it! It's super cute while not going to the point of saccharine, it has engaging, funny, relatable characters, deep character study, a fun and simple yet deep and interesting story, heartwarming scenes, great musical numbers, and just an overall fun and whimsical tale of friendship and valor. Popolocrois is just the kind of anime that children really need to see! It's a great and fun tale full of whimsy, and it proves that children's shows can be wonderful, creative, and great with the right amount of effort put into it, and don't need to just be glorified toy advertisements. But I can see some small things that could easily prevent it from being a big hit with American children, but that doesn't make it any less awesome!If you can believe it, this anime is actually a sequel to the first video game. I have not played the video game, as it hasn't been released here! But I don't care! This anime may be a sequel, but it doesn't totally leave you in the dark about who's who and what's what. Anyway, the story's about a prince named Pietoro who, with his forest witch friend Narcia, meet a strange purple haired girl named Hyuu, who suddenly appeared because of the antics of the Demon King GamiGami. As it turns out, Hyuu is part of a supposedly dead race of people called the Wind Kind, and despite their attempts to befriend her and help her cope with the situation, Hyuu is frustrated and wants to know about the Wind Kind. Her bodyguards, Ston and Sanda, decide to steal Pietoro's dragon powers, which prompts Hyuu to join forces with GamiGami and try to become the queen of Popolocrois so she can find other wind people like her. This causes quite a lot of problems for Popolocrois and everyone in it, and she's constantly worrying whether everything she's doing is right.This was made in 1998, so of course the animation is going to have nineties written all over it, but for the most part, it's actually very well made. The colors are soft and muted, yet bright, the movements are fluid when they want to be, and when the situation calls for it, it can really set the mood. If you can believe, it was made by a brand new company back then. No, it wasn't Bones, it wasn't Sunrise, KyoAni, Gonzo, or anyone of that caliber. It was made by none other than Bee Train, who really was a new company back then, and this anime really showed what they were capable of. Yeah, the cutesy, chibi character designs can be very off-putting, especially if you think this anime's gonna be a saccharine fest, WHICH IT ISN'T! But then again, this style was prominent in the games as well, so don't think the character designers weren't faithful. I seem to find that I have a liking for the old style of animation as its very easy on the eyes with their soft, muted colors and occasional fuzziness.Now to sing praises about one really great part of the show: the music! The entire soundtrack fits the show to a T! The soft, dreamy tunes fit the moods perfectly, all the pieces are wonderfully composed with that sweet, pleasant nineties feel to it you'd find in most anime of the nineties, and the effects they can have on scenes are awesome! Plus, there's always a kind of whimsy in every single piece of background music. Even in the sad scenes there's something whimsical going on, and it doesn't hurt them one bit. Guess who composed the OST? Ko Otani. You may think you've never heard of him, but trust me. You've heard his work. This is the guy who did the OSTs for anime like Haibane Renmei, Outlaw Star, Gundam Wing, Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-, Shakugan no Shana 2nd Season, .Hack//Quantum, Eyeshield 21, Zatch Bell, Hyouge Mono, Hakuoki, Another, Deltora Quest, Pumpkin Scissors, and Blade of the Immortal. Some of you hardcore gamers may know him for his work on Shadow of the Colossus, Sky Odyssey, and Sengoku Basara 3, so this guy has a pretty good resume. Another great part of the OST are the songs. It's not often you see an actual insert song play in a majority of episodes, and musical numbers in anime are normally very uncommon aside from a concert scene, yet Popolocrois has musical numbers. I'll bet you're thinking they're just carbon copies of G3 My Little Pony songs that are cliche, dumb, annoying, and have no relevance to the story whatsoever. WRONG! The musical numbers have great orchestral music, wonderful singing, and fantastic animation, very much like the ones in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. They're pretty much the best songs I've ever heard.Next up is the second best thing about this show: the characters. You may think that, because the character designs are all cutesy and make the show look like its for kids only, that there's gonna be rehashed and reused character cliches like the main male character being an idiot hero or a spoiled brat, the love interest, and the clingy jealous girl who hates it when her male gets interested in any other girl, the shy girl who does nothing but worry about the main character, the stupid villain who wants to take over the world for stupid reasons, etc. Again, WRONG! Yes, they look like they could fall into every one of these stereotypes, but they don't! They all possess subtle but unique and awesome traits that most characters nowadays lack. Even the villains here are amazing, and the best of them is Demon King GamiGami, who is not only awesomely hilarious with his over-the-top hammy voice acting and his strange love for making weird mechas out of junk, but actually has much more motivation than just taking over the world and getting rid of Pietro. Every character is very likeable. Pietro, while a prince, is just like any other kid: sweet, kind, is a little impulsive but not in a bad way, and is a little short sighted at times. But when the going gets tough, he'll be willing to learn and improve himself for the better. Narcia, while just as sweet and nice, doesn't have a lot of confidence and often keeps to herself, but instead of blowing this out of proportion, she asks for advice and talks to whoever is willing to listen about her problems. By God, why can't more anime characters follow her example?! I will admit, however, that the only character I've had problems with is Hyuu. I don't hate her. In fact, I really like her (and she has the best insert song in the whole series), but...she is the most freaking selfish and indecisive character EVER! By God, every other episode she decides one thing and then changes her mind and does something else while constantly not seeing what her problem is! I'll let it slide this time because it pretty much drives the plot, and that she DOES explain her reasons for doing what she does, even if she doesn't solve them right away.I can't really seem to find any real flaws with this show, other than Hyuu's constant doubting and indecisiveness. But I do know that this show does have things that can really turn off other people, which may contribute to why it's so underrated and why it won't be able to be aired on American TV. For one thing, episodes 12 through 21 are mostly character focused episodes, which are awesome, though most people may find them to be pointless filler, and these episodes are anything BUT pointless, and they're rather slow paced, so one would have to be patient and appreciate what the episodes have to offer if they want to enjoy them. Secondly, GamiGami seems to love fanboying over Narcia like a kid with a crush. Yeah, an old man who crushes on a 12-year-old girl. It can be pretty easy to construe GamiGami's fanboying over Narcia as pedophilia, but he's everything BUT a pedophile. For one thing, he doesn't really go after her, and his fanboying is only taken to the extent of a child with a one-sided crush. He's much more honorable and noble than most anime villains. Plus, it's mostly played for laughs, so people shouldn't worry. Also, I get the feeling that people may think Narcia's alter ego, Kai, is an African-American and slam her with accusations of stereotyping just based on her portrayal, though in Popolocrois, there's no defining people by the color of their skin or the country they come from, so they really shouldn't be all paranoid (I haven't heard anything of the sort, but I think people would say stuff like this if Popolocrois did air on American television and if they're paranoid enough). That, and people may look away from it just because of the cutesy chibi character designs and the fact it's based on an RPG alone, which is a HUGE mistake, as a lot of people I know believe that Popolocrois is one of the best RPG adaptations ever, especially considering OTHER adaptations (Final Fantasy Unlimited). What also surprised me about Popolocrois is that it actually managed to subtly sneak some very suggestive things past the radar (NOT SEXUAL!!!), and no children's show I ever saw managed to address such an issue in that way despite its warm, innocent, and idealistic nature. I thought it was a pretty bold move. It's in episode 11, and believe me, you'll know the scenes when you see them. This is why I love Japan's kids shows, as they're not afraid to treat certain serious issues with the gravity they have in real life or sugarcoat them due to fear of parents complaining.So what if Popolocrois looks cutesy and is based on a video game? You guys are really missing out on this diamond of an anime. It's sweet, it's nice, it knows when the stakes are serious, it averts so many fantasy cliches, and it's just downright awesome! GO WATCH IT!!! Seriously, why hasn't this been broadcasted on Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network yet?! Would someone be so kind as to license it and dub it in English for fans to enjoy?! They deserve to watch this polished gem of an anime!!!;Recommended
1;Popolocrois Monogatari;masamvne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/masamvne;10;PoPoLoCrois Monogatari is a video game series I rarely see mentioned. It was initially released in Japan in 1995 (based on an earlier manga series, which I hear isn't very good), but was passed up for localisation in favour of Beyond the Beyond due to the latter's psuedo-3D battle engine, preferable over PoPoLoCrois' (albeit absolutely beautiful) 2D isometric sprite based play. It spawned numerous sequels, and the first two titles (as well as a specially made scenario) were eventually ported to the PSP and brought to the Western world. The two titles were heavily edited (over half the content was removed from the first game) due to Sony's completely illogical viewpoint of having 'shorter' 30-hour quests for their portable system (which I really cannot understand, at fucking all. Usually I'll see some logic in this kind of decision, but I really don't see any at all (yes, I'm extremely butthurt)). Despite being highly inferior to the original PS1 games, the PSP version is still a very good game for JRPG fans (if buggy and somewhat easy). Those who appreciate light-hearted children's fantasy are doubtless to fall in love with this game, as I have, as the games focus on the adventures of Pietro Pakapuka, Prince of PoPoLoCrois, as he attempts to save his mother's spirit from the ominous Ice Demon.Two anime series were also created: PoPoLoCrois Monogatari which takes place between the first PoPoLoCrois Monogatari game and PPLCMII, and PoPoLoCrois, which adapts the PlayStation 2 games that chronicle the adventure's of Pietro's son, Pinon. Whilst both are very good (the latter including some surprisingly dark moment), I feel the former is the better series - hell, I think it's a fucking masterpiece!PoPoLoCrois Monogatari tells the story of a mysterious girl named Hyuu who somehow appears on PoPoLoCrois. She soon befriend Pietro, and the majority of the series focuses on their relationship, how Hyuu copes with being in an unfamiliar world, and the mystery surrounded where she came from. The series starts out rather small-scale initially (despite a rather large opening, but grows to be almost an epic by its finale.Despite being a children's series, PoPoLoCrois Monogatari places a massive emphasis on character development, deeply exploring the thoughts and feelings of the main characters. So much emphasis is placed that the plot effectively stops half way through and then shifts into a series of stories and encounters that have no real bearing to the main plot but greatly develop the main characters, and the story does not pick up again properly until the last three or four episodes. Character development is done in a way that shows that the protagonists are still children yet does not trivialise or tone down the drama.The only real problem with the series is that the aforementioned plot-hiatus can make the show seem to drag out a little, but honestly I didn't find this detracting from the overall experience one bit.The series has great animation with a very unique (and pretty) artstyle, and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in anime. It is not required to play the games to enjoy the series, but you'll understand certain characters' relationships more and recognise references/callbacks to the first game. I'd highly recommend watching this series, it's quite tragic that it's so obscure despite being so fantastic.;Recommended

0;Popolocrois Monogatari;deep3anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/deep3anime;3;"Poplocrois monogatari starts with a prince Pietoro who was born to a Dragon mother and a Human. So he acquires power due to his dragon blood. He had a friend who is a fairy (born as a sprite and brought up as a witch with alternate personality Kai) name Narcia. Most of the time this young prince roams in the forest with Narcia. Accident created by Gami Gami Maou who considers himself as villain brings a wind clan girl named Hyuu, who steals indirectly dragon powers of Pietoro. Remaining story is getting it back.Characters: Most irritating characters are Hyuu and Pietoro because he forgives Hyuu's selfishness easily. Pietro is also selfish when he only chants name of Hyuu even after she brought calamity to his kingdom. I am surprised with His mother character who is the only pleasant one in the entire series.Entire series is worse than any fillers we have seen so far in any anime.This anime failed to explain lot of story behind why everyone sympathized with Hyuu though she is the EPITOME OF SELFISHNESS. The characters seem to be little kids then why is there romance element? Bizzareness is what i can ascribe to the plot. Pietro was considered to become strong when he returns from his ""journey"" by his fater. But i do not see where did he journey actually. He roamed in their kingdom forests only. Narcia is not supposed to roam in her form to distant places. But she accompanied him for certain areas. Pietro enjoys the company of Hyuu only ( most of the series shows it)The story is not worth watching as it is dragging and selfish story of Pietro who seems to double cross both the girls.BUT THE GOOD POINT OF THIS SERIES IS THAT THE USEFULNESS OF THE translation notes provided at the beginning of some of the episodes as these provide some understanding of Japanese language and culture. I learnt about goushiosama deshita for instance.This series might give some clarity to those who have played the parent story of it, RPG play station game.";Not Recommended

0;Pinky;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;7;Feels like a crack about the director's own upload history, but WHEW. I did not see that coming. The lovingly detailed gore foreshadowed only by the lovingly detailed way the loli girl's hair rustled while she worked on starting the chainsaw. Like, more than even the other extremely gory and explicitly zombie-themed shorts made by this person, this one feels like violence. Which, again, is an incredible achievement in making claymation feel like realism. Wow.I've seen most of what I care to of this director's works (Pussycat will be the finale for me), and they have a lot of great reasons to be proud of themself.

0;Pinky;Ouji_Kurai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ouji_Kurai;1;Spoilers Warning: That is if you care.I think I just stumbled across the biggest Anime abomination ever in my life. I mean, Shitcom and No Littering were stupid and hilarious, but Pinky...? To an extent, I'd probably call it one of the most gruesome, disturbing, and graphically dark ONAs that exist. Only reason you should watch this ONA is to probably have a blast (sarcasm) and be purposely disturbed by it. Or of course, just to fill in that completed anime list.Story is super quick. A guy and a girl have an idea of filming something, so then he starts filming, then she whoops out a chainsaw, and then the person she has that's tied is now getting mauled and chainsawed to death by her with her blood and intestines flying all over the place. Then they finish filming it, and then...Upload it on the internet...Yeah...Basically this ONA is the embodiment of insanity, twisted idea, and gruesome showing. Nothing much to be honest. This ONA is basically on the same level that you see in Robot Chicken or any other adult swim cartoon you see with it's blood splatting gruesome dark twisted scenes veiled with dark humor. One thing about this ONA is that it makes Goblin Slayer look like a kids show. Only 3 characters exist who have zero development whatsoever which is intended to be like that, and the basic sound effects, and only some air conditioning sound effect exists, and only 1 quick song plays at the very end of the credits which barely sounds like a song.Enjoyment? Well, if you like dark humor with sick twisted ideas and a rather disturbing watch. Then I guess this series would be for you. Otherwise, if you value your sanity, then stick to My Hero Academia and Black Clover. If you did watch this ONA already, then try and watch Umaru Chan or any other slice of comedy to cheer your mind up since you probably feel darked out already. Overall, a 1/10 Anime. If there was a 0 for the rating, then I'd probably give a 0/10. As expected lol.;Not Recommended
1;Pinky;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;I gave it a four(bad flick)no audio in terms of voiceStory is supposed to be a comedy and horror. Horror i will agree on. You do see a death but the death is quite tame and predictable. As for comedy? how? aside from the death the killer(s) depending on your view make there crime public. Is it comical because the killers have a dark scene of humor and are sharing it with like minded people? Going away from the story's genre choices to more on the story line what the fu(@? i mean seriously? i know the movie is a little over two minutes long but give the viewers an idea what is going on. How did the victim get there? why are the killer(s) sharing their work? is that a suit the girl is wearing or body paint? is one of the killer's mind that of a child? This art reeks of unanswered questions. The least the creator could have done is have a shot scene of a newspaper that might explain the backstory. Yet, they did not.Character: next to nothing for a back story can't really comment further.Sound: you heard a chainsaw big whoop!I could drone on but i will finish with a couple more sentences.

Just try to watch the first movie first even though it's not necessary.Having said that, WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD:HOLY SH- Without context of the first one I KEPT getting tricked by this movie! In the first 1/3 of the movie I shipped no-name guy with Verta just because I thought that what Verta was meant to do was understand her sister's will. Blanca loved a weak guy for his heart, and Verta resented this because her sister kept getting hurt. So when Simon appeared I was like: Yep, this is the plot isn't it? Cause you know, Simon: strong, kinda bad guy. And No-name guy: weak but sweet, heroic guy. Predictable enough?However I was wrong, the more time it passed the more I was convinced that no-name guy was Blanca and I needed to stop the shipping boat, BUT THEN UNO REVERSE Again.Suddenly no-name guy 'isn't' Blanca and is just wearing a mask.BUT OH NO, In the end HE IS BLANCA'S REINCARNATION.BRO WHY ARE YOU PLAYING WITH ME LIKE THAT. Why can't I ever predict Chinese movies? ( Disney is seriously way too predictive.

The story gets a bit violent on the second installment as the punishment starts heating up, and we see the girls undergoing their fair share of abuse. The overall animation style is fairly cheap, and not really all that well done; definite B-grade work. This also suffers from one of my big hentai pet peeves… body parts that are oddly colored (In this case it looks like all the males have beet-red genitalia).

0;Dengeki Oshioki Musume Gootaman R: Ai to Kanashimi no Final Battle;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;8;After seeing the first series of Gautaman, I knew I was destined to watch this sequel. Happily the final chapter has been subbed and I went into my viewing with some slight trepidation. The original had been surprisingly clever and entertaining, as inevitably sequels never seem to measure up. However this one does, even surpassing the original.The story picks up where the original left off. Mari continues the fight as Gautaman against Tobishima and Black Buddha. Both carry on a relationship with each other completely unaware that they are archrivals. The echii content is ramped up as the story features a lot more nudity, sexual humor, and yuri content, however you don’t ever feel like it’s been shown simply to titillate your hormones. Most of it is pretty humorous. There is not nearly the number of pop culture references in this story as the previous one, but the most notable and best one is from the final battle which features Mari doing battle with the Terminator.Now I am certainly not going to tell you that this is anime gold here. The story is silly, the humor is perverted, and most of the characters have the weight and substance of a marshmallow. Like its predecessor, Gautaman knows it’s ridiculous and silly and never does it try to be something more than it is. I mean seriously, it’s about a girl who smashes evil wearing a thong, with her ass. If you can’t find something to laugh at about that, you either don’t have a sense of humor or you just find anything echii distasteful.While the characters are not particularly deep, they are very likable. We aren’t shown any real new about any of the characters. However Mari and Saori still manage to be interesting. Mari's relationship with Tobishima and Saori are explored in greater detail but not really resolved satisfactorily. Though I can’t really hold it too much against the show because that’s not really what it’s about. Tobishima manages to become much more likable and perhaps tragic than he appeared in the first OVA. The cast is fairly small which works in its favor.Visually, while dated, I found its animation and art to be quite good. When compared to other series of this age it, like its prequel, holds up well. The battles were fun, and the parody of the Terminator at the end was great. There is very little music but the acting was good.Overall, Gautaman is sure to give everyone a few laughs. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and gave it the score I almost gave to the original series. If you enjoy slapstick and parody comedies then you should definitely have this little gem on your list.;Recommended

You thought Dark Vader was awesome? A Jotaro Kujo lookalike goes ORAORAORA on a building, levels it entirely with his fists, it explodes, and he then turns into the Terminator. You heard it here first.Story: 6As a continuation of Gautaman 1, it picks up right where the last one left off. That is, somewhere between Nobodygivesacrap Avenue and Whydoievencare Boulevard. There's a buttload of awkwardness in the form of a downright creepy love triangle, and one weird non ending that leaves you with a ""what even?"" reaction... much like the rest of Gautaman in general.Enjoyment and Overall: 8, 7What do I like about Gautaman? It's not pretentious. It ""knows"" it's stupid. It knows it's the butt of a lot of jokes. Gautaman doesn't care, it doesn't give a flying butt slam.

The enemies here are bland and they don't even attempt a joke for long portions of the run time.What has it been replaced by? Well, for one, there is more nudity and sexual content, and now it's presented for its own sake, annoying the portion of the audience that doesn't care about poorly-animated softcore porn from 1994.However, the largest difference is how much time is spent focusing on emotional melodrama, particularly a love triangle between Mari and Tobishima (secretly her archenemy) and the lesbian lust Mari's roommate Saori feels for her. Throughout these nauseating scenes, which occupy far more time than the fights, the anime treats itself dead seriously, and genuinely expects viewers to buy into its romances.This, from an anime featuring tentacle rape monsters in its first few minutes, including Mari being violated by an octopus in a pose similar to Hokusai's ""Dream of the Fisherman's Wife"";https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Hokusai_The_Dream_of_the_Fisherman's_Wife.jpgSince they've abandoned the humor and colorful enemies and techniques, what we're left with is a really crappy, stupid romance mixed with equally lousy softcore porn. Watch the original, but avoid this disappointing trash.";Not Recommended

0;Jigoku Sensei Nube OVA;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;8;"Its recommended to watch the anime first as the OVA takes place after key events of the series. Episodes 1 & 2 feel like extended Nube episodes, however Episode 3 has the feel of a movie.As expected of OVA series, the animation is of higher quality which is more noticeable in the prologue & some scenes. The same goes for the OST being new & performed by Masamichi Amano whose done soundtracks for several OVAs, however the biggest highlight is the last episode which will be explained in more detail down below.Episode 1: Students have been disappearing around campus which is the act of a ghost that hides in the walls. Nube is nearly captured by the ghost as he extracts his soul in the form of a boy Together with his students, Nube must regain his body, save the children, & exorcise this phantom. Overall alright episode as it displays the affection the students have for their teacher Nube.Episode 2: A young ghost girl enters the dreams of Nube's students in which they must listen to complicated instructions on a path to find her harmonica, however if one takes the wrong path, they'll forever rest in peace. The story behind this OVA is a very creepy one but manages to deliver a heartwarming ending as Nube discovers the grief behind this girl.Episode 3: THIS IS THE BEST ONE!! A demon named Zekki has come from the 6th level of Hell in order to rescue his brother Baki from Nube's seal. Meanwhile Nube's seal is getting weaker as Hell itself will soon feast itself on Earth. The animation for this episode is very unique as it almost resembles a different studio even though it's still animated by Toei. The character designs have more of a ""pop"" to them as their hairstyles, color & detail seem more ""movie exclusive"". Interesting thing about this OVA is that it really resembles a Go Nagai series as the author & artist of Hell Teacher Nube were inspired by Devilman among other series. With its near perfect blend of comedy & horror, certainly gives this episode a Go Nagai vibe along with delivering as something you won't see in the anime. There isn't that much violence but certainly feels more like a dark battle shonen with the great animation of demon battles.Overall, this OVA series is great with the final episode being the perfect way to end it.";Recommended
0;Wu Geng Ji Zhi Tianqi;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;Wu Geng Ji Season 2 is a training arc.Season 2 Recap (Spoilers)Wu Geng leaves the treacherous blood stone mines after meeting with his Grandfather. In Season 2, we are introduced to a lot of different concepts. Wu Geng finally joins with the hidden gods tribe, a once prosperous village of gods that rejected the corrupt way of Tian. After getting repeatedly attacked, their numbers dwindle forcing Wu Geng to fight Shi Xing - a masochistic Great god of ferocious affiliation. Wu Geng is captured by Shi Xing and is sent to prison at Ghost City, a former flourishing desert City plagued by the High Priestess due to Shi Xing's former affection with humans. It is at Ghost City where Wu Geng reunites with his Uncle Zi Yu to fight against Shi XIng on the night of the blood tribute. After defeating Shi Xing, Wu Geng and gang head to reunite with Bai Cai and the hidden gods tribe. Bai Cai meets an unexpected guest in the afterlife who helps her soul reunite with her body after protecting Wu Geng from Zhui Ri's lightning attribute attacks. The Dark ones, a warrior race that fled into the underworld one hundred thousand years ago by ancient gods join the fight and teach Bai Cai some attack and defense abilities. The climax of the season happens as Wu Geng finishes his qi cultivation on Phantom Island, an island that fauna and flora rely on qi to survive. The High Priestess and Tian Kui make an appearance to eradicate the remnants of the hidden gods tribe which gets sabotaged when the dark ones, a reawakened phoenix-fused Shi XIng and finally Wu Geng appear.Story: 3/10The story is vast and very entertaining yet the execution is very bad. Imagine watching almost 2 hours of fighting between Shi Xing and Wu Geng (and eventually Zi Yu) only to have Shi Xing come back as a good guy. The series loves to drag on fight scenes to the point where it's just bland colorful sword auras and monochrome filters. The fight scenes are still back and forth where Wu Geng is on the edge of death but somehow is rescued but still fights again until he's on the edge of death and he's saved by his enemy only to fight again and again. The fight scenes really like to test my patience. This happens again when Zhui Ri is tasked with killing Wu Geng but somehow lets him live because his unrequited love sacrifices her life to protect him, even going as far as to give up his life essence to revive her. Doesn't make any sense.Art & Sound: 5/10- No Comment -Character: 4/10Character development was probably ok. A lot happened in terms of characters being established, developed and removed in season 2. The reawakening of the phoenix and Shi Xing was pretty good and even introducing the dark ones to the remnants of fallen gods tribe. Also seeing the social hierarchy of gods at the end, when Tian is in slumber the High Priestess takes authority but when the High Priestess is incapacitated, the elders take authority. Even going as far as mobilizing what seems to be the royal guards/law enforcement of the gods. Apart from that, everything else is just there to establish the characters.Overall: 4/10I was excited for this but was let down because of dragged out fight scenes and terribly slow plot progression.;Not Recommended

0;Ojousama Sousamou;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;3;"When you think of great character design and artwork two of the studios you might think of almost immediately are Gainax and Studio 4°C. So it’s a bit amazing to me that artistically, Debutante Detective Corps turned out to be one of the most horrible looking turds I have seen to date. I guess even the best have to start somewhere.Given Debutante's title I am not sure what I was expecting, but regardless of what it was I certainly didn’t get it. Nothing about the story or the title make a lot of sense. Obviously this was a title given by the English dubbing studio and it’s really only the beginning of this epic fail abortion of an anime.Our story starts with our five heroines entering the scene in spastic, silly, and unnecessarily flashy manners. We are given brief bios of the quintet and you better read it because that’s all the character ""development"" and background story you’re going to get on any of them. They are all fabulously wealthy girls and apparently are being threatened by a mysterious organization. So of course the police, instead of taking our spoiled bitches to some place secure like um, the police station maybe, they take them to a completely unsecure high school where they end up just locking them up in the principal’s office. Of course despite the school being blanketed but literally hundreds of armed officers in riot gear our three villains do manage to get inside the school where predictable, over the top, silly, and retarded action ensues.Nothing about the story works. The comedy doesn’t because it relies mainly on having some sort of emotional investment in the characters. Given the shortness of the OVA this is practically an impossible task. Once the revelation is made at the end as too who is behind the attack, you’re likely to either explode into a howling laughter at its stupidity or face palm. Or perhaps both. Obviously that this was meant as a pilot episode for a potential series. It’s not shocking at all that this was never picked up. At least someone with some sense and good judgment realized how god awful the concept was and thus the world was saved from the potential of a full season of this garbage.The characters are standard 90s clichés. You have every kind of ""action"" girl in the cast. The Chinese martial arts master, the Russian big guns girl, the explosives expert, the master of disguise, and the psychic master of magic’s. In addition we are treated to the usual tsundere, moe, and bratty personality types displayed in every other anime ever made. There is nothing extraordinary or memorable about any of them and honestly you will have a tough time just remembering their names let alone anything about them. The villains and supporting characters are equally stale and stupid.Artistically this is about as bad as I have ever seen. The style is typical of the era of which I am not a fan of at all but even for the 90s this is epically horrible work. It’s really shocking to me too when you consider the studios involved in its production. For me it’s really difficult to imagine how anyone ever thought this looked good. The sound and music score are as drab and uninteresting as the animation. The lack of a decent story makes it impossible for any talent level of seiyuu to give a good performance.If you’re considering watching this because of the studios involved in its production like I did, don’t. You will be disappointed. Debutante Detective Corps is best left to the dustbin of history. I am sure those who made it would also wish you forget it exists too.";Not Recommended

2;Ojousama Sousamou;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;1;"Overview:All anime fans know that Gainax has produced some of the most influential and beloved anime of all time, but every studio has made a few mistakes right? What was the worst Gainax anime ever? The answer to that question: Debutante Detective Corp!This anime is clearly supposed to be a Charlie's Angels ripoff about an international cast of hot girls with varied skills solving mysteries and kicking ass. The problem is that it is one of the most incompetent, horribly directed, pieces of shit I have ever seen. The only laughs come not from the comedy, but from the GOD AWFUL ""engrish"" that permeates almost every scene of this anime. In other words, the only parts that are enjoyable are completely unintentional.I'm just going to describe the first scene to this piece of shit and you will know immediately if you want to watch it or not!A highschool meeting is taking place with the principal welcoming the incoming freshman class. Suddenly, a blatant ripoff of the song ""Jump"" by Van Halen starts playing. Then a girl on a motor cycle smashes through the large stained glass window that looks like it belongs in an old European cathedral rather than a Japanese highschool and we the viewers are treated to a wall of text that makes our jaws drop! “Miyuki Ayanokouji come from Tokyo with specialty mechanic. The ups and downs of emotion are drastic and it flights easily in straight for wardness. The homelike surface that is good at cooking is surprising!” Miyuki then asks in a California Valley Girl accent, ""Sorry...like...am I late or something?""Just when you are trying to recover from laughter, a second girl smashes through the door of the school with a bicycle and we get another hilarious text wall. “Reika Syu come from Hong kong with the specialty of fighter. A Chinese merchant abroad daughter. It is raised by grandparents the cause of Chinese Mafia tightened from the childish time. Though it is lively and active, it has the bad habit of dose in fant regression. Food is liked very much!”Then a Mercedes Benz smashes through the wall of the school and we get another outrageous text with bad grammar and a questionable world view from the director of this shit. ""“Yoko Ryuzaki come from Yokohama with the specialty disguise. Quarter the German noble that a grandmother is rumored with the illegitimate illegitimate Child of Adolf Hitler descended. As descendent of Hitler her justice is strong and the period drama which punishes advice evil is liked very much by the honest”.A few seconds later a 4th girl smashes through the ceiling after jumping out of a helicopter that explodes for no reason! She lands on the principal and possibly kills him. We are treated to the following data. ""Nina Kirov come from New York with specialty GUN MANIA! The descendent of Russian descendent Romanov dynasty. Parents are big wealthy persons of the mystery what parents are romping about in the world. She himself is military mania of the ULTIMATE.""Finally our last girl arrives with a totally unexplained, massive police escort. Of course another horrible engrish text is inevitable at this point. ""Kimiko Ayanokouji come from Tokyo with the specialty Super ability. The successor daughter of financial combine an old peer descended. The genius type of the intelligence 200 is calm and it is cold it is cold when it is cut off from unusual character!""Now that our cast is assembled, our adventure is ready to begin...for the five people left in the audience who haven't fled from the sheer idiocy and ineptitude of this shitty echii series.Holy shit! I have seen poorly directed anime before, but the fact that someone at ADV films looked at this and decided to bring it over to the US for an English dub just blows my mind. There are legitimately great anime that have yet to receive an English dub, but THIS gets picked up! WTF was ADV thinking?! No wonder they went out of business!";Not Recommended

On a side note, the animation quality and artwork isn't even that bad, too bad they do nothing with that and keep it really boring.Honestly the only parts I enjoyed was when Akiyuki Shinbo, director Madoka Magica and Monogatari, showed off his signature style where he uses weird framing and composition as well as a unique color palette but those parts were really short and rare.;Not Recommended
4;Ojousama Sousamou;Randomnameo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Randomnameo;3;"This reminds me of that ""sequel"" of Beauty of the Beast that was actually a bunch of failed pilot episodes for a tv show that never was and that were, instead, put together as a movie in order for Disney to profit out of them, after all. In case you don't get what I am talking about, this is a pilot for a tv show that Gainax never ended up making but was released as an OVA in order for the company to make money out of it, anyway. At least ""Belle's Magical World"" hits the movie lenght mark, this anime, on the other hand, is just 20 something minutes long. But hey, is it at least one of those failed pilots that is worth searching for and paying for because it really had the potencial to be great? NOPE. The plot is non sensical, the characters are annoying and devoid of any uniqueness, the jokes are not funny and you can tell that the people who worked on it got sick to work on it during its production. The plot is basically this, 5 rich, annoying school girls must be guarded because they are targeted by some terrorists who want to kidnap them and collect their parents money(whom we never see, by the way). But because they are stupid bitches they want to drive all the police away, then what do you know, the people who targeted them show up and ""hillarity"" ensues(not really). One thing that can be worse than an unfunny comedy is an unfunny comedy that makes it obvious nobody was interesed into working on it. Speaking of which, the guy that directed fucking Madoka Magica was the director. Guess he started out really low and it shows that he didn't enjoy starting this low.";Not Recommended
0;Beyblade Burst Dynamite Battle;ultimategamer95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ultimategamer95;7;"Felt like I should actually make a quick review for this one, since it's the finale of the Burst anime and all, and it just ended. Yeah... I'm still pretty emotional over it inside tbh, it's been quite the ride. Really wish there was a season 7 coming, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be. May as well go over each thing quickly...SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE CHARACTER SECTION BTWArt:No comment. It's just the Beyblade Burst art; nothing bad, nothing special.Sound:My second least favourite Japanese Burst opening personally (that's not to say I don't like it, because I do honestly), only beaten out by GT's (rewatched a bit of that season not too long ago and still hate that theme... luckily the English dub one is an absolute banger). Nothing really else to comment on OST wise really... can't even remember if there is much else in relation, but it's just basic background stuff if so really.(New) Characters:Bell is honestly a pretty loveable MC imo. Defintely a huge improvement over the Asahi twins, that's for sure. He just likes his fun, and seems like a cool dude to hang out with. Really like his growth and development throughout the season tbh, feels kinda more realistic the route they went with it, over him winning everything. Well... his win/loss ratio is kinda all over the place, let's just say. And I know it's easy to hate on the MC losing a lot but... yeah (I admit even I got frustrated sometimes, but hey, it's less cliche). You get used to it. And hey, as long as the battles are entertaining, right?Basara: Cool character, cool friend to Bell. Just wish he didn't get the short end of the stick with Bahamut... Seems like that's always been the case with Bahamut users though, except maybe... Blind from season 4 (yes, he lost everytime, but at least he was skilled). Cool design I guess too.Ranzo: AMIGO! Just another Kiyama brother. Lame battler, but I found him to be a cool dude. Way better than Ranjiro imo at least.Illya... I remember being really excited for when she was first introduced, but she turned out to be quite the cocky one, which was kinda annoying at points. Didn't really have many battles after the Lui arc either (and then mostly lost anyway), which was a bit of a waste. DID really like her design, however, looks pretty nice. I just wish she was an actual strong and maybe nicer personality wise blader, tbh (or at least from the start... took her until like 2/3 way through the show to mature). Oh yeah, and I definitely ship her with Basara (you'll see why later on).Rashad: A DECENT final antagonist, I suppose (though not really a villain). Found the Valkrie copy stuff a bit lame at times tbh, but kinda got used to it. Felt better once he actually got his own Bey though later on. Seems like a really cool dude to hang out with. Could've been written off a little better at the end though imo, but I won't complain, since it didn't affect me that much.Phenomeno: Final villain of the series and was wasted imo. Watch and you'll see why, but UGH... He kinda just... leaves the show once his defeat happens, and I'm still angry about it. I genuinely wanted to see more of him after Bell's final battle with him, honestly. Seemed like a really cool dude after that fight. And honestly, I still think he was a fun character before that, despite him being a ""ripoff"" of you know who. ...I'm legit never gonna forgive them for wasting him that hard.Enjoyment:Won't beat around the bush about it, it's Beyblade, my favourite anime franchise (yeah, I said it), love it until I die.One quick thing I do wanna complain about is the ending though... I do feel like it was a bit rushed due to the little amount of episodes they had left to finish, but that's just me. Mainly due to the villain stuff and... I'm pretty disappointed they didn't show as more or the legends as they could of in the final episode/ending sequence. Sorry, just felt like ranting about that real quick there. Let's move on.Overall: 7/10. And I know that contradicts what I said in the enjoyment section but... we're considering all factors here. In terms of enjoyment alone though, it is my favourite show, yes.Anyways, *ahem*... As I said at the start of this, it really has been a ride, and I genuinely am going to miss watching a new episode every Friday. Burst has been a joy to sit through from start to finish imho. Not sure if I like it as much as the OG or Metal series, but it's still great. Looking very forward to seeing what the next generation of Beyblade has in store though!... in probably like a decade or so, if anything.But yeah, that's all from me. Thanks :)";Recommended

0;Shikatte Ingo: Misaki Shunin no Buka Kyouiku-hen;BloodHedgehog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BloodHedgehog;3;"Well where to start off...this is my first ever review on MAL...which makes it ironic it's for a H-Anime but I digress. That being said...despite it being H-Anime I came into this thinking it would be actually decent as far as H-Anime are concerned....but was I wrong. So I guess I'll rate each ""category"" for this particular H-Anime and then give my reasoning behind each rating. So let's start off with...Story - 1/10Story? There was absolutely no story. If it were possible to actually give a 0 rating, I would. The minimal information you get from the first and only episode is that one of Rei's employees is really not doing well at work. So what does this busty attractive boss decide to do? Why screw him of course lol. The story pretty much goes out the window within the first minute along with Rei's clothing...which is pretty sad.Art - 6/10Surprisingly the art was actually pretty good, in fact the GIFs on Gelbooru actually did this H-Anime more justice in terms of animation than the H-Anime itself did...which is just as sad as the lack of story. For the most part the art and animation was really nice...then there were points where the ""good"" animation just went poof and we were left with....poorly animated breasts that flapped all over the place. Not to mention that the only ""good"" art and animation stemmed from Rei herself. Everything else including the ""man"" she was screwing were horrid. I will give the animators credit though...instead of making the guy white and his penis some weird color...they made everything about him a weird color lol.Sound - 8/10Beyond everything I've said so far...the sound has to have been the best part going for this H-Anime and I'm not joking. Everything from Junko's (the seiyuu of Rei) general voice to her moans and reactions to what was happening to Rei were spot on. My only complaint...is that her voice was the ONLY voice in the entire episode. The guy who seems to remain nameless has no voice though Rei acts as though he responds to her. Honestly I actually thought at one point this ""man"" was dead lol. The music or at least background noise wasn't anything great.Enjoyment - 3/10What can I say...anyone who watches a H-Anime is clearly watching it so they can ""fap fap fap fap"". Sadly you aren't really given the opportunity to do so. Each ""scene"" is fairly short and fades to black and then changes to another scene that it feels hard to even get into any of the scenes at all. It sorta reminded me of a piece of H-Anime revolving around Tifa...but that felt better to watch than this.Overall - 3/10Overall, it's poor piece of anime with only two things making it bareble to watch being the art and animation as well as the sound or I should say voice of Junko. But if you want to watch a dominant female boss with huge breasts get screwed by a voiceless nameless guy for about 17 or 18 minutes then watch it. But it's not something I'd recommend to people I know...not that I know many people who'd watch H-Anime to begin with.";Not Recommended

One of those where all the sweepers come together to fight some world renown creature. It's exactly what you'd expect: visuals have been upped a little, plot is a bit tighter and more epic, etc. It still has many of the recurring jokes from the series.The plot is pretty standard: there's an even more eviler vampire lord and Mikami's desire for money results in her fighting it. I would have liked a bit more effectiveness from the other sweepers. They all get about one good move in at some point and that's it.

1;GS Mikami: Gokuraku Daisakusen!!;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;7;"Being the only movie for the Ghost Sweeper Mikami series, its'a good one which serves best as introduction for people to watch the anime.The story for the film focuses on the revival of Nosferatu who has assassinated & acted as Oda Nobunaga. Essentially, the goal of the movie is like any other shonen series being defeat the bad guy & his minions. While this Mikami features offers a bit more action than the anime, it still delivers on its comedy which is a good thing.One of the highlights of the film is the animation increase as it displayed a few good visual pieces during the zombie infection & Mikami's battle against Nosferatu spider minion. It is also a bit more bloody than usual but no to the point where it makes a giant shift in tone like in ""The Slayers"". My only complaint to the movie is that it doesn't involve the other characters such as Dr. Chaos, Maria, Emi, etc in a more productive role as their scenes are brief but worth watching.The English dub was performed by Manga Entertainment which comes off as okay (makes me curious how the popularity of this series would be if the whole anime was dubbed). As a another note, the soundtrack for the English version is changed with some tracks resembling covers of the original OST or being more fast beat themes to hype up the action(Similar to Bruce Falconer & Manga's release of Fist Of The North Star). The music is good but doesn't have that variety that the anime series has. On the subject of music I believe the ending song of the film is called ""My Jolly Days"" by Masami Ouki.Overall, the comedy is perfect & the additional action is a nice treat for the fans but doesn't offer too much variety among other anime films, but it's definitely good with its unique qualities being the characters & its sense of humor. Hopefully this film can get some more exposure as this feature should get people interested to watching the anime & reading the manga.";Recommended

This is one of those times! This is a shitty echii dubbed by early ADV and translated in the style of Ghost Stories and Samurai Pizza Cats by Matt Greenfield. It also features the talents of certain voice actor that take this piece of shit from merely amusing to absolutely amazing!Plot:Dragon Knight is the story of a wandering hero who gets caught trying to steal food from a royal palace. In order to escape punishment, he must go on a quest to rescue a harem of beautiful women being held in a nearby castle. The plot is...minimalist to say the least. This is a 30 minute hentai based on a 1980s erotic PC game. Yes...there were erotic PC games in the 1980s with Chip's Challenge/ Oregon Trail graphics. Gotta get that sweet Apple 2 graphics pussy!Characters:The only character of note is our perverted hero named Takeru, who is voiced by God's gift to Mankind: Doug ""The Golden Boy"" Smith. The early days of English dubbing were...rough to say the least. That's why I love those old actors who saved otherwise bad anime with amazing performances. Doug Smith was one of those rare VAs who could make ANYTHING watchable. He belongs in the old anime Hall of Fame along with Mark Gatha, Allen Wenger, Carter Cathcart, Rik Nagel, and all the rest.Art:This is a 30 minute hentai made by Studio Wombat. If you think the art and animation is going to be good, you should be slapped.Overall:This is a terrible echii, but a pretty amazing early anime comedy. If you want a Ghost Stories echii series with an amazing voice cast, then you can join me in enjoying this buried treasure!";Not Recommended

Otherwise the plot might be a bit confusing and fast.I don't know much about Hijikata's life, but I could follow the OVA quite well. The plot progressed fast, but not too fast. The info texts between the events were very useful, especially with time skips.The art style was okay, when considering the length (and probably short budget). The animation worked, though I think the overall style is a bit too simplistic. I did like the fact that the characters were clearly distinguishable, and especially Souji's facial expressions worked well.I would have liked to see this in more detail, with more time, and with more emphasis on the characters and their thoughts. As a sketch of Hijikata's life this works, but it could have had more time to let us know the characters.;Mixed Feelings

0;Slow Step;Master10K;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Master10K;6;All of life’s trivial quarrels can be solved with a simple bet. Well that seems to be the motto, this terribly old-fashioned anime follows. If you’re not into sports anime where there’s always something trivial at stake then it’s best to steer clear of this one.Slow Step is yet another Sports, Drama from the legendary mangaka Mitsuru Adachi. A man known for creating the classic sports manga Touch, which spawn a hefty number of anime adaptations. This time round the sport of choice is softball, where Nakasato Minatsu is the ace of her High School’s softball team. I would go into how it follows the classic sports drama formula (the underdog team) but in Slow Step the real story lies in the Romantic, Comedy side of things. In the beginning it’s already established that Nakasato is sort of seeing her childhood friend however by some weird circumstances she ends up in a love triangle. Well I say weird because the root of this love triangle dilemma is none other than one of the most widely used clichés (mistaken identity) and from there this series, which initially showed so much promise, gradually diminishes into something far less enjoyable. Not only that but when things sort of become a love pentagon, hexagon, whatever… chances are you’ll stop caring about the outcome.I wouldn’t really blame anyone for not caring about the romantic outcome, since the characters range from a bunch of immature selfish kids to some really old-fashioned adults. I understand that this was based in the 80’s but when the only appealing character is a typical delinquent student, then that’s saying something.The art style also reflects the time period it was based on, with stubby appearances and bean shaped heads. At times it does show off some great animation, especially during the games, but these moments are few and far in between. Same can be said about the soundtrack, there were a few good tunes here and there but they’re just a few of them and the same old ones were constantly repeated.Overall just like the titles says, Slow Step is slow in advancing its romantic plot and any real advancement is due to the sports side of things, where it all comes down to a simple bet. The sports element was interesting, especially when it also went into boxing but don’t expect anything on the level of Hajime no Ippo. With that said, this turned out to be an unsatisfactory anime. Even with five 45min episodes, absolutely nothing was resolved but keep in mind that I didn’t find it a completely wasteful experience.;Mixed Feelings

If you've seen every show, movie, special, etc. that is rated higher than this, then I can only congratulate you.This music video might seem silly to some people, but that's because they don't see the bigger picture. In an oppressive and patriarchal society, the main protagonist, Garou, is an aspiring dancer, but thanks to the oligarchs that run the film & entertainment industry, also with the assistance of many of the world's largest oil producers like BP and Shell, all discos, nightclubs and dancing facilities were destroyed. It took many sacrifices to get to where she is, and thanks to the power of friendship and plot armor, she succeeds in living her dream and is now able to get her PHD in Feminist Dance Theory. Given what's happening in today's society, this hidden gem of a music video is a portrayal of what we need to do right now, and that is for all of us to unite as one in order to stamp out sexism and to destroy capitalism in order to help out minorities and transgender people.Some people would argue that this is some good shit, some might even equate watching this to losing their virginity, others might question their existence and regret watching this in the first place.I'll be nice and give it a 2, as there are a few shows that are a whole lot worse.;Not Recommended

Seeing that it came out before the anime aired it was some kind of promotional material to coax people to watch the show. If that's the case it failed, badly.If I was to guess I would assume it's styled to be a parody but it lacks any context and aside from the odd character design it isn't funny or interesting.I kind of wish I knew who the producer was because I want to ask them if they intended to make this and if so why or if they were just told at gunpoint to throw something together.;Not Recommended

0;Kingyo Chuuihou!;OrdinaryOddity;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OrdinaryOddity;8;Goldfish Warning is beyond pleasant!Every aspect of this show exudes cuteness.Even if you haven’t heard of GW before, you've certainly heard of the staff's subsequent endeavour Sailor Moon. GW sports the same design sensibilities and craftsmanship as Sailor Moon, making it one of the best looking anime of its ilk.Every individual scene is enjoyable in its own right, even without context, because the visuals are so outstanding. Just looking at the visuals makes me feel good.Beautiful watercolour backgrounds, with a soft pastel palette that are often swapped out abruptly with much harsher colours for comedic emphasis. An effect that is heightened when used in combination with abstract backgrounds that implement a paper crafts look, with crayon, marker, chalk and paper cutouts.The characters are just as important to the look of the show, with highly expressive animation that shifts between art styles on a dime, greatly contributing to the show's comedy.The main cast is relatively small, with a handful of principal characters and about as many secondary characters, but there is never a dull moment because the cast bounces off each other so well.Background classmates also have distinct character designs to help flesh out the setting though they rarely if ever shift out of their chibi/SD designs, emphasizing how inconsequential they are by literally taking up less of the screen.The comedy of GW is rooted in the personalities/interactions/animation of its characters, energetic vocal performances, sight gags, cartoon visuals and fast paced editing. On occasion, GW also uses reference as comedy but those scenes still function for unaware audience members.GW is highly digestible, with 2 episodic segments per episode. However, these segments possess continuity and past events are referenced.What more can I say? If you're looking for a good time, this is it!;Recommended

They really need something else in them to keep viewers entertained. Majokko Tsukune-chan has that.StorySimple enough to keep up with. Really it's not the overall story that's any good. It's how the anime goes about the story that I found really enjoyable. Rather than helping people Tsukune manages to make things worse for most. She means well, but doesn't seem to realize that her magic actually causes disaster for most people. This actually turns out to be very enjoyable, and kept me laughing from start to finish. Not to mention some of the things in this anime were pretty demented.Art/SoundI really liked the art. I liked how cartoon-ish it looked. Though, if chibi-ness isn't your thing stay away . . . far away. Sound was fine, nothing else I can think of to say about it.CharacterThe main character, Tsukune, is a delight from start to finish.

1;Majokko Tsukune-chan;Anise_Punter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anise_Punter;7;"Tsukune-Chan is a kind-hearted witch who goes around trying to assist people in trouble. To put it nicely, she does not do a very good job of it, and often leaves the situation worse than when she arrived, usually with multiple fatalities. This is played for laughs.The art style is highly reminiscent of 2x2 Shinobuden, except without the fanservice, so that's a plus. Often, the art would switch into a purposely low-budget appearance to add to the surreality of it. Trading out Rie Kugimiya for Haruko Momoi is a wash. Both have the kind of voice that just makes me want to throttle something. I've never heard of any of the other seiyuu.As for the comedy, well, I had to invent the ""Crack is a hell of a drug"" tag for this one (and promptly tagged six other shows with it). It's nuts. Half of the jokes have nothing to do with anything, and the other half of the jokes are gallows humor. Women are stalked. People are implied to be pedophiles. People are killed by grenades, getting sniped, explosive sneezes, falling off buildings, drowning in oil, other massive explosions, and getting eaten by sharks and dinosaurs. All played for laughs. I appreciated it. The author had to be on crack cocaine when he/she was coming up with this thing.The Christmas story was by far the most awesome part of the show. Words cannot express how preposterous it was.All in all, I'm sure I would have found it funnier if I wasn't in such a poor mood to begin with, but a grade just under a 7 will suffice. Can I recommend this to people? If you like absurdist humor (if you liked Bobobo for example) and can put up with the voice of Anise Tatlin, then sure.

2;Majokko Tsukune-chan;Fujaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fujaku;7;Majokko Tsukune-chan is a 6-episode (technically three as each episode is half-length) comedy directed by Sakurai Hiroaki who did Daa! Daa! Daa!, Kaichou wa Maid-sama, and Kodocha. It also has a storyboard by the famed comedy director Daichi Akitarou, the guy behind Fruits Basket, Kamisama Hajimemashita, Kodocha (again), and Now and Then, Here and There (which isn't a comedy, but hey, it's still famed). It is a comedy that tells the misadventures of a witch called Tsukune-chan and her daily life with all of her friends.Due to the fact that Majokko Tsukune-Chan is a comedy, fans of action and plot would call it boring, as besides comedy there isn't much to offer. There is no story to speak of, and little continuity between the skits in each episodes. Stuff blows up, but then, a minute later, everything is fine! (expect Tsukune's little mascot thing, which dies in the first skit and remains dead throughout the whole show) However, as a comedy, Tsukune-chan does what it wants to do and it does it well. Tsukune-chan constantly gets herself into absurd situations, like in one skit she becomes Santa's reindeer. Then Devil Santa kills regular Santa, and a scientist makes Mecha Santa to deliver the presents. Okay, maybe that sounds really dumb on paper, but it works, trust me. The humor of this show is rather dark typically, and is very snarky. Our main character, Tsukune-chan, is typically always happy and optimistic and seems to be oblivious to the ways everything is messed up in this show, but she is snarky too when she wants to and is the best character of the show. There's also several side-characters, like the goofy Mr. Mayor, the “rival” witch character, and several other members of the cast. The show manages to be goofy enough to be funny, but doesn't fully rely on random comedy and rarely repeats jokes. It rarely gets boring, with perhaps one skit as an expectation.Animation and sound... The show skimps a bit. The animation is very poor, with really simple character designs and not much movement. Backgrounds are typically very cartoonish. Now, Tsukune-chan is a comedy so it doesn't need to have good animation, but still. What music there is is very relaxing, though it reuses tracks too often and has a full-length opening and ending theme despite its shorter episode length.Majokko Tsukune-chan Final ConsensusStory: Entertaining comedy- 8.Characters: Really good bunch of unique, wacky characters-8.Art: Poor- 5.Sound- Reuses tracks too much-7.Overall I give Majokko Tsukune-chan a rating of 7, and a recommendation to watch it.

0;Mahou no Yousei Persia;mathemagican;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mathemagican;8;"Imagine for second that you are 11 years old again and your fantasy world is the free African savannah, open and free, full of love, and the only thing you can possibly think about is about what fun adventures are around the corner. Then out of nowhere, society calls and tells you its time to take your first step towards adulthood. You wake up, and the dream is gone, but you remember the dream, but its time to get dressed and go to school and be part of society. In a very metaphorical sense, this is the narrative introduction to Persia's character.Persia takes her fantasy with her and goes on a new journey, this time to understand what this mystical and obscure idea known as Love means. Through the comedic framing we the audience are pulled into this world view without rules into Persia's worldview to take that first step with her into a new chapter of life. Mahou no Yousei Persia is a coming of age story, setting it apart from (at least as ive seen, i have not seen every magical girl pre Persia, though I have sampled many) the Magical girls that came before. Where Minky Momo considered what dreams meant and Majokko Meg wondered if there was good in humanity, Perisa looks inwards to find meaning in something inherently opaque to common understanding. I found this analysis of Persia to be very well constructed, even as it twists through the episodic comedy of Persia's episode count, and at the end, Persia learns to let go and accept whats outside her control. This journey is most directly explored at the series mid point and concluded at the end, but between episode 22 and 45, Persia constantly grapples with different forms of Love, deepening the thematic message the Show writers wanted to convey, and I found this to be a wonderful use of the show's runtime, whether thats a Yoyoko's love for her parents, Goutou's love for a nostalgic memory, locked in a single sepia photo, Kishin's love of photography, or Kenji's love for a girl who disappeared from his life never to return.Persia herself is an almost addictive character, with Tominaga Miina's incredible voice performance. Her antics are constantly fun and when the tone calls for it, emotionally gripping. Shes simple and earnest and wild, but grows more empathetic as the show progresses. The show uses its comedy brilliantly; I laughed a lot, but the show writers use the aesthetic of the episode to set the tone with expertise. I especially love a scene in episode 20 where Persia transformed as Fairy walks through an empty city street in the rain, her child form reflecting in the building window, all soaked in somber blues, yet complimenting both Fairy and Persia in their moment of solitude.I do think the OP/ED change was a clear negative, especially given how important the first OP is to Persia's core character arc with Kenji. In universe, the first OP was written by Kenji as a ballad to his previously mentioned lost love. It just doesnt add anything for me, and the song and visuals are distinctly worse.Mahou no Yousei Persia is a well crafted introspective series that pulls you into persia's worldview with a brilliant and convincing audio visual aesthetic, and im so glad I watched this show.";Recommended
0;Mahou no Yousei Persia;Estefan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Estefan;6;"I recently finished watching this and I thought I could try writing a review.Story:I found the overarching story, as written in the synopsis, rather uninteresting. Most single episodes don't make much of a reference to it, with some exceptions. It happens when the heroine seriously screws up or if other characters (the 3 green little minions or Kenji) have business with the Love Dream land.The single episodes were of mixed quallity. I found some quite moving, like the ones with Kenji or the story of the old foto from Persia's grandfather. Others were rather forgettable (at least I forgot them).Art:Backgrounds: Didn't see anything bad or good at the backgrounds, so they are mediocre (5) I guess.Character designs: Persia was cute, Tota (a chubby classmate) not so much. But anyway, most characters were given distinctive looks that respond to their personalities. Exception are the fraternal twins, which I kept confusing despite the different hair color (was it again the brown haired or the black haired one in whom Persia and Yoyoko were interested?). 7 for character designs I say, so 6 for the art section.Sound:It didn't annoy me, so fair (6) is the score.Characters (this will be the longest part):Heroine: She is generally a good hearted girl, who wants to make people happy. I guess that's what most magical girls want to do. Sometimes, she makes mistakes, or tries to use her powers for selfish wishes. This either doesn't work, or it backfires badly (at one occasion when she consciously does something evil).At the beginning, she seems to be unbeatable in brawling and running in her normal form. However, as I watched the series, it seemed to me that she tries to pick the fights she can win. If she can't win, her running skill can be useful - or not, for example, one time she tries to run from some gangsters and crashes into a wall. However, in most cases, or if she can't win or run, she solves the problems by devising a plan. The execution of this plan generally involves her adult form. In adult form, she can assume the ability of any professional, from model to computer programmer.I liked the heroine, she generally wants the best, but also has some flaws, and she is not stupid.Now to the heroines companions. There are 3 little green creatures, which Persia received when she got her powers. They are annoying, and cause more trouble than they are worth.Simba, once a lion and the king of the savannah, got turned into a whiny house cat and lives now in Japan with the heroine. If anything, I just feel pity for him.The heroine's closer social environment: I already mentioned the twins. They live in the house of Persia's grandfather. One is active in the student council, the other does sports. Both looked just like friendly and boring model students.She has some classmates, who wouldn't call themselves Persia's ""friends"" I think, but with whom she hangs out a lot. Yoyoko considers herself as Persia's rival in love regarding one of the twins. The two girls often pick fights early in the series, but this changes at one point, after which Persia tries her best to come to good terms with Yoyoko. There is a reason for that I guess (but I shouldn't spoil here)... The chemistry between the 2 was interesting.Norinobu is the self proclaimed investigative reporter in Persia's class. He soon suspects something regarding Persia and stalks her eventually. His attempts, failures and the heroine's management of the situations were fun to watch.Not much is said about Persias parents. They appear in every episode, but they just seem to have the parent role. Rather boring types.The heroine's grandfather has a backstory and own interests. His fate is somewhat connected to Persia's. He is one of the more interesting characters in this series.Other characters: A lot of more or less interesting people come and go in the series.I found Kenji remarkable, a musician whose appearance reminded me of John Lennon. He has his own, more personal relation to the Love Dream land.Enjoyment:Despite the generally good characters, I found it partially tedious. Quite often, familiar elements seem to be repeated. Some episodes were boring, some good, so a 6 is sort of a compromise as a score.If you are in the magical girls genre and have some time to kill, go ahead.";Mixed Feelings
0;Sweet Valerian;Freida5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Freida5;5;"""Release serotonin! Overflow Dopamine! Glug Glug Glug! Relaxation Squad Valerian has arrived!""Sweet Valerian is a bright, cutsey show very reminiscent of powerpuff girls.The art is adorable with everyone being chibified and the main heroines transforming into super rabbits. The action scenes aren't that complex though. I gave it a high score because I really liked the character designs and the few instances of weirdly drawn characters thrown in. The music matches the show, with appropriately cheerful and upbeat tunes.The main drawback of the show is that each episode is only three minutes long. The story for a majority of the episodes are ""person gets turned into a monster by the stress squad, Valerians defeated it."" The characters are pretty one note, even though we get at least one episode dedicated to learning about them. These character's read emotionally flat as well. Their reactions to things seem muted, and the fact that their mouths are so small make their faces hard to read. A good attempt at making a diverse and interesting team, but lack of development hampers it from being great.Overall, it's an action comedy that delivers on smiles and warm fuzzy feelings. If you have an hour and want to watch a solid kid's shows, then give it a try.";Mixed Feelings
1;Sweet Valerian;chubar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/chubar;6;"The first impressions I had about this anime was going to be a slice of life type (since CLAMP love doing those along with romances) with some extremely basic themes as the art design seemed really simple, cute, and heartwarming. With only 18 episodes (plus 8 specials), I’d figure this wouldn’t take me very long to finish anyway.“Sweet Valerian” is really cute and it’s really simple. The entire length of an episode is actually three minutes long, enough time for things to happen and the Valariens to take down the monster but if there is a plot to have it’s simply about this: monsters are created by a super stress gun that detects the highest amount of stress and the Valerians use their powers to find a way to destress, or rather, relax the victim.There is an origin story – the girls were going about their daily lives but realized that life would be a lot easier if they had a moped. So one passes them by and they were each inspired to go get a moped license when they get stopped by a mysterious looking custodian (who’s really Panda-bu, the sidekick and the one who lets the girls know when there’s danger in the city called Asianland City). Soon, they’re led in a secret room where they meet someone called the Ear Hermit.After some training, the girls eventually get something “Valerian License” which is what transforms them into cute, adorable bunnies.All of that, in three minutes, no less! The art is really simple and cute but the animation isn’t very impressive, it’s pretty average. The music in the anime itself is very relaxing and fits with the theme with the story – which is about relaxing even thought here’s so much stress in people’s lives.All in all, it says exactly what’s on the tin box, especially within the three minute time-span; but despite all the mediocrity of this anime, and the extremely simple plot and the time span, the comedy in the series isn’t bad at all. Sure, there’s a lot of cultural jokes that may fly over especially western viewers’ heads but the other jokes are actually pretty funny. The monsters have creative designs and even though Kanoko always tries to talk to them at first, she always loses her temper immediately.Would this series be better as a regular 23-24 minute episode series? Maybe not. The whole idea of this show is to relax and not let everyday stress build up with something charming and sweet.If there’s anything to compare this to, “Sweet Valerian” is like a snack: it’s good to sit down and enjoy it, but if you eat too much, you’ll spoil your dinner.(Part of Project Magic!!)";Mixed Feelings
0;Ginga no Uo Ursa Minor Blue;HybridMedia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HybridMedia;8;This 20-minute anime short comes from Tamura Shigeru, an animator/manga artist, who has worked in several animated works including The Glassy Ocean and Phantasmagoria and has contributed to the defunct manga magazine Garo. For me, finding the information on the director and this anime is pretty obscure and I couldn’t find more info on him but hopefully, the little info I gotten might help this.Here’s the plot in a nutshell: This adventurous story of a boy named Uri and an old man takes place in the cosmic Milky Way where the starfish live. This is the tale of their fantasy journey in search of the mysterious monster fish. Yuri discovers a new star near Ursa Minor. Further observation of the newly found celestial body lets his grandfather witness the transformation of the constellation into a diabolic looking fish swimming up the Milky Way. It's up to Yuri and his grandfather to stop all the destruction this monstrous fish is causing.Now, the only two main characters or the ones worth talking about is, obviously, Uri and his grandfather and to sum them up, they are straight-forward simple and was simple as they are, they didn’t need any more characterization. There isn’t any deep dialogue between the two of them but they do have a purpose throughout the short and weren’t just faffing about nothing. The same thing can be said about the story, too. It is a very straight-forward and simple story with no unnecessary filler or idiocy.The animation reminds me a bit of the old TinTin cartoon that was on HBO and maybe the comics, too, but I have no recollection of that and it is very non-traditional Japanese animation (i.e., back to surreal style anime) and at first, it did look a bit cheap but cheap doesn’t mean it will be bad and sometimes the basics and simplicity do work out in your favor and I think I said this too many times but it can work out if it’s done right. Really, how many times have I said that during my reviews? The music, I really didn’t pay much attention to, but it does play like a 16-bit RPG game but not much of a stand-out.FINAL VERDICT: This short does the simplest style of animation, story, characters and music but sometimes using what you got to make the best anime short doesn’t make you cheap. It’s simple but it is a good anime short to watch.Would I recommend this to you? Yes, I would.;Recommended
0;Shokuzai no Kyoushitsu;Erodude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Erodude;5;"Whoa. Just...whoa.Classroom of Atonement is a very, very odd hentai, and I don't think I mean that in a good way. The animation is really underwhelming, the sound is nothing to write home about, making this kinda fail as erotica. The characters and plot seem a little reminiscent of School Days, except this is ACTUALLY a hentai. I should mention I didn't like School Days, so I do NOT mean that in a good way.CoA follows our leading lady, Nanase, as she gets raped repeatedly (as atonement) because her dad is a murderer.""Wait, what?"" you say? Nope, it's exactly what it says on the tin. Rape, rape, one consensual sex scene out of nowhere, and more rape. Sometimes other girls get raped, too, because they're concerned about Nanase and/or nearby. Yeah. That's it.I can't tell what CoA is trying to say about anything, and I don't attribute this to excellently artistic ambiguity. Is it saying that children are responsible for their parents' crimes? Is it saying that sinfulness is inescapably heritable? Is it saying that eye-for-an-eye punishment is a good method of justice? Or is it showing us the aftermath of these attitudes as a warning not to accept them? It's hard to tell, because the presentation is just so bad.For one, the art has not aged well. CoA is an exercise in dynamic panning, which does not work nowadays, especially in hentai. So anyways, as such, there's a lot of still art, which goes off-model very, very often. I'm not entirely sure there WERE models. The colors are dreary, although not in an X TV sort of way where it's intentionally nearly grayscale. Overall, CoA is nothing much to look at. This goes for the sex as well, the seximatography of which is bland.The sound was, well, for the most part not there. The voice acting was okay. I can't even remember any of the music or anything about the sound effects, not even during sex, when I usually pay attention. As said before, CoA has a bad presentation, and there's really little way to get around that.The characters aren't much, either. Most of them (read: non-main) have so little personality that I honestly couldn't understand WHY they'd do such things. Cookie-cutter is the very best I could say about them, and that's a stretch. Not that humanizing rapists is necessarily a good thing. After all, that might make the viewers, GASP, think!Nanase, the main heroine, is somewhat intriguing in how she deals with the stress of being assaulted and her own feelings of guilt, whether about her father's crime or about her own predicament, for which, of course, she is entirely unresponsible. How realistic you think her reactions are might make all the difference. In my opinion, episode 2 developments didn't quite take things the way I expected, which is to say I became a bit skeptical of her character.There's one other interesting character, whom I shall call The Organizer, who facilitates but doesn't participate in any of the rapes. He's also the one who guilt-trips Nanase all the time. A lot of my interest in CoA came from wanting to know what was up with him. Come the end of episode 2, we find out. I was not hugely impressed.The story is largely intertwined with the character development of Nanase, and, as mentioned earlier, it basically revolves around her getting raped and wondering why she has to atone for anything and/or feeling guilty about just about everything. This is kinda hard to watch, unsurprisingly. It's partly because Nanase ends up walking the line between starting to like getting raped and just plain shutting down emotionally. This is a bit awkward, because that's the line between typical rape-based erotica and something psychologically dark, and those two types of stories are meant to produce very different feelings in the viewers. And, since CoA walks this line with approximately the same grace as a drunken pit bull trying to chase a runaway tennis ball, we don't get a complex, deep, and titillating piece of cinema. No, what we get is bad hentai.And yet, for all this ranting about how bad it is, I've not totally bomb-rated it. Why? Well, despite how cumbersome it is about it, CoA brings up a number of philosophical questions, as well as presenting what might be a realistic portrayal of a repeated-rape-victim's mindset. It's gripping, in a way, and I can imagine some viewers finding it very interesting.Regardless, however, CoA fails as erotica, which means it's hard to recommend it to anyone. I mean, what would I ask? ""Hey, do you want to witness the psychological deterioration of a girl who is explicitly raped and guilt-tripped about both it and other things in her life that aren't her fault?"" Not exactly going to grab many viewers, I'd say. Oh well.";Mixed Feelings
0;Shokuzai no Kyoushitsu;SiekoValantin;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SiekoValantin;2;"Art is as crap as you would expect. The characters are just as plain as you would expect, and the twist isn't really even a twist, it's just a stupid explanation. They have the classic rapid fire way of speaking that anime does, if not faster. And they also have the classic 'Fade to black' hentai scream that signifies that whatever they were saying 'No' to happened anyways, the character is either about to climax, be climaxed in, or has discovered some terrible, traumatizing information that they just cannot believe.This is not a spoiler, it's in the title, but I don't like the idea that people want us to believe that no reasonable person in the whole school caught wind of the assault going on, involving several victims, and called the police?There is so much wrong with the plot that I can't even.

0;Konchuu Monogatari Minashigo Hutch;petran79;https://myanimelist.net/profile/petran79;8;"It is difficult to review a series like Hutch the Honeybee. One has to consider that in Europe and America the series was heavily edited with almost 1/3rd of the episodes missing. Only 65 episodes were broadcast, yet instead of concluding the first series finale, they added on top of it episodes from the 1974 series too, changing it and making it less dramatic.In Europe series had another problem. Maya the Bee was already super popular since the 70s-80s and Hutch was shown in the mid-90s. Despite being older than Maya the Bee, there was no way it could hope to surpass it in popularity, despite featuring even more episodes than Maya. Add also the edits, the later arrival and this series seemed like an inferior copy of Maya and was not as well remembered. Btw the Japanese voice actress of Aya in the second series was also the voice of Maya the Bee!Irony is that first season of Maya the Bee in Europe was also heavily edited, despite featuring less violence and drama than Hutch, thought some scenes were very tense or emotional too.Not a great era for freedom of expression on TV....A review based on the Japanese unedited version will have to scrap the anime most remember in their childhood, making it necessary to rewatch it in its entirety. This also does away with the feeling of nostalgia, because I review it as an adultFirst let me add some facts:I got the mux of the Italian dub. Series contained 91 episodes. I counted how many episodes did not include a dub: 31!31 episodes were edited out of a 91 episodes series, more than 1/3rd! Though I noticed some episodes not translated to Italian, had an Arabic dub.All episodes are sad and serious for a kids series but in this case they had to omit the episodes with the more controversial topics.Though this was not the sole reason. In some cases there was a continuity issue where an episode showed excerpts from a cut episode, so there was no way they could dub it.This affects the background story of a major side character later on, since one episode devotes some background info on him.Some other cut episodes include content that would have caused quite a reaction on European and American TV.-kids and adults beating the elderly-a son killing his father-girls and boys that become friends with Hutch, die-parents dying in front of their children-children dying in front of their parents-mc sometimes becoming too violent himself-boy hitting his father-characters getting tortured or dying while working as slaves-a girl getting beaten and robbed, yet she lies in order to protect the guy that did this to her.-predatory birds dying a violent death due to electrocution-genocide mainly caused by human intervention, eg pesticides, child insect collectors, road work, pollution, bags made out of insects etc-an insect child, successor to the throne, getting born with mental disability because of a prank-bees revering a bee keeper as their god, even showing their angel souls rising up-a mother torturing her fragile and bullied child to make it tough-in one episode I noticed that the dub toned down the voices of some wasps that were heard to be eaten by spiders. In the original, actors screamed with all their might, making it more similar to a horror movie!1974 series has some cruel episodes too, especially in the beginning, though series is not as good, lasting only 26 episodes and with a rushed ending too. Introducing a rival there did not work out as well.Overall it would have been an emotional rollercoaster for a child to watch such a cruel series. Even as an adult I had to shut off my emotions in many cases. This was simply too much.One reason such a series would never be shown today, especially in its entirety.To the particulars:(Animation,design, art):for a 1970s series and with so many episodes, they had to make some concessions to everything. Character design though is very good and charming, never failing to win the viewers sympathy. Even as an adult I liked some of the characters. As a child that loved insects, I'd have adored it. 1974 series is significantly better in that department, though with less episodes. But one has to take into account that they tried to portray the various birds, some insects, animals (dogs, cats, rats, moles, bats etc), snakes, and lizard predators as realistically as they could.Music, sfx, dialogue:This is what makes the series shine. This has to be one of the best 70s series in that regard. All dialogues are full of expression and transfer the character's suffering to the viewer, both old and young. Music is also very touching and dramatic where need...bee. It can become lyrical too, like it happened with many 70s kids series. Sfx are well taken care off. The predators especially the birds have their own distinct creaks and they even added cicadas and the sounds of human tools are also heard. You can hear the background sfx like crickets at night too.Story:With very few exceptions, most episodes are standalone. Despite the big number of 91 episodes, very few were boring or uninteresting. Every episode had something new to offer and as one would expect, most would end up in a dramatic or tragic way. No setting remains static, character travels through various places, interacting with the insect world and experiencing the cruelty both from insects, humans and other animals. In the end series gets a proper conclusion. One reason I thought the sequel was really unnecessary, still it was decent so as not to ruin the first series.Characters:MC is Hutch, his mother and later his sister Aya. In the sequel they also add a ladybug and a rival, a wasp boy. Still I preferred the fewer character of the first series. I liked Hutch because unlike other kids series, he is by no mean perfect. He has his shortcomings and occasionally is revengeful and laughs with the suffering of others. Yet in the end he always manages to reconcile with others and himself via all the suffering and cruelty. I think this is the most important lesson the series gives and it was so tragically edited and changed in the dub.Overall:I would recommend the series, problem is to whom.-Viewers of the old edited series will want to remember it as they saw it, without many tragic scenes and a different ending, although the true one. A better alternative would be to watch other Tatsunoko series like Demetan or Pinocchio, since they at least remained unedited in the dubs.-Kids? It is way too heavy, tragic and serious for kids today and so out of touch with today's cartoons and anime. Plus that design and animation will seem too crude. For older cartoons, Mr Bug goes to Town is a much better option and of course the obvious choice, Maya the Bee, that is far less violent but only in the second season.Best option would be the first ""documentary"" , the 1920s movie of Maya the Bee with real insects!-Viewers interested in old Japanese animation without edits? Only in this case will I recommend it. Notice that so far those episodes are untranslated and will likely remain so for a long time.Series served its purpose showing the 70s kids about the toughness and cruelty characters had to face, mainly with Hutch but also with Demetan the Frog. Yet in the end they always had hope and looked forward. In a sense Hutch, unlike Demetan, came far too late, almost 20 years later. TV landscape had changed and it was one reason this shock factor would not work out, hence it was edited.If you want to see what is the difference between a Japanese and an American or European kids series, you have just to look for the first series of Hutch the Honeybee.";Recommended
0;Yomigaeru Sora: Rescue Wings - Saigo no Shigoto;SimsHsia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SimsHsia;8;* This is my first review, so please excuse any errors I've made.** In case you're watching Ureshii's subs, for some reason they didn't translate the ranks so I've added them in parenthesis as a guide/reference.***This DVD-only episode titled The Last Mission takes place roughly 3 years before 2nd Lieutenant (sani) Uchida Kazuhiro is assigned into the Komatsu Air Rescue Unit, from February 12th to March 1st, 2003. The episode focuses on the then Chief Master Sergeant (souchou) Motomura Hiroshi who was Komatsu's lead rescue medic. You'll notice in the TV series that he has since been promoted to become the squad's Warrant Officer (juni).I feel that this episode was a touching concluding episode for the series as it goes into detail about the past of Motomura and how he met Major (sansa) Shuujirou Hongo, which I found as a surprising coincidence. The major event that occurs in this episode is Motomura's last rescue mission before resigning as a medic. The rescue mission is different from the ones seen in the TV series, it's not a disaster-type rescue but more of one of those milder rescues. The rescue holds a value of importance to Motomura which you'll see why near the end of the episode.Overall animation is the same as the TV series, including the CGI graphics and is still nicely animated. This episode features only an ending theme, the same one from the TV series but a slightly different cut of the song.If you watched the entire TV series, you might as well watch this special just for completion sake. For, you, the random visitor who happens upon this review and haven't watched the TV series (yet!) you should really consider giving the entire series a shot.;Recommended

So he does what any other “normal”, straight guy would do: he fcks her.He eats her out, gets sucked off, goes in virginally, anally, tries some bondage. At first the girl doesn’t understand what’s happening. She doesn’t know why she’s so horny or what sex is. So at first she doesn’t enjoy it but then gets really into it and starts moving on her own. She starts to act weird, her head spins 360°. Her head pops off.Now here’s the twist: she’s an alien robot made to monitor human sexual behavior.Two naked humanoid aliens come down to the apartment and rape the guy. End. I love it.The thing about this guy is, like the guy from Fairy Forest Remi-chan, he starts off as being a pretty normal guy but as the hentai goes on these guys evolve into sick perverts.This hentai shares the same producer: Adult Source Media.Same plot: a guy discovers a naked girl, has rough sex with her and there’s a twist ending.I rate this as very good particularly for the ending.;Recommended
0;Harumi-chan no Oita;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;3;Harumi-chan No Oita is one of those hentai that is decent in itself, but the production quality really hurt it. If the audio and art where at the quality they were intended to be, I would easily raise the score to a 5 or 6.The art was okay in Harumi-chan for when it came out, but there are chunks of time where there's no background and they are just surround by a solid background color or gradient. The animation also isn't very smooth and suffers from some quality issues you see from this time.Now the worst part of this hentai and what really killed its score was the sound, which I would have given a one but you can tell that some sort of quality was there before its release or dvd. The first thing I noticed that was awful was the sound effects, usually hentai aren't known for always having the best sound effects or at least natural sounding ones. However this one takes it to another level have poor quality, one that stood out right away was when the girls is masturbating at the beginning it sounds like someone making sounds with their mouth and not a girl playing with herself, which was kind of off putting. Then throughout the episode there is sound clipping, static, and cut outs in the audio that just make it frustrating to watch.Overall I wanted to enjoy it more since the story and sex scenes were fairly solid, but the audio and lazy background art really hurt it. Which leaves me unable to recommend it to anyone to watch, unless you want to see what bad audio looks/sounds like in a hentai.;Not Recommended
0;Ninja Mono;Arboria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arboria;7;So there's some ninjas and about half of them are girls and most of those girls are cute. There's some slashing and some gags and a few cool fight scenes. This is one of those things, pretty common with OVAs where it's like if you're looking for something entertaining to occupy an hour of your life this will do the job. There's nothing that particularly stands out about this one, which is fine because that means there's nothing that really makes it bad. I think the final fight in the second episode is pretty cool and was definitely more than I was expecting, you probably won't be disappointed.I've said it before and I'll say it again. When it comes to 80s/90s action OVAs, it's like, just watch it. Worst case scenario you waste an hour of your life which I'm sure you already do plenty.

0;Ninja Mono;jyagan0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jyagan0;6;A rather bizarre combination of bloody violence and cutesy teenage girl ninjas that just doesn't quite work. One character in this anime has no problem hunting down and killing an apparently innocent bear for sport, but turns out to be deathly afraid of . . . frogs. It's too violent for little kids but also too annoyingly cute for adults. Might work for 12 year old's. Includes a PG-13 hot springs scene. I thought it was a good experience to say the least. But the fact that the series isn't continued really is a downer on a good thing. It seems that the man who produced/directed(I don't really know) also produced/directed the first Tenchi Muyo. Well, he's dead. He died after making the 3rd episode of this and the 13(?) episode of Tenchi Muyo. This is why there isn't an end to either Ninja cadets nor the first Tenchi Muyo. If the series had at least been continued it would have been better. But these 3 episodes leave you wanting more, which there isn't.;Mixed Feelings
0;Sin in the Rain;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;1;Esta review también está en español.There are some people who like to search for the unknown, the not so popular stuff, just for the sake of find something new. I'm one of those, of course. Find something good and forgotten (or directly, unknown) is pretty neat... but for that, you have to dig a lot. And while digging up among the weirdest animes you could imagine (such as Twilight of the Cockroaches and Toshi Densetsu Monogatari Hikiko), I found Sin in the Rain. I usually give the verdict at the end of the review, but I'll make an exception today:DON'T WATCH THIS. IT DOESN'T WORTH IT.But why I say such thing, and why I give a 1 to the final score (two traits almost exclusive for trolls)? Well...The story of this OVA is interesting at least: a girl named Kimura is wandering around the town, very confused, and with a hazy memory. Later, she remembers: her mentor died in a suspicious way, and she fears that the police is after her. Luckily, the detective Takamizawa is willing to help her.The animation is not bad. Not outstanding or anything, but it does the work. Same with the sound (the dective's seiyuu is Keiji Fujiwara, aka Leorio in Hunter x Hunter 2011 and Hughes in FMA).Then, whats the problem with SitR? It's quite simple, actually: there's no conclusion. It was supposed to have more episodes, but apparently, Mook Animation (the studio responsible of this OVA) broke before the whole project could be finished. So, there's no ending. That's a shame, because Sin in the Rain look at least interesting, and it ended being just a waste of time.So, this review is more a warning than anything else: don't waste your time with this. It just not worth it... at least now, that you know that the whole thing is an aborted project. There's no sense in watching something that has no end.--------A algunas personas nos gusta adentrarnos en lo desconocido, en lo no tan popular, como para salirnos de la rutina. Nada más satisfactorio que encontrar, o redescubrir, algo olvidado! Escarbando entre los animes más raros, uno se encuentra de todo... y fue, obviamente, de esa forma que llegue a Sin in the Rain. Voy a dar mi veredicto ahora mismo:NO VEAN ESTO, NO VALE LA PENA. Esa oración resume lo que pienso de SitR.Por qué? Bueno...La historia de esta OVA es interesante como mínimo: una chica llamada Kimura se encuentra confundida, vagando por la ciudad. Más tarde recuerda: su mentora murió de forma sospechosa, y teme que la policía está detrás de ella. Por suerte, el detective Takamizawa está dispuesto a ayudarla.A nivel técnico no está mal, tanto animación como sonido, sin ser espectaculares, cumplen correctamente (la voz del detective la pone Keiji Fujiwara, o sea, Leorio en Hunter x Hunter 2011 y Hughes en FMA).Entonces, cual es el problema de SitR? Es muy simple, no tiene conclusión. Se suponía que iba a haber más capítulos, pero, según parece, Mook Animation (los responsables de esta OVA) quebró antes de poder terminar el proyecto. Una lástima, porque lo que prometía como algo al menos interesante, termino siendo solo una pérdida de tiempo.Así que esta review es más una advertencia que otra cosa: no pierdan su tiempo con Sin in the Rain. Simplemente, no vale la pena... o mejor dicho, no tiene sentido que vean algo que no tiene final.También, vea bien, lector de MAL: muy probablemente, esta sea el único 1 no troll que usted verá en esta web.

At once there is a question: ""Already end?""Ideal epigraph to this roller is poem of Vladimir Vishnevsky ""Oh, as the sofa came to an end suddenly"". Probably, founders didn't have enough money for continuation shooting. It is a pity. The quite good series could turn out. However the first and unique episode simply breaks. It is not open ending. It is not ending at all. I do not recommend to look: only frustration. (Itself looked casually: I thought that there will be an integral short thriller). Fiasco...A monotonous anime based on exclusively human's feelings. Plus a little detective. The picture is subject, but incomplete and compressed. Characters are interesting. But aren't opened almost. The viewer sees any sincere throwings, but gradually starts to miss, for can't understand, from where they appeared in a plot … Posing is pleased. It is quite realistic. And it is qualitative. OST’s … Partly faceless, however, as well as an anime. But all create the same mood.P.S. Whether did really money suffice? Maybe founders wanted to leave mysteriousness that we reflected and presented how to be developed events further. I think that. I will not be surprised, if the guy, who wrote the letter to the main character, appears the murderer. It is only guesses and as everything will occur further to solve only to you.";Not Recommended

0;Gang-aji Ttong;ManlyTears;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ManlyTears;9;Doggy poo is a very heartwarming story, and from the low rating I feel like I have to defend this anime. I would compare this to Clannad After Story because of the way the child was abandoned and the touching story.First of all this anime is very different and although silly this is a very original story. It follows the life of an abandoned pile of poop. You basically experience its life and prejudice.I feel like there is a lot of metaphor in this about today's society and racism. Everyone treats poo differently which is very depressing. There is a lot of imagery in this and I recommend this for intelligent and sophisticated people.The art is claymation, it is not very high quality I admit but it gets the job done. For the most part, everything is detailed.There is little sound but I highly recommend the dubbed version which can be found on youtube.Characters are the strongest point in this series. There are many characters introduced with very distinct personality. There is not much background developed but you will experience many different types of personalities.I really enjoyed this movie, don't let the title and content mislead you, I was shedding manly tears by the end of this.;Recommended
1;Gang-aji Ttong;starsonia913;https://myanimelist.net/profile/starsonia913;9;I must say, I think the bad ratings really don't show the true anime.Story: 7I would give it an 8 or 9 if there was more action to it, but what action could you give to a pile of dog poop.Art: 7It's not bad, It's just not regular anime art. It's clay models. Still though, the scenery isn't half baked or incomplete. It looks as if they actually put time and effort into it.Sound: 8You can hear the wind rustling the leaves and the laughter and footsteps of the children. They could put more, but it was enough to understand.Character: 9The the poop wanted was to be worth something. He didn't change much, but he got to learn that he was worth something.Overall: 9A few minor flaws and things, but this anime is truly an interesting one. I honestly couldn't compare it to any other because of the original plot and idea. I feel like this is a metaphor for raceisim. It is slightly religious, because it mentions god, but that's not very important to the story itself. It is an amazing story and really deserves some good ratings. One of my favorites!;Recommended

0;Gang-aji Ttong;albinochocolate;https://myanimelist.net/profile/albinochocolate;4;Alright, go ahead and read the title.It's not exactly the most alluring name, but it definitely was an attention-catching one, even if it's not for traditionally pleasing reasons. I went into this Korean clay animation short not knowing what to expect. It seemed it was either going to be unintentional hilarity or a heartwarming tale (as others have stated). Ultimately, I found it to be strange and underwhelming mixture of the two. It is however, not exactly a piece of canine excrement, at least in terms of quality, despite the assuring name.Doggy Poo is the main character, and it is also a clump of poop that came from a dog's anus. He then becomes a sentient being that struggles and finds it difficult to live as dog waste. The short basically explores his misfortune, but it is obviously not shown in an extremely depressing or all too interesting fashion. The short is heavy-handed as well, but then again it is targeted at children. Which is not a complete excuse to forgive incompetence in several areas, but it does grant some leniency. It most likely will appease small children, although to be fair, that's not a particularly hard job to accomplish.Traditional animation is nowhere to be found, but instead the more typically family-friendly clay animation (lovely Christmas shorts come to mind). It is not outstandingly intricate or crafted, but it is competent and the backgrounds aren't exactly half-baked. They, along with the characters, have some detail to them which makes the short easier to watch. The absurdity of the premise still lingers throughout, but it definitely is easier to take in with the palpable animation.Overall, the short is definitely not horrible, and does possess some positive components: the pleasant piano-centered soundtrack, the decent visuals, some unintentional laughs here and there, and even emotional resonance with little Doggy Poo, albeit only a little. It's obvious the short wasn't really aimed at any age groups other than the wee little ones, so for what it's worth, it's tolerable and not a very bad way to pass a half-hour.Four Slightly Cute Anthropomorphic Defecations out of Ten.;Not Recommended

The last episode and I guess the third one would be cool to see explored in an actual anime with a proper story and not something that feels like recaps.Last episode was by far the best due to just the fight and seeing little snippets of what could be explored, but thats not saying much, but I say give it a watch!;Mixed Feelings
0;Kyoshin to Hyouka no Shiro;Denby;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Denby;4;Shiro, the Giant, and the Castle of Ice is an extremely short OVA following Shirou and Tokiya who are transformed into giants via stones gifted to them by their grandfather, Matsujii. Shiro is able to use the fire power of Goron to save Tokiya from the ice giant.The show is only about six minutes in total so there is not all too much to say about it. The song in the final episode is good as are the backgrounds and emotions in the voice actors.There isn’t all too much wrong with this show if it was to be used as a pilot. None of the characters are given a backstory and the viewer has no time to familiarize themselves with who they are. The backgrounds also don’t at all match the lighting on the characters which, with the exception of the giants, details and shadows are essentially non existent. As for background music, apart from the final episodes, there pretty much is none and the whole show is over before it even fully begins.It’s definitely worth a watch as it is only about six minutes in length and is very fluid in animation and well put together, even if there are more words in this review than the entire script of the show.;Not Recommended
0;Take Your Way;AK25;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AK25;8;Take Your Way is a pretty emotional music video.The MV tells the story of a boy who failed to save the one he loves, but is given another chance from a friend who offers his life in exchange. The song is told through the perspective of the one who sacrifices himself. The song's heartwarming lyrics about lifting the person one cares about to encourage them to try again, only this time they are not alone. kz's signature heartfelt lyrics and composing that tugs at one's heart-strings are all present and are enhanced by the narrative told through the visuals.The video plays with the nicely with the colors it assigns to its characters. The scene of the friend merging with the boy with the glasses and mixing their color coupled with the lyrics at that point about not being afraid and that he's never alone is handled wonderfully, followed by a great Itano circus with different colored missiles flying over the screen and leaving behind trails of onomatopoeia that was also done previously, but this time, resulting in a successful attempt at saving the girl and and a happy ending.Its empowering song about encouragement told from the perspective of a person who wanted nothing more than to see his friend succeed and the MV's distinct style of coloring and incorporating it in its narrative make Take Your Way a pretty great anime.;Recommended
0;Izumo (2003);Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;This here was a subbed english anime. I hated the fact it was censored. Not only that but sometimes the censorship was a bit much. a step away from cutting off the good parts(sexually speaking). Aside from the minor negative this is a good adventure show. The idea behind this anime was questions were not answered in this life so the writers(rhetorically speaking) pondered. Decided let's have them answered in an alternate life and better yet merge them together. It was a wonderful idea really. It made me think even though i find my life to be anything but different then most perhaps there is that one thing that will change it. Sure it may not be right away but having it be at the end gives me more than enough time to prepare.Anywho going back into the anime it is like yu-gi-oh or pokemon from a hentai stand point.;Recommended
0;Yuuwaku Countdown;Ghost-Hardware;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ghost-Hardware;4;This is a 6-part OVA series. All sections are about 15 minutes long and I assume each were done by different directors, so the animation quality, presentation etc. differs a bit between all of them.The first ‘part’ is the best. It had an odd, dreamy atmosphere reminiscent of some of the better ecchi from the 90’s. And it managed to (shockingly) be erotic as well. The actual plot was non-existent but look, that’s not what we’re here for. The animation itself was serviceable but a bit weak, this was made on a small budget after all. I’d recommend watching this one at the minimum.Two of the parts (episodes 4 and 5) are a joint story, and the animation and art show a slight improvement. Not to a major degree, but an improvement still. Again, there’s a weak setup that’s just an excuse to show some sex scenes but it’s still ok. Keep in mind, when I say 'ok', that’s not high praise.The other parts aren’t even worth talking about in detail because they’re pure garbage. One is a very generic knights’ tale, the next is a bizarre ‘experimental’ story which doesn’t make any sense and probably exists just for the director to show how deep he is, and the last is a ‘comedy’. At least, I think it’s supposed to be a comedy. I use the term comedy lightly here because there’s zero moments of actual humor in it. It’s offensive trash.Taken as a whole, this is pretty awful which is why I’ve only given this a 4, but the first part and (possibly) the joint story are worth a watch.;Not Recommended
0;Wu Shang Shen Di;Saurna;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saurna;8;Reincarnation story ✓Less than 10 min. ✓Kick ass MC ✓CGI ✓I confess, the poster for this anime did not appeal to me.I confess, the lack of information on the page did not encourage me to watch it.I confess, I do not like short anime.I will be honest, go watch Wu Shang Shen Di right now, don’t even read the rest of what I have to say. I can promise you my review will not be “enlightening”, “analytical” or “sophisticated”. I watch anime for enjoyment, not to take it apart and say “could have been better”, “there’s no character development”, “the art style was boring”, “not enough detail in the art”, “seen one, seen them all”. Alas I have strayed…If you like Isekai you can like this show, if you don’t you can still like it.The first couple of episodes involve alchemy babble, which shows Mu Yun’s knowledge that becomes his strength to gaining power, influence and wealth. It will be boring and confusing, but you don’t need to learn or remember what they’re saying. The gist of it really, is that the era Mu Yun is from had more understanding of the world and the ‘modern era’ is more backwards than advanced. See it as Mu Yun’s display of superiority. The only thing you really need to pay attention to is the break down on levels and rank. It’s tricky, but it gives you an idea on why some of the things he does might be ‘impossible’ for his level and rank.Mu Yun is like a kid who’s been bullied to the point of fighting back. He does not tolerate disrespect, his slap-boxes are funny cause he catches people off guard. I like that he is somewhat mature, and sassy.The girls are not tsundere annoying types*. Then again, there are not many girls in this show, there’s 3 of them so far and none are damsels waiting for OP MC to save them, which I like. Best girl is Qin Meng Yao if for some reason you disagree, go get your head examined.*Your first 3 experiences, tsundere’s are cute, after that they’re just damned annoying.The CGI isn’t really bad, you know like the stiff robot* walking, fighting or moving. It’s got some flow, wind and stiffness that will catch your eye but not too annoyingly. The Chinese have good looking CGI. Unless you’re nitpicking. I like that background characters are alive and moving outside of interacting with MC, it makes the world feel alive.* Beserk (2016).I’ll be honest, the music and sound effects really don’t stand out to me, but, there is 1 track that plays when the MC succeeds (Ha, sounds like a lvl up tune). You first hear it in episode 2 when he’s talking to Mo Wen about refining pills. Hearing it often in the show, it grew on me, but still I’m not all hyped about it.The fights are okay… there is not a lot shown in fights, but it’s a 7 min show with about 5 min really per episode. So don’t be too alarmed if some fights feel rushed, short, or completely missing. If he’s beaten them before no need to show him kicking their asses again…right? I mean, his bad guys pop up like he’s catching Pokemon, and they show up in 2’s. So he always has a fight or asses to kick.Finally, don’t watch the show with expectations, just appreciate it as it is. I won’t lie, it’s not going to stick with you like your favourite anime, you’re probably not even going to remember core characters names. But it’s a good show to watch if you’re tired of regular shows or just looking for something to pass the time.If for some reason you’ve gotten this far in my review and you have not watched Wu Shang Shen Di. I don’t blame you, but I challenge you to go watch the first 5 episodes (literally worth 1 episode of a regular show). Don’t give me the “it’s too short” excuse, there’s always a ‘kind soul’ who makes a compilation on the tube. Now go.;Recommended
0;Wu Shang Shen Di;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;5;"Supreme God Emperor is a typical cultivation isekai of a spiritual master that gets mysteriously transferred to a new body of a bullied kid. The opening tells of a scroll that has captured the soul of utmost experts in a last ditch effort against evil in order to preserve the secrets and pass them on to a new generation. Typical stuff. How this manifests is the protagonist gets selective access to this scroll in his ""mental ocean"" (i.e. subconscious) that holds a collection of all kinds of martial arts skills, and give him random boosts of energy, allowing him to raise his level every few episodes. Of course, he's an alchemist master, blacksmith, cultivation expert, and everything else under the roof in his previous life, so he knows exactly what he needs to do to level up.As you can see, the story is utterly mediocre. That exact same synopsis could have described other cultivation shows to a tee, like Martial Master (Wu Shen Zhu Zai) or Spirit Sword Sovereign (Ling Jian Zun). Perhaps the only saving grace here that makes it somewhat interesting is that the protagonist is a teacher, and he steadily builds his allies by figuring out the weaknesses of his students and helping them improve.But besides that, we get all the same cliches and repetitions. The protagonist teaches, gets insulted and assassination attempts from petty villains, gains another level and seeks revenge, gets recruited to a bigger city -- rinse and repeat. And if one likes this genre, it's perhaps watchable. But the biggest flaw is in the execution. First, the fight choreography consists of people punching each other in the fist with very few variations, the oldest of shounen cliches. Characters consistently over power others by a flurry of attacks like Luffy's gomu gomu no gatling gun, or Jojo's muda muda. In a word, lazy.The animation is rather plain and settings look generic. The character designs look almost as if they are pulled from other shows, with female characters wearing a familiar green uniform, and male characters with blue and white, and villains wearing black. The same looking guy would show up in different towns. Different noblemen would reenact the same conflicts in different arcs. The protagonist is instantly respected by local alchemy masters by sharing just a few recipes. And every classroom has a token female classmate or two that wants to join protagonist's harem. Every city has a prearranged marriage. The music is kind of campy.It's just... nothing special. Spirit Sword Sovereign has a similar story, slightly better choreograph (but still bad), but the execution is far more interesting. Martial Master and God of Ten Thousand Realms (Wan Jie Fa Shen) have the same revenge fantasy underdog structure, but pulls it off more believably.If you're a fan of cultivation stories, where idiotic villains of the week keep underestimating the protagonist despite being proven wrong over and over, or you've exhausted all other possible options, then give Supreme God Emperor a watch. It might not be as bad as I'm describing it, but still utterly mediocre.";Mixed Feelings

0;Gakuen no Shuryousha;Laura-sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Laura-sama;6;Visually, the show is decent and the character designs sort of hit that middle ground where the designs overall look a little young or small but they're not quite as bad as they could be. Noelle's design as well as her roommates are probably the best overall and her roommate gets a couple of really good scenes in this show. Takamine's daughter is decent and the others are fairly average but they all pull off their scenes well enough. The sex scenes overall are decently done at minimum with a couple of good moments in some of them but nothing wildly fantastic. The animation for it pretty much fits the same bill so there aren't any real surprises here.Wicked Lesson is a decent piece of adult anime entertainment but in the end it's a fairly average show that doesn't go to the extreme with its bondage stuff and isn't all that fetish heavy. There's a plot to be found here and while it's enough to carry the scenes from one to the other it's not something that's all that memorable nor all that well written when they get down to the big explanations for it.

And then shows up to his house in real life.Reika seems to have some kind of mind power. It appears that she used mind powers to invade Keiichi’s dream, and is also using it to convince his mother to have her stay with them.He spies on her masturbating in his room but then she disappears when the mother shows up. Was it with mind powers? Teleportation? Jumping out the window? These questions will be answered never.Reika plays all sorts of mind games with him:-Trying to convince him to sleep with his mom and sister. They’re his stepmom and stepsister by the way. (Whenever a hentai takes the time to let the viewers know that the characters are not blood related I always laugh). She tells him that his sister masturbates when thinking about him. But he refuses to believe.-Trying to expose his love for his childhood friend Tomo that he has a crush on. Reika steals Tomo’s swimsuit and blackmails him by taking a picture of him masturbating on it.He refuses to sleep with Reika, but she eventually seduces him and turns him into a masochist and her sex slave. Which is good since in most hentai it’s the female who ends up being the masochist and sex slave.Conclusion,This is a pretty good hentai despite only having one episode. The story was good but needed a real conclusion; it doesn’t explain the origins of Reika. Some people may have questions as to what is happening.Unlike other hentai, this one focuses less on sex; there are only two H scenes and both are with Reika, except for the first; his wet dream had Tomo and Reika in it.There should have been a sex scene with his mom and sister. What’s the point of telling us that they’re not blood related if you’re not gonna make them have sex. Too bad there’s no episode 2.Rate Very GoodSTORY: Even though Reika’s origins aren’t explained you will still understand what’s going on. Unlike most hentai with no story or a stupid story this story is actually interesting and gets your attention.CHARACTERS: All the characters are interesting:KeiichiReikaTomoMomSisterBut they didn’t develop the mom and sister, I was hoping for a sex scene with them. They probably could have if there was an ep 2.";Recommended
0;Mashou no Kao;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;6;Rate of 6 (fine)Seen in English DubbedHas anyone had a masochist desire? well your not alone. In this anime the main male character has one in a dream. However, among many aspects of this anime it is unclear who's dream it was. One might argue it was the main characters. Yet, how would you explain the later submissive attitude?Other aspects that are unclear are the origin of this unknown female. Why does the unknown girl have the same backstory as the main character male?So many questions. If i were to guess i would say this is all about dreams. Everyone knows the ideal male dreams but i think this was centered around the dreams of the females mentioned in the show.Could it be that we were seeing what she was wishing? It is highly possible. think about it. When you dream do you see yourself as yourself or as somewhat different? We all have things we dislike about us. Dreams is something rare in which we have a shot at changing them without consequences. That said in mind being different allows us to function differently in life. Where we take things depends but are no longer based on the same rules. A very intercepting idea that could have had a follow up episode.Oh well...;Mixed Feelings

Still very clean, though.Sound: Voice and sound effects were ok. There was some music I guess, but besides the very first minute, the scenes are all quiet.Character: Asagi is the focus here, really. It shows her perspective being tortured by Oboro plus having to watch Sakura and Murasaki being tortured too. She's accepting to take the two's place and being presented the orc that's going to impregnate her.Enjoyment: They removed the story, which I thought it was ultimately a good thing, since the story in that one is stinky mess anyway and was just getting in the way of the sex, instead of complementing it. They soldiers are now purple demons and instead of the tents, they're in a wall of flesh (I think that's what is called?). I liked this too, since the soldiers were pretty much what bothered me the most. There's also a new scene, that shows Ingrid walking into Oboro being raped with tentacles, but it's very short and look like shit because it's presented as a flashback in sepia. The only scene they left out was the futa ones, which sucks since they were my favorites.Overall: Well, this is perfect if you wanted to watch Taimanin Asagi 3 and couldn't care less about the story, specially if you don't like futas. It's short, compact and changed some things for the best, in my opinion. But, in the end of the day... Why?";Recommended

0;Saiyuuki;Lolita_Flora;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lolita_Flora;9;Saiyuki fans the world over, if you have not watched this than there is something missing from your fan obligations that need be filled in immediately. This beautifully animated film from 1960 depicts the famous “Journey to the West” in a classic style that has set the foundation for generations to come. The legendary Story of Son Goku: The Monkey King in his epic adventure “Journey to the West” has been retold many times over since its publication 1590 and since then has generated much popularity. Everything from Dragon Ball to Forbidden Kingdom has draw inspiration from this amazing story. The Monkey King/ Alakazam the Great is one of the most well executed retelling of this classic tell and is a pillar of historical foundation for the 60’s as well as anime as a whole for coming along during the birth of this great genre’s lifespan.The animation for its time is quite advanced and done with great finesse. With the exception of a few other films, no other anime during that decade can match up to the beauty of this film’s animation and vibrancy. Voice acting during this day and age is not the best, but is easily over shadowed by its ability to continue on track telling its story. It fuses tasteful tid- bits of 1960 technology during the ancient times of this story such as telegraphs and pistols as well as things that haven’t even been created to this day like video telephones. All in good fun, of course. It’s a wonderful family film that is beyond enjoyable with lots of adventure, song, dance, mystery, magic and fantasy. Anyone who watches this film will quickly learn to grow with Alakazam/ Son Goku on his journey to learning humility, mercy and wisdom. I thoroughly impress upon any otaku or person who is interested in the “Journey to the West” story to enjoy this film and add it to your resume of films viewed. You won’t regret it.;Recommended

It was part of the Sunday matinee on TV. At the time I had no idea it was a Japanese cartoon, but the story and artwork was pretty good.

2;Saiyuuki;jonahthefurious;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jonahthefurious;8;Based off the Monkey King character from the classical Chinese epic novel Journey to the West (Journey of the West being the inspiration for other cartoons like Dragon Ball Z), this is the story of Alakazam the Great and his journeys after becoming king of the monkeys. I watched it not expecting much after seeing a lot of low-budget early anime, but I was surprised by the great characters like Alakazam, and especially the pig Sir Quigley, whose character design is straight out of John and Joy Halas' Animal Farm.The American dub was really well-done, and actually pretty funny at some times. The movie as a whole is pretty lighthearted, and extremely imaginative. Magic is an important aspect of the movie, and the different ways Alakazam uses it never failed to be interesting. As far as the animation goes, it looks like it was very influenced by classic Disney animation. The fact that it's narrated by the voice of Disney-regular Sterling Holloway (the voice of Winnie the Pooh, and Kaa in the Jungle Book) adds to the Disney feel. The animation has aged well, more than a lot of anime from this time.;Recommended
3;Saiyuuki;ShirleyMarquez;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShirleyMarquez;7;"Saiyuuki, aka Journey to the West, is not a great film by modern standards. But it's an important one in the history of anime. It's only the sixth anime feature film ever made and the first one to be released in the US. The substantially reedited American version was titled Alakazam the Great, in a dub featuring notable actors including Jonathan Winters and Dodie Stevens, the voice of Frankie Avalon singing the title part of Alakazam, and Sterling Holloway as the narrator.Because of its historical significance, it's a must-see for serious students of anime. (Alas, the original Japanese version seems to be unavailable, but the dub is available on Amazon Prime as I write this in December 2017.) For everyone else it's something that you might want to check out if you're curious. I admit to having a soft spot in my heart for it because it is the first anime I ever saw, during its original US release in 1961. The dates here are of my most recent viewing of the film. I couldn't put in 1961 if I wanted to; this site doesn't accept dates that far back!";Recommended
0;Saiyuuki;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;"I'm finding it really difficult to grade these early feature length animations - partly because most of the artists were still exploring the boundaries of what works and balancing a nascently developed industry's profitability - both when it came to the animation and the manga works they were bring primarily adapted from. A common problem that a lot of the animated films of this era seem to have is poor storyboarding and even poorer narrative coherence.While Hakujaden struggles to keep going and is just filled with padding, Sayuuki has the opposite problem. It attempts to cover material way more ambitious in scope and scale than it has the time to cover while also balancing the extended fight choreography and typical animation tropes that the audiences of the time deemed necessary. The pacing is zippy and quickfire, but the structure is wildly incoherent - not to mention the source adaption material (Tezuka's manga inspired by the original Journey to the West) is in itself a poor adaptation of the Chinese classic.Elements of western mythology are mixed into a primarily Chinese/Buddhist setting and fable that eventually makes the entire world building incoherent. I was expecting a Chinese heaven filled with Chang'e and Immortals and Buddhas, not harp playing angels and astronomers lifted out of Georges Melies's space faring shorts.Action choreography is another issue with movies of this time. One that I suspect is an artifact of the Looney Toons and Hannah Barbara effect. Conflict in animation originated as a means of inducing slapstick humor. Combat rarely has stakes since both sides in any fight - be it the looney toons or their opponents, tom and jerry, are nigh invincible no matter what trick they throw at each other. This tradition has passed onto these films and even into the modern day, where prolonged physical conflict continues on for extended periods and the participants constantly shrug off physical damage. Those battles that Son Gokuu has end up taking me out of immersion and reduce my enjoyment of this particular film.The one thing I loved about this though was the sound design and the choice of music. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, so I got to experience a lot of the Japanese songs and most were quite catchy. ""Ore Wa Son Gokuu"" will probably continue to echo within my mind for a few days to come with its deep sonorous, simply and yet catchy tune.Journey to the West as a story in itself is just too long to cover within the time frame of an hour. I think the better mode of approach would have been to pick a specific fable within the epic along the lines of Princess Iron Fan to adapt. None the less, the inspiration Sayuuki had on future animators is quite easy to see. There are clear inspirations drawn by Studio Ghibli from the washed out, yet natural looking peaceful background imagery that have come to define them and are clearly inspired from here and Disney movies.";Mixed Feelings
0;Saiyuuki;Ricequake;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ricequake;4;Let me begin my review by stating that I did not see this movie as a kid, and therefore have zero nostalgia goggles to work with. Saiyuuki, for lack of a better term, is not a very spectacular movie. The music is, for the most part, forgettable, and doesn't always work. The musical numbers are unneeded. The visuals are passable, but nothing special. The voice work is okay: again, nothing special.One of this movie's huge problems is getting me to care. I didn't care about the journey. I didn't care about the characters. In fact, I HATED most of the characters. The female love interest is a forgettable, bland cinnamon roll stereotype, and Son Goku is kind of a dick until very, very late into the film (and even then isn't that likable). The side characters are kind of neat on occasion, but most of them only show up for a few seconds aside from the guy who wanted to eat them, the pig, and the monk: and the monk is blander than water.Quite frankly, I went into this movie expecting a classic animation. However, as is sadly often the case with older Japanese animated movies, I instead found myself wondering why I was watching it, and constantly checking how far along I was (as early as 30 minutes into the film!). While not terrible, the film is certainly not good in my eyes. And on my ratings scale, that comes out to a 4/10. While I'm sure some people might enjoy it, with or without nostalgia glasses, I personally think you should give this one a skip.;Not Recommended
0;Hana to Hebi The Animation;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;5;"Watching Flower & Snake I am sad to say I kept saying to myself ""this woman deserves what is coming to her"". I despise when people just let bad things happen to them without trying to fight back. Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately) by the end I started to feel bad for Shizuko, but honestly I still didn't like or care about her. This film is full of all kinds of people who are just unpleasant and rotten to the core, there really is no hero or good guy to be found anywhere, and its hard to enjoy a series that has no one to root for or care about.Flower & Snake is a tense hentai series that focuses on bondage, rape, torture, humiliation and control. If there is a sadistic side to you then you may find this hentai appealing, but if you are like me and prefer the lighter side of hentai then this is one you should probably stay away from it. This is about the breaking of the human mind and spirit and the evil of man. There are no parts of joy or humor, no hint of hope, nothing but darkness and despair. When the final credits rolled I was just happy that is was over, and that is kind of sad. Then again, there are plenty of people out there that seem to enjoy this kind of dark and miserable story.This is a 2006 hentai, but it felt like it could have come out of the mid 90's. Just like the story, the animation style was dark, with a moody color pallet and lots of shadow. Since the film has been licensed for sale in the US it does come uncensored and with an English dub as well as the original Japanese audio. I generally do not like dubs as the voices rarely fit, but I have to say that this dub was very passable for the most part and only suffered from bad porn-star acting on occasion.As for the story, well it had enough substance overall, as long as you can suspend your beliefs long enough to accept what is happening. Once you got over the major plot points it pretty much broke down to a pure submission story. The major characters were fairly well rounded out, but sadly none had any positive points to their names. I think the best part of this hentai was the fact that even though it was heavy in S&M themes, that it at least spared the audience from the horror of scat scenes or surgical torture.In conclusion, I wish I could find more to like about this hentai, I really do, but it was just too dark for my tastes… I guess I am a sucker for happier endings. If you have a demon living inside of your soul then I am sure that you will find this to your liking… I think that the goth crowd will get a kick out of it.";Mixed Feelings

Whether it’s guiding two virgins through their first time or teaching a tough guy what it really means to make love, this sultry Professor has all the gentle advice and sexual skill to make a man out of anyone.Even though her sex education is second to none, Shino has needs, too. She aches to find that special someone who can help her achieve the fulfillment that she teaches to others. How many lustful encounters will she have before she finds someone who can please both her body and her heart?***Spoilers***We’re introduced to Professor Shino of a private academy who only wants to do good deeds to her students and those she considers her friends. For example, we’re introduced to her as she provides a blowjob to a friend whose wife died some time back but he hasn’t dated or had sex since then, so she’s helping him out by relieving all that stress. Of course, he’s completely into it and they progress into a full sex scene in which he reveals his thankfulness for all of this by proposing to her. But for Shino, it’s not about being committed to just one person but rather she has all of her students to think of and can’t imagine leaving them just yet for marriage.On campus, Shino isn’t like most other teachers since she’ll go right up to the bullies and make them stop and question them without fear which she does to a group of thugs ignoring the warning of fellow teachers. Later she interrupts them again when she noticed that they were cutting class and smoking. This event pissed the delinquents. At that moment the leader comes to the conclusion of making her payback for all the trouble she is causing them.She’s a decent enough teacher and is someone that her students feel that they can talk to. One student feeling pressured by her boyfriend to have sex but she wants her first time to be memorable, not the roll in the bushes he keeps seeming to want to have. She comes to Shino about this and she promises to take care of everything, which times out well as the boyfriend has just hurt himself at baseball practice and is in the nurse’s office. What she ends up arranging is amusing as she gets the guy to undress in the office and then brings in his girlfriend (who is naked) in order to have them understand each other’s bodies.The results of this little get together in the nurse office gets Shino excited and she heads off into the sunset looking for some pleasure herself, only to come across the bullies from earlier. Can you guess where it leads from there? Yep! it’s pretty obvious the delinquents have their way with Shino sensei by raping her. But to our surprise she is more upset that they didn't make love to her the right way (love caring way) than being rape so she is in lesson mode and Yep! She ends up making the delinquent leader realize his mistake. The show is fairly predictable but it’s all done with some very good looking character designs, attractive animation and generally quite enjoyable sex scenes.In conclusion I can’t say I was holding out much hope for when I first saw the synopsis but with good animation, simple plot and enjoyable sex scenes, this is a fairly easy hentai to recommend to anyone who has time to spare.;Mixed Feelings

All three schools have their strengths in a center area of the arts, like Siegfeld being focused on being the ""elite"" of the elite focusing on many arts, Frontier Arts being more into their Western and being carefree and Rinmeikan in tradition Japanese and being calm and collected, though the characters originating from them and considering it's a comedy anime short are obviously unlike the schools focus though with this large of a cast and the short solely focused on quick one-liners and some character jabbing, hey world building isn't exactly in this anime short's focus, though it shows in the schools intermingling with one another as well as character interactions in general.The comedy through this excels in it's quick one-liner jokes on the huge cast of characters which helps get to know the new characters (and for people who play the mobile game, a bit of fanservice LA supposes) and yeah the comedy is good as LA did chuckle a couple of times and due to the short runtime in general it makes it even better making all the one liners and jokes snap. Latter on the comedy is more to do with one joke taken to the extreme in some extent, this can land or miss most of the time. To this end, Shoujo☆Conto All Starlight latter becomes nothing but isolated episodes looking at the different three new groups sometimes mixing with Seisho Music Academy girls in some vocal and visual hijinks.The animation done once again by Kinema Citrus and the new studio entering the stage, Imagica Lab, well the animation is minimalistic to say the least background and the chibi characters but the chibi character designs reminds LA of those chibi acrylic prints of anime character you see but animated. The background isn't much to talk about but still works with the chibi character designs anyways. It's chibi comedy anime short and though Shoujo Conto All Starlight does do the rare weird stuff, it's mostly chibi characters on ok backgrounds.The voice cast, due to THREE new school groups entering the stage makes this voice cast IMMENSE, but LA will just say the voice cast fitted well with their respective roles, especially Hotaru Nomoto as Akira and Megumi Han as Aruru. One thing LA did note is that in the latter episodes, it seems that the majority of the voice cast go almost ad-lib in their reactions and it shows in their laughter.Shoujo☆Conto All Starlight gives a comedic twist to the Revue Starlight world whilst adding in a bunch of new characters in the process and giving us what other schools Revues and training for it is like, but mostly chibi comedic hijinks with Revue Starlight, if you are fan of Revue Starlight and want to see a more comedic take on it with new characters at that, then Shoujo☆Conto All Starlightt is for you!...well that and if you played the mobile game of course.";Recommended

While not the best piece of self-indulgence I’ve seen, it’s one with the craftsman’s charm of a dispassionately made wooden bear trinket at a remote tourist destination. Which is to say, the blasé attitude of the man behind the counter who’s been carving these for 40 years gives it its own strange charm from how automatic and numbing the activity became. Homemade, yet polished in indifferent mechanical process. It lacks liveliness, but is without factory cynicism; giving insight into one who has been at it for far too long. A steadfastness when creating these same baubles countless times, that despite the lack of enthusiasm in his present self, one can see the skill built over those years. The light is gone, but the precision is still there.That’s roughly how I felt watching this. It lacks the inspiration of other eccentric or unhinged shows, but is still droll from its overall presentation. I can’t help but be smitten by the aesthetics, in spite of the half-heartedness of motivation that seems to emanate off of it.

0;Souryuuden;DeathHormone;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DeathHormone;7;First off, this anime is quite old, and I supose people will kinda only really like this, if they are hardcore anime fans and can apprecaite its old, or people who saw it when it first came out.The story is about 4 brothers who each have a hidden power to turn into a dragon, each dragon has 1 element, such as fire, or wind. The brothers at the start of the anime don't know they have this power. The story is basically about an organzation that knows of the brothers powers and trys to capture them, thus leading to the brothers knowledge that there are dragon kings.It sounds quite basic, but there is a nice plot twist in there.The characters aren't that special to be honest, although I'd say most people will be able to pick a favorite out of the brother character, and there isn't really much devolpement between the brothers but there is regarding their dragon powers.The art isn't going to blow you away, since it's an old show, but for it's time it wasn't bad at all. The sound from what I can remember does it's job, but compared to new anime it wont be spot on.However with all that being said, there is a certain enjoyment in this anime, and I'm not sure what it is, I think the creator must have had great passion for his work, and you will find it a joy to watch, I know i did. however I wouldn't recomend a rewatch if you saw it when it first came out, and this is the anime that hooked you into anime, as it hasn't aged that well.Overall, Give it a watch if you're a huge anime fan and must see everything, It won't blow you away, but I don't think you find it that bad, and you'll find some enjoyment in here.;Recommended

What the hell happened!!!!! was it all a dream instead or something...blew almost my bloody head apart because in an instand it switched from the brothers fighting, to the dragons realm and seems acting like nothing, or something supposed to happen !!!!! wth just too weird , but overall a action packed serie, still one of my all time fav.;Recommended

This is actually the most Fucked Up hentai I've fapped to, though not _nearly_ as much in earnest as I was for Dropout. Dropout manages to be very likeable despite its Extremely Fucked Up premise, while this hentai does not.In my opinion, only one of the most unimaginably hardcore degenerates could be aroused by every aspect of this hentai. (Though, that title really belongs to whoever the fuck fapped in earnest to all of Euphoria, if that person even exists. Reviewing Euphoria next BTW.)It's really the fast, jumpy animation style that gets me off quickly, as weird as that is to say, since most seem to hate the animation. The art is not great but I wouldn't really call it bad either.However, no one in this hentai is really attractive, so it's just phallic objects going in and out of holes, with impossible quantities of cum later spilling out, and vague projection of myself onto the girls being used as human toilets for me. The main guy especially is extremely unlikeable, which I suppose makes sense since he *is* a violent rapist of young girls - AKA the absolute scum of the Earth.But this, as well as said violent rape being depicted honestly, obviously makes the hentai much less fappable. If you are a puritan who hates kinksters and doesn't think adults can be trusted with dark erotic fiction, you may want to require that all rape fantasy hentai be this disgusting (as a stepping stone to outright elimination). What a horrible and dull world that would be.;Not Recommended
0;Haou Taikei Ryuu Knight;Emptyk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Emptyk;10;Lord of lords Ryu Knight.It's a show I just happened to bump into while browsing the web and started out of sheer boredom. But I soon came to love it and consider it an all time favorite.Story:The plot is a fairly common one.Evil creatures trying to take over the world and the heroes who try to stop them.Something I liked very much about it was the combination of mechs with swords, old style guns, and even magic, for fighting.At the time I had never before seen a mech show that used magic and swords, all the animes I had seen with mechs were sci-fi.And I thought/think it was very cool, and that it was pulled off well.A 10 from me for story. ^^Art:(Style)The art style is very similar to Slayers and other series made around the early nineties.Triangular eyes, pointy(ish)feet, etc etc.I use the same art style when I draw, so I obviously like it very much.(Animation)I personally, am a huge fan of all early nineties shows because of the animation.Before computer generated animation became so big, and more importantly, so accessible.(cheap)A 9 for animation from me.Sound/music:The sound effects I'm sure were very good for their time.Though now, over ten years after the show was made, they aren't as impressive.Though I wouldn't say their bad.The music I remember liking while I watched it. After I watched it I bought as much merchandise from the show as I could find, most of which was CDs. And after listening to the music separately from the show I totally fell for it. The music is great! Awesome listening!A 6 on sound and 10 on music, so 8 overall.Character(s):I love all the characters in Ryu Knight.From the dramatic Sarutobi, to the greedy Katze.From the sweet and naive princess, to the evil, misguided Galden.Every character is very different and there are several characters.So no matter what type of person you are, or what type of character you like, you are bound to find a character to love in this series.A 10 for the characters.Enjoyment:I loved this series to death. As I said at the beginning of this review, I started watching the series, which gets off to a...rather slow start, out of boredom.But now it's one of my all time favorites.With it's skillful balance between comedy and drama,I looked forward to the episodes as much as I looked forward to the episodes of Slayers I watched with my sisters when I first started watching anime 7 years ago.A feeling I didn't think I'd get again.So for me personally, it was a hugely enjoyable experience.A 10 for enjoyment. ^^Overall:I will leave you all with this.I remember very few animes I have enjoyed so thoroughly.From the art, to the characters.I enjoyed it all.It is a wonderful mix of all the different aspects of anime.My overall score for it is 10.I would highly recommend it to any anime fan, be they young or old,well watched or new to anime.This is not a series anyone can afford to miss.;Recommended
0;Chiisana Penguin Lolo no Bouken;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;5;"Since my man Kenny Lauderdale recently made a video on what is and isn't anime, I decided to go on a quest and find the least anime entry on ALL of MAL!Different anime rating sites have different criteria. Anime News Network is probably the strictest. It absolutely has to be written in Japan, directed in Japan, and made for a Japanese audience first and foremost. There's no Chinese animation, no Korean animation, no co-productions. It HAS to be Japanese.Kitsu is the least strict. They say that ""anime"" is just the Japanese word for cartoon, so why shouldn't all cartoons be added? Avatar the Last Airbender and Korra are in the top 50. Stephen Universe and Houseki no Kuni are rivals. There are serious arguments over which series has the best gemstone girls! Meanwhile, Elfen Lied is locked in an eternal feud with Teen Titans Go to be the most hated thing on Kitsu. Last time I checked, Elfen Lied was rated slightly lower, but that was before Teen Titans Go made that entire episode trolling the shit out of Thundercats fans, which is a popular anime on Kitsu. TTG probably retook the gold medal after that.MAL is generally in the middle. The definition of anime on MAL has shifted around since it was founded in 2008. When I joined in 2014, there really weren't Korean and Chinese entries on this site, but those were added because MAL now considers anime to be ""Asian cartoons"". MAL has held steadfast on excluding American cartoons that look ""anime"" such as Avatar because America doesn't share the same cultural influences and isn't an Asian country. A MAL entry can be co-produced by America, but Asians have to play a leading role. Doesn't this mean that ""The Nutshack"" is an anime under MAL's definition? Yes! Yes it does! However, I spoke to a mod and the Philippines is currently not being shown the same treatment as China, South Korea, and shockingly North Korea. This isn't due to any ethnic discrimination, but because the mod assured me that Nutshack WOULD skyrocket to #1 the second it gets added and they want to avoid the headache.So I wanted to find an anime that isn't remotely Japanese. An anime with a production team whiter than mayonnaise in blizzard. It took me surprisingly little time to find Lolo the Penguin. I accidentally first read the title as Loli the Penguin, which made me giggle. This film was financed by the Soviet government. It was written in Russia. It was directed in Russia. The audio is Russian. The animation was done by Soyuzmultfilm in Moscow. It was made specifically for a Soviet audience plus Warsaw Pact nations. The only reason that this is an ""anime"" is that Toei apparently provided some film equipment to Soyuzmultfilm. They didn't even help animate it. This is less anime than any Hanna Barbera cartoon! Why not just add Swat Kats or Pirates of Dark Water? At least those were animated in Japan and inspired by 1980s anime. There is simply NOTHING Japanese in the DNA of Lolo the Penguin.So how is the actual film? Eh...it's ok. It's a 3 episode, made for TV miniseries that was spliced together into a direct to VHS movie. As an aside, my favorite anime OP in this sub-genre is ""Guest From the Future"" and anyone who disagrees is cordially invited to go fuck themselves. The plot is pretty reminiscent of Don Bluth's the Pebble and the Penguin, which would be made 10 years later. However, it's not clear if Bluth took any inspiration from this film. In both films, an adventurous but kind of stupid young penguin gets lost out at sea, has to escape from leopard seals, and finds himself captured by poachers. All of this is likely coincidence. Leopard seals are the main predator of penguins and you have to fit humans into the film somehow. What's odd is that in both versions the main penguin is an Adelie penguin who befriends a rockhopper penguin that isn't native to Antarctica and has to get back home. It's still probably a coincidence, but I found that interesting. What definitely DOESN'T happen in Pebble and the Penguin is that the poachers open fire on the penguin colony and kill dozens of penguins before an avalanche kills all the poachers. You might think that's a little bleak for a children's movie, but the 90s were a BAD time for Russia, so at least it prepared those 80s kids for the tough times ahead. Russia ain't easy.Overall, it's an ok movie for its time. It's not great like Hedgehog in Fog, although oddly enough it has the same narrator! If anything it's still far better than The Pebble and the Penguin because it isn't crammed full of bad musical numbers. Do I think Lolo should be an anime? HELL no! However, I don't work for MAL. I'm just some random dude who writes reviews for fun.";Mixed Feelings
1;Chiisana Penguin Lolo no Bouken;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;Since it’s a Soviet-Japanese joint production, “Chiisana Penguin Lolo no Bouken” is an anime that doesn’t really feel like an anime. The animation style, dialogue and story progression seem distinctly non-Japanese, and the credits (and voice acting) are all in Russian. Japanese staff did work on this, however, and the background music in particular sounds like something you’d hear in a Japanese production.This 3-episode OVA is about an Adelie penguin named Lolo and his friends and family, and it follows him from when he hatches from his egg as he grows into an adult. Inquisitive and rambunctious, he gets into lots of dangerous situations while going on adventures with his friends.While the penguins do look cute, their actions sometimes contradict their cuteness and make the viewer realize that life for these creatures is indeed “survival of the fittest.” We see them stealing rocks from each other to make nests, for example. There’s also a scene where Lolo’s parents spank him (of course, this isn’t natural penguin behavior). There are also lots of predators that the penguins have to watch out for, and these are depicted menacingly — the killer whales and the seals, in particular, look frightening. Another interesting narrative choice here is that the penguins seem to be able to communicate with the “good animals,” like the dogs and the blue whales, but not the “bad animals,” like the skua gulls. There are also bad and good humans, and the bad ones are shown to be ugly while the good human is not.Plot-wise, this OVA tells a series of connected stories that are entertaining and suspenseful to watch, and that convey the harshness of nature and what being part of the food chain entails. These stories culminate in a conclusion that is largely satisfying but open-ended. Some of the major developments at the end happen too suddenly, and the characters’ reactions to them are glossed over. There are a few plot developments, particularly in the final episode, that don’t make much sense. In general, however, the story and characters are pretty good.Regarding technical aspects, the animation is usually fluid, although it can be blocky at times, and they recycle some shots. Also, sometimes the penguins look like they're smiling when they're saying something serious. The background music is appealing and kind of relaxing, in a way. I can’t comment much on the quality of the voice acting since it’s in Russian, but it sounded okay.There is some potentially objectionable content, most of which I think got cut for the English-language releases of this OVA. There’s the aforementioned scene with Lolo’s parents spanking him, there’s some violence as characters are almost eaten by other animals several times, and there are some deaths (with blood shown).Overall, although “Lolo” has a few issues, it’s a solid watch.;Mixed Feelings

0;Ushichichi Tabehoudai! The Animation;AnotherDegen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnotherDegen;6;"In brief, if you like lactating cow girls and nice ahegaos, ""Ushichichi Tabehoudai!"" is for you, granted that you're alright with older, less photogenic men. However, there are far uglier ones both mentally and physically in the grand scheme of things.More in depth...Story: 6. We have a couple of guys struggling to get sales up for their business until they come across a girl, Nana, that fits the bill for their marketing campaign. When the two guys get her all dressed up, she recommends to go for a sexier theme for a marketing campaign since her dress is more risqué than usual. You can guess the rest.Art: 7. The animation quality is above average and the animation style is quite unique compared to others. ""Ushichichi Tabeoudai!"" is a sort of middle ground between manga and anime as it occasionally takes on an animated panel format, which was a nice surprise. And for all of you ahegao lovers, there are a handful of ahegaos present here. While they aren't the most distorted and mind broken ones you'll see, they remain relatively unobtrusive and natural. A minor gripe about the animation, though, would have to be time intervals between each cut. As each cut fades out, there's nothing; no sound, no image, just you. These gaps are more apparent due to the lack of background music and can be quite distracting given how frequent they are.Sound: 4. The sound design was subpar to say the least. You could hear when the voice clips ended. The synergy between the voices and animation was a little off occasionally. An example would be Nana panting during a 5 second still frame of insertion. Now, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing per se, there was no background music at all. This allows for you to be completely immersed in the raw sound and let the little bit of ASMR (for those of you into it) be heard. However, because of the noticeable endings of each voice clip, it would have been better with background music to make it less detectable.Character: 5. There was nothing too special about the characters. We have two business men trying to raise sales using previous marketing methods but have failed to find a girl that will work out well. That is until they encounter Nana, an airhead with the God-given ability to lactate without being pregnant. Aside from her modest ahegaos and her nice eyebrows, nothing really stands out.Enjoyment: 6. When I saw the ugly bastard tag, I was going to close the tab as quickly as I opened it, but looking at the snapshots, they didn't seem so bad. So I pressed forward. If it turned out to be unwatchable so be it. This wasn't a bad watch and was actually one of the more enjoyable ones I've seen. While the men are no Adonis's by any means, I don't think making them more model-like or just average would change my enjoyment. Then there's Nana. Although cow girls aren't really my thing, I found her to be quite pleasant. Maybe it was her personality or maybe her eyes? Yeah, it was probably her eyes. Eyes can either make or break a character for me, and Nana nailed it, especially with her expressions.Overall: 6. ""Ushichichi Tabehoudai!"" is quite different in terms of animation, in a good way, and while the sound design is lacking, the art is really above par and makes up for it. I would rate this a 6/10 and I see myself coming back in the future.";Mixed Feelings
0;Ushichichi Tabehoudai! The Animation;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;3;Ushichichi follows two guys as they find their new girl to represent their brand (basically a cow girl). They come up with the idea that the best way to promote their company was by making the newly hired cowgirl shoot a porn video with them. So a pretty bland story about some guys taking advantage of a stupid girl.The art is horrible in this, all the characters are blob like with nearly no motion. At times it looks like just sliding pictures than something actually animated. Add on top of that we got the man guys being two old fat bastards that are kind of obnoxious.To make things short and to the point, this is an awful hentai that everyone should skip. It doesn't offer anything of quality and is a step below if not several steps below other notoriously bad production companies like Queen Bee.;Not Recommended
1;Ushichichi Tabehoudai! The Animation;slaaack666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slaaack666;3;"""From this moment on, my naughty virgin cow pussy is about to get messed up!""Story: Senmu and Shachou are two fat bastards desperately trying to find a cute oblivious girl to work as their company's mascot and help with publicity. Already at the end of their ropes, they meet Nana-chan, a cute chubby waitress, who accepts the job offer in hopes of eventually becoming a celebrity and start living the good life. After trying on her cow outfit, she runs her mouth suggesting something a little bit sexier and end up being persuaded into shooting an adult video as an ad for the company, thinking it's her first test to the world of fame.Art: The artstyle and lines look amazing on the girl, but everything else is simple and bland. Animation kind of works when it works, most of time is downright bad and way too stiff (lip synch in particular). One or maybe two good angles, most of them are completely trash—unless you like staring in the ass of an old fat motherfucker. There's also a lot of weird looped cuts with nothing in the background, almost as if there was supposed to be something there and they forgot to add (although some do have more than one angle)... or the animators screwed up the aspect ratio and then just zoomed out to fix it... or maybe the director just woke up that morning and thought he'd be the Michael Bay of black backgrounds.Sound: Voices are horrible, Nana's too high pitched and annoying and the ugly bastards sound exactly what they look like they sound, which honestly, wouldn't be too much of a bother if they'd ever shut the fuck up. Sound effects are unexpectedly fucking good and I hate it, as it seems so difficult to find a hentai with some half decent sound effects and natural-sounding sloppy... flesh... uh... beating, I guess—you know, that good ol' *plap plap plap*. There's no music at all besides the ending credits, which is a recycled song that was also used on Shiawase nara Niku wo Morou.Character: Nana's quite hot and cute, but has the personality of a wet piece of cardboard. The other two characters are fat old fucks desperate to get their hands on a young girl and that's double the enough reason for me to feel like shooting them in the face—or myself—with a 12ga.Enjoyment: It drags. It drags so much and I think the biggest reasons are the disgusting pig never shutting up throughout the whole thing while I try to get off, the uncomfortable lack of sounds or music and the never-ending white transitions everywhere all the time, which sometimes feel like an eternity and always kills the pacing.Overall: There's nothing here besides the cute girl, but even then she's really not worth the hassle, just look up some GIFs on Google and call it a day. But I mean, if you do like fat old men, I think maybe I would recommend hanging yourself. And as always, ""if fapping a lot made you feel hungry, please go to Oxhorn for some meat and fill your bellies until you're satisfied as well""!";Not Recommended
0;Wanwan Sanjuushi;Catch33;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Catch33;7;"Guessing from the lack of reviews, I will assume this series was a sole phenomenon in Portugal, and maybe Spain?The Dogtanian ""Dartacão"" opening song was such a hit here that every kid and adult knew how to sing it or as least hum the melody. The opening YouTube video in Portuguese has 712,378 views, and it's only one of the many ones.The series was created by Claudio Biern Boyd. The 26 episodes were produced in 1981 by the Spanish international BRB and the Japanese Nippon animation.It's a faithful adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel ""The Three Musketeers"", although it has some different details such as the protagonists being dogs or the protagonist's beloved being called Juliet instead of Constance. One can be sure that this series inspired many cartoons and was highly influential to the now famous ""Beastars"". Nah, just kidding.This series premiered in Portugal in 1983 on Saturday mornings. It quickly became a success, being repeated several times in a public main channel. In the beginning of the 90s, it was repeated and also on another private channel in 1995.All in all it was a light-hearted and very entertaining series with a classic good vs evil theme.";Recommended
1;Wanwan Sanjuushi;PingPongYa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PingPongYa;10;Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, or 'Wanwan Sanjuushi' was one of my childhood favourites growing up, I constantly watched and rewatched it! I just rewatched it again recently to live out my youth and it is still as good as I remember. However, I feel like it's something you can only truly enjoy if you have the nostalgia with it.Story: 10/10I always loved the story, it's a take on a book written by Alexandre Dumas from the 1800s. I think it is portrayed well and the pacing of the story is also very good. It is not rushed and seems very well thought out. Though, I have never read the original book so I have no idea how loyal it is, but as a standalone it is great. The different plot points are awesome.Art: 9/10I rate it highly due to nostalgia but the animation is quite simplistic and inconsistent. Though I think that adds to it's charm. The backgrounds are all very beautifully drawn and the character designs are also great.Sound: 10/10The music in this is AMAZING! I have ALWAYS loved the theme tune and it is so catchy. All of the background music is also perfect. Would highly recommend just for that on it's own. The voice acting could have been a little better, as a few characters sound stale, but I think it works fine. I only saw the English dub, it being on when I was younger, so I am not sure if it is the same with the Japanese dub.Character: 10/10I ADORE the characters in this! Again, may just be nostalgia talking, but I think they are all very unique and thought out, all with different personalities. The villains in this are also amazing and I adore them.Enjoyment: 10/10Honestly, there is nothing I would change about this whole experience. It is an amazing watch. Perhaps the voice acting for some characters could have been better, but I only saw the English dub so no idea how it plays out in Japanese.Overall: 10/10An amazing show, but only truly enjoyable if you watched it as a child, and are now revisiting it. I had no idea it was counted as anime until I saw it pop up on this site, so that is also really cool. I highly recommend you watch it. It is very child-like, as it is meant for small children, but the designs and story are really good still. I would personally recommend the English dub, but I'm sure Japanese or any other dub is good too.;Recommended

3;Wanwan Sanjuushi;Diogo_Gomes_1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Diogo_Gomes_1995;9;"Here's another one that i remember watching vivibly as a child but never got to finish it's entirety. And this one so happens to be one of the most popular anime shows in Portugal. Right alongside with Tom Sawyer, Heidi, Maya The Bee and of course, Dragon Ball.Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds (Or Wanwan Sanjuushi as it's called in japan) is an anime show made in 1981 by both Nippon Animation and BRB International. It's based off the novel ""The three Musketeers"" by Alexandre DumasEver since it's airing on european televisions in the 1980s, it became an huge hit to the point of getting it's own merchandises. It even received a sequel made years later known as ""The Return of Dogtanian"". Which takes places years after the events of the anime. As well as we are given a CGI animated movie released in 2021.However, we're not gonna go too deep into the franchsie itself, but rather the anime show that started it all. Which is why you're here in the first place.So, how much this anime holds compared to what it did back in the days? Let's find out:The story, like i mentioned, is based off The three Musketeers as it follows the story of the novels pretty well. Dogtanian goes to paris to become a muskehound and does what he knows best. Helping out thoses in need to prevent any incidents ever happening.While the obvious difference here is that the characters became anthropormorthic animals, the key difference between this anime and the Duma's novels is that the character traits of Athos and Porthos are interchanged. Porthos became the secretive noble of the group while Athos became extrovert.So far, aside the changes to the characters, the anime does a pretty good job following the anime pretty well. Telling the story of The three Musketeers faithfully.So no issues with the story here.As for the animation, even though this is a co-production between BRB International and Nippon Animation, Nippon Animation handled the entirety of the show with the animation throughout 26 episodes.With that said, i have to say that the animation is pretty great for 1981. You get lots of details on certain areas and locations of France and the fight scenes look pretty good as well. Very detailed and fun to look at. The character designs are good as well. Each of the characters are given some nice looks on their outfits and designs as animals. Even Juliette doesn't look that bad but rather decent, as well.Them you have the characters. Again, just like the story, the characters are also fun to watch and follow.You have Dogtanian, who's the main protagonist of the series, who's very brave and not afraid of taking challenges againts thoses who get in his way to become a musketeer.You also have the musketeers like Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Athos is more of the strongest of the three musketeers and enjoys drinking and eating alot. he can be a goofball at times while Aramis is more of a gentle swordman who enjoys reading books (especially the bible) and does poems to women anytime he's in a conversation with them and then you have Porthos, who's more of a bravest of the group who does anything he can to stop any bad guys anytime he sees them.There are also other characters that do serve purposes to the story of the anime. You have Juliette who would later become Dogtanian's love interest and the small mouse named ""Pip"", who would appear later in the show as Dogtanian's sidekick that would help and advice him what he should think isntead of resorting into using his sword to attack.And then you have the villains of the anime. First you have Rochefort, who would become Dogtanian's first enemy he fought againts, who spies on each of him and his musketeers and does anything he can to take them down.There's also Vidimer, who's mostly a comic relief who tries so hard to put a stop to them by coming up with many plans. From making booby traps on them to even disguise himself as a girl just to trick them and basically, he fails at everything. he's quite an hilarious character, by the way.There's also Milady, who also plans to kill Dogtanian and his musketeers with her schemes that she comes up with. Quite a gorgeous neko girl.And finally, you have the prime minister of France himself, Cardinal Richelieu. Who wants to have the power to control King Louis. He's the one who orders both Rochefort, Vidimer and Milady to do anything it takes to take Dogtanian and his musketeers down. But sadly, he gets frustrated because it never goes the way he wants it to be.There are a few more that i would like to talk about, but i just felt like theses characters i mentioned here are makes the story important.Now for the sound. Like i did with Vickie The Viking, i watched the PT-PT dub of the anime since it's the only one available on Youtube and the one that i'm mostly familiar with. Never watched the Japanese dub, although i heard a few things about the anime that makes the sound of the anime different here. So i will check them out and update this review whenever i can. But for now, here's my thought on the sound:The music is probably my least favourite part of the anime. Mostly because it re-uses the same score as the opening theme song of the spanish version but with different composition. I mean, it's nice to hear the opening theme song since it brings so much joy of watching this anime as a kid again, but when you start repeating the same song but with different scoring, it gets annoying alittle too much.The sounds are pretty good. You get some unique sound effects added when it comes to fighting scenes which makes it more interesting and fun to listen, to.And for the voice acting, or the Portuguese dub that i watched which was done by National Films, it's pretty good to a certain degree. On one hand, i'm impressed with how many voice actors did great performances for each of the characters. Milady's PT-PT voice by Maria Emilia Correia really gives a soothing and beautiful voice for an already beautiful catgirl. While António Montez did a splendid job at making the voice of Aramis in a beautiful and wonderful way. Giving him a very kind and gentle voice for an already kind and gentle musketeer. May António rest in peace.So yeah, i think everyone did a good job at voicing the characters in the PT-PT dub. But Dogtanian's PT-PT voice actor on the other hand? Ehhhh, i don't know, man, it's not that the actor that voices Dogtanian, João Lourenço, did a terrible job at it. Quite the opposite, he did a good job as well, but i just don't think his voice fits for that character because from what i know about Dogtanian, he's a child. He's supposed to have a more child-like voice, so hearing João do an adult voice for him just sounds pretty off even for a great performance.But other than that one instance, i think the dub still holds up very well. Given that it was done in 1983 and it's the only dub that is still available to watch after so many years is just as impressive as the PT-PT dub of all things Dragon Ball, except much better.But yeah, so that's Dogtanian and the three Muskehound. Overall, i think this show still holds up to this day after 40 years. The story is outstanding, the art and animation is great, the characters are very memorable, the sound is good, but the music needs a little more work, the dub is still pretty good to a certain degree and bottom line, i had a great time watching this classic gem.If you're a fan of literature-based shows who wants to watch a great adaptation of The three Musketeers, i highly recommend this anime. There's also the english dub for this anime, too. Not sure what it sounds like, but if you live in an english speaking country and want to watch this show in it's englsih dub, go to youtube and there you go. Have fun with this one. You won't regret it.This anime is definitely better than Mickey, Donald and Goofy: The three Musketeers. Now that's a fact that cannot be proven wrong.Anyway, that's my review of Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds, i hope you enjoyed my review for this anime and i'll see you guys next time. ;)";Recommended

0;Prism Magical: Prism Generations!;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;1;Oh look another trash anime without a review. Here I go as a dumbass watching it and being sick of it like most of the time this happens, and yeah this a quick rant.It is amazing something that is 15 minutes long has given me so much cringe but the cringe is not enough for me that it is not reflected on my face.First of all I don't get where did MAL get the info about the synopis. A treasure? What fucking treasure? School where was this school you are saying?This piece of turd is about some girls taking a bath in a hot spring and being taking care by some security, until one guy comes and is peeping them, and all of the sudden the girls and the boy become magical girls and stop these men that that are also peeping them.This OVA does not have anything of value nothing, NOTHING. The only thing that maybe it is good, it is because the girls appear full nude. Yeah no censorship at all. It seems that this shit only served to make some crazy people horny about some animation. Then anything is pure trash, garbage, crap, poop. excrement, diarrea and I can keep going.That's it about this one. I can't describe anything else because it is just that, a dumb promotion for a visual novel that barely no one has heard about.Even a 5.20 of mean score is way too much for feces like this.Well take care people in whatever you do and see you around.;Not Recommended
0;Gun x Sword-san;napolean86;https://myanimelist.net/profile/napolean86;7;These short episodes portray the cast of Gun Sword in a very wacky way. The characters appear as though they're in a cheap puppet show. So don't expect much in the way of art or storyline, but if all your looking for is a good laugh, then you could do far worse than watching Gun Sword-san. Oh, and Kameo the turtle talks.;Recommended
1;Gun x Sword-san;reidouraidou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/reidouraidou;9;Gonna keep it short and simple: Gun x Sword-san is among the best surrealist/absurdist anime out there. The main anime (GunxSword) is not even needed to enjoy this precious and fantastic gem. The only thing holding it back is being relegated to DVD when everything should be on streaming now.It has everything you need:Fast talking psycho charactersPervy talk4th wall-breaking shenanigansSubversive as hellHilarious critics about the anime cultureThe rough 3D models from 2005 are not a detriment at all. In fact, it just makes it even better for how absurd and budgety it feels.It's like crushing coal into a diamond. The VA's do God's work bringing these weird looking shapes into life, especially Kameo that apparently is almost a senile old man in the flower of his youth.There are so many meta jokes about the parent anime and the industry that it reminds me of how Gintama executed it's comedy way back when it was starting to air. The metaness of it all is very charming and it's important to value these old animes with this particular style cuz they are not a dime a dozen, that's for sure. Please go watch it right now, somehow;Recommended
0;Gun x Sword-san;GorfZaplen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GorfZaplen;1;DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME! Avoid this, especially if you enjoyed Gun X Sword. Every episode is a marathon test of your patience. I found myself checking the time left every episode and in every episode exactly two minutes were left. There is not a single funny joke here that it doesn't eventually run into the ground and grind to dust. This anime has personally caused me to reconsider the directorial talents of Goro Taniguchi, as no good director could make something like this willingly. I feel terrible for the dub voice actors that were likely forced into dubbing this, their captive families likely held at gunpoint in front of them as ransom. It was the longest 22 minutes of my life, I think, because after Gun X Sword-san my ability to distinguish time has been completely demolished. AVOID AVOID AVOID!;Not Recommended
0;Wan Jie Shen Zhu;Str8dope;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Str8dope;7;As of writing this there were 108 episodes of this show, all subbed on youtube. It's about a God, Lord of the Universe... This is what made the story interesting to me, compared with other Chinese fantasy shows... They usually focus on cultivation and spend hundreds of episodes on the character trying to become godly, but this guy just starts as an ancient god who has lived thousands of years. This is pretty much the only unique value of the show, aside from the generally good storytelling and lack of over-the-top action and cliches.Fight scenes don't span episodes, and actually have plot behind them.Character development is the weakest point of this show. The MC is cool, wise, sage-like, which is befitting a thousands-year-old god... But the relationships that he forms with everyone else in the show are very superficial.Overall, a story with a few unique ideas, set in the 'ancient chinese fantasy' theme, so if that's your thing like it is mine, then you should give it a watch.;Recommended
1;Wan Jie Shen Zhu;Ace3232;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ace3232;10;"(2022) This series is so good I'm writing my first official review. I admit: it's going to be a bit tricky to write because I want you to discover the surprises for yourself. This is one of the very few anime that, while it does peripherally have a modern twist to it, they don't beat you about the head with it. In fact, they only pull out the references every 10\20 episodes or so. So when you see it, you're genuinely surprised! They also *slowly* lead you to discovery the MC's back story. They spend far more time having really meaningful explorations of what's important.I will tell you that it took me multiple episodes that, also peripherally, this story is somewhat Dr. Who for a xanxia: he has female companions he deeply cares about, he uses his brain (and humor) to solve problems and the *space* he inhabits is (say it with me) bigger on the inside. And yes, he's a...wellll....you need to figure that one out yourself.There is great character development across the board. MC tries his best to reason with those sent to kill him and, best of, he treats them right. Thus, he has one loyal band of followers because he isn't a {insert word here}.Fun fact! He actually changes his outfit for *the right reason.* He doesn't wear either the same outfit for five seasons, nor does he change his outfit's color\keep it when he goes undercover. I really wish that the animators had actually shown a specific cross-anime shirt he referenced in the first or second episode.Music: I have to hand it to the music director. It's not canned music from other animes. I've especially appreciated that he\she created *very thoughtful instrumentation* that complimented those deeper conversations. Even the ""playful"" pieces aren't ditzy.If you gloss over this show, you're really going to miss some stellar, thoughtful interactions and plot development. Is it the best show I've ever, ever seen? Ehhhh maybe. I mean, I wish they had put this much thought (and upgraded 3DCGI) into Soul Land (eye roll).BTTH has some of the same, thoughtful scenes (see the Gazebo in a rainstorm scene where MC is pouring his heart out to Dad while the storm crescendos and decrescendos as he lets it all out).I'm surprised that I haven't seen this mentioned on more lists (esp. as I learned after the fact that it's one of the highest viewed shows in other parts of the world). It took me a *very* long time to understand and appreciate anime as I was long over screaming emo boys with spikey hair.Now I spend my time loving and researching shows like this as I'm trying to write my own.Pay attention to this one, and you'll be rewarded over and over.";Recommended
0;Wan Jie Shen Zhu;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;6;Wan Jie Shen Zhu follows a god named Ye Chen who reincarnated from a human of the modern world. Ye Chen has many roles as a god being the successor to the Holy Palace, King of Space gods and Lord of the Universe. However, Ye Chen abandons the Gods Realm due to the gods especially the Heir to the Snow God's Country pursuing Ye Chen for his overwhelming power.He escapes to live a life of peace in the Blue World - An ancient world in a different Galaxy from Earth. In this world, Ye Chen rescues people who have suffered from Northern Bei Di's tyrannical reign - a country that is controlled by antagonist gods. Ye Chen and the people he saves form a safe haven and opposing Sect called the Flower Palace which teaches its disciples high quality martial arts and methods from the modern world.Eventually, the Heir to the Snow God's country discovers Ye Chen's weakness is his followers and sends gods to pursue them inevitably provoking the lazy Ye Chen's rage. Ye Chen begins to build his army by collecting treasures and bestowing god status on his followers preparing to eliminate the Heir of Snow God's Country.Story: 6/10Lord of the Universe has ambitious goals of developing a wide story consisting of several worlds and many side characters. It even skips Ye Chen's reincarnation background, the backstory of how Tan Tai and Qinxue were saved by Ye Chen and the past grudges Ye Chen had with An Xue of the Snow God's Country. Instead of these more interesting storyline establishments, Lord of the Universe follows a harsh 20-30 episodes of trying to introduce many characters to us that by the time the story truly starts its already midway through the first season. It doesn't follow the typical beginning of reincarnation series which makes the beginning bland and hard to follow.Art - Sound | 6/10The character design of this series is pretty good. The main character doesn't look aggressive or wimpy and his clothing is well designed. The animation does leave a lot to desire though, the movements are basic and are easy to tell they have been rigged without motion capture. Although this may be true the character closeups and fight scenes are pretty good visual experiences.There are 2 sound tracks that stick out in this series - I couldn't find on YT so if you find it please let me know - There is a badass suspenseful soundtrack used whenever Ye Chen appears to save the day and a comedic/fun soundtrack that plays whenever Ye Chen provokes anyone from his harem. These 2 are pretty good memorable soundtracks, apart from that the series sound design and VA are pretty decent.Character: 5/10Ye Chen is a mysterious character in the beginning but we grow to know that he is a reincarnation from the modern world that introduces female spray perfume, Cola and iPads to the ancient blue world and to the gods. He is coined as the smartest person in the Universe by the gods but we don't get any directive content based on this apart from his dialogue explaining that he spent 900 years studying, hundreds of years mastering ancient board games and even some years indulged in sensual pleasure. We also see a glimpse of his dominance on the mortal world seeing as he controls 90% of the world's markets under a legitimate business that began on his luxury perfumes for nobles eventually spanning out more products like Cola and other modern ideas. He even has Newton's Cradle in his bedroom in one of the earlier 20s episodes.I think by showing Ye Chen's establishments we are just spoon fed content that could have been progressive. The series instead focuses on Ye Chen's accumulation of power to fight against the antagonist and this becomes his overarching goal in the first season. The story attempts to be vast but it doesn't develop the characters in a way that brings value to their existence - it essentially skips their development and shows us flashbacks of how they came to be. This is a basic way to progress since the series is already over 100 episodes, there won't be any emotional attachment if characters die.Enjoyment: 7/10I feel like this series will gradually get better the more you watch as I felt toward the end, but I hope it doesn't end up like Wu Geng Ji's way of repetitive progression. When writing this review I haven't watched past the first season of Lord of the Universe but my personal favorite moment from this season is the chess battle between Grandmaster Yi Xing and Ye Chen EP57 and the ending where Grandmaster Yi Xing is astounded at the digital chess on Ye Chen's iPad/tablet.- Unrelated Note -I dropped this 3 times in the past week because I couldn't find a place to watch all 60 episodes in ENG SUB. Even when I found places to watch with ENG SUB, they had poorly subbed english. Some subtitles were partly english partly indonesian/malay. The original animators posted the series on YouTube but they aren't in english and whenever someone uploads the english subbed version they get striked. In conclusion, this series is hard to find in good english so if you find a source, cherish it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ochamegami Monogatari: Korokoro Pollon;KillerOwlQueen;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KillerOwlQueen;8;stupid... very stupid but fun. It is pretty loyal to the source material. Ok not really, but more than I thought it would be, Zues is a womanizer, Hera is mad and all the other gods mostly fit into there stereotypes which is more than i could say about other animes based n greek mythology. I might just like this show and watched it when I was little, so nostalgia is a big factor for my enjoyment. Honesty the angle boy is the best, mainly because he is Eros and was in the show and that is cool because noramly he isn’t in things about greek mythology buuuuuuutttttt he isn’t correct characterized but i think they just needed to give polon a cute sidekick and his relationship with the other gods is correct (other gods mean Aphrodite). So if you want a stupid kids show with a little girl that lives in the land of greek gods, this is a perfect show for you.;Recommended
0;Xiao Qian;Lefastor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lefastor;9;You provably should watch before reading this. -Last edit---------I believe I watched this Movie/Film at my very young age, maybe when it came out or later, the thing is I couldn't really find it anywhere during year I never took it off my head, till someone once asked if it wasn't just a Dream, well maybe, cause in my head the Umbrella was Red, and she travelled inside it. There was even a scene where they stopped by a blossom tree in a little lagoon of lotus flowers in the middle of Green Plains. Also the pirate was more like sonic pirate or the ones from icecream, he had no legs and the robot was a ship with legs. The karneval was abit different the houses were more like the stone ones like in animes as Magi but they were way taller one above other with tons of Karvenal/Festival stuff and also those guys with long legs walking around, it was wonderfull, there was also the train travelling the universe in its way to a giant clock with clock pieces floating and etc, I didn't remember the dragon as a train but a guardian of the train or something since people where trying to capture or kill them, the part of that Tree witch was more like underwater cave and that other girl was a mermaid or something, the bad witch was their mother and wanted his soul then her sister closed the shell to stop her. Then after passing the rebirth clock, he woke up in a room with no roof doors windows (only the holes of doors windows etc) and paper chinese lamps to illuminate the place, blossom threes, etc, he went looking for her in every house.. he couldn't only find babys, he was one.. then he look up to the sky seeing the stars up there while screaming and crying..ETC, didn't say all details but that was how I imagined.. a love story between a boy and a ghost girl( how come I forgot that lovely dog.. maybe because my first dog got kill at my young age..it was my first friend/male dog, till then didn't have any pet that was just mine nor any male dog, my pet had 3 dogs but only a female dog survived.. later we had to give her away..etc..)old animes always look better in our heads than when watching again years later.. I kinda made it the only reason to continue here inbetween such garbage humanity, I thought about make the movie myself in 3D since I ended up studying 3D overall for 3 years, now I don't know... maybe I could make a different version but the movie exists, in my dream or memory was abit different, even the guy cards when they run away was like they grew up and made floating stairs.. Idk now. There's nothing else for me in this placeThe movie was released in 1997 so.. yeah older than myself , the dubbed ver was released in 2002 I guess, maybe I watched around that time or later, I was very young, like they say, before learning how to write you need to learn how to read. I believe I could read subtitles but not write at that young age.;Recommended
0;Xiao Qian;Arcanus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arcanus;6;"Before watching this movie, I made some research on it and ""don't expect to understand this one"" seemed to be the key phrase. Still, the synopsis was interesting enough and so I watched it anyway (I'm a sucker for Chinese folklore), although just expecting eye candy. In the end, I liked it! Though I warn you in advance: if you are not familiar with Chinese folklore (specially the tale of Xiao Qian and the tax collector Ning), you will find some of the concepts awkward, at best. Like, for example, the idea of ghost busting: if you are not familiar with the myths of supernatural powers possessed by Taoist masters, you will most likely laugh at it while recalling a certain American movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it.Story/World:Although it's not mandatory to know Chinese folklore in order to watch (and enjoy) the movie, you will miss out on a great deal if you don't keep up with all the Chinese mythological references (which the movie expects you to know, since it doesn't explain any of them). That said, the story is very singular, although odd and many times incomprehensible.We follow Ning, a debt collector, and his dog Solid Gold. They're wandering around (seemingly aimlessly) and end up in a ghost town. It's a story of a human falling in love with an enchanting ghost, followed by bizarre giant monsters, with some generic warriors helping along the way. And don't forget all the Chinese mythology references too (eye candy).Basically, don't watch this for the story if you have a short attention span. Although the creative storyline isn't necessarily directed to adults, it demands the comprehension of those at least 10 and up.Art/Animation:The art is nice. The character designs are Disney-ish in an unique way.Animation-wise, watching it now, don't expect something grand. The animation is quite good for its time (for the characters and its motions, I mean) but it's outdated (this movie is over 10 years old). That being said, lets also not forget that this is Chinese animation so, obviously, the style is also different. Animation excels in character motions, specially in action scenes, which are greatly done, using very creative camera angles and charming colors. Down side would be the the CG used, which is on the very low quality side. In fact, the use of both 2D and 3D don't go very well together: the 2D is great, the 3D fails.Character:Character designs are unique to the individuals. A lot of the personality can be deduced from how the characters look like. Of course, most of them are pretty linear, like the ""I trust everyone"" Ning (you wouldn't expect that kind of personality on a debt collector xD), the ""worship me"" Evil Mountain, the ""I'm awesome"" Ten Miles, the ""I'm god"" White Cloud or the ""too good for you"" Shine. However, although there is nothing utterly wrong, nothing really stands out in this department.Sound:Sound, sadly, is its biggest failing. The film was originally designed specifically around doing both Cantonese and Mandarin so you'd expect some failure there but, oddly enough, that's not where the failures appear. Actually, both audio languages are quite nice: the Cantonese brings less harsh character voices, since the dialogue sounds more like singing than talking, while the Mandarin is far more serious, with the extra work gone into drama. No, the problem is not the audio language.We then have a few Disney-ish musical moments throughout the movie, although they sound lovely in both audio tracks. No, the problem is also not in the songs.Unfortunately, it's the effects that fail the whole sound experience. They are mediocre and banal, at best. I even recognized sounds from a game, as well as numerous other films.Although the dramatic aspects are well held, very often the sound intrudes on a well animated tense moment, ruining the whole experience.The English dub is another fail, although not as prominent, because I recognize that it's somewhat hard to translate Chinese into English without it reading rather strange (cultural relativism). Nevertheless, the dialog is incredibly cheesy and, on many occasions, fails to deliver the original meaning of the story. I don't recommend it. The Mandarin and Cantonese tracks are both quite good and, although you are probably used to the clearer Japanese language, Chinese is very melodic so give it a try.Enjoyment:I liked the story and there were a few hilarious moments and awesome action scenes, but that was it. You can tell the movie is very ambitious and wildly imaginative. The love story portrayed is universal enough to be understood by anyone. So, if you can overlook the pathetic CG and the miserable sound effects, this movie will be something worth your time, otherwise, you watch it for the myth references only.Overall:Sadly, it fails to stand out thanks to several factors already stated and though it is re-watchable once or twice (to hear both audio tracks), that is about all.";Mixed Feelings
0;Xiao Qian;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;3;"Xiao Qian was released in the late 90s from the studio Triangle Staff. That's right, one of the studios behind Uchuu Kaizoku Mito and the studio we have to thank for Serial Experiments Lain. It's based off of the short story Nie Xiaoqian. So, let's see how it holds up as a film. Story:We follow a young debt collector, Ning as he takes a journey to forget his former beloved Lan Siu who left him on account of his ignoring her in favour of earning money. Dude, we get it you need money but a successful relationship is built on communication. You can't just ignore your partner. In any case, he encounters a pair of ghost busting monks who purify some evil spirits in front of him. While he runs and  waves his arms about like a right useless bastard. After the excitement, he continues on his journey only to find himself in  city filled with spirits and uncertain how to survive. Let's dig right into the primary issue that plagues this film. The pacing. And this isn't like yesterday's subject either where the pacing could have been better but wasn't that bad. In this it's an absolute mess. Once the film's gotten going we can't get a couple minutes between one long action sequence involving a lot of shouting and the next. Its like Ning's whole shtick is getting carried into absurd situations where he's completely useless. He's like Yamcha. There's also the big romance plot. Which is complete tripe. Our leads have no chemistry, seemingly nothing whatsoever in common and no apparent reason behind one being attracted to the other. He basically looks at her and thinks ""wow, she's pretty."" then she sees him and thinks ""I'm going to steal his life force"" but then changes her mind and falls for him for no apparent reason. Which is a general problem with the film. A lot of the ""motivations"" are nonsense. The ending is pretty shit too. Characters:In addition to the motivation problem, one of the big character issues has to do with consistency. I touched on that with the romance, but it goes deeper than that. There are characters who will quite literally switch their positions in five minutes without any compelling reason to do so. But the worst element of the characters has to be Ning. Not only is he pretty damn annoying, but he's a completely useless character. This isn't like Spirited Away where an everyday protagonist goes to a world of spirits and does well for themselves. This dude is completely out of his depth the entire time. And that type of character only really works in a comedy and even then you don't want them as the lead. Art:The art is a bit more mixed than the other elements. On the positive side, some of the supernatural designs look pretty good and the film does do a good job with making the city of spirits look pretty vibrant and unique. On the negative side, the animation is very clumsy and the designs for the more ordinary parts of the world are crap. There's also the issue with the CG elements not meshing well with the more traditional animation. Sound:The acting is, at best, barely passable. Maybe it's just that the script involves a lot of frantic shouting and it's really grating. Maybe it's that the actors, as a whole, sound like they don't give a shit but the consequence is that the performances just aren't very good. The music is okay. Ho-yay:There is none. Which suits me fine because, judging by what they do with the romance they do have, it wouldn't have been good. Final Thoughts:Xiao Qian is pretty bad. It's riddled with story problems, characterisation is weak and inconsistent, it doesn't look or sound good. I'm going to give it a 3/10. Tomorrow  I'll end the week with a look at Aki no Kanade.

Just so this is perfectly clear, I don't treat a Hentai series any different to any other genre.Another thing I want to mention is that I've watched everything there is on the Nanoha canon and I'm totally aware that everything began with an eroge that later would turn into this anime and eventually Nanoha was fully reborn as a magical badass. In any case, I went into this with an open mind and expecting something completely different to the Nanoha-verse (which it is).Animation:1) it's what you'd expect from shows back in 20022) it lacks visual accuracy in some scenes (ex: if a character is driving, depending on the angle, it might have the seatbelt or not).3) the animation and the dialog aren't always in syncSound:1) sountrack is pleasant2) the voice acting might actually be the worst team performance I've ever experiencedStory and characters:1) The 1st episode really surprised me when it came to the sex scene because I thought based on the MAL description, that this would be another harem situation2) I don't like underage, rapey, sexist stuff.3) the last 2 episodes, there's an actual plot but it was boring and uninteresting. I also think that the last episode took too longOverall and because it's not the ""usual stuff that you see in every hentai clip on the internet"", it's a 6/10 for me.";Mixed Feelings
0;Triangle Heart: Sazanami Joshi Ryo;Yukito-Atari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yukito-Atari;4;"Hello everyone and welcome to my first review on MAL. I just finished Triangle Heart : Sazanami Joshi Ryo and started the sequel. The review will contain spoiler at the 3rd block because the synopsis don't reviel enough. But first, Let me ask you, the reader, two simple question :-Are you here reading this because of the serie named ""Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha"" ?-Do you plan to watch this for a good fap ?If you answer a single one of those question with ""yes"", stop right there and read this, otherwise, you will lose 2h30 of your precious time.What's ""Triangle Heart : Sazanami Joshi Ryo"" and how is it related to the Nanoha serie ? Let me answer your question with some historical stuff related about everything on the origin of Nanoha. At first, there was an eroge named Triangle Heart back in the end of the last century. Eroge at the time was a new market on Windows PC and the genre was just starting to getting popular in the Otaku subculture. When you succeed to have a popular title, you try to use the trademark you already paid for and use that brand name to make sale of anything, just for milking the brand for getting more money. Triangle Heart was one of those brand at the time. They made an unrelated sequel using the brand name which was about a dude getting a job as janitor in a woman dormitory, it was a success and they wanted more profit from the brand and decide to adapt all the arc of the eroge into a 5 episode anime which's literally this anime (Sazanami Joshi Ryo). Each arc have different storyline which seem not getting any relation between them, mostly like the original Triangle Heart and Triangle Heart 2 was not related, the arc are sharing the setting and character but not the same plot.Episode 1 was like an introduction of the character and trying to make the Cat God Girl liking the dude. Episode 2's another arc, now they want to make the samurai girl laugh because she's too stiff. Episode 3's the one where i start to loss it and it's when i start to say it don't make any sense anymore. Episode 3 has a plot in the same setting has the anime Isuca from Winter 2014/2015, the samurai girl and two of her relative are now fighting again demonic spirit with their katana. Finally, Episode 4 & 5 has the same arc, it's something who has a plot similar to Elfen Lied... I know your reaction, WTF ! Isuca to Elfen Lied. The story's about a girl of the dorm being a genetic engineered angel who has a genetic engineered fairy friend with ESP power with a degenerative condition taking a lot of pill for her ESP power which has some making her really horny (PS : Not worth the fap because no booner, will explain later). They both fight again another ESP genetic engineered fairy which has the same DNA has the other Fairy. Add some terrorist plot and you have the story of the last arc. Add also unrelated scene like some basketball game and you get it.Now, you want to know why it's not a good hentai for fapping ? I would not event call this an hentai nor an ecchi. At first, it has nudity but there's no teasing like in an ecchi and the boob grabbing scene has some bad voice actress. The first two episode has a straight sex scene between the janitor and the same girl. The main problem, it's slow to begin the fun and it end in less than 1 minutes after it begin. The H-Scene are literally less than 3min per episode which are 30min each. It has the biggest mosaic i have ever seen and it's really miss-positioned that it hide non sex stuff, the moans are bad and not event exciting, it sound like an old milf faking really hard on a microphone it's not event enough to gave you an erection and if you do, you will loss it because the h-scene are a single small 3 minutes run time per episode, can you came in 30sec ? No, then don't event try to fap. The 3rd episode's has an unneeded Yuri h-scene between the samurai girl and her cousins. She's supposed possessed from a demon which force her to ask why she was treated like a kid... It don't event look like she's possess at all. 4th episode's has a female masturbation scene with the angel girl starting in her room after taking some pill of drug, i don't know how the transition was done but seem they change the cut to the bathroom directly with no transition... Being horny, she masturbate on the border of the bath and when her wing opened and golden shower... -_- Last episode start with another Yuri h-scene between the angel and the fairy because the fairy took the drug, another background change without transition, both flying, some licking and leg crossing masturbation and the fairy climax and she make another golden shower. It totally lack originality and the short duration will make you lose your flaccid erection if you manage to get one.So, returning about the history about how it's related to Nanoha. Triangle Heart 2 was not the last opus using the brand, there was 2 Triangle Heart 3 and a bonus short eroge. One of the Triangle Heart 3's the Nanoha eroge (no english translation, sorry folk) and the other one's the unrelated sequel with Nanoha's brother and sister being something like anti-terrorist agent using katana. This one's the one you want to watch it anime which's totally unrelated to Sazanami Joshi Ryo. It's named Sweet Songs Forever. For Nanoha, it has got an AMV which's called ""Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha : Lyrical Toy Box"". The AMV was so popular they milked the story and made the well know Nanoha Anime Serie we all know today. On all those anime serie, the only thing related was the art style and character who has a lot of them looking like Fate from Nanoha in both Triangle Heart anime. So, what happened to Triangle Heart eroge ? Ivory decide to make a new eroge called Wanko to Kurasou and finally got closed down from Janis who own Ivory. With Ivory being closed down by Janis which own the right of Nanoha, it took 8 year to finally get the sequel named Vivid. Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrickerS was made around the time Ivory disappear and there was only remake of the first two season before the new series named Vivid. Also, if you did not know, the voice actress of Nanoha's quitting from being a senyuu, so enjoy Vivid while it last.It was a long review with a ton of information, i did not enjoy it very much and was mostly confusing about the plot of the anime starting with episode 3 and i came worse each following scene on episode 4 and 5. Overall, it was so much confusing than i literally got the impression i lost 2h30 of my time thinking it was related to Nanoha... Final score 4/10. Don't watch except if you did read the eroge Triangle Heart 2 and want to see the nice old school adaptation.";Not Recommended
0;Bloody Night;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;6;Esta review también está en español.Bloody Night (BN) is the third short film made by Nagao Takena, and is when he starts to get serious in this claymation thing. Truth be told, the two previous works were quite simple and crude.The story of BN is about a girl who is walking in what appears to be the most dangerous alley ever. She's alone, but armed with... a purse. Great. Out of nowhere, a red monster appears, and a dramatic chase begins, in which our young heroine must run faster than ever in her silly life...The animation is as smooth as it can be when the characters are made of clay. The characters are well done (nothing really outstanding, but they're fine), and the landscapes are almost absent: 95% of the time we only see black (cause... you know, is night). The amount of blood is ridiculously abundant, typical of a B-movie xD. The special effects (cause yes, this movie have special effects) are terribly bad, but amusing, to say at least.The sound... well, it's a silent film, so there are no voices. But the music is pretty good, especially in the tension moments. It remind me a lot to the style of the Sega Genesis, specially the game Splatterhouse (which is kinda appropriate).I recommend this short film to people... not very impressionable. Yes, it's clay, but Mr. Takena's work is famous for its violence, gore, guts and impossible amount of blood. If you like horror, and this kind of animation is your stuff, you surely will like this. It's not ground breaking or incredibly original, but it is interesting. And if you liked this short, I also recommend the other works of Takena, especially Bloody Date.--------Bloody Night (BN) es el tercer cortometraje de Nagao Takena, y es cuando empieza a ponerse serio en este asunto de la claymation. La verdad, los dos cortos anteriores eran bastante simples y precarios...La historia de BN trata sobre una chica rubia que está caminando en lo que parece ser el callejón más peligroso del mundo. Sola, y... armada con una... cartera. Genial. De la nada, un monstruo rojo aparece, y empieza una dramática persecución en la que nuestra joven heroína deberá correr por su vida...La animación es todo lo fluida que puede ser cuando los personajes son de plastilina. Los personajes están bien hechos (nada espectacular, pero correctos), y el paisaje es casi inexistente: el 95% del tiempo veremos negro. La cantidad de sangre que vemos es ridículamente abundante, típica de una película clase B xD. Los efectos especiales (por que sí, hay) son terriblemente malos, pero al menos causan gracia.El sonido... bueno, es una película muda, así que no hay voces. Pero la música es bastante buena, especialmente en los momentos de tensión. Me recuerda mucho al estilo de la Sega Genesis (puntualmente el Splatterhouse).Recomiendo este corto a personas no muy impresionables. Si, es plastilina, pero el trabajo del señor Takena es bastante violento, siendo común el desmembramiento, las tripas y galones de sangre. Si les gusta el horror, y les atrae el estilo de animación, este corto les va a gustar. No es una obra rompe esquemas o increíblemente original, pero es interesante. Y si les gusto este corto, también recomiendo los otros trabajos de Takena, especialmente Bloody Date.;Mixed Feelings
1;Bloody Night;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;overall:5I will try a different form of review for this one. I will compare and contrast it to its counter part bloody date.Bloody Night what it lacked in character visual/story/ horror made up with the 'good' ending.sound: not sure why the creator chose not to do sound. wouldn't be that hard... hell, would have improved his audience views. Even if the sound was comical like three stooges.character: still lacking background... how did the girl get there? what was said exactly? i could go on and on.P.s. to the creator if you are alive and can read this please do not use your power in clay animation for horror try a different genre like comedy.;Mixed Feelings
0;Tsurupika Hagemaru-kun;space_duck;https://myanimelist.net/profile/space_duck;8;This series was one of my all-time favorites growing up along with other timeless shows such as Doraemon, Shin-chan, Ninja Hattori and Kochikame.It's such a simple premise, yet the ingenuity and creativity shown from each episode makes it refreshing. If you are looking for a chill easy to watch anime then your search is over. An anime doesn't need to have a great story, stunning art and music from popular bands. Enjoyment knows no such thing. Sometimes it is just the way characters interact in a particular scenario or just the sheer ridiculous answers the Hagemaru gives to questions that will make you laugh, but you will laugh.Don't worry about the ratings, reviews and opinions.

0;Toshi wo Totta Wani;Jolon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jolon;5;The Old Crocodile feels like an anime version of one of Aesop's fables. However, as the credits rolled, I was struggling to sort out what the moral was supposed to be.The English voicing is excellent, and Peter Barakan's voice brings to mind narration of Madeline or Curious George from my childhood. This anime short would stand in good stead in that company, with a very similar tone and feel. One is left with the vague idea that they are watching children's PBS broadcasting.The characters are strange, and as I initially wondered why anyone would create this, as it clearly seems aimed at children but is so baffling and strange. However, a child's notion of what is strange and too fantastical is far less fixed than an adult's, and I don't think its story or the character's motivations and actions would seem unbelievable to the intended audience.As it is, without giving any spoilers, Octopus's reactions to Crocodile seem surreal and incredulous. The ending was stranger still, but by then I had learned to just roll with it and enjoy the journey The Old Crocodile was taking me on.As a short anime work, it pails in comparison to Tsumike no Ie, the work most similar in length and tone that I can think of, but is still worth your time as a curiosity and as a short children's story stands on its own merit.;Mixed Feelings
0;Toshi wo Totta Wani;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;4;"This feels like one of Yamamura's more commercial works, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were commissioned. The art is simple and childlike and a tad crude, but it can be charming when it comes to the animation, though it's nothing very exceptional, especially with the more abstract and dramatic forms Yamamura has committed to the medium. Yeah, this must be one of his worst, other than some of the quite amateurish early credits, and even as a committed Yamamura fan, I saw this as a completionist nope for the longest time.It's like some kind of fable without much of a lesson, and I definitely don't care if it has one, but if you forced me to answer what I thought the point was, I'd say: ""Don't eat your friends and family. First, believe in yourself, get a really good tan until you're sunburned, wait until people form a cult around you, and then they will feed themselves to you."" Deep enough for a fortune cookie message?It becomes more about the adventure, a few themes, and the fantasticalness of it all. A kind of macabre whimsy. It's quite slow and painful in its point a to point b linear telling of the crocodile's tale, and we're given the banal, rather non-artistic treatment of narration and voices from one professional actor with a dramatic TV voice, making the whole thing feel like National Geographic, but with a staff far too lazy to head to Egypt and mosey on into the Nile for a crocodile.It seems to be the kind of thing made without a clear-cut audience, and I see this as having a very limited appeal: too cute for film circuit snobs, not cute enough for anime fans, too grotesque for children, overly childish for adults, slooooow for the TV viewer, a little mundane for the Yamamura fan, and too unreal for the people weird enough to actually sit through animal documentaries. And while horror fans wouldn't be into this, the POV shot towards the end is really disturbing.I definitely get scorpion and the frog boat ride lol lmao vibes from the relationship between the dimwitted octopus and the crotchety crock, though it's not quite the same. I'm also really hungry, and I wish I could have eaten the octopus—if only to have ended the story faster.";Not Recommended

Generally, shorts like this are known to lack of depth in fleshing out characters, setting, and thorough story progression. This one is no exception. That said, viewers will be happy to know that in this particular case, being short and simple is hardly a problem here. Though lacking any crazy depth and extravagant themes, the message of the story gets across and we are rewarded with a 11minutes of bliss.So what's this all about? Well, it's a story of man's best friend, and the unbreakable bond between the two. Altogether, it's enjoyable given its short time-frame.

0;Shi Xiong;Mnemease;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mnemease;7;"Although subject to debate, this anime was one of the main influential works in recent developments in Chinese young-adult animation. On the original airing platform of Tencent, the series quickly rose to prominence, which was quite rare to see around that time given the sheer number of well-developed Japanese animations that are on that site. So, I guess for Chinese viewers it has a bit of historical significance.Shi Xiong is, at heart, a humorous parody, meant to poke fun at certain qualities of modern Chinese society and the state of the world as a whole. The main character makes up for his lack of character development with his witty internal monologue, which drips with sarcasm at the end of every second sentence. Given how his cell phone ring tone is ""your grandson is calling you"", it comes as no surprise that he has quite a definitive personality.The ""zombie"" construct is a pretty common one (though perhaps not ones that attend anime conventions and mutate from cannibalism), as is idea of the overpowering antagonist who never seems to die. The story follows the general zombie apocalypse archetype wherein the protagonist tries to survive and save as many people as possible. However, the author does put an interesting spin on everything that does happen - which is often very, very random - so overall the plot remains reasonably exciting. After all, it's not every day that you see a zombie with an obsession with paper currency.Overall, the quality of illustration is average (still better than most of these current horrendous modern Chinese kids cartoons though, so I guess it was expected given the historical background). The first episode is in a completely different style from the others, so maybe watch the second one if you want an idea of what the art is generally like. I do happen to really like the voice actors though, especially the male lead. He plays the part quite well and adds quite a bit of liveliness to the whole dreary backdrop.One thing I've noticed about this recent wave of Chinese anime is that they tend to end seasons abruptly at weird places, and Shi Xiong is, unfortunately, no exception. There is a second season of this (which ends at an even weirder spot) that happens to have pretty awkward pacing and is overall a huge disappointment. The conclusion we can draw from this is that, if you're going to watch this series, don't get too invested in it.Overall, Shi Xiong is a fun series that makes you question the author's sense of moral decency sometimes (some jokes are inappropriate enough that they are now deleted from the online manga due to Chinese government censorship). It's definitely worth watching if you happen to like gore, cute kids dressed as giraffes, damsels in distress, internet language, and middle aged drag queens.";Recommended
0;Shi Xiong;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;"Zombie Brother recapIn H City, a populous and technologically urban city has its water supply infected with a pathogen that mutates humans into zombies. Xiaofei is the protagonist of a satire, parodical zombie donghua that picks at the western and eastern apocalyptic medium. His purpose is to make it out of H City safely to reunite with his concerned Mother; However, the government quarantines Xiaofei and other helpless people inside H City forcing them to fend for themselves, will Xiaofei manage to sneak out safely or will the ever-evolving intelligent zombies capture him.Story & Characters: 4/10The story starts off atypical of eastern apocalypic media with pathogen-contaminated water consumed by humans. The events also follow suit of a main character finding his/her way out of the apocalypse's ground zero; However, Shi Xiong does it very differently. The story events have twists that reference franchises like Pokemon, Naruto, Bleach, Fairytail, The Walking Dead, Train to Busan etc. which was a nice touch in the beginning but gradually became the go-to method to pause the plot development. The characters are a bit interesting with personalities involving a homoerotic author, policewoman, abandoned child and many others. Shi Xiong makes some good effort in maintaining a character palette but it still feels like the characters are somewhat disposable and die for illogical reasons.Art & Sound: 3/10The first season art and animation was atrocious to watch even for a low budget donghua, it makes sense since it was released in 2015. However, it is the art that made it a very distracting experience; I assume this was intentional considering the satirical nature and budget related constraints the studio behind this show wanted to adhere. The character designs are very artificially like even more so as a 2D animation. Overall, not impressed with the visuals of this series first season as it discouraged suspense in a lot of scenery and angles/shots.I am not surprised with the sound either; Most of the time the sound doesn't suit the atmosphere. The sound quality itself is fairly decent for a small time 2015 donghua but there was a lot of background noise or reverberation that made it sound cheaply mixed. Especially Xiaofei's dialogue considering the series is filled with 90% of his monologue and char dialogue.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10This season could have been better developed if it didn't use gag references to other franchises while it gets serious. A lot of characters could have remained in the story because of their out-of-touch and engaging personalities. The scenery could have also been created more porportionately as many different angles distorted the details of the scenery/background especially during the weeb crowd event. I may not watch the second season because of the repetitive satire of the series.";Not Recommended

1;Denshinbashira Elemi no Koi;AMS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AMS;7;"When my anime club voted to watch ""Denshinbashira Elemi no Koi"" I was surprised, and expected it to be another poor title not worthy of watching to the end. With the basic idea of it, you just think to yourself ""I should get high before watching this!"" or ""That's just insane, they're really scraping the bottom for ideas now"" but that just isn't the case.Elemi no Koi is a surprisingly well developed story. As strange as the idea of the show is to get used to, the story is rather relateable. Once you get past the initial weirdness of Elemi no Koi, you find that it's not all that different from many other anime.While it's not a total tearjerker, Elemi no Koi has sad moments that really make you sympathize with the characters.The artistic style is rather uncommon, in that it is a claymation, but don't let this mislead you. Whereas the viewer might expect something childish out of a claymation, this anime actually has surprising depth and maturity.Most of the time in this anime there is little to no sound, such as music or special sound effects. Most of the sound is speech between characters, or the occasional background noise. The budget may not have been large, but as far as I can tell this was not intended to save money, but to make an impact. As bizarre as the story may be, you really get a sense of reality from it.I was surprised to find how well presented the characters were in the show. Despite the characters being completely different, you can always understand them and relate to them.In the end, the show doesn't go for your classic ""good vs. evil"" approach or absurd silliness or action, which so many anime rely on, but instead approaches from the perspective of thoughts and feelings. From this, the entire show has a very unique approach to something that a general audience can enjoy.This wasn't my favourite anime, and it doesn't even make it into my top ten, but it was so much better than I expected, and I'm willing to say that this anime is generally underrated and overlooked.";Recommended

The sound effects were key in achieving this and they were done exceptionally well.The music kept the tone of the film, and the ED planted my feet gently back on the ground after this sweet experience was over.The character designs of the telephone poles themselves were whimsical and expressive, being able to translate a variety of traits and emotions with very little dialogue. I was impressed, given the large number of anime characters out there that fail to do this.If you were a kid with a big imagination, have ever tried to be someone you're not or been in a long distance relationship.. well, Elemi no Koi may reveal itself to you to be the underrated gem that it is.;Recommended

But of course it's slow. It's a meditation on impossible love, the struggle of communication, and the limitations of identity.The level of detail on the various telephone poles is kind of astonishing, especially where it crosses over into how they show personality. Same for the human characters. Some of those facial animations were extremely good without hitting the uncanny valley.

0;Denshinbashira Elemi no Koi;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;1;"It's interesting to think of Denshinbashira Elemi no Koi as a nostalgic sendoff to the landline phone era and its greater intimacy. Cellphones appear nonexistent or a luxury of the wealthy, and the technology is suggestive of the 1980s or the 1990s. We've yet to reach the nadir of poorly composed text messaging filled with baby talk in Elemi. However, the story may be too plain, were the creators to treat us to the standard bittersweet and long-distance romance facilitated by the phone. Instead, we're presented with a literal goodbye to the era, as Takahashi, without foreknowledge, becomes entangled in a lovey-dovey and electrifying tryst with an ANTHROPOMORPHIZED TELEPHONE POLE! Telephone pole... Yes, telephone pole. T-E-L-E-P-H-O-N-E P-O-L-E...How does one get roped into the incel to ""Mom, I'm dating a telephone pole"" pipeline? No, Takahashi couldn't simply be ""normal"" and stock up on PVC figurines or snuggle up with an anime girl pillow. He had to be special and straddle a telephone pole to shock and awe an audience that would have otherwise rightfully concluded that the staff was doing little more than phoning it in.There are plenty of dates you can't bring home to mom, but this is going a bit too far, and I can imagine the awkward silence unfurling between the older, probably married, co-worker and Takahashi:Co-worker: So, Takahashi, how is your sex life?Takahashi: (blushes) W-what!?Co-worker: I can see it in your rosy-red cheeks (winks). Tell me about her. (He visibly snorts steam into his nostrils.)Takahashi: Well... I have been talking to a girl lately... and, you see, uh, um, t-telephone p-p-pole.Co-worker: Is that what you're calling your little engine that could, champ? (He tosses a copy of The Little Engine that Could onto the table, inching it toward Takahashi.)Takahashi: (Screaming, he squeezes his eyes shut in that embarrassed schoolgirl confessional way so familiar to anime.) I'm in love with Elemi! The telephone pole across the street! She's very pretty, and her face resembles your favorite character from the train series! (He points to the company's copy of Thomas the Tank Engine on the shelf and then bows multiple times while babbling.) I mean, uh... if Thomas had a sister (Takahashi looks excited).Co-worker: Reading these books has led to you developing a complex. You're a Denchucon.Takahashi: No, she's real. Don't you believe me?Co-worker: I'm sure you've stuck a few forks into random sockets in your lifetime, but how do you expect me to believe such a shocking story, Takahashi? Listen, you know how I asked you to dog-sit while I'm out of town next week? Let's cancel that.Takahashi: What? But why?Co-worker: ...After a long workday, Takahashi clocks out and stands near a telephone pole, craning his head to look at her well-endowed cross-arms; the hum of her transformer soothes him. Ever since childhood, he liked tall women. Even ones taller than him. And this was one tall woman: a gorgeous galvanizing giantess, he thought... oh, my sweet pole princess... I hope she falls over and crushes me like a bug. ""HELP, HELP! It's him! It's the Denchu Diddler, and he's struck again! Look at the illegal things he's doing to that poor defenseless telephone pole! Take him to prison..."" yells the co-worker at the top of his lungs while peering at Takahashi from a company window. Takahashi blushes, runs face-first into the telephone pole, hems and haws around to apologize to the telephone pole, and finally makes his way down the street and turns the corner. The co-worker and everyone at the company laugh. They joke about it every day. They hide photographs of telephone poles in Takahashi's desk drawer and accuse him of looking at pornography while on the job. One of the co-workers even spray paints Takahashi's apartment complex with the line ""THE DENCHU DIDDLER LIVES HERE!""What does one even say in response when your conversational partner is that deep into the sunk cost fallacy and indulges in the most bizarre erotic target location error imaginable? Anthropomorphism in fiction has gotten weird. It used to be cute, innocent, and even sophisticated back when people like Beatrix Potter were illustrating children's books, along with numerous other artists and storytellers from various countries, who would use these same kind of characters. Then drugs and sex saturated popular culture and became a more significant part of fiction, with animators like Ralph Bakshi and numerous comic artists injecting these talking animal works with a steady dose of cocaine and hookers. Somewhere along the way, furries became a viral internet sensation, and we've been shambling about blind while burning in hell ever since.The set pieces, animation, production values, etc., are all fine. There are no serious issues from a technical standpoint. However, a few scenes that didn't directly involve Elemi or Takahashi felt out of place or pointless. I'd be lying if I said it was not sloooow and booooring, but it's sort of like an old realistic slice of life film—it's just more offbeat because, you know—telephone pole dancing—but if you imagine this as a typical romance film, it doesn't stand out in script or delivery. Everything hinges upon the curious concept. Most of all, I hate this kind of ""Oh, it's such a quirky tale of forbidden love, how bittersweet. Such is life. Boo hoo."" Takahashi is such a loser that he gets rejected by a telephone pole. Remember, when life gets rough, and you start to call yourself a loser, think of Takahashi. ""At least I didn't get rejected by a telephone pole like that loser Takahashi.""No matter how disgusting you think certain fetish content is, you probably understand why and how it might exist. But a botched escapade of hopeless romance between a telephone pole and a 25-year-old man? Now I've seen everything, and I know the so-called rule 34 is alive and well. By the end, trying to be objective in my appraisal, I thought, ""Well, it's not so bad, I guess. Fair enough execution."" Then I'm like... I just watched a 44-minute short film about a failed relationship between a 25-year-old man and a telephone pole. What the hell? 1/10...One by one, the street lamps flicker out; the windows go dark. A pitch-blackness spreads across the city in one monolithic sweep. Takahashi scales Elemi as a strange auroral light envelopes him, shifting from a sickly green to a bloody red. He says, ""You've been a dirty girl, Elemi. A filthy girl."" The glimmering stars become engorged, and they throb like hearts, and he notices the moon is watching him climb Elemi. The moon flashes its vast Thomas-the-Train-Engine grin and winks, drool dripping down from the corner of its mouth and all over the streets. If Takahashi squints, he can see that the stars are not just blinking figuratively but have actual peepers and are watching the action with bated breath. Elemi moans ecstatically. ""Takahashi, we're being watched,"" she says, discharging electricity. Takahashi gets a jolt out of hammering nails into Elemi as he climbs. ""I'll fasten a clamp on you when I get up there."" ""You got the new pole clamp!? Oh, yes!""The other utility equipment and telephone poles twitch into life. ""Mind if we join in, Takahashi?"" They laugh and whip their wires around. Elemi flicks her eyelashes and licks her red lips in anticipation. Suddenly, the ground splits beneath them, and they fall into darkness. The earth swallows them, masticating them between a gnarled bunch of stony teeth. The billions of stars, the moon, and other anthropomorphized entities scream. Takahashi yelps, Elemi Squeals, the alarm clock wails, and the co-worker shrieks and snaps awake in a cold sweat.""What kind of terrible nightmare was that?"" the co-worker mutters aloud, gasping for breath. He gets the Sunday newspaper and places it on the table. The front page story involves a death, which is unusual for his small town.

0;Nendo no Tatakai;pawlogp07;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pawlogp07;7;I think this is the most underrated meme anime of all time. Even though this is a clay stop-motion animation and it has no sound, the events in the story and the clay figures itself are preety well done. In my opinion this is the best part of the series (there is also Battle of Clay 2, and the 2019 remake, but they are both not great, and I'll probably write a review of them as well). I can definitely see why it has a very low score, but in my opinion it doesn't deserve to be one of the lowest rated anime on MAL. This is probably the highest non ironic review of Battle of Clay that you will ever see.;Recommended
1;Nendo no Tatakai;SoiledX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SoiledX;10;this is by far the greatest piece of fiction ever published to the online web-space. I am so honored to be a part of this historic treasure, and I think the plot to this anime rivals competitors like Attack on Titan and Keeping up With the Kardashians. I loved every second of this and the combat was unmatched. I re-watched this masterpiece again today as it was the dying wish of my pet hermit crab. The animation is flawless, the soundtrack made me cry, and the characters are very loveable. Love how the dog comes back at the end. 10/10;Recommended

Then this is for youBattle of Clay is apparently a homemade video some guy did about some pieces of clay which are then formed into a couple of claymen. We then get to see them rolling around and fighting each other... in stop motion. So this isn't really 2D at all, it's actually live action (if you can count stop motion as ""live"" that is)There is no semblance of a story whatsoever, they just attack each other with their fists, hammers and a ball of tape. There was also a pig involved somewhere along the way.... for god knows what reasonAs far as audio goes, the creator has uploaded two different versions. The first one is a silent movie. Like literally, there's no audio whatsoever. The second one however does have sound... that is to say it has squeaking sounds, bleeps and other completely random sound effects that barely make any sense at allIf this sounds just like what you've always wanted to see then you can find this illustrious masterpiece on the creator's YouTube channel here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_s6bUJsezY (silent version)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgQCt4uozxk (squeaky version)";Not Recommended
1;Nendo no Tatakai;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;4;Esta review también está en español.Battle of Clay (BoC) is the first short film made by Nagao Takena, that silly mate that has a wierd affinity with the clay.With a humor similar to that in the Looney Toons, BoC is about a red clayman and a yellow clayman who fight in a cartoonish way. A dog is there, too.The animation is... poor (after all, Takena made this film when he was in high school), the characters are very simple (the red man is plump, the yellow one looks like one of those heads in the Easter Island, and the puppy is... cute n_n), and there's no sound of any kind.In summary, this short is simple (to not say bad) and low quality. I will recommend it to people who like Takena's style, and want to know how everything began. But, just like with Battle of Clay 2, I also recommend this to those who have a minute and fifty-seven seconds free. I bet most of the people reading this review will go to youtube to see this, just for curiosity. And for the same reason, I recommend the other Takena works. They're longer (up to six minutes), with better quality, and Bloody Date even have a satisfactory story. But wait! Unlike this short, which is rather plain and have an innocuous humor, the rest of his works are famous for their violence... so, if the (clay) gore is not your stuff, stay away.--------Battle of Clay (BoC) es el primer cortometraje hecho por Nagao Takena, ese individuo que tiene una extraña afinidad con la plastilina.En un estilo de humor similar al de los Looney Toons, BoC es sobre un hombre de plastilina rojo y uno amarillo peleando de forma caricaturesca.La animación es... precaria (después de todo, Takena hizo este film cuando estaba en secundaria!), los personajes muy simples (el hombre rojo es redondito, el amarillo parece una de las cabezas de las Isla de Pascuas, y el perrito es... tierno n_n), y no hay sonido de ningún tipo.En resumen, este corto es simple (por no decir malo) y de baja calidad. Voy a recomendarlo a las personas a las que les gusta el estilo de Takena, solo para que vean como empezó todo. Pero, al igual que con Battle of Clay 2, también recomiendo esto a quienes tengan 1 minuto y 56 segundos de los cuales puedan prescindir. Muy probablemente todas las personas que lean esta review vallan a youtube para ver esto, por simple curiosidad. Y por esa misma curiosidad, recomiendo que vean los otros trabajos de Takena. Son más largos (hasta seis minutos), de mejor calidad, y Bloody Date incluso tiene una historia satisfactoria. Eso sí: a diferencia de este corto, que es más bien simple y presenta un humor bastante inocuo, el resto de sus trabajos son famosos por su violencia... así que si el gore (de plastilina) no les va, manténganse alejados.;Not Recommended

0;Sono Kinisasete yo: My My Mai;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;6;"What do you get when you combine a sexy big breasted girl with a perchance for losing her clothing with stories of mystery and mysticism? Why you get My My Mai and a whole lot of animated boobs and echii situations. Poor Mai is never going to be able to get married.The story is a bit of a Frankenstein of themes. Mai is a super counselor, though I am not sure this really translates that well. She’s part private detective, psychologist, and exorcist. Clients come to her as a last resort, when everyone else fails Mai can get the job done. The series consists of four stories, two of which are related but encompass completely different situations. There isn’t anything deep about any of them and the basically revolve around getting Mai out of her clothes or being fondled or molested by the rest of the cast. Some of it is pretty amusing in that ""I shouldn't really think this is funny but it is"" kind of way. The highlights being Mai ""exorcising"" Satan while wearing a bikini made of crosses and the acupuncture treatment to cure a doctor of his multiple personalities.Mai is pretty standard for this genre of heroine. She’s a bit inconsistent in the way that she constantly exposes herself to everyone in the story yet still remains sheepishly embarrassed by other echii situations. Despite having absolutely no depth at all, she’s still pretty likable as a character. The rest of the cast is all in supporting roles and with a few exceptions only appear in one story. A few of them had some potential but they are never given enough screen time to become all the interesting.The art is a mixed bag. The animation is fluid and well drawn and I did like the character models for the most part, though the hair styles in particular are extremely outdated and kind of silly looking (Particularly in Mai's case). Typical of the era this was made, the color palette feels washed out and boring. Since the main focus of this show is about T&A, I can say that element of the show is well done. I have always preferred the more realistic body types and chest measurements common from this time period to the saggy over the top back breaking boobs of today’s anime. The voice acting performances a fair but nothing that stands out. There isn’t much in the way of musical performances, and none of it is memorable either.Overall I had some fun watching this title. My expectations were low to start but it has a few laughs and it’s pretty short. So if you just have a little time and like echii comedy or animated boobs then you might get a little enjoyment from My My Mai.";Mixed Feelings
1;Sono Kinisasete yo: My My Mai;Kalendraf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kalendraf;5;"This is a review of the DVD version of ""My My Mai"" released by U.S. Manga Corps in 2002. It was viewed with English voice overs.""My My Mai"" falls into the category of ecchi comedy with a significant helping of fan service along the way.Parental Warning:There are some scenes with nudity, and some adult situations. The age on the box indicated 16 and up, but the warning included on the DVD suggests 18 and up. A few of the scenes in the first episode may merit a 16 and up rating. However, most content in the remaining episodes would likely be acceptable viewing for slightly younger teens.Story: 5/10The story is divided into four episodes, though based on the placement of the beginning and ending credits, and the somewhat uneven length of these segments, they are presented in a format more like a pair a two-part episodes. The story revolves around Mai and various “counseling” services she provides to her clients. At various points, she serves as a bit of a detective, a counselor, a psychiatrist, or a paranormal investigator. Between the different episodes, there are a number of comedic situations that arise. While these sometimes lead to Mai reaching various levels of undress, those scenes manage to achieve the desired comedic effect without taking things too far.Of the four episodes, two are closely related. The first involves Mai searching for a doctor to help cure a client's granddaughter while the third involves finally curing her. Unfortunately, the scenes with the doctor seemed rather unfunny, and the amount of screen time devoted to Mai’s interaction with him stretched longer than I would have preferred. Fortunately, the other two episodes help make-up for these.In the second episode, Mai attempts to help a client overcome his allergy to nudity. As crazy as this sounds, there is an actual anxiety disorder called gymnophobia. The episode doesn't go into any detail about this, but rather focuses on Mai's attempts to diagnose and cure the client. The client's reaction at points along the way and the ending scene are worth a few laughs.In the last episode, Mai and some friends are on summer break and end up investigating a haunted inn. This is the best of the bunch. At a couple points this one reminded me a bit of a Scooby Doo episode with the gang trying to uncover their next mystery, with some slapstick thrown in along the way. It also features multiple twists and turns along the way, as well as a final surprise.Characters: 4/10The main character Mai is featured in each episode, however we never see much in the way of character growth for her character. She offers a wide array of services, some of which seem rather unrelated. Her views on modesty seem a bit uneven. In some scenes she seems perfectly willing to show off her body, while in others she voices her concern over her lack of attire. Overall, she is quite likeable though she seems extremely naive at times.Some of the other characters appear in mulitple episodes. Among these is Dr. Ben Shinobi who appears in the first and third episodes. His character is interesting in a Jekyll and Hyde fashion, but I found that he was more of a distraction and detraction to my overall enjoyment of the series.The other characters appear only briefly. Some of them like Ai and Mii seem interesting, and they probably should have been included in more of the episodes to give them time to be developed.Art / Animation: 5/10The character designs in ""My My Mai"" are generally appealing. A few of the character designs may seem a bit dated. Some of them, especially Mai, feature overly huge hair, but their other proportions seem to be attractive overall.The animation is generally good, and there are a few scenes that seemed to be well done. However, the age of this title is apparent, and some of the animation is rather simple. The transfer is average with some the graininess and washed out colors.Sound / Voice: 5/10Soundtrack, background music and sound effects were acceptable. The opening soundtrack is completely forgettable. There wasn't anything that really stood out good or bad in terms of the sound effects or voice.Enjoyment: 6/10Overall, I enjoyed this series. All four episodes feature a mix of humorous situations, with a few rather funny scenes highlighting the bunch.Final Verdict: 5/10""My My Mai"" is an acceptable ecchi comedy, delivering its share of risque comedic antics, and never taking itself too seriously. While the characters are generally appealing, it seems to be missing much in the way of an overall story. The episodes are largely stand-alone, which does not give it much time to develop or have much depth in the plot.";Mixed Feelings

0;Shuukaku no Yoru;r4physics;https://myanimelist.net/profile/r4physics;7;DISCLAIMER: Hainuwele - Shuukaku no Yoru is an adult anime OVA featuring violence and sexual assault. These elements are primarily used for aiding the theme of decadence, delusion and loss of self-worth in the anime and do not put forward any ideological stances. Nevertheless, if you are uncomfortable with such depictions, you might not want to watch this anime.Okay, having said that, I would like to introduce you, the potential viewer to Hainuwele: Shuukaku no Yoru. This anime is the brainchild of Katsuma Kanazawa along with the prolific Iijima Hiroya, who pioneered the exploration of violence and psychological themes in adult animation in the late 90's and early 2000's. As more visual novels started getting anime adaptations, especially adult ones that aired late night, his influence traveled to anime such as School Days which is infamous for its escapist MC who seeks comfort in sexual pleasure.Shuukaku no Yoru is set in a city that's trapped in various vicious cycles of escapism and decadence. Although it's implicit, we come to know that the only way to leave this city is by crossing a certain bridge. The story begins on this bridge, on which Honoka, a white-haired seemingly innocent adolescent girl is sexually assaulted by some middle-aged man, presumably from the decadent part of the city. As she loses her strength and lets herself drown in the sound of the pouring rain and a passing train, she is rescued by Masato, who is later revealed to be her childhood friend. Masato essentially kills the man, throws him off the bridge.Defloration, sex, blood and the trauma that ensues, is a central motif in the anime and also connects to the Indonesian myth of Hainuwele. Anyways, there's a time skip and we see that Masato now leads a small underground gang, which operates in the so called ura-machi, or the decadent city on the other side of the bridge. Both Masato and Honoka are seen to be trapped in this city in which numerous underground businesses, arm traders, brothels, and gangs thrive. Sexual pleasure is seen as a commodity that you can buy away. We never come to know what lies on the other side of the bridge. This is a world with precise boundaries. The anime proceeds to explore Honoka, her older sister Ryoko and the stoic Masato, who lives to protect Honoka. All three have lost hope. They no longer dare to leave the city.The sex scenes in Shuukaku no Yoru are top notch. Sexy character designs, luscious women, scheming men, stoic men, insecure women, courageous women. Amidst scenes of rape and violence, we also have more tender erotic ones. Various motifs such as pubic hair, realistic proportions and realistic body movements during sex aid the themes I've mentioned.Will you enjoy this? Will you be able to use this for your purposes? I can't say. Certainly if you're interested in exploring the themes I've mentioned, watching this ova is gonna be a good decision.;Recommended
0;Shuukaku no Yoru;evanicafan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/evanicafan;3;Shuukaku no Yoru is definitely not your average urban hentai, the story takes place in a decayed no-man-land where the sight of gangs feasting on each other blood with them knives and rapists enthralled by the dew of virginal blood are everyday doses.These city hyenas compete for power and women, when 2 gangs confront, and a winner arises, the winner gang can dispose of the femmes in the rival band and of course, the leader gobbles the best slice: that's when the action comes out, you better expect lots of malevolent and sadist sex between these sexual scavengers.Basically this synthesizes the plot involved in this series, my main problem is that the continues flashbacks tend to wear my mind and I end up confused, the argument need a lot of improvement (it doesn't matter if you see both chapters unadvisedly), the animation is average, the character most of them spoiled brats, so bottom line: didn't feel any satisfaction after seeing this so I recommend it if you're onto this kind of scene.;Not Recommended

It is an adult only anime from 2002 but be warned as it is very rape heavy. There are some consensual scenes but it is mostly for those into rape fantasy so you have been warned. That said the scenes are well animated and have good attention to detail however climax scenes are almost non existent. The ending is the only part of the story that may stick with you as it is quite sad, although the characters and unresolved plot lines take away most of the impact. Sad if you feel sorrow for most people, just a rushed run of the mill tragedy that most forget if you're the average person however.;Not Recommended

When start watching this make me feel like, how could this anime have not been so popular. Which is unfortunate Sadly this is probably going to be a sleeper for most people for a while since it's a Chinese production.Art: Overall the art isn't anything special. Luckily it isn't bad at all, but that doesn't mean it lacks moments where you know that with better animation the whole anime would be better.Sound: There isn't really anything special about the sound choices of this anime, it is all pretty standard, and nothing will surprise you, but it does do its job at some parts and doesn't take anything away from the anime, while also not adding anything of much value, past the mere basics.Character: Some of the characters have a lot of personalities and unlike the normal emotionless MC, Lu Mingfei isn't like them, showing his emotions. The same with the side characters, they all have decent personalities.Overall: I gave this anime overall a 9, The genre and main character really boosted this as a whole and made it much more enjoyable to watch than one might think. I hope the sequel will be better, when the story proceeds to continue.;Recommended

However, this feels less like an OVA meant to accompany a game and more like the prologue to an actual anime. That never got made.Art - 1/10The animation is by Idea Factory, and it is easily some of the most atrocious I've seen.

Mainly because Excel Saga started to air at the same time, and it had animation that was a million times better than this show. Also, the CGI is atrocious, but at least they have an excuse here - CGI was still new to anime, and as such, it was easy to screw up.Sound - 1/10The sound was...decently mixed, but extremely forgettable.

1;Generation of Chaos;Yukariki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yukariki;3;"“Humans cannot change as rapidly as a caterpillar goes into its cocoon, and then comes out as a butterfly. You don’t notice snow melting into water; you don’t know it until it has already happened. Humans are like that; you won’t notice your growth until you are already grown.”These poetic sentences come from Generation of Chaos: Prologue, a show brought to us by the great Idea Factory which created Mars of Destruction and Tenkuu Danzato Skelter Heaven. Like other Idea Factory works, it is supposedly based on a strategy role-playing game the studio made. This anime is created before Mars of Destruction and it is good to know that Idea Factory sucked before as well.As this OVA is meant to introduce viewers to the Generation of Chaos world, I begin to take notes of the setting and characters. I gather that the work is similar to the Monster Rancher series, though this may be too good for a comparison. There are three segments to the show: Chiffon is a monster master whose voice cannot reach to his monsters because he is too old. Thus, he embarks into an epic coming-of-age story. Another segment is about a runaway demon who knits silk to feed her sister. The last segment, after the ending credits, is about the history of the game’s setting, character profiles, and an advertisement for the game; I am amazed by the usage of filters in this segment. If these sounds like a fantastic stories worthy of praise from Miyazaki, this is because they are.The art consists of character designs that look ripped from the video game placed onto backgrounds and floors coming from Nintendo 64 games, speed lines, and unimaginable delights. Some of the character’s emotions are plain humorous; it is amazing that Idea Factory approved this work.The voice acting is tolerable except for the knight in the second segment; I have no comment for the knight’s seiyuu. The female narrator at the end is one of my favorites for being overdramatic for a game advertisement. However, the real kicker for sound is the repetitive usage of music. People who have watched Mars of Destruction and listened to their usage of Beethoven and Satie will know what I am talking about. The music feels loopy and surreal; there is a musical piece that is played on an organ and it feels like a five year old composed it. Never has the music feel so generic.Poor Mizuki Nana. She is a fantastic singer and her opening and ending themes show. I pity her for her credit in this work. Whoever added her into the credits of this work should be ashamed.It is unfair to judge this work through the criteria of an actually good show. Instead, I shall factor in more of the enjoyability factor. Did I enjoy the show for being stupid and idiotic? Yes. However, is the show more special than Mars of Destruction or other so-bad-it's-good works? No. The work feels too generic for me to like. In the end, my mouth is gaping more than laughing.Mars of Destruction fans, so bad it’s good fans, and masochists will enjoy this work without a doubt like I did. There is potential to make good riffs on the work. However, to those who are not big fans of bad works should stay away; a work like this can make someone terribly insane.";Not Recommended

3;Generation of Chaos;ScarletCelestial;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ScarletCelestial;1;"Generation of Chaos is something I expected to be bad, but was somehow much worse than I thought it would be.Story: 2There being two stories in it that are completely unrelated makes so little sense to me with the runtime. This means that the plot of the second half is so badly executed and confusing yet so cliched at the same time it is hard to get through - even though it's less than 10 minutes long. The first half is the reason this isn't a one: although a Pokemon rip-off in a lot of ways, it does give a unique spin on the formula. However, it is too overt in it's friendship message (that is pretty hard to see due to no interaction) and a lot of details feel very unnecessary to what is being told.Art: 1Off model characters, bad 3d backgrounds, designs that are forgotten 3 minutes after watching it, janky and there isn't much more to say. Bad.Sound: 1Can't remember any music, some of the voice acting is too over the top and the voice of the knight feels very unfitting.Character: 1Two of the characters (of whom I can't remember the names of) from the first half have no point of being in the story. They provide little in the way of humour or plot development and could honestly have been left out.All other characters in the stories feel there just to be there, for things to happen to them. You do not learn to care for any of them. You do not see how they change in any way. They don't even really have traits (plural). They are as flat as paper.Enjoyment: 1Confusingly bad.

I mean, it's still trash-tier, with cheap and constantly recycled animations, mediocre designs and incredibly rushed storytelling, but I don't think those are the notable parts.For me the absolute baffling fact is that this was meant to be above all an advertisement for one of the Idea Factory's JRPG, and manages to be perfectly devoid of any points of interest that would make me want to play it. We have one character that once was a pokemon trainer (designs of which are either direct ripoffs or terrible)... But became an adult and lost his powers to command beasts. Always wanted to play as a retired trainer with no notable abilities, that sounds so rad! Than, we have the half-demon lady that suffers a tragedy... Possibly due to humans being fearful of demonkin, but we're not really sure? Due to that, she immediately transform from a seamstress into a badass warrior lady and joins some random demon on... Well... I'm not sure on what exactly?If you're wondering where the stories of these fascinating characters go, you can check out some longplays of the Generation of Chaos game on YouTube. As for the OVA... It's not funny like Mars of Destruction, despite some stupidly edgy moments in the second story, so while it's definitely not the worst thing I've ever seen, I don't think there's any value in watching it...

0;Tales of Crestoria: Toga Waga wo Shoite Kare wa Tatsu;HellNope;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HellNope;10;I give this a 10/10 mostly because the story presented in the game this is based of is amazing, unfortunally it is hard to capture all emotions that the actual tale offer in a short animation, making this adaptation kind of confusing and shallow for somebody that isn't introduced to the full story yet. Another con would be how this animation kind of turn out serving as a huge spoiler for anybody interested to start playing the actual game, specially since the story is it forte.Overall I liked the visuals and soundtrack, the characters design look a bit different and edgy from their originals, but it still look good.;Recommended

0;Oni-Tensei;animegorey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animegorey;7;Not bad, for a hentai. I bought this for the demons and they are pretty cool. I don't care for the hentai ones, except for Kite (uncut), Mezzo Forte (uncut), and Mystery of the Necronomicon. Animation is very good and violence is kinda graphic at times. It would actually be better if there was less sex, but it's tolerable compared to Bible Black. Story is great concept, although it would have been better if it was a cyberpunk type with less sex.;Recommended
1;Oni-Tensei;tallyhoo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tallyhoo;8;"~SUMMARY~ Reiko Kure is a female detective who must unravel the mystery of a mafia massacre that left only a young girl, Nozomi Ema, alive. Nozomi possesses a strange tattoo depicting an oni, an ogre. This ogre emerges from her back and either rapes or murders. Nozomi tries her best to distance herself from everyone but she just can't seem to catch a break. So begins the monster/rape/monster rape filled adventure of a detective and a very unlucky girl.STORY: 8/10ART: 7/10SOUND: 8/10CHARACTER: 8/10ENJOYMENT: 7/10OVERALL: 8/10~STORY~ A hentai doesn't require a plot. Most of the time it doesn't and when it does it's more ridiculous than it is erotic. Because that's the purpose hentai serves, animated porn. And when people search for it they don't wade through the countless titles to find one ""with a good story"" but fappable material. If (monster) rape scenes are your thing than this will probably do it for you. But story wise I was actually pleasantly surprised at how they attempted to tie together psychology within the plot. It wasn't the most thrilling endeavor but it was notable and quite welcomed considering an actual ounce of effort was put forth in explaining what was going on. Overall the story deserved an Oscar compared to most hentai flicks. Though once again, I'm sure the story isn't what you wanted it for, it was a nice touch.~ART~ Developed at the very end of the 90s, that's 11 years ago to the date, it features animation common during the time. That isn't to say it's bad or good just visibly vintage. Sex scenes aren't anything special just the usually thrust and go routine. I don't find the artwork to my taste however, even the vaginas looked like they belonged on a rotting corpse and the dicks reminded me of kitchen spoons. But budgets and time should be put into account.~SOUND~ Oni-tensei OST for $9.99 lol. Voice acting was typical moans, groans, screams, and wails. But they did the job they were meant to. And proper feelings were expressed, don't watch the dubbed versions of hentai EVER~CHARACTER~ I really enjoyed the Oni-tensei characters, the protagonists at least, they showed some backbone and even though they were in a rape hentai they never let up the resistance. [spoiler if you care] I especially liked the moment when Nozomi bit her aggressor's tongue since I always wondered why the rape victims in hentai didn't do that in the first place, same goes for when Reiko bit a dude's penis right off - I loled cuz it reminded me of the movie Teeth [ spoiler end] And I did sympathize with [spoiler again if you care] Reiko when she lost the baby she cared so much about though with the way things were going in the ending sequence it probably wasn't long before she got pregnant again [spoiler end] 8/10 because the characters didn't buy into the ""enjoyment"" of being raped. Normal people don't like being raped, k?~Enjoyment~ Porn is porn is porn. Upon analyzing the sex scenes I didn't really feel much toward them. I'm not into the monster rape stuff. I'm more interested in the passionate but that's hard to find and when you find it it lasts half a second. (can you tell I'm a lady?) Heads up that the only sex scene involving love is found in the last episode and is rushed in at the end. The whole series is rape and rape and rape and rape and so I was just searching for what else there was. Like I said so many times before, not my thing, but maybe yours.~OVERALL~It's worth the browse. A minor detail I may have missed is that this hentai has some gore. Not too much. Just guys getting their faces smashed open with eyeballs flying out and their teeth spilling on to the floor no biggie. Really no biggie. It's only for like three scenes and isn't all that graphic. (not for me) If you choose to avoid it it's found in episode 3 I believe. Concluding words....I just wrote an entire review on porn O.o but I enjoyed it so ha ^^";Recommended
2;Oni-Tensei;OmarLivesUnder;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OmarLivesUnder;10;I can't believe it... Still, it has actually happened. The hentai OVA made it to highest score in both my list and mind. How that happened, you ask? It's just that it has several things that matter the most: an interesting story, a great soundtrack, an ability to arouse sexually (for hentai only) and most importantly, an overall sense, a message, if you want. It was clear from the first frames that it's different from the most hentai OVAs out there, but I couldn't even imagine the extent of itHonestly saying, I hate to retell a plot so please, if you seek for the plot that makes sense, viscid atmosphere and don't want to behold an utterly stupid ending after some reasonable action — just have my word for it: it's worth a seeingYea yea, I was THAT amzed too;Recommended

0;Yuki no Taiyou Pilot;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;6;Rate a 6English SubtitledPlotOne can sail in this kind breeze of an anime. It would be hard to become lost with the slow directions and information given by the female narrator.Her words were not only helpful but spoken in a clear manner.Granted for some the story does seem to progress in a fast paced fashion but this is not an entire anime but a plot or teaser of a trailer if you will. So, it is a given certain elements especially those with great meaning (like her parents) will leave a lot of questions to be raised.Maybe it is the sheer joy of the childlike nature of the artwork or the main character's flooding happy natures makes me wish i could partake more in her life by seeing the full movie(if it does exist). Making the trailer a success.Although, it doesn't seem to be much different in terms of the popular Broadway story/act of little Annie. Making me slightly disappointed in originality.As for the main quirk of the character who has a knack of hitting things head on does bring for a soothing characteristic to an anime that could have been quite packed in drama.;Mixed Feelings
1;Yuki no Taiyou Pilot;Autros;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Autros;6;Surely a product of its time with a pretty cliche story but i think you can really see small hints that of Hayao Miyazaki's famous directing even from back then.I don't know if he had any part in the animation department but it seems way more vibrant and fluid than any of the contemporaries of its eraObviously it is a 4 minute short and its packed full of content with an easy to follow story,of course it leaves out almost all the details and what we get are only basic calicatures of characters but even that for such a small runtime is an achievementWould reccomend just to see where it all started between Miyazaki and Ghibli and what that would eventually bring;Mixed Feelings
2;Yuki no Taiyou Pilot;Vemoes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Vemoes;6;Miyasaki's first solo director gig. This is a short that seems to serve as a pilot for the manga, but is more like a quick trailer of a larger story.Perhaps they were hoping to make a full series out of this, which would've looked like many other anime of the time: era animes showcasing the rural life in either Japan, Europe or the United States such as Rascal the Raccoon, Candy Candy, Haha o Tazunete Sanzenri, and many others that were popular at the time.We're immediately presented the main character and within a minute we're shown her personality, what makes her lovable and what gets her in trouble. We're presented conflict by the third minute and somewhat lacking resolution by the fourth.This could've been a larger anime filled with friendship, coming-to-age and rural themes, but for all we know it just got rejected and we got this short and rushed story instead.Not a bad watch, and you might want to give it a try for historical reasons.

0;Saint Luminous Jogakuin;dbaranyi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dbaranyi;9;"&ldquo;Saint Luminous Mission High School&rdquo; is an original TV anime from 1998 that was produced by Genco/AIC/Triangle Staff and was originally broadcast in a last night TV Tokyo time slot. High school student Kaihei Kijimi is surprised when he finds out that he has inherited his grandfather&rsquo;s prestigious private all-girls international high school, and he is even more surprised when he finds out that he must accept the role of school chairman or else the school will close.Against the objections of some of the teaching staff and of many of the students Kaihei enrols himself in the school so that he can continue his education while he tries to decide what to do with his new responsibility. But things only turn to the worse as some of the girls start to disappear in mysterious ways while outside forces attempt to discredit the school and take it over. Kaihei finds himself embroiled in an ever deepening mystery while he attempts to establish his credibility with the students, staff and parents.Just what is going on at the non-standard school where students have an unusual amount of freedom in their studies? Are there evil spirits or aliens involved in the disappearances, as some students claim? Are Kaihei&rsquo;s actions helping the situation or making things worse? Kaihei will eventually have to make a decision about a commitment that will affect everyone and everything at Saint Luminous Mission High School.This short and enigmatic series is first and foremost a very good mystery story. Although the setting and situation appear to be tailor-made for a harem comedy, comedy is very secondary to the mystery in this series, and Kaihei is not a harem anime lead character, nor are the girls harem anime heroines. The animation is quite good for the time, with character designs reminiscent of many of the classic AIC anime of the 90s. As well, the voice acting cast are for the most part seasoned pros from many of those same AIC classics. In addition, the ending theme song is a very early and quite memorable piece from Ali Project.Saint Luminous Mission High School remains a unique and intriguing example of late 1990&rsquo;s anime series that were based upon original stories. It was originally released on Japanese Laser Disc, and then on R2 DVD, but has never been licensed in North America. The official web sites are now rather sparse and contain little of the original information.";Recommended
0;Saint Luminous Jogakuin;LightQuill;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LightQuill;6;"It's been over a year since I watched Saint Luminous Jogakuin and while I thought it was fine the first time around, I still can't stop thinking about it for some absurd reason. Saint Luminous Jogakuin sits in a strange place for me. On the one hand, the show contains an utterly weak and forgettable mystery that barely get resolved in the last episode. The story is mediocre at best, and the art isn't pleasant to look at from time to time. Yet, even with its numerous flaws, I find it difficult to dismiss this as a bad show.Saint Luminous Jogakuin revolves around the disappearance of a student attending an all-girl high school, Saint Luminous. Our main character, Kaihei Kajimi gets the news that he is going to inherit the school from his late grandfather. As a result of this inheritance, Kajimi has to act as the school chairman unless he wants the school to shut down. He accepts the role and thus begins the fun harem/slice of life anime that this show was destined to be.It's not that fun, actually.Soon after, Kajimi finds himself playing detective, attempting to find the missing student only to discover that more girls are disappearing by the minute. Along the way, he meets with the girls that reside in the school, whether that be an artist or a radio jockey, he makes sure that they find comfort in these dire times. What makes Saint Luminous Jogakuin so special to me is that, while the show's premise is set up to be some kind of harem anime, it manages to be mature in its tone and atmosphere. There's a hidden sadness that lies within this show. The fact that Kajimi continually fails to find answers to the mystery is frustrating to watch, but maybe that's the point. The lack of progression that lies in the mystery adds to the burden of the main character. As the show progresses and the school's morale starts to diminish, I feel more sympathetic to Kajimi as he is unable to resolve the case. Watching his relationships with the students becomes more and more distant as weeks go by is unbearable, and the mind-boggling mystery that barely moves isn't much help.The plot moves at a standstill, yet the situation worsens each passing week. Kajimi is completely incapable of solving this mystery. Not because he's an inept detective, but because the disappearances are caused by an unexplained force that he doesn't have the power to comprehend. This leads me to believe that the mystery isn't the main focal point of the anime. It plays a considerable role, don't get me wrong, but I think the strongest parts of the anime lies in the interactions between Kajimi and the girls that he interacts with. As the show progresses, we are introduced to a motley crew of schoolgirls. Each of the girls tend to have a distinct personality and some with a personal arc that gets resolved thanks to Kajimi's help. The girls don't act like characters from a haram, but they act more realistically and have their desires separate from the male lead.With all of that said, is Saint Luminous Jogakuin a good show? Maybe. If you're looking for a good mystery, stay away from this show. If you want a ""character study"" (which is a term I use very loosely) then perhaps give this show a shot. Just don't expect the resolution to be more satisfying than the buildup.";Mixed Feelings
0;Feng Ling Yu Xiu;KuroNekoAlchemy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KuroNekoAlchemy;10;Chinese animation that got me into chinese animation.I'm just finishing a rewatch of this series and it's spectacular how much the story holds together, and how many things are subtly hinted at or foreshadowed in dialogs that only makes sense once you've seen later events. It really makes me wonder how much the author planned in advance-considering that the first draft for the story was made in 2016 with a promotional music video and a lot of things from the opening didn't even happen yet-but without doubt, A LOT.Needless to say, this story just hits differently. At it's heart, it's a wuxia martial arts action adventure journey. But it has so much more going on behind the scenes, with hints of tragedy both past and incoming, various characters plotting their own agendas behind the scenes and steady but brilliant worldbuilding. I've seen people compare Feng Ling Yu Xiu to Girl's Last Tour or Made in Abyss, and they aren't necessarily wrong while not being necessarily right, either.I can only ask you to give this series a try, even if you aren't into chinese animation. The story is far from over-second season is in production-and the plot only thickens. The first couple of episodes had at times a choppy animation(not necessarily bad) which might be discouraging to people who pay a lot of attention to production values, but it's to be expected considering that originally it was a crowdfunded passion project animated by one person. Later the animation quality goes up significantly, especially during the sakuga fight scenes.Oh the fight scenes! Reminiscent of old Hong Kong's Jackie Chan movies, this is some of the best fight choreography ive seen in animation. The author mixes traditional chinese martial arts with fantasy qi energy and creativity I haven't seen since the times of drunken master. Rather than purely relying relying on literal magic or brute force power ups, our heroes often use cunning and terrain to get advantage over their opponents. And of course, as expected of wuxia/cultivation piece of chinese fantasy, most fighting is unarmed kung fu style-and the author really did his research in this regard! As a (former) practioner of wing chun, I could recognise a lot of familiar stances, guards and moves, such as lap sao or snake crane.I really don't want to spoil anything about the story itself, other than it's very good and well written. The characters are all likeable- especially the main couple. Yes, it is yuri. Tho the girls never do anything sexual like kissing on screen, it's very strongly implied they are seeing each other as more than good friends through many heartwarming slice of life like moments in between action and fighting typically expected of action-adventure series.Overall I can't help but reccommend this title. Since I've first seen Feng Ling Yu Xiu, I've seen more chinese series and even started learning chinese language, but none of them hit exactly in the same spot as this one. It's a work of passionate genius, and I can't wait to see what the author has in store for us for second season!;Recommended
0;Onikirimaru;WongSlong;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WongSlong;6;"Sorry this is my first review, and I am glad that this might be the first review for this series on MAL. Sorry for the spoilers.Onikirimaru is about an ""ogre"" who looks exactly like a human. His duty on Earth is to slay all of his ""ogre"" brethren so that one day he may become a real human boy. This is the story of the JAPANESE PINOCCHIO except his nose doesn't grow longer when he lies, and he also carries a sword... Whatever let us continue with the review.My experience with this OVA is pretty poor. Due to the fact that I do not speak or understand Japanese, I was force to watched Onikirmaru in subtitles. This was pathetic because the subtitles were pretty POOPY. For instance, in the subtitles they called the ""ogres"" ghost, which to me makes more sense than calling them ""ogres"". What would made it more precise if they were just called demons because I am pretty sure that ""ogres"" are able to move through walls, come out of a women's, or become gas-like beings. I also understand that in Japanese ""Oni"" means ogre so yeah... fuck me!!!Also I was confused for awhile how the ""ogre"" slayer was named Onikimaru, but then his sword was call Onikimaru, but it's was just the fact that he had no name and took the name of his sword.Animation: The animation/art in Onikirmaru was pretty average for it being about 20 years old. So I can't really complain much there except for one thing... RANDOM BEWBS!?!?!?!In every episode, there is always a female being possessed by an demon(ogre), and some FUCKING how they always stripped naked revealing their BREAST. Boobs are cool and all but really, do we need to see every girl exposed when an ""ogre"" pops in. Like no joke, the only time when you see boobs is when ""ogre"" is like 'Ey yu mine now GURL, YEAH GIVE a taste of dem MELONS' then WOOSH clothes GONE!Music/Sound/ Voice: Onikirmaru's music is nothing special, but you can kind of feel how outdated the sound of the OVA's ending song. The sounds are also nothing to talk about that much also. The voice acting I got to say is pretty GOOD because I don't understand Japanese so everything in a foreign language sound legitimate.Enjoyment: Overall, this anime has been OKAY. It is sad that the concept of the story wasn't explored much more than it should have by the studio producing it.";Mixed Feelings
1;Onikirimaru;Reviews-rants;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Reviews-rants;6;"Note: the following comes from a video review, links on my profile page.Onikirimaru creates a world where the personal of what is (likely) to be humans watching is contrasted by that which, externally at least, is perceived to be not human, except if only actions are considered both the familiar and ogres run parallel.A Shinto kind of aura pervades the anime, where a spiritual type of barrier is able to prevent the 'hideous' sort of nature that ogres emanate, shields that only function on such creatures... but what if reality isn't as binary?These oni tempt humans to a point where their desires and even will can be overcome, where instinct is rendered useless by curses. The four episodes contain tales that can be seen as exploring extremes, whether love or hate (less of the former), friendship or friendlessness, even the very idea of non-existence when conflicted with the overwhelming force of the oni.They are interesting, mostly stand-alone narratives; notice how the oni exploit emotions, this seems to be a feature of interaction with Japanese mythological creatures, like a kitsune who uses deceit.Arguably the most pathos-filled of Kei Kusunoki's adaptations, it would have helped if characters didn't last just a single episode, but they are nonetheless stories with a start and end, which also could function as a commentary on a more in-depth thought than most anime with swords normally sustain. Most of the manga wasn't seemingly animated, though what remains still complements Youma's atmosphere.";Mixed Feelings
0;Peeping Life;cluelessblues;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cluelessblues;6;"A quick series, partly because it's only 10 episodes long and mostly because each episode is five minutes (including closing credits), ""Peeping Life"" is pretty adept at showing the nuances of Japanese people and how they speak. All the little verbal pauses, gestures, and polite redirects come through quite naturally even though the animation is clearly done with CG.Every episode starts in medias res, so it might take the viewer a little time to figure out what the heck is going on. But every five-minute dose never features more than two characters, which keeps things simple. Sometimes it is a little painful to watch because the characters find themselves in inane situations (or are, themselves, inane in one way or another).All in all, it's worth seeing at least a couple to admire the studio's ability to capture the essence of Japanese culture and human interaction via computer animation.";Mixed Feelings
0;Yumedamaya Kidan;Ilyaoh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ilyaoh;9;I found the title intresting, so I decided to watch it, that it was a pretty unusual story is figured, occuring to the title.So, a Dream Sphere Dealer and his Dream Sphere Creator (which is a ugly rat who poops out the sphere's.) find that this girl, the lead character takes life way to serieus, so they decide to pay her a visit and let her go through some various dreams she can have thanks to the sphere's.That's actually the story, how it goes. Naho has a lot of ...doubts about things in her life, about her baby brother, the way she thinks of her late mother. Through various dreams she finds out that she would rather forget her mother, this would make living with her father and babybrother easier.Once decided dreams (from her brother and herself) collide and start to collapse, they (the dealer, his petrat and Naho) need to escape out of the dreams. Now this is all just great, the end is to be foreseen even before the movie starts, but it's still a funny story.The art is pretty cool too, normal, and yet some weird things. Sometimes I disliked how they drew several expressions, but that doesn't happen to much, the sound's okay too I guess.About the characters itself, Naho is a teenage girl who has doubt about things in her life, she's going through a rough fase (self-proclaimed by her.) etc, basically one of the normal teenagers, her baby brother is a baby that just can't do anything else but mess everything up and whine, but then we get the intresting one's. The dealer and his pet. The Dealer looks like a shady character once introduced, and well, he is. He's ugly, has a weird grin and his voice-actor makes him even more shadier. Which is good, he's supposed to be shady. His petrat is cool too, he makes the dream sphere's containing dreams by just thinking it and shitting it out, he also has a bad temper and smokes.Intresting huh?Although it's a special and it just takes 24 minutes to watch it, it's pretty enjoying. My thoughts, when it ended, were that they could've made a cool movie out of this idea, I don't think that will happen, but it would've been better as a movie then as a special, that's my opinion at least.;Recommended
0;Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu;MoonFox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MoonFox;10;"When I first heard about Legendz from a random forum I thought to myself ""This show looks to kiddy, it can't be that good for 50 episodes"". Boy was I wrong!I've heard others put this show down for that same reason, but trust me. The childish look of the box art and some of the art is misleading, though the artstyle is a little weird at first glance, after watching and completing this anime there were many beautiful scenes and characters. An incredibly wonderful story starts to take place as you watch and get further into the show.One would first suspect this is just a silly show about kids and their dragons born from toys, but after watching more and more you begin to realize the in-depth serious and dark story that is foretold as episodes go on. Once you think the show starts getting to silly, next thing ya know something big happens and more of the mystery's are revealed. Or maybe you think its getting to serious at one point? Well just around the corner they'll let some fun comedy loose or back-story about your favorite character.Even characters that seem meager and unimportant have a role to play in this pleasant anime. Maybe you even think, ""boy that persons cruel"", and then before you know it you begin adoring that character more and more as things are revealed throughout the story. I can assure you everything has a place in this anime, from the silly comedy, wonderful story, the fun characters and all of the different kinds of Legendz you get to know through Legendz: Tale of the Dragon Kings.All 'n all I hope more people can give this anime a chance as it is quite underrated.Its got everything one could enjoy for a show about 4 close friends and their adventures with their Legendz.";Recommended
1;Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu;DATS24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DATS24;9;"Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu is one of anime that I watched when I was around 13 or 15 on my local tv channel, I generally loved it, especially with its hilarious kids comedy like what you see on american cartoon like Looney Tunes, etc. Now I'm 18 and I had a nostalgia with it, so I decided to watch only to remember some aforementioned hilarious moment and also some awesome moments in it. After finish watching it (including CD drama), I found that, the cover of anime is COMPLETELY MISLEADING, with its awkward character design, I thought that it was only focus on its hilarious comedy, boy I WAS wrong. I had never expected it would be deconstructed like this. It's not a general kids show, no, it's not even appropriate enough for kids. Maybe kids' standards in Japan were different, thoughStory: 9/10I found the first half series being lighthearted with its hilarious gags also a lot of character moments in it. Let's see, the story is about Legendz, mythical creatures that people believe that they were real and really existed long time ago. Just like in real life, the legendz are mythologies. Only, in this, on the setting of time, the legendz are being reborn for some reason. The reborn of these legendz were first represented with the creation of Talispod, one of kids' toy developed by dark WiZ company in order to make children happy. It was later called Legendz battle by the kids, showing virtual legendz appearing from talispod and you began to do like sword fight with your friend. The problem was shown later that some of legendz appeared in human world for REAL. Here comes some of questions like: ""Why legendz appeared for real? What's the reason of it? What's Legendz War and how come it happened?""Yeah, the first half of the series didn't explain too much about the problem, but there're indeed some clue where it's going to be very serious some time later. We got a team rocket-wannabe who were commanded to steal Shu's talispod, because he had a real and special legendz with him, Shiron the Windragon, and maybe have a connection with the later story, yeah he did indeed. They are doing quite similarly like what pokemon's team rocket do every episode, only in this, they're not too annoying. Things became more complicated when there's something revealed about the existence about 2nd Windragon, which was clearly awkward. Also following the reborn of legendary earth, water, and fire elemental legendz.Things got more complicated when there's explained about legendz war, where it happened when the nature of the earth has been diminished, being desolate because humans' doing against the nature of earth, their darkness in their heart and their negative emotions and legendz began to fight the personification of the aforementioned darkness, resulting destruction to human world and being reset. Now that's going to be happened again on Shu's era where humanity have been grown more complex with technologies and so on, also it's told that the technologies that human created had harmed the nature of earth badly. Later it was told why Shu and his friend were chosen to be saga and why they must face these things completely. Humans later have expected legendz to be dangerous creatures, threatening, resulting them expressed negative emotions that has brought back the deep darkness of the world and being reborn to destroy the existence of life on earth. How they will stop the disaster and how they can overcome the real darkness of the world, it depends on what they do in order to survive.The stories were thought provoking enough for kids show, showing how deconstructed they are, also darker and edgier than most of kids show. From the existence of human being with its technologies that apparently bring destruction to the mother earth to the negative emotions of human that had brought back the true darkness of the world. It's simply intriguing and you need to think a bit to make it reasonable.Characters: 9/10The main character here, Shuzo Matsutani is kind of typical shounen who is silly, and kind of annoying but hilarious. But, well, it was a bit different of our typical shounen characterization, after all. Even though so, he had a lot of awesome and sad moments too, and interestingly he saved everyone from the worst situation with his silliness, that's just an unusual moment seriously.His family problem wasn't that serious, his father and mother are simply just wanting their children happy at all cost, none that all. After the first half episode, there's an episode when Shu for the first time really felt despair. He didn't want to make his parents worry about him and he didn't want his parents especially his mother to be involved with legendz war. He got quite serious development in these moments.Second main character is Dino Sparks, who is introduced on around first 5 episodes. I found his character being special, what I mean is he's a rich person but he isn't happy at all because his activities had to be scheduled so even he can't play outside like what most kids do on their age, also he had serious family problem, where his mother left home because of his dad's doing and mistakes. It simply made Dino hates his father because of that. Later it was shown on 1 full episode about Dino's father, Bruno Sparks character moments and his past. When he remembered the fondest moment with his wife, and his dream to make toys to make kids happy. We really get his character development after it, made him brave to talk to Dino and said ""I'm sorry, Dino. I wasn't a good father for you. I realized that I've made mistakes that have made you sad all this time. I won't ever let it again to you my beloved child."" Damn, that's really touching seriously. Also eventually in the second half episode, Dino's mom had back for long time but had her appearance changed from slim to big fat. Even though so, Dino didn't lose his love to his mother, also Bruno, her husband until last episodes. ""Despite what you look like, you're my wife and I will always love you."" That's what I got from Bruno Sparks, what a beautiful and touching moment.Next is Mike McField. I really like the characterization of him. He's a nice guy who want to be nice to everyone, evoking them when they're in problem, and he love natures very much also he's addicted to hamburger. He's the first person that able to talk to Dino, the lonely rich guy and even can become friend with also sharing his favorite hamburger with him. He's the type of sympathetic person who can understand someone's feeling and also nature's feeling. That's why he's being chosen as Tsuchi no Saga (Earth Saga) because his deep love with nature. He got some serious problem with his feeling when he's transformed into a griffin and going berserk hurting each other. He felt despair after it happened, thinking that his friend would never forgive him of what he had do with them. He got quite good development after episodes, though, only not as strong as Dino. Also he had less moments with his family.Next is Meg Sprinkle. She looked like an annoying girl at first, yeah. She made some of funny gags with her Meg Chop for many times, I really enjoy it. She seemed to be the least focused character, but not until her changed mind about her impression to legendz, especially when she finally met her partner legendz, Zuou. She didn't accept him at first, because she thought legendz were cruel, and had made her sad. But it went through time and eventually she can overcome those feelings. Still, she didn't have much time about her moments with her family.Next is Halca Hepburn. She's the one that I can said, got the most character development than all and having deep characterization out of the other characters. She's the one who loves legendz very much, hoping legendz becoming real and apparently her dreams come true. At first she was so crazy about legendz, like a nerd. But thing got changed in her mind, her impression of legendz after seeing them becoming threatening to humanity especially for the kids, though she was misunderstood. We got to see her change from crazy to legendz, joining Ranshiin to destroy the existence of legendz in the world. Things got changed again when she finally met her dad, who was also loving legendz when he's still younger. There's also thing that explaining their past about reading books about legendz, explaining it like a dad telling a fairy tale. What become worse after that is her dad was the one behind these problems. From a legendz lover become the one that willing to destroy the existence of legendz forever. He has a reasonable motives, though, only it's kind of silly. This made Halca feel in despair anymore, thinking what she must do to save her beloved ppl. But after that, she became developed and she was the one that had stopped the disaster, along with Shiron and Ranshiin.Last but not least, for the minor characters. This is where I found that Legendz CARE SO MUCH of its minor characters, even there's an exclusive episode which told us about the story of some of minor characters after it disappeared from the episodes. Even the team rocket-wannabee, they got so much development and the thought of ""they're cruel people just like team rocket in pokemon"" in our minds doesn't prevail anymore. They also had understandable motives why they did those mission to steal Shu's talispod, and eventually resigned from dark WiZ company and began to help Bruno Sparks to make children happy with their toys. I can conclude that they just want ""kids to be happy."" Even the parents here had their role of how they rescue their children, what they'll do to protect their beloved children. All people cooperate with each other to stop the disaster, even the main human villain himself. This was really intriguing in character section.Sound: 8/10I liked the song Kaze no Legendz, it's just wonderful. Also Mou Donimo Tomaranai was also unique ending. Most of their soundtrack were classic jazz, which really give us the american things in it. The last ending song was very sad, and it really match with the moment on last episode..Art: 7/10Despite being a 2004 anime, the art was reasonable, though. But the problem is, the design of characters were MISLEADING. People will seem it more likely a family comedy with many gags on it. I knew they're trying to make people surprised, I really appreciate their motives of making this anime.Overall: 9/10There's simply no one like Legendz out there, although I found the overall of the series being similar to Digimon Tamers, especially its plot, both are REALLY awesome. What I really enjoy especially in this series is that, even though on a very serious situation, they can make you laugh. What a mixed feelings, from the silly-but-fun comedy to breaking the 4th wall. Everytime when something's getting serious, they did put the gag on the right time, so while you're enjoying the gags, you didn't lose the feeling of enjoying its seriousness. I remember in some dialogue ""We have to blahblahblah..."" ""Huh?? but it wasn't written in the script.."" It made me really LOL, seriously, without losing the seriousness.Despite its seriousness and hilarious things, this series actually had given me some life morals. We, human often don't know about what we did to the earth of our creation of many stuffs, even we often don't care about nature. This series actually want to tell us that ""Things that destroy the humanity are the human itself."" It was true after all, seeing what we had done to the mother earth in real life and how sad the earth was feeling when it's being hurt.I was very sad that this kind of wonderful anime is quite underrated and even on quite low score, 7.4. People should give it a try for sure, don't just judge the cover from the art style and also its earlier episodes. You'll find it wonderful if you understand more of this series, seriously.I hope this review helps, thanks..";Recommended
0;Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu;Segaco;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Segaco;6;It is saddening to see such a charming anime end up like this.At first glance it looks like a kids' show, and the first few episodes do seem like they want to sell you their toy. But also starting from first episode the comedy showed off its fast pace, the character interactions were so good you could tell the main cast genuinely cared for each other, and the attention to detail with the plot was great, so the fact this was made for promotion you just forget.I won't spoil, but the tenth episode was especially touching. It showed the anime could deal with character emotions in a believable way.And yet, the moment the anime tried to make long-scale serious drama everything started to fall apart. Something a story must have when their setting is mostly fantasy is believability in character actions, which none of the main cast had when it mattered. But it's not only the main cast, every single side character acted in a way that completely shattered my suspension of disbelief multiple times during the serious arcs.So while the anime does have this façade of good comedy and character interactions for a long while, it at one point opts to head into a more serious direction, which would be fine if it wasn't for the dubious writing. Or maybe it's just dubious writing in my eyes, but I don't think anyone who finished can disagree that the writing is like that because Legendz is a kids' show.My point is: don't be deceived by thinking it will deal with things in a believable way. As long as you expect kids' show developments and actions from both characters and the plot, you may avoid the bad impression this ended up leaving on me.;Mixed Feelings

1;Nikuyoku Gangu Takuhainin;Kyron_Tyrannos;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kyron_Tyrannos;9;Also known as Living Sex Toy Delivery, this Hentai involves plenty of Bondage and BDSM. The story doesn't evolve much, and even though the reveal in Episode 3 is quite interesting, it doesn't alter the story much.Characters are nice to look at. The lead male is quite vicious in his revenge, without becoming totally disgusting, and the methods he uses on the ladies are varied, rarely using the same technique twice. Besides the BDSM scenes, there are some straight sex scenes, and even a couple of full-fledged orgies. The Japanese voice acting is quite good.This was the first BDSM / Bondage hentai I watched, and it's one of my favorites. Want some nasty (but not totally extreme) bondage, beautiful women and varied sex scenes? Don't stall anymore, this is for you.;Recommended
0;Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;6;"English is not my language.Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi, one of the pioneers of Mahou Shoujo in the 80s.Well, the anime is a lot of fun.The story is about a girl who loves flowers, and one day two little animals appear to her, Kakimaru and Keshimaru.The anime follows an episodic pattern, focused more on comedy.It's fun to watch. Every episode has a plot, in which Yumi usually uses her magical powers to help herself or someone else.It can be quite repetitive, but it's worth it because it's funny.The comedy is really good. Early on, Yumi is late for school, and she decides to wear a costume made with magic to go to class, but the magic has a time limit (not set, which generates script conveniences), and the costume disappears and she leaves. running only in her panties on the street (looks more like a diaper haha).Another example is your grandfather ""fighting"" a gorilla who escapes from the zoo.Characters usually have a small plot in the story. Most are pretty cool, even if it's nothing grand.My biggest problem with this anime is magic. As it does not have a time limit, it is conveniently used. For example: sometimes the spell ends too quickly, and sometimes it takes a long time.Another thing I didn't like was some episodes that used flashback to recap. It was boring to see the same thing with another character telling what I've already seen. As it's kind of a recap, it lasted a long time in the episode.The ending wasn't so good either. It's very convenient and also has inconsistencies in what was going on.Anyway, it has its positive points and its negative points like every anime. But as a whole it is good anime episode by Mahou Shoujo.";Recommended
0;Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi;LacrimaMosa666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LacrimaMosa666;6;Mahou no Idol Pastel Yumi, anime quite forgotten, shame on u, dear mal users. While it's not the best in the genre it's definitely worth your time and remembering. Especially from the art style point of view. Sweet piece of animation for kids but I can say it's easily for anyone who like this type of animes. Pretty problematic piece to review again - but we all like it. It was quite funny journey this time...STORY: 5Quite low, I know, but it's bloody mahou shoujo from the mid of 80s, from the guy who brought one of the best in genre - Magical Emi, just look at the characteristics in art and characters. But goin' back to the story.Yumi is a sweet, nature-loving girl that always takes care for it, especially the flowers. One day she meets two flower fairies who touched by her commitment for the flowers gave her magic power, the magic cane and the beautiful pedant. When she uses cane to draw, anything she draws becomes real as long pedant is not flashing, because after it starts to flash there's only about 30 seconds before the magic power dissapears. And that's the main source of the gags. It's quite mediocre story about clumsy, sweet girl that receives magic power and has to deal with the responsibilities and everyday life. The good thing is that the series is only 25 episodes long. What back in 80s was a quite short series.ART: 8That's the best part of the show. Especially as the creators were working on few other mahou shoujjo animes before, especially mentioned already Magical Emi. There's a lot of similarities and and cuteness known from that anime. The colors are beautiful, full of pastels and beautifully drawn backgrounds, not to mention godly presented main character. Of course please keep in mind we talking about mid 80s anime. So art was great 30 years ago, but hardly can be called good in 2019. Keep that in mind.The animation is quite smooth itself and there's not much downs with it after all. Moves and details are decent so are characteristics and anatomy.SOUND: 5Weakest part of the series but nothing uncommon back in the day AND today especially as the copy I get wasn't quite... good. Main seyiuu was good as well as some of the characters but music was forgettable, voice and sound quality very, very poor, sometimes I had problems with understand dialogues because of poor recording quality. But as I said - I'm used to it and I'm sure u can find better quality or even some subs/dubs.CHARACTER: 6There's only one character that is worth to mention, Yumi, the main. Everything is about her, her character development is quite decent but nothing much original or over the 'mahou shoujo' style. Reliable building and backstory combined with lovely character design and writing gives fair, sweet girl that anyone can love.ENJOYMENT: 9And that an hella high score, I know. Apart fromo all downs that the series have the enjoyment os godly. Gags and jokes typical but keeping u smiling all the time, story is bit mediocre but for some reason keeps u by the screen episode after episode, main character becoming ur best friend in a second. Art style, beautiful setting, colorful world and sweet mc gives u no other choice but love it. And love a lot.OVERALL: 6Can ask after that review: ONLY? Yeah, 6 is an fair rating for this anime. Considering all it's flaws and downs, sound and story especially I'm suprised how well the anime is maintaining to keep you interest through the whole 25 episodes so by the end I was actually suprised that is end already. As responsible writer I need to mention again - it's VERY typical mahou shoujo anime, mostly for genre maniacs like me, but I can actually suggest it to anyone with open mind and viewers who want to know something more about japanese animation itself.It's a good piece of anime, hovewer, have troubles with the time passing. Nothing to be scared after all. It's sweet story for basically everyone, especially kids.Dear mal users, really, this anime should be remembered. Not with 344 users ratings, but at least with ten times that amount. Go for it guys, it's still available to watch. Go for it before it dissapears forever.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ace wo Nerae! 2;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;"This is what I would call the pinnacle of dramatic audiovisual portrayal and exploration of an individuals struggle and growth.The story continues mainly from where the original series left off. I'd say that the engaging part of the series for me is the exploration of the struggle of the main character and the story is more so used to lay out a premise for that exploration.The art style of the series is different from the prequels which had more bright and youthful perspective to the design and colors. The palette for this series is lot darker and portrays more mature and darker approach to the series. I'd say that the design and colors are in line with the main characters mindset compared to the earlier series. The vibe of the design is also very ""Dezaki"" looking at Oniisama e... and Black Jack OVA.I'd say that part of the philosophy of this sequel series is growing up from an innocent childhood to accepting the reality around you and overcoming the struggle. The art and design I'd say represent this philosophy when compared to the original 1973, 1978 and 1979 more youthful parts of the story.The key character during this season is Oka Hiromi the main character and her relationships with tennis, her friends and the coach Munakata Jin. I'd say that these relationships and how their weight reflects on the main character and her struggle is handled exceptionally well in this series.Another key part of the series is the Oka Hiromi growing up through her struggle and moving on towards the future accepting herself and her relationships.As far as enjoyment goes this series is probably the series that I was most engaged in to watching just because of how well the struggle of the character and her growth during the series was handled. If you are not fan of heavy struggle or dramatised portrayal of growth you might not enjoy this season as much.Overall I'd say that this was one of the most engaging audiovisual experiences that I've have been able to experience.";Recommended
1;Ace wo Nerae! 2;Tsubakiaka;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsubakiaka;7;Here we are. The next installment of Aim for the Ace! after a delightful series and movie adaptation. We step into a new and maturing Oka Hiromi now focused entirely on her tennis after graduating and becoming a junior champion with her teammates. Oka has achieved it all, she’s a tennis star, has a great coach, and amazing friends/teammates.Until she doesn’t.For fans of the previous installments, the style shift and VA changes might be quite jarring. As we turn away from the softer palette and character designs (a bit more similar to black jacks ‘93 OVA), Fortunately this does not distract too much from the beloved tennis and personal drama. We also step away from unorthodox framing and shots to a more direct scene by scene. Sound quality is for sure a step up from the rest of the series as well. Aim for the Ace! 2 offers a look into the more personal trials and tribulations of our favorite characters as they go through loss, grief, and struggle. A more serious take on a sports anime, but absolutely worth it.;Recommended
0;Memories Off #5 Togireta Film The Animation;Leyren;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Leyren;5;This one is pretty useless to watch.You actually have to read the synopsis to get what's going on, as nothing of it is explained in the OVA itself.Shortly put, the story is about a girl which is somehow being blamed for the death of some dude. Therefore, she thinks of herself as a horrible person who should be with nobody and cuts all ties with her friends. In the end, they find her and they reunite. The End.It is unclear how that person died, or who that person was for that matter, how she is to blame for that, and how that person (or the girl) is related to the other main character(s). Even for a single short OVA, it leaves a lot of open questions and vagueness. On top of that, it's quite boring.;Mixed Feelings

We could not with draw money from our savings accounts, we would not be able to sleep in a nice bed not knowing where our home is... That is why i find the comical ending disappointing.

1;Memory;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;I think I prefer Tezuka's shorts when they don't verbalize their thoughts and use music and visuals to tell the story he wishes to narrate. For when the narrator does open his mouth to elucidate on the temporal unreliability of memory and the inconsistencies of the human mind storage system, the exploration is pretty surface level and tinged with an objectified view of women that would be widely offensive today.Memory is clever in short bursts - mostly when it uses the animation to play with double entendres and misidentify objects with the narration to achieve a comical effect - but in terms of substance, the short is quite weak and perhaps even vacuous.I got to add that I love the sound design in these shorts. I love how the Hyoshigi are used to create the distinctively percussive sound that substitutes for tempo and rhythmic pacing of the animation - which relies primarily on contrasting still images. It gives these shorts a distinctive Japanese, yet experimental identity.;Mixed Feelings
0;Precure Super Stars! Movie;Arboria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arboria;8;Cures from several seasons interact with each other and fight a big bad guy. If you're fond of any of the relevant characters, especially Hana, Saaya, and/or Homare, you'll enjoy the movie. Its structure isn't that different from a typical episode of Precure, it's just longer and has better animation. Watching the Hugttos and the Kirakiras get together was really cute and fun, and the final fight was pretty exciting. The Mahous don't get as much screentime but they're around. The morals about keeping promises are important for anyone to soak in I think. Also the opening track is one of the better ones of the franchise in my opinion.In the end it's a Precure movie. Even if it's not as good as other Precure movies, it's going to be at the quality of or better than many episodes of Precure. And you enjoyed those, right?;Recommended

1;Makaryuudo Demon Hunter;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Makaryuudo” is a one-shot half-hour OVA based on the manga of the same name, and it’s basically about a demon girl whose job it is to hunt down evil demons causing trouble on Earth. While this OVA has an all-star voice cast and interesting demon designs, it is lacking in just about every other aspect.Short, one-episode OVAs from the ‘80s tend to be one of three things: an advertisement for the manga they’re based on; a “bonus” video for fans of the manga; or a pilot to a potential TV series. “Makaryuudo”tries to be a little bit of all of these, and succeeds at none of them.The plot and character introductions are rushed, and everything moves way too fast. It seems like the OVA starts in the middle of the story, so it expects you to have a general idea of who the characters are and their relationships with one another. And before you can even get a grasp of what’s going on, the whole thing is over; the monster-of-the-week plotline has been resolved, everyone is okay and our heroes (?) live to fight (and go to school) another day.The characters receive little development. The main character, Yama, gets some backstory to explain her current situation, but it’s glossed over. She’s kind of like Miyu from “Vampire Princess Miyu,” except a little friendlier to people. She has a crush on Sho, your run-of-the-mill Japanese high school student, for reasons unknown. It’s implied that they knew each other in a past life. Sho has a friend (girlfriend?) named Kaoru, who’s nice but bland, and another friend named Sawaguchi, who unwittingly gets involved in the demons’ nefarious plans. There are two other “good” demons, and some delinquent kids, and the main antagonist, the school principal’s granddaughter. All of these characters are one-dimensional. There are also 3 characters who work/live in a a cafe who seem to be integral to the plot, although their backgrounds are not explained.The animation is subpar and downright choppy at times. The humanoid character designs are okay, but they look rather generic, with the exception of Yama, who has cool hair. The demons, on the other hand, sport intriguing designs and variety: there are harpies, nautiluses with tentacle heads, skeleton dragons, etc. This may be worth watching just for the demon designs alone.The all-synth instrumental soundtrack is okay, but mostly forgettable. And I’ve definitely heard some of the exact same sound effects in other ‘80s OVAs, so they’ve probably been recycled here.The voice cast, surprisingly, is robust. The entire cast is well-known voice actors. Even the minor characters who went unnamed in the credits were voiced by the likes of Emi Shinohara, Shinichiro Miki, etc. Unfortunately, the substandard dialogue and rushed writing did not do a good job at showcasing their talents.Regarding objectionable content, there is a lot of nudity (the topless harpy demons), occult imagery, gore, death and some body horror. However, the whole tone of the OVA is, strangely enough, rather lighthearted.Overall, while there are worse OVAs out there, “Makaryuudo” is rushed and incomplete, and has subpar technical aspects. The demon designs are pretty neat, though, and this is a rather “harmless” OVA and not hard to sit through, so you may want to watch it for the cool ‘80s aesthetic.";Mixed Feelings
0;Makaryuudo Demon Hunter;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;This little one-shot OVA is totally weaksauce. Awful on so many levels.Yama is not your average high school girl. She has secretly been sent from the underworld in order to fight eeeeeeevil! The overall premise is sort of cliched, especially when compared against many similar type of anime OVAs and movies that flooded the market at around the same time. But all those other shows must have sucked up all the talent, because they must have had the B-team (or maybe even the C-team) of writers and animators working on this.The quality of the artwork and the clunky animation are sub-par to the point where it noticeably detracts from the viewing experience. You are stuck watching how terrible the key animators are at staying on model (the amount of 'right-hand bias' is staggering), to pay attention to the story. But, then again, there's not exactly much of a coherent story to pay attention to.If you're going to watch this, do it for the laffs. Because if you want a cute demon-fighting tsundere warrior, there's many other anime to choose from that are miles better than this.;Not Recommended
0;Zoku Koihime;Marquez103;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marquez103;8;Zoku Koihime is a sequel to the original series. It pretty much contains all the same characters from the original, but now includes a new girl called Tomamo and her father Enra. As a sequel, it continues where the story left off and answers some questions.Story (8): As far as the story goes, its pretty good compared to most hentai as it follows the original storyline. I would write what the plot is about but its probably better I dont so you can watch it yourselves. Theres some comedic and romantic moments and not so much NTR, so most of it is guilt free.Art (8): The art is the same as the previous Koihime so it isnt top of the line like Bible Black, but it is a little more smooth and detailed. Unfortunately, the censorship is worse than most hentai ive seen and can be really annoying at times. I dont know if theres an uncensored version so unless I see one, the score isnt getting any higher.Sound (9): The original voice actors are here and the music isnt too loud so the sound is good.Character (10): The characters are the same which is a plus and the introduction of Tomamo really helped. Personally, Tomamo is my favorite character so i guess its a little biased, but for the most part all the characters are well developed.Enjoyment (8): I thought it was a good sequel to the story with some pretty good sex scenes including a threesome, but the censorship really killed the mood at times that can be hard to ignore. Once its censorship free, this show will really shine.Overall I give this hentai an 8. The story is nice and well developed with good sex scenes but the censorship is a heavy anchor. Either way though I recommend watching it since its worth a watch to see how the story end with some good H scenes.;Recommended

0;De:vadasy;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;4;"The late 90s; a golden age of anime. When anime was licensed and imported all over the world with almost no regard for whether or not it was actually any good. Since this is De:vadasy we are talking about it definitely falls in the not very good category. De:vadasy can best be described as erotic Mecha, except without any real eroticism. It’s typical of the crap that cluttered this era. I am not sure what is more exasperating; that a company wasted the time and money to necessary to make an English dub or that people actually purchased this tripe.The plot for De:vadasy revolves around alien creatures that have invaded the earth and can only be combated with special Mecha units. These Mechs are piloted by naked couples using their sexual energy to power it. No don’t worry you didn’t read that incorrectly. Basically our pilots are getting masturbated and fighting the good fight against aliens! It sounds like a hentai plot but there isn’t anything sexy or remotely interesting about any of it. Even if you like this kind of thing you’re unlikely to be satisfied. The action is boring, the story fails to deliver anything of substance, and there isn’t enough sex or nudity to appeal to fans of hentai.For a Mecha title there is a shocking lack of any exciting Mecha action. The battles are dull and uninspired and seem to be over almost before they even begin. Much of the story centers on the main characters trying to become one as a team in order to operate the Mecha effectively. But given its embarrassing nature its obvious how things are going to play out. The story also fails to resolve any of the plot elements. Neither the character relationships nor even the ultimate war effort against the aliens ever seem like they are adequately resolved.De:vadasy's characters are equally uninspired. You have your classic tsundere lead that loves the male lead Kei but can’t honestly admit her feelings to him or herself. Not that Kei is all that interesting of a guy anyway and honestly I don’t know what she saw in that dork. He ignores her and pines after the mysterious green haired girl, who I am sure had a name and I might even go back to see what it was if it didn’t mean I had to watch any more of this shit. Besides basic introductions little is explained in regards to the characters, their backgrounds, or their endings. Most of what they do provide makes little sense.Visually De:vadasy is really ugly. The colors are washed out and the character models and action are unappealing. It really looks like something you would expect to see from the early 90s and given this show is not even 10 years old and it looks so dated already is the main reason I give it such a low score. The acting and musical score are as equally uninspired and lifeless.I can’t recommend anything about this series. It is pretty much equally horrible in every category. If you’re looking for boobs and sex just find some hentai and if you’re looking for Mecha action there are literally hundreds of better ones than this. Seriously don’t waste your time like I did.";Not Recommended

1;Bishoujo Comic Lolicon Angel: Mitsu no Aji;opernlied;https://myanimelist.net/profile/opernlied;8;“Lolicon.” We hear it all the time, yet the term always seems to lack definitive meaning in modern anime communities.However, there is really no doubt to its application here. Certainly a controversial gem of hentai, “Lolicon Angel” is, in short, a lolicon hentai, depicting young girls engaging in sexual acts. The issues surrounding lolicons are undoubtedly a touchy subject, and the very low number of animated lolicon hentai only serves to reinforce this. Nowadays, a production such as this would never be released.Beyond its gratification, though, “Lolicon Angel” takes an interesting approach in its narrative. The premise is simple- a young girl loses her money and two of her friends help her investigate the possible theft. There are three suspects, so they split up in order to confront each suspect. Little do the girls know that they are about to uncover a hidden side to themselves. Each segment has a girl exploring the pleasures of sex, and the presentation of these scenes leaves a lot of room for debate.Accordingly, the opening sequence outlines the idea of sexual exploration that permeates this OVA. While they are showering, the three girls discuss their curiosity with the male “thing” as an object of fascination. After the shower and discussion, as if in a bout of catharsis, two of the girls decide to get “playful” with the third.The first segment has one of the girls confront a female student. In a shocking turn of events, the girl finds herself in an unfavorable situation as a teacher becomes involved. The teacher-student relationship is explored here, and there is definitely an interesting religious metaphor being used in this segment when the teacher mentions a punishment from God.The second segment has a girl confront a male student. A relationship soon builds upon a few misunderstandings, beginning with a love letter, and a simple yet delicate boy-girl pairing is explored. The boy demonstrates the essence of primordial lust that is so natural to the growth of his gender, whilst the girl remains constant in her innocence and naivety. This segment arguably exemplifies the crux of the OVA’s themes as the boy exerts his knowledge that is unknown to the girl.The third segment is perhaps one of the most surreal to exist in hentai, involving a girl and an old father. A “merry-go-round” becomes the focal point of sex, and the scene undoubtedly banks on the limits of absurdity. The logic behind this is complicated, but this segment seems to make a reflexive statement on the escapist nature of hentai, suggested by the delusions that the old father embodies.An interesting twist brings the OVA to a close. Yet, in the process, the young girls have uncovered much more than the money that was lost. Important to note is that the girls still retain a sense of innocence, in that they are never explicitly informed about the act of sex. Rather, they have only experienced its pleasures without the reason, adding another possible level of discussion.Unfortunately, the OVA’s technical aspects do suffer. Being from the 80s, the animation and designs, while decent for their time, have not aged well, and this is evident in the crucial sex scenes. The soundtrack comprises of simple compositions that serve an atmospheric purpose, but are unmemorable and lacking in presence. The voices for the young girls are another issue, as the voices do not properly represent the OVA’s themes of innocence and naivety.However, the technical aspects do excel in other areas. There are a variety of angles and perspectives in the cinematography, showcasing the sex scenes in a dynamic format. Alongside this is the editing, which lends the OVA a fair amount of its creativity. Some of the most powerful use of editing in hentai is employed in this OVA, using a scene transition to present the “climax” of the sex scenes. Such a technique accomplishes much more than conventional presentation, adding another level of ambiguity to the scenes.At just under 22 minutes, “Lolicon Angel” can certainly be considered ambitious within its genre. Ultimately, it is a real treat for hentai aficionados and loli enthusiasts alike.;Recommended

0;Wizardry;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;7;"Don't let the rating put you off this one. Its not as pretty or grand as many other sword and sorcery animes of the period but it is a very solid and enjoyable watch nonetheless. Definitely worth its hour long runtime.The story is very generic but also very faithful to the dungeon crawler game it is based on. Many similar ova adaptations of rpg games ditched this aspect to break free of video/table top game constraints. But by staying faithful, the spells and character classes benefit from a added depth and charm. Similarly, the pacing follows a rpg style encounter, party member, exploration routine. This works well for a hour long action ova and I can't see anyone messing something simple like this up. My only complaint is that the supposed big bad is stopped before he ever comes out, despite the considerable build up leading to his return to this realm. Many old ovas suffer from the flaw of a rushed or confused ending but at the very least, this one's ending is neither particularly rushed nor unsatisfying in any way.Character is the strong suit of this anime. In a short 60 minute run, what an action anime should deliver isn't deep character development but rather, appealing character designs and personalities and the chemistry between the characters as they face dangers together. Wizardry delivers in all three aspects. You get the standard magic swordsmen, healers, apprentice spellcaster and elf against the standard zombies, vampires and demon stuff. And then theres also more original stuff such as the badass ninja character (called Hawkwind no less!) and a demonic harlequin. Easily the best part of this anime is how all the characters overcome their initial differences and cover each others backs to defeat monsters stronger than the sum of their individual abilities.The art is average for its time. This includes both animation and the quality of the frames and drawings. The designs themselves are also very generic; but being based off classic dungeon crawler aesthetics, the anime somewhat gets away with this. Last thing of note is the darker colour palettes. Not as bright and vibrant as many other fantasy animes though you can argue that dungeons are supposed to be dark.Sound is standard synth soundtrack, the sort of unmemorable stuff that a vast majority of anime of this period had.If Wizardry has a flaw, its the fact that it isn't spectacular. There are fantasies out there with better art, characters, music and/or story but what Wizardry does have, it delivers with perfection. A solid hour long watch for any fans of retro rpgs, D&D tabletop style games and sword and sorcery fantasy.";Recommended
1;Wizardry;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;Rated a 7 (Good)Seen via english subEver play a role playing game with dungeons? like l.o.t.r.o. or elder scrolls? This movie takes that experience and puts it into a if that were real this is how it could be played out. That idea alone of taking a lot of people's fantasy for the r.p.g. area make me happy and others too i would imagine. Sure, one could fight a monster or two or hundreds but this setup was a rarity/unique. Granted how people knew how this dungeon worked without informing the viewer was a little sloppy for an intro. Then again, the main cast was not 'rookies' in their words. All that aside, the flow went well straight to the nice ending.p.s. word of advice... depending how you see the movie via an English subtitle pay attention to what spells are cast/effects. Descriptions tend not to matter in general but this is an exception.;Recommended
2;Wizardry;rooster_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rooster_;8;"At the time of this OVA's release, the Wizardry series of dungeon-crawling fantasy video games was immensely popular in Japan. The genre continues to be bigger there than in the West, with many indie and mid-budget releases taking direct inspiration from the franchise. Wizardry was hugely influential to fantasy RPGs as a whole, and many of the tropes related to magic spells, character classes, and monster types can trace their origins to it.All of this is to say that the Wizardry OVA is a strikingly faithful adaptation of the Wizardry video game experience, and of the dungeon-crawling experience as a whole. A team of adventurers with clearly-defined combat roles tackle the increasingly-dangerous floors of a subterranean dungeon, with the ultimate goal of reaching the bottom floor, where the evil wizard Werdna lies. Actually, when we first meet the party, they're largely uninterested in confronting Werdna, as they're comfortable making money off of mid-level monsters, an experience that players of dungeon crawlers will be all too familiar with. The way in which this OVA makes direct gestures to the way in which one would play a Wizardry game without feeling contrived or awkward is kind of impressive.From there, the story kicks off in a predictable but satisfying way; suffice to say, it doesn't stray from the main quest of the original Wizardry games. Negotiate traps, slay monsters, kill the final boss, and retrieve the magical artifact. The kingdom is at peace once more. A likable core cast and a series of exciting action scenes make the OVA fly by. The character designs and animation are typical of OVAs of the time, with sharply-defined features, a somewhat muted color palette, and stock lighting/special effects. Although nearly the entire OVA takes place inside a dungeon, there is enough care put into background work to make it feel atmospheric and not drab.Though sword-and-sorcery fantasy is a common setting for Japanese video games, it's rarely seen in the world of anime, and Wizardry is a nostalgic ride for everyone who grew up in the era of fireball-casting mages, elven archers, shoulderpad-wearing knights, and dark, damp, dreary dungeons.";Recommended
3;Wizardry;BadAnimeReview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BadAnimeReview;7;I just stumbled upon this after “Odin: Photon Sailor Starlight”, and I’m happy I did. I’ve never played any of the games they’re based on, but I’m told that this is rather faithful.Story (6/10): for a short 40 minute OVA movie, it was pretty entertaining. It was well paced and the writing was good. It’s not the most fantastic, thought provoking tale ever told, but it’s fun.Art (7/10): you can tell who’s what in this OVA just by looking at them. The colors are dull to fit the tone, but I think it’s a bit over used. 90% of this story takes place in a giant temple that’s about 1,000 years old and run down by monsters, so it looking dark and dreary makes sense, but does the entire town need to be? Also, in the scene where they meet the big bad, they don’t look so good when the open the door.Animation (7/10): they put most of their efforts into the battles. Characters move fluidly and powerfully during these and the magic effects look pretty good. That’s not to say the rest is bad. While limited, the animators tried to get some subtle movements in so even if they aren’t doing much, they still seem alive.Sound (6/10): it has two good songs, but they’re all pretty forgettable.Characters (6/10): like the story, they’re not the deepest characters, but they do get developed and/or have some time to shine. Albert probably has the least relevance to the plot, but he never was in the way. I think he had a great build up, he just didn’t make use of it. Throughout the story, he doesn’t do much aside stopping a bad guy from turning someone to stone. Near the end, a terrible thing happens, and he feels tremendous pain and agony, but he just sits there. A shame, but I still liked his character and thankfully he’s the only character that had an arc that fell flat on it’s face.Enjoyment (9/10): it was fun, I was attached. Sure, I don’t have much to say, but those 40 minutes was a fun 40 minutes.;Recommended

0;Wizardry;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;Wizardry was an old series of RPGs. The first one was released in 1981 as a simple dungeon crawler created by students. From there it exploded and kept going for two decades with the last game, Wizardry 8, coming out in '01. Unless you want to count all the spin-offs, which have kept going with an online MMO being the most recent. Its servers shut down after a year or two though. About halfway into the franchise's life cycle there was an OVA. It was brought to us by TMS Entertainment. You may remember them from Kyougoku Natsuhiko: Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari, Glass no Kamen & Magic Knight Rayearth. So, how did they handle this classic RPG franchise? I'm guessing based on my track record of them that it was kind of middling. After all, the best series I've looked at was the slice of life drama, Glass no Kamen while the more fantasy-based ones have been rather mediocre or just all right. But maybe this one is better, or worse, than the works I've seen from them before. Let's take a look.Story:The narrative is simple enough. There's a dungeon with ten floors. Adventurers travel through the floors, save for the tenth, and they gather treasures. The tenth is avoided because that's where the big bad lurks and no group of adventurers wants to risk dealing with him. He hates adventurers getting on his lawn. Our protagonists are a party of three, not that kind, made up of Shin, Alex & Hawkwind. They're going to search for some treasures when they encounter the elderly Joeza and his apprentice Albert. The two of them are planning to take on the big bad Werdna and they need help.To be fair, that is basically the plot of the first Wizardry game. You create your party, go through the dungeon to try and reach the tenth floor and beat the big bad. Nice of them to leave that intact for the fans. That being said, there are some problems with the execution. The big one is consistency. Initially, our intrepid threesome, not that kind, decline to help Joeza and Albert because it's not worth the risk. This is followed by them almost immediately changing their minds for paper-thin reasons. Why even have them decline under those circumstances? There's also a fight scene where their enemy uses a sword beam and its impact varies for no apparent reason. One person gets their arm cleaved off. Then it hits a couple other people and they just get knocked back. Now, in a game you could call this the result of a poor saving throw but in an OVA that's supposed to have a cohesive narrative, it just makes no sense. The series also suffers from being largely mindless action. It pretty much dumps its exposition at the start and then moves into a bunch of fight sequences. I know you aren't going to manage much in less than an hour of running time, but you couldn't have cut down on the action to strengthen the story a bit? Maybe do a better job with the main trio changing their minds?Characters:The characters are pretty much a generic fantasy group. Now, in the game you make your own characters. So, it's not like they had any really well developed characters to work with. The problem is, again, the lack of consistency. It takes the characters from being kind of flat archetypes and downgrades them into kind of flat archetypes with confused motivations. It doesn't help that Shiela, our token lady for the series, suffers from a great personal tragedy by having it barely impact her. Huzzah for character reactions, or lack thereof, that remove any potential impact that the events of this series could have had.Art:For an early 90s anime, the artwork is pretty average. It doesn't look good by the standards of the time, nor does it hold up particularly well, but I can't say it looks bad. There are some awkward moments. Alex gets bitten by a zombie and poisoned but his metal boot shows absolutely no sign of damage and you have to wonder how he's actually injured in that situation. Did the zombie's mouth phase through his armour and get his flesh while leaving the armour intact? I don't recall the zombies in Wizardry having the powers of Kitty Pryde but maybe I'm just forgetting about that.Sound:The acting in this is passable. The cast is pretty solid featuring the same actors who voiced Zoisite (Sailor Moon), Alex Louis Armstrong (Fullmetal Alchemist), Will A. Zeppeli (JoJo), Netero (Hunter x Hunter), Piccolo (Dragonball) & Chief Nakamura (Ghost in the Shell.) Unfortunately, the fact that they're voicing wholly bland characters prevents them from really showing their abilities. They still do just fine, though. The music is all right. Not good, but decent enough.Ho-yay:Honestly, none of the characters have strong enough dynamics to have romantic tension. Ho-yay or otherwise.Final Thoughts:I will give Wizardry credit for making a genuine effort to capture the narrative of the first game in the franchise. Unfortunately, they couldn't be bothered to develop the characters well and the general problems with consistency hurt the series. It winds up being, while not bad, a below average fantasy work. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. If you're a huge fan of Wizardry or you just want a quick, action heavy fantasy story, consider giving it a try. Otherwise, I don't recommend it. Next week will be Kemono Friends.;Not Recommended
1;Wizardry;Silyon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Silyon;4;Imagine my surprise when I saw that there was, for some reason, an anime based on one of the first ever computer role-playing games. Now that wouldn't be all that unusual if the game in question was made in Japan, but Wizardry is an American property originally developed by two college students. I never thought the series would be popular enough in Japan of all places to receive an anime adaptation of any sort, but after looking into it a little bit it seems that even to this day there are still some spin-offs released in Japan.But enough about the game, we're on MyAnimeList and I should talk about the anime not a game that my grandpa would've played.Where to even begin? There is not much to say about Wizardry. As far as anime go it's quite innocent and doesn't having anything that would make someone frustrated or angry or any other undesirable emotion. It just sort-of is.The anime starts off presenting some of our party members mid-battle showing us exactly how skilled or cheap they are since they seem to be one-shotting all the monsters in the area. They're probably grinding low-level monsters for exp. The plot to the anime honestly matters very little, all you need to know for the purposes of this review is that there's some evil bad guy living at the bottom of a dungeon and that our group of heroes originally comprised of Alex the guy with a sword, Hawkwind the god damn ninja and Shin the other guy with a sword go into the dungeon to maybe defeat the bad guy. They don't know, they're not quite sure yet.Along the way they meet the mage Joeza who for all intents and purposes serves as a heal-bot, Albert who I don't know why he even exists, and Shiela the female mage who exists to make this less of a sausage party. These chance encounters with new friends prompt our intrepid trio to actually go after the bad guy for real, because I guess they don't have anything better to do today.From that rather long-winded description you can probably puzzle together most of what happens in the anime without having seen it so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say that the story doesn't leave any sort of impact after it's gone, even though it so desperately wants to, having not one but two named characters die. Wizardry only has 50 minutes to cram in a bunch of fight scenes, a romance subplot and a few dramatic character deaths along with the main story and the lack of time for developing any of the characters or plot really shows.Mind you, with the set of characters and plot that we do get I don't know if a longer running time would've made much of a difference, but I think it would've at least helped in not making the more sad scenes fall flat on their face.The anime is really like a dive through a dungeon in one of your grandfather's old computer games. You have a party of characters and you fight monsters, simple. Since we've established that the characters might as well be faceless ragdolls and that the story is as basic as they get all we really have left are the fights. So how are they? Not very good. The art in the fights, and just in general, is pretty good, mind you. And that is definitely the only thing even remotely praiseworthy about Wizardry, is that most of the time the art is at least above average (maybe except during the scene with the guy who has abs that look like they were drawn on with a permanent marker). The good art is not helped, however, by the downright boring fight coreography. Most fights end in one or two hits and those that don't are usually solved by random magic pulled straight out of the writers' asses and the game manual. The spell effects are nothing to write home about most of the time the spells just looks like some coloured mist that envelops the target. There are some that have decently satisfying effects but there's only like a couple of those and they're still used poorly in fights.Since I was somewhat praising the anime just now I'll throw it a bone and say that the ending song was pretty good. It's the only song that I noticed all throught the anime and that's just because it was front and center during the ending sequence. For all I know the rest of the anime could be devoid of any music.Now, to take that praise back in some way because I don't feel the anime deserves being praised so much otherwise you might think it's actually good I'll go into the overall look and feel of the anime. So, overall the anime looks pretty drab having dark colours and backgrounds with our main party being the only slight splotches of colour, though their colours are also muted. Wizardry is just not pleasant to look at, and while you could say that they're in a monster infested dungeon and that it's supposed to be dark that still doesn't make it any less drab. They could've used a torch's light to give the place a warmer feel on occasion or used colours other than musty blue and grave dirt brown. You can give the viewer the feeling they're in a dungeon without boring their eyes to tears.Well, that's pretty much all I have to say about Wizardry. It's a weird little OVA that I found worth watching just because of how odd its heritage was. You may not feel the same way however, so if you're looking for some good old fantasy anime to watch then I suggest you look elsewhere. Wizardry is certainly old but it is far from anything I would call good, the best praise I could give it is 'harmless.' So if you're in the market for some anime that simply suck up 50 minutes of your time without giving you anything worthwhile then go for it, otherwise stay away.;Not Recommended

It is a simple question Kasei Yakyoku offers to answer through the pang of four characters, during a tumultuous era of Japan. KY [thank you to banish on the recess of your mind any salacious joke in relation to a certain brand of condoms] is a original Josei tale geared around the very idea of emancipation. Indeed, the personal dilemma of Taka, Akiko, Sara and Kiyokuni hinges around it. Akiko looks to escape the confinement of the prestigious house of the Marquis Hasho, her father. At the light of the first wave feminism ideal (which is in vogue at the time) she thinks of the traditional Omiai as a dusty matchmaking device, to the dismay of Kiyokuni. Her assertive femme du monde composure breaks like a shell past the harrowing reality check, after she first interacted with the man she fell for. As for Kiyokuni, the heir of a solid banking company, he occupies an unique place in this tale for he is the only one to relinquish any vague desire of self made independence. He thinks of his arranged marriage as a necessity as much as a benediction. It highlights his complete unselfishness and then an attitude improper for a healthy romantic relationship. As for Sara, the maidservant and childhood friend of Akiko, she embodies the old-styled maiden ideal. She wants to owe nobody but ends with manifold predicaments due to her ingenuity in regards to the cruel world she steps in. Taka, the main protagonist is simply prisoner of his situation as a high-ranked mobster, whose talent to dispatch ""wordly"" affairs is much coveted by his organization's boss. It pretty much forged his seemingly reserved and detached character. As you notice, there is an interesting quator to weave a compelling story around. KY's success is heavily dependent on a right dramatization. So, does it deliver at it? Yes, it does!...This success can partly be attributed to the solid direction of Osamu Dezaki. Properly efficient at conveying a melancholic atmosphere to his pre earthquake disaster love tale, it unfolds with drawling gravity, earnest key dialogue lines and Dezaki's trademark use of pastel freeze frames, which accentuates a transient and yet etched intensity. While it lacks foreshadowing regarding certain questions (as how and when exactly Taka fell for his assistant's sister), the story holds itself well together with the limited available length it has. Probably due to time constraint, the animation can somewhat look stilted at times, which is particularly noticeable during certain action scenes. Also, the cuts to earthquake's countdown information would have gained in being inserted into the screenplay, rather than being simply shown with a drab static card. However, these are minor concerns and overall the cinematography aged finely thirty years later... Art direction in itself is lavish, particularly in the wake of the introduction. The establishing sequences, brimming with Jazz age imagery, are a sight to behold... Akiko climbing down the stairs, donned with her slanted sequin dress and her headscarf, takes one back to a dated and yet charming ambiance. A clear disruption is noticeable past the first OAV, as to signal a clear disruption between the happy-go-lucky modernity of the roaring 20s and the ever lingering Japan of traditions, holding people captive of its desiderata. The soundtrack, a low-key one, is at the image of this dichotomy with a dominant sway in favor of traditional instrumentation. It fits the mood perfectly, as a more ostentatious sound-design would have made the dramatization too overbearing.Stylistically, the chara-design opts to go for what could be called a Gekiga approach, if this term ever applied to animation. The obvious concern is to graphically convey maturity, rather than blooming innocence. Tonally, a last word has to be addressed in defense of the open ending: KY is all around rounded as a period drama. Providing a decisive ending would be as arduous as unnecessary. How Sara is supposed to find back Taka when the only clue she has is that he is alive? How the ex-yakuza can possibly reach for his lost half when he has to lay low because of a bounty on his head? How can it end in a significant way for Akiko as her sentiments are as unrequited as Kiyokuni's? What is usually considered as taunting cliffhanger does not apply here. It is a conclusion more in the style of Kayako Ebina's biopic, Ushiro no Shoumen Dare. Just like a harshly smite Tokyo recovers, the scarred protagonists hold on as good as they can. That's how life naturally goes, with its share of dead ends and wasted opportunities.If you are set to watch a period drama/romance series capped off in a bittersweet way, you cannot go wrong with Kasei Yakyoku. It is mature, paroxysmal, elegant in spite of some cheesy melodramatic accents. It is going to leave you hanging, and that, is the evocative magic the underrated studio of Satoshi Dezaki prides itself in.Praise be unto Sacred Geometry~..| Colophon |..This section is dedicated to content indication in order to inform audience in a practical way. On the next paragraphs, the potential spectator gets hints about the title's strong suits and drawbacks.Ketchup meter: Violence mostly permeates from the unfulfilled distress of the protagonists. The action scenes aren't too racy even though the conflagration in Hanai's house shows some teeth.xXx meter: There are bare breast scenes. They're not staged through a voyeuristic lens though, as they are there to evidence a couple's sincere passion or in the case of Akiko and Taka's pair the glacial, loveless reception of sexuality.Fishing scene(s): None.POSITIVE aspects:+ A rare Josei tale foreshadowing a little known Historical disaster+ Osamu Dezaki's literate cinematography+ Care for characterization and cast interactions+ Tonal consistency in complete favor of tragedy (without gratuitous misery pornography or jarring bits of comedy)NEGATIVE aspects:- Lack of build up regarding certain key plot elements- Somewhat campy lines, here and there- A slightly unlined editing at times (instance: the love scene between Sara and Taka.

0;Kasei Yakyoku;azizsahar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/azizsahar;6;This had so much potential, but was poorly executed on different levels. Makes me wonder and eager to search more for the ideal work by Dezaki. I'm really interested and fan of two things in this: the historical period it is dealing with, and realistic anime, both in the art and storytelling. I just love these works where they try to make characters and situations look and act as real as possible, competing with films even. Curiously, plenty of such examples (and far better) are found in manga compared to anime. Imagine if this was done by a talented group specialized in noir, my rating would definitely go higher than 6.;Mixed Feelings
1;Kasei Yakyoku;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"With aesthetically pleasing character designs, a Taisho era setting, and intriguing tales of romance against the backdrop of a natural disaster, “Kasei Yakyoku” is a decent OVA. However, with only four episodes, it is far too short to provide necessary character development and a satisfying resolution to the story.The character-driven plot involves a rich young woman named Akiko; her maid, Sara; Kiyosumi, the wealthy banker that Akiko is being pushed to marry; and Taka, a handsome member of a crime syndicate. All of the characters, rich or poor, are restricted in some way. They yearn for freedom and independence, and think that the others have what they lack, although those that they consider “free” are just as bound as they are. As the drama centered on these characters unfolds, and their lives intertwine, the date of the Great Kanto Earthquake inches closer. What will happen to these characters after the earthquake strikes? Will they be able to find each other and confess their honest feelings?I will go ahead and say that while the ending of the OVA does hint at some developments, it is open-ended and vague; I guess the intent was to have viewers pick up the manga afterwards to find out how the story went. (The manga appears to be out of print, by the way.)The characters are unique, and it’s interesting to see how they play off of each other. Akiko’s immaturity and naiveté can be a little grating, but it’s understandable. Sara, who arguably is the heroine of this OVA, gets fairly good character development for what little time there is for it. Kiyosumi is rather undeveloped, but he fills his role satisfactorily. Taka acts like a jerk half the time, and a kind and considerate person for the rest; his character is a bit unstable and could have benefited from more backstory.The music is decent; pleasant to listen to, but on the bland side. It does fit the tone of the series well, however. The voice acting is okay. Sometimes, it felt like the actors were speaking too quickly to try to cram as many lines in as possible (perhaps, again, due to this only being 4 episodes long). But the voices were appropriate for the characters.As for art, the character design is superb. Designed by Akio Sugino, who also designed characters from “Rose of Versailles,” the characters in “Kasei Yakyoku” have a classic Art Deco look that’s really appealing. The backgrounds look nice as well. The animation is good, but there are some parts (particularly dramatic scenes) that switch to still artistic shots for some reason, perhaps for emphasis.The basic story is solid, but the execution can be a bit off. Scene transitions are a bit rough at times, and there are some parts that just don’t blend well together. While most of the plot is carried forward logically, there are a few critical instances that rely on convenient coincidences, which strain one’s suspension of disbelief. As mentioned earlier, the ending does not conclude anything for any of the main characters, and thus is unsatisfying.Also of note, there are a few sex scenes and some mild nudity, but they are important to the plot (i.e., not strictly “fanservice”). There is also some violence, and a few of the secondary characters are killed on screen.Overall, due to the design, the characters, the setting, and the unique premise, this is an interesting OVA, although it’s difficult to recommend to a general audience due to the objectionable content and the inconclusiveness of its story. If you’re into aesthetically-pleasing character-driven melodramas set in the 1920s, though, this one should not be missed.";Mixed Feelings

1;Gosenzo San'e;Ghost-Hardware;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ghost-Hardware;7;A hentai with an actual plot? And it’s… pretty good too? Say it ain’t so.The story follows Gen, who moves to his families’ mansion after his mother dies. Here, he’s introduced to his wheelchair bound grandmother and her mysterious silver haired maid. His family line holds a dark secret, which is slowly revealed to us during the course of the show. The mystery of his past and the inhabitants of his new house was actually pretty interesting, and the melancholy atmosphere was a large factor. The pacing was good too, not too fast or slow. Sadly, I thought the actual mystery did start to fizzle out towards episode 3.In terms of presentation, the animation was nothing special but the art was appealing and above average when you compare it with Hentai from the same time period (1998). The music was good and FAR better than your average hentai. There was an issue with the sound mixing in episodes 2 and 3, the music was so loud I could barely hear the voice acting in some scenes. I watched with the original Japanese audio, so I could of course still read the subtitles but a bit strange that this was overlooked.There wasn’t that many H scenes either. In terms of tastefulness, it was a mixed bag. Obviously, there were scenes that were included just for titillation, I mean part of the plot is that Gen’s ‘curse’ forces him to inseminate as many women as possible. That being said, quite a few scenes were actually tasteful and in general what was there was generally short. An effort was made to tie the sex scenes into the story. Hell, often it just faded to black without showing anything at all. There’s actually an upload on Youtube of the full four episodes with all of the H scenes removed.You know what's surprising? This was directed by the same person who directed Welcome to the N.H.K.! It was odd watching a Hentai show that had an actual story, characters that had something resembling a personality and an atmosphere that wasn’t overly happy. Nothing about the show was ‘great’ but this is easily the best Hentai I’ve seen as an overall package, and it works as a show in its own right.;Recommended

Recently orphaned, he has to move into his grandmother's house, and he unwittingly triggers the Hiraga clan's curse in which nearly every member leads to a tragically short life. Soon, Gen's begin's to unravel vague memories from a dream that he's always had. With the help of an American graduate student, they try to uncover the secret of the Hiraga bloodline.The whole thing is actually pretty well paced, something that I wouldn't expect from a hentai. Normally a hentai either has no plot, or a plot that rushes through it so fast that it makes you question why they included a plot at all.While some of the acting English dub isn't all that bad, it's still pretty much the standard fare for an English hentai dub. Props to the voice actor for out main character, Gen, who sounds as stiff as a board. But on the upside, the animation and art artstyle is also actually quite good.Also, apparently Gen's bloodline suffers from a rare ""condition"", and Gen ejaculates gold semen, called ""Aqua Permanence"", which can lead to immortality if consumed. After Doing a cursory search on google and ruining my search results forever, yellow semen can range from something as simple as a dietary change, infrequent ejaculation, to an STI , and even abnormally high white blood cells and jaundice. Basically, yellow semen doesn't mean immortality, it means that you probably should see a doctor, and quickly.On the sex front, it's not that bad, but the OVA isn't really all that focused on the sex, instead making it more of a catalyst for the plot to exist. I don't know if it was made the way it was to be called a 'hentai', or if it was studio mandated to make it a hentai and the team behind it had to work around it, but if you edited down the sex, the plot would still work.Would I recommend Gosenzo San'e? Yes, but weirdly enough, not for the sex. The story and characters are blander than tofu, but the fact that it actually tries to have both a plot, as shallow as it is, as well as being decently paced and atmospheric, it makes it a decent watch for the people who might want to watch an incredibly obscure anime. Here I was expecting another terribly put together horror hentai like ""Mystery of the Necronomicon"" or ""Alien From The Darkness"", but I actually got something half-way decent.";Mixed Feelings

However, the reviews at Anime News Network spoke highly of this feature, and the artwork was very pretty, so my interest was roused. It took me sometime but I was able to track it down and watch it.And I wasn't disappointed. MASQUERADE (or its more appropriate Japanese title of ANCESTOR's GLORY) is more or less like every other hentai, where a guy and a girl get together and do it – but thankfully the story that centers around this is a fairly good one, that boasts a decent narrative and characterization.A newly orphaned teenager goes to stay with his grandmother, and learns that his family discovered the secret to eternal life - a golden liquid within their bodies that comes out whenever they get excited. The problem is, the more times he gets excited the closer he comes to dying, a fate all his relatives have shared. He ends up getting lucky with a lot of females: his housemaid, a foreign college student trying to get his golden fluid, his gorgeous school nurse and her overachiever daughter (who is the best character in the feature), and his new schoolteacher who is holding a secret of her own...For the most part, the story is suspenseful and mysterious enough to be fairly interesting. Things move along at a fairly even pace, giving enough time for the story and the characters to develop well enough to be interesting. The artwork is well-done, reminiscent of TENCHI MUYO; it's actually made by the same people who did that show, and thus in some respects acts as a more adult version of the show. The voice actors are basic, but do their job all right (the English dub is sub-par, you're better off watching this in pure subbed Japanese).There are probably better hentais out there. But this one at least has an engaging story and characters, and is worth watching once.";Mixed Feelings

0;Hakata Mentai! Pirikarako-chan;kekekeKaj;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kekekeKaj;6;"I ended up watching this after Crunchyroll's random feature landed me on its page. At the time of viewing, this show's rating average barely broke the 5 mark, so it's fair to say I didn't exactly have high expectations. Still, how painful could it be to sit through a series of sub-5 minute show? (Actually, I just remembered my experiences of grinding through ""Teekyuu"" so the answer would appear to be ""very"".)Perhaps due to my low expectations, I ended up rather enjoying these shorts, finding the episodes to be silly and fun.But what is Hakata Mentai about?Uhh, I'm not entirely sure I can describe the premise properly. From what little information I could find, the show is supposedly based on a shopping district in Fukuoka's Hakata district. The main character Pirikarako is some kind of ... fairy ... thing? Who, along with her companions - a red blob and three floating strawberries - goes around and ... does weekly weird stuff ...... Look, the plot doesn't matter okay? I'd no clue what the heck was going on at first, but I found it's easy to move past that and just sit back and enjoy the zany humour. The setup might be strange, but the individual stories are coherent enough to entertain.Over the course of the series, Hakata Mentai features various food items that I presume the real life Hakata district is well known for. The series can come across as a thinly veiled advert for the local attractions, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I remember when I used to watch traditional TV a long time ago, I often enjoyed some of the adverts shown during the breaks for their creativity and sense of humour ... at least for the first five times or so that I watched them. Well, Hakata Mentai is a bit like those. Most of the entertainment value stems from the amusingly random nature of the show and the often well delivered punchlines at the end of each episode. For sure, some of the episodes are significantly funnier than others - in particular, a few of the episodes in the middle were duds - but with such short episodes, there's barely enough time to be bored before it's over.The animation quality is about as cheap and static as you would expect for a series with such short episodes. It has a fittingly bright, childish colour palette, but beyond that there's not much more to say here.Having watched it, I'm a bit surprised by the low ratings garnered by the show. It's true that no sane person's gonna unironically declare this as the epitome of anime, but I personally found it to be a charming, amusing romp. If you've got a few spare minutes, you could do worse than spend it watching an episode of this.Personal rating: +0.5 (decent).";Mixed Feelings
0;Porphy no Nagai Tabi;Tien;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tien;8;"I feel bad for the people who watched Porfy no Nagai Tabi while it was airing. Because so few people were watching it to begin with, there was no one interested in subbing it; in fact, the entire show (52 episodes) had already aired before a fansub group finally began to work on it. This led to the show being largely ignored during its runtime, which is unfortunate because it's a good series despite its unpopularity.Released in 2008, Porfy no Nagai Tabi is one of the most recent World Masterpiece Theater releases. It's directed by Tomomi Mochizuki, who has recently garnered infamy for having directed the anime adaptation of Pupa. Don't let this discourage you though; most directors have a blunder or two, some worse than others. Mochizuki deserves to be better known for series such as Saraiya Goyou, Zettai Shounen, and, of course, Porfy no Nagai Tabi.This show has an interesting arc-based structure. The first 10 or so episodes detail the simple life of Porfy, Mina, and their parents in a small village in Greece. It's all very mundane, but there's this charm to the main characters that makes you want to keep watching. Porfy is a good-natured but sometimes rash 14 year-old boy with an almost obsessive interest in automobiles. Mina, his younger sister, balances this out with her sweetness and innocence. Together, they go to school and play with friends while the family works toward building a service station at their home. It's a happy time for them, but not for long.After a certain event occurs, the series is then divided into several distinct arcs. A few episodes are devoted to the aftermath of the event; then, when Mina eventually goes missing, the main storyline of the show begins. The bulk of the story involves Porfy traveling to different locations across Europe to search for his sister, experiencing new things and meeting people with good intentions as well as those with more questionable motives. This traveling arc comprises two halves: the first half is a series of mini-arcs that are each about three to four episodes in length. Each mini-arc is about Porfy's interactions with the people he meets and how he lends a helping hand to solve their problems.The second half changes this up a bit; it's composed of episodic stories that are more ""standalone"" in nature. For example, one episode is about Porfy staying in a town with very strange customs. Another episode simply shows Porfy walking through the countryside with nothing significant occurring aside from a couple of brief interactions with passersby. I guess that's realism for you!The show isn't all about Porfy though. We also get glimpses of Mina's new life after she's taken in by a traveling gypsy woman and her family. In fact, the last ten or so episodes are primarily focused on Mina as she experiences an unexpected but fortunate turn of events in Paris. The purpose of this last arc is to build everything up to a finale — a satisfying one for sure, but unfortunately the show ends right at the climactic scene (it even plays in slow motion through the credits), which leaves the viewer craving for an epilogue of sorts to tie up all the loose ends.A series about traveling isn't complete without pretty scenery, and Porfy no Nagai Tabi doesn't disappoint. The background art in this show is gorgeous; both landscapes and cities are drawn with stunning detail, and what's more impressive is that the show maintains the quality of the art through all 52 episodes. On the other hand, the character designs are somewhat simple with no shading, so the contrast between the two may be a little jarring at first.The soundtrack is appropriately mood-enhancing; that's all I really have to say about it. Something interesting I noticed was that the overall sound of the music changed to suit each new city or location that Porfy visited. For example, the tracks that play during the slice of life arc in Greece consist mainly of soft piano and violin; however, in Paris, the accordion and synthesizers are introduced, which I thought was a nice touch.In short, Porfy no Nagai Tabi is a story about friendship, new experiences, loneliness, loss, and, most of all, growing up. Many viewers will probably dismiss it as boring, especially since it's 52 episodes long, but if you like these types of stories then you'll definitely want to experience this journey with Porfy and Mina.";Recommended
1;Porphy no Nagai Tabi;TRURTLE;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TRURTLE;7;"Porphy no Nagai Tabi is really not an anime to watch if your looking for something intense, fast paced or addicting (it's a slice of life ^^"").The anime is light and soft despite it being about two wandering orphans without a home because it's being shown through a child's eyes. The anime continuously hints at darker things going on behind the scenes yet these are only subtle hints that have no importance in the story whatsoever and as we watch Porphy and Mina start to shift and change as they grow, we see a little more of these come to light. More complex emotions are shown (although they're still not that complex) as Porphy begins to mature and come into contact with more people who are reluctant to take pity on him.Story 6/10 - The story is very slow paced and is definitely not for everyone. I found the story intriguing and it definitely keeps you watching since there is no way predicting what's going to happen next but if you're watching for the story alone, you'll quickly grow impatient. It's the characters, their journeys and appreciating the art and sound that will make you love this anime.Art 7/10 - If you only look at the landscapes and pretend you can't see the characters (LOL) you'll be left thinking the anime was pretty beautiful but then you see the characters and they look like they've been drawn on classic paint. No, all jokes aside, I really did enjoy the art, the landscapes were beautiful and the contrast between the characters and the background (such a big contrast) was actually quite refreshing.Sound 7/10 - The sound really, really grew on me. Again, it's really not for everyone. Super slow (I found it calming) with piano. The music is actually hard to describe but it's well picked and really does suit the feel of the anime.Character 8/10 - If you don't get emotionally attached to characters easily then you probably won't care much for the characters in Porphy no Nagai Tabi. I enjoyed watching them slowly grow. Going through their journey with them and coming across different people who all treated them differently was really, really enjoyable. There was much more to each character than was actually shown and this was done pretty well since the more Porphy matured, the more insight he had and thus the more you were able to see about each character.(skipping enjoyment because i cba)Overall 7/10 - Even though, I got pretty impatient towards the end, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I've said this a thousand times but it's definitely NOT for everyone. If you like to take your time with anime, appreciate the thought and effort that went into it and get ridiculously attached to characters as soon as they appear then you will really enjoy this anime. It's really cute.. if you're into watching things grow and seeing things from an innocent point of view then you should give it a go :) especially if you wanted something light to pass the time.";Recommended

0;Lolita Anime;eririri;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eririri;7;"Being the first animated hentai series, Lolita Anime is perhaps most often watched nowadays for its historic value. Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by.Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions.Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.";Recommended

How did main character suddenly receive power of flight? Again, was for comedy intention but seemed random.Overall a nice idea. Structured in an odd manner. At least character messages made sense given role change.;Recommended
0;Body Jack: Tanoshii Yutai Ridatsu;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;5;"Body Jack feels so much like the plethora of perverted school comedies that came out in the 80s. Perverted teenagers get strange powers or mysterious machines that allow them to fulfill all their naughty fantasies with the girls of their dreams. Much like those films now; this one feels dated, silly, and not all that funny.The story is in a word; lame. Asagaya a teenage boy with the kinds of thoughts I imagine they have at that age regarding the cute girls at his school. In an extremely silly turn of events he is given a machine by a mad scientist who will allow him to have out of body experiences and basically take control of the body he enters. He wastes little time using the machine and immediately stalks his way to a classmates house Komaba, who he has fantasies about. He takes control of her body and creepily uses her to leer at her naked body and then have lesbian sex with his childhood friend Nakano. Yes, it is just as disturbing as it sounds. The plot plays out predictably and isn’t all that good. The sex was about the only reason to watch it and some of that was surprisingly good.This anime is basically hentai. There is, particularly over the last half of the anime nothing but masturbation and fornication going on. Though the sex scenes are pretty tame and I guess considered censored. Typical of what one would call ""soft-core porn"". Since the sex scenes are such a big part of the show, it’s worth noting that they are mostly pretty good and manage to be somewhat erotic and sexy.Asagaya as a human being is pretty despicable. I feel very sorry for Nakano who crushes on him pretty hard and is tricked unwittingly by Asagaya into admitting all her feelings for him while he was possessing Komaba. The fact that he himself doesn’t seem to have a decent bone only seems to find this information as amusing and perhaps as an opening for him to have more sex with her after returning to his own body. He has the mentality of a 14 year old and the events of the story do little to change his character. Typical for his age but he’s not at all interesting as a love interest.Nakano and Komaba come across more as victims than anything else. Especially Komaba who is so horrible used and abused that it is really very sickening. The events at the end of the story are very disgusting. I guess the only saving grace would be that her consciousness is unaware what is happening to her. Nakano, as a tsundere type atleast gets a bit of physical revenge back though I did feel for her for the reasons mentioned earlier.Visually, Body Jack is mixed. The art and animation is typical of the 80s and I am unsure how much my dissatisfaction was due to the poor quality of the source. The colors are drab and washed out looking but the character designs, and the sex scenes are quite well done. One thing older anime typically does better than their modern counterpart is drawing realistically dimensioned female bodies. The music track is dated and boring. From the dull closing song to the background and incidental score which screams cheese. The acting is also not that inspired.Overall this is a very ordinary and below average show. Though you might feel a bit of nostalgia for the days of perverted teen comedies. If you absolutely must see every anime out there with sex in it then that’s about the only thing to recommend.";Mixed Feelings
0;Body Jack: Tanoshii Yutai Ridatsu;Arkylius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arkylius;4;I usually like classic anime because of their uniqueness and originality.This an ecchi anime where a boy get's power that allows him to get inside the body of the girl she likes. (Not much unique) But I liked it. But what happens after is he found out that this girl is a real sl*t. She had incest relationship with her brother who usually fu*ks her and even brings him friends to fu*k her too. What a wh*re! (I really hated this part)But he learns one thing that his childhood female friend is in love with him. So that bizarre experience wasn't that bad for him after all.;Not Recommended
0;Tsuukin Kairaku: Chikan de Go!!;BlackMagic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlackMagic;6;"I really have to split this review into two parts since this 'movie' is really a combo of 2 standalone parts: Tsuukin Kairaku Chikan de Go! and Kaihoku.Tsuukin Kairaku Chikan de Go!Art - 7Nothing spectacular but pretty good and accomplishes what it set out to do.Sound - 8The music was a good choice for ambience..kind of a soothing electronica at first, and picking up tempo as the action progressed. The voice acting was pretty enjoyable as well even if the dialogue wasn't anything outstanding. I personally liked the Narrator's lead in lol.Characters - 9Honestly the protagonist is at the forefront of the genre. His smirk and dismissive &quot;hmmph&quot; are truly world-class and I love how he warms up his hand as he scopes his prey. The other passengers on the train represented a pretty decent variety of people as well: the typical victim, the confident woman with a steely gaze, and the of course the token girl who actually wants to be molested. I actually loved how the protagonist lost interest when he realized her interest..it shows the man is a true sportsman with some class who's looking to truly test his skill. I also loved the old man who had the crappy technique lol.Story - 9Tsuukin Kairaku is a great introduction to the Chikan theme. It keeps things traditional without resorting to the typical rationalization and justification of saying all women want to be molested. This show also covered a large amount of ground in 19 minutes by showing 3 different scenarios: success, failure, and the tables turn.Enjoyment - 9.5I loved the protagonist, the music, and the overall theme. I'm a traditionalist as far as train molestation goes, meaning it should be molestation period. Trying to say the women actually want to be molested is the typical explanation, but to me it just diminishes the value and intensity of the experience.Overall - 9KaihokuArt - 7Same as beforeSound - 8Pretty good musical score on this as well and it did a pretty good job of using the right music at the right time.Characters - 5Pretty weak, there really just wasn't a strong protagonist to carry this episode. I did like how the ringleader woman did the trademark Chikan smirk. She even did that thing where she licked her lips lol. The emphasis in this show was on the victims more than the perpetrator, and this wouldn't have been a bad thing...except they are pretty much whores who gave in easily. There was really no effort expended here by either party and it left me feeling a bit disappointed.Story - 5There seemed to be a bit of potential when the teacher was browsing the mysterious website and saw one of her students on it having a gangbang lol. This set up a bit of a mystery feel for this episode as the teacher sought to discover the truth. The story ultimately took a downward turn with the lack of resistance put up. Their pathetic &quot;iiyaa&quot;s seemed more for show than purpose.Enjoyment - 2This episode really just didn't appeal to me, but then again I am more of a traditionalist as far as Chikan. If you are more open to different takes on the Chikan theme then you might like this more than I didOverall - 3Conclusion - 6I had to kind of average out the scores here and the enjoyment factor of episode 2 kinda killed it for me.However, I would highly recommend the first episode for any Chikan enthusiasts out there as it does a very great job introducing the basic concepts ^_^";Mixed Feelings
0;Kennel Tokorozawa;Daniel7689;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Daniel7689;10;Story 10/10: Rin Tin Tin wants to fuck his owner and marry her, then have puppies with her. This is very emotional and deep story about the love of a perverted dog, which has the balls to hump their owner.Art 10/10: It''s pure eye candy, I would make Rin Tin Tin my husbando, very great detail to his design.Character 10/10: Rin Tin Tin is a perverted dog, which has the very deep personality of wanting to fuck his owner and hump hump.Sound 10/10: the OST took my ears to the next dimension, and the OP beats anime like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure by far.Enjoyment 10/10: I enjoyed this OVA completely, and the teacher (no spoilers) was truly epic guy I would highly recommend to all ages.Overall 10/10: If you want to troll your friends and make a meme praise club of Rin Tin Tin go ahead you won't regret it.;Recommended
1;Kennel Tokorozawa;animeandgod;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animeandgod;9;"Story 10/10: Rin Tin Tin (similar to penis) is a an absolute mad lad of a dog. Basically he just wants to have sex with his owner Chika and have fun in other ways ;). In very absurd situations he tries to get together with Chika. Everybody except this one asshole teacher want them to be together with eachother. Unfortunately Chika is a bit of a tsundere and doesn't want to admit her own lust for him and additionally tries to hide it by trying to get with other man (disgusting). Even though Rin Tin Tin helps Chika when she is in need she still doesn't love this beautiful, perverted, slightly suicidal dog.Sound 8/10: The OST is very memorable and other animes should take this as a great example of using fitting music. This dark humor is accompanied by a silly soundtrack.Character 10/10: This story has everything a tsundere protagonist, a strong supproting cast, an awesome lover and a hideous, disgusting, perverted, pedophilic villain. The cast really fits well.Art 6/10: If this epic has one fault it is the art. It was made in the 90's but still the art isn't original. The animation is alright but still lacking for such an amazing tale. I think it's a crime to have not given this anime a huge budget considering it's amazing plot and classic-like feeling.Enjoyment 10/10: The enjoyment of this anime is neverending. It's just amazing. Kennel Tokorozawa is hilarious with many hilarious and absurd scenes. This anime really deserves more recignition and for me it's a real canditate for a classic people will be talking about for a long time.Overall 9/10: If you ever want to see an erect dog penis in anime, you've come to the right place.";Recommended
0;Kennel Tokorozawa;RafaelDeJongh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RafaelDeJongh;6;Kennel Tokorozawa is quite something, the only reason for me to actually come across this anime was that this is an anime (and sadly the only one) where Jimmy Onishi voice acts a character.For that reason I pretty much instantly had to watch it as it would just be too hilarious to see an anime with Jimmy as a voice actor in it.The story is quite something however, promoting bestiality in such a way is well not really heard off these days.But knowing Jimmy's backstory and with that he has an enhanced smell plus that he is overly perverted, I pretty much think they cast the perfect role for Jimmy!All in all it's an old and unknown anime, with a rather mediocre story and characters that pretty much only resolves around ecchiness, but it was still very enjoyable to see the anime and especially the live action part special that came with it!All in all a pretty fun watch!;Mixed Feelings
0;Kennel Tokorozawa;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;2;"Overview:This long buried hunk of garbage was recommended by a friend. I had never heard of this series until recently and apparently neither has anyone else...because MAL has no reviews available for this series. Until now!Plot:There is a dog with human level intelligence named Rin Tin Tin who lives in a kennel in Japan. So is this going to be a parody of the old Rin Tin Tin TV show from the 1950s? Well...not exactly. This Rin Tin Tin is a degenerate pervert that lusts after the daughter of the Kennel owner. If that wasn't stupid enough, EVERY supporting character urges the daughter to ""let nature take its course"" and have sex with the dog! This 1991 OVA is a combination between a D-tier Furry fanfiction and a horrendous comedy in which almost none of the jokes land! Rin Tin Tin is voiced by a stand up comedian who was apparently fairly popular in Japan during the early 1990s. I'm not positive if his entirely flat, deadpan delivery is because he is Japan's Bill Murray or if he just REALLY didn't want to be in this anime, but desperately needed the money. He had never been in an anime before and after this he never appeared in one again! The girl though is an industry veteran that also played Yahiko in Rurouni Kenshin. RIP childhood!So basically we have an uncomfortable and unfunny comedy about an anthropomorphic dog played deadpan by a comedian who doesn't want to be there. This is the anime version of Oh Heavenly Dog with Chevy Chase!!!The plot just kind of meanders for about 40 minutes and suddenly ends without any real resolution. A perverted teacher is introduced to compete with the perverted dog, but everyone ends up getting bitten by snakes for some reason. The dog assures us that the snakes weren't venomous after he gets bit in the dick and the anime just kind of stops! My head hurts just thinking about this piece of shit!Sound:This anime never received an English dub fortunately. The Japanese version with English subs is available on Youtube. The only other existing dub I could find is oddly enough a Russian dub that was done by 1 person. The Japanese audio is weird not only because it was CLEARLY ripped from VHS, but because the Japanese comedian playing the dog sounds different than everyone else. I think he couldn't be bothered to show up at the studio and recorded his lines on a Sony Walkman from the 1980s. I'm serious...I'm pretty sure that's what happened.Overall:This anime is painfully stupid, but for some reason I didn't feel it deserved a 1 because at least 1 or 2 of the jokes almost warranted a chuckle. I also enjoyed the comedian's deadpan delivery of his catchphrase: ""hump hump hump"" repeated ad nauseam throughout the series! I have no idea how an anime this terrible has escaped the public's attention, but if you enjoy the worst of the worst, you need to witness this atrocity for yourself!";Not Recommended
1;Kennel Tokorozawa;unimportantuser;https://myanimelist.net/profile/unimportantuser;1;"There once was a man who went by the name ""Justin Sevakis"". No, he wasn't some legendary MAL user, instead he was one of the big guys over at Anime News Network. Justin used to write a series of articles called ""Buried Garbage"", in which he would dig up some god-awful OVAs & other anime from the past such as ""Dark Cat"", ""Angel Cop"", & ""Mad Bull 34"". Why do I bring this up you may ask? Because buried garbage sums up this pile of schlock perfectly. Yeah, I would usually try to save calling something bad or good for the actual review, but this piece of waste is so bad, I felt the need to warn you right out of the gate. Without further stalling, lets begin.Story:The story (or lack-there-of). Is just fucking creepy. It's about this perverted dog who wants to fuck his own owner. Yes, I wish I was kidding about that.Do I even need to start on just how wrong this concept is. I can't believe somebody actually had the nerve to write something like this. This OVA is a pretty standard ecchi-fanservice fair, aside from the fact that a dog has putrid fantasies about fucking his own owner.The structuring of this series is all over-the-place, & the pacing is really bad too. The story just flip-flops between locations on a dime, one second we're at Chiko's house, the next we're at her school, now we're in the middle of town, now we're at the beach, & finally, we're at some grave-yard.As if the story couldn't get creepy enough, later on, we're introduced to Chiko's teacher, who gets the wrong idea that Chiko might be coming onto him. Instead of doing the responsible thing & trying to explain to Chiko why they shouldn't be together, NOPE! Motherfucker full out embraces this idea & wants her to come onto him, so that he may also partake in some ""Hump Hump"" (god I wanna blow my brains out for saying that). So, as if a dog wanting to fuck his own owner wasn't creepy enough, now we move onto a middle-aged school teacher. Fuck-Sake.Characters:I really don't have much to say regarding the characters. None of them see any character development, none of them go beyond 1-dimensional (maybe Chiko does but that's such a stretch). Chiko is the high-school girl character who's a bit klutzy. Her only notable character trait is that she beats up Rin Tin Tin whenever he tries to hump her, which is really satisfying for the record.Right on fucking que, we have Rin Tin Tin. I fucking hate Rin Tin Tin, I didn't think it was possible, but this anime made me hate a fucking dog! I love dogs for the record, but Rin Tin Tin sure isn't one of them. Rin Tin Tin's only personality trait is that he's a horny bastard. Next we have the middle aged teacher. There isn't much to say here really, he's pretty much just a middle-aged-man version of Rin Tin Tin, so he's just as hate-able.There are some side-characters, notably Chiko's friends, & a random bloke at a coffee shop who gets the wrong idea that Chiko is going to commit suicide. These 2 don't go beyond caricatures, & are forgotten about almost immediatelyArt:I hate to say it, but the art isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, it at least looks competent compared to Dark Cat & Sword For Truth. The animation is extremely lazy however, not as lazy as Dark Cat, but lazy never-the-less. I find it fitting that this OVA never saw pass VHS. Personally, a VHS release was too much for this turd.Sound:The sound is absolutely atrocious. The voice acting is worse than Dark Cat, I'm not kidding. It's either over-acted, or unbelievably dull. The audio quality itself is just as, if not more atrocious than the voice acting. Rin Tin Tin sounds like he recorded his lines in a tin-can. The audio mixing itself is also terrible, it will go from loud to quiet at the drop of a hat, sometimes I can barely hear the characters, other-times my ear-drums erupt.Final Thoughts/Overall.So that was Kennel Tokorozawa, it's just as painful as this review makes it out to be. DO NOT! Watch this OVA. It's atrocious in every sense of the word. It's not even funny bad either like Dark Cat or Mad Bull 34. It's just, BAD. Aside from the art, there's really nothing positive for me to say here at all. So for that, my final rating is going to be a 1/10. This shit sucks, and I feel ashamed of myself for giving this the time of day. Before anyone asks me if this is worse than Sword For Truth, yes, unfortunately, yes it is.";Not Recommended
2;Kennel Tokorozawa;SomeMoron;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SomeMoron;3;"*Completed for the 2018 Anime Watching Challenge: (93) Watch a completed anime with a popularity of or lower than #5,001*I have several questions regarding this obscure, little OVA, most of them starting with the word ""who"".Who was the intended audience, who came up with the premise, and who greenlit the idea in the first place? It blows my mind that this exists in the first place. The premise reads like a bad joke, like the bizarre ramblings of some sleep deprived writer.Our story follows Rin Tin TIn a talking dog that desperately wants to fuck his human owner, Chika (No you didn't misread that). Along the way, the dog battles for her heart against other potential male suitors, such as: The local school rapists, a misunderstanding beach resort employee, and an old, cradle-robbing math teacher. This OVA is trashy from the get go, and it never lets up.My complaints so far could be overlooked if the show was at all funny and/or entertaining, but sadly, it doesn't even have that much going for it. It is painfully unfunny, and most of the jokes it throws at you fall flat on their face. This is mainly due to the fact that most jokes revolve around Rin Tin TIn's infatuation with Chika, which come off as really creepy.It's all downhill from there, as the animation is abhorrent, and the voice acting and music are irredeemable.A complete and total failure on every level.";Not Recommended
0;Moekan The Animation;alx222000;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alx222000;6;"Moekan follows Takahiro, a strict, seemingly-cold guy, who is in charge of a facility for training combat-maid androids. The story begins with the arrival of a new recruit, Rinia, an older model android, with a clumsy streak. We then watch as the two interact.Due to it's shortness, the series shoves the story and character development along, and it feels like everything's going just a bit too fast, leaving the impression that they forgot to mention a few bits.Also, some of the story elements don't quite make sense, for instance, the company that Takahiro works for makes two completely contradictory actions. This would make sense if there was a seperate faction in the company with their own agenda, but this is never actually demonstrated, so it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps the game it's based on is more informative.There are a bunch of other elements to the story/background that I find weird, but I won't bother going into them here.Comedy is included, but it doesn't really stand out.The animation and sound are decent, though nothing special. There is some combat included in the show, and looks nice enough.Overall, the series has a warm-and-fuzzy, &quot;everything will work out alright&quot; vibe, and if you embrace that sort of feeling without worrying about the details, then you'll probably enjoy this. On the other hand, the more cynical viewers will probably utter a phrase that includes the words 'sentimental tripe' or something to that effect.Either way, you can probably find better things to watch, but Moekan will do in a pinch.";Mixed Feelings
0;Moekan The Animation;Solid_Cow;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Solid_Cow;3;Have you ever seen something so terrible that it made you feel awe? Like watching two cars collide, but you see it as a sculpture of twisted steel being built right before your eyes. That's how it feels to watch Moekan. I would warn you that this review will contain spoilers, but it's actually impossible to spoil Moekan, for reasons I'll explain later.Make no mistake, Moekan IS an awful show. The story is insipid, the characters are bland cutouts, the action is stupid, the romance is forced, the pacing is dreadful, even the OP and ED are sung off-key – there's not a single good quality to be found in this garbage heap. But somehow all these horrible elements, when mixed together and given that special KSS touch, become something truly magical. You see, saying this show makes no sense would actually be an ignorant statement. The writers of Moekan have actually created their own special kind of logic, one that only applies to this world. We are simply observing another reality, one where our own expectations have no place. Things happen which should not happen, yet we have no choice but to accept their happening. This is a world where androids are created to be maids, then trained to be soldiers. Rinia is an old combat model who has been reassigned as a maid, and her reason for coming to Maidland is to learn the art of combat. One maid is a member of 80s rock group “Alice in Chains,” yet this is never mentioned again. We know nothing about the country where this takes place, or the company that builds these killer robots, or what goes on in this mansion where every episode happens, yet we know that one of these androids has to eat and pee. A crippled man breaks his leg catching an android who wouldn't be harmed from a fall, yet the action of catching her seems to heal his leg. Two nameless bad guys want to shoot people who are on a cliff above them, so they activate their shoe rockets and fly up above their targets. Sexroids. The company is tired of all the assassination attempts made against one of their employees, so their solution is to assassinate that employee. There is no cause or effect, rather things happen and then unhappen. It's anti-plot. You can add “for no reason” to literally any scene description and it would fit. It's completely baffling, and yet it's obvious that every bit was intentional. Nothing accidentally makes sense, any possible plot thread is plotholed with expert accuracy. The creators of Moekan set out to create Moekan, and in that regard they succeeded admirably.The pacing of this disaster deserves special mention. Every episode feels like a recap episode, where you're shown things for just long enough to jog your memory since you've already seen it before. Except you've never seen it before. You see, the animators who worked on Moekan the Animation didn't want to do any animating, so they gave us the crib notes instead of the whole thing. The show moves lightning fast, yet perplexingly it also moves glacially slow. Did you know that Rinia is dumb? Surely the last 20 minutes devoted to showing how dumb Rinia is did nothing to alert you to that fact, so here's another scene showing that she's dumb. She also has a Super Saiyan mode, but that's not important, better get back to the dumb stuff. Kazusa is killing people who are trying to kill Takehito because ??? but then she wasn't actually killing people until she kills people. Also she's afraid of dogs until she's held down and traumatized by a dog until she falls in love with it. It's impossible to determine when something is supposed to be happening, almost like there is never a “before” or “after.” If anything was ever elaborated upon, then it might have crossed the line back into an attempt at sensible human entertainment, but that would involve suffering through more Moekan. As it is, the show is in an uneasy equilibrium where the smallest cut or addition would have an incalculable effect. Too much, and it would be impossible to force yourself through this ordeal. Too little, and it would no longer qualify as an actual narrative.My favorite part of this whole experience is actually the lead girl's hair-hands. Rinia's “Rinia Hand” Hands (リニアハンド rinia hando) are such a unique idea that I'm actually impressed by their existence, yet they end up being utterly pointless. Despite having two fully functional pairs of arms, Rinia never uses them for anything that she couldn't use her non-hair hands for. She only uses them for such exotic tasks as opening doors and trying to lift boxes. At least Melona actually DOES something with her hair/goo hands, however lewd it may be. In fact, Rinia has the perfect opportunity to cover herself with them in the first episode, yet she uses them to pull up her blanket instead. That's what people with normal hands do! On top of all this, no one even notices that these alien appendages exist! They're so unique that they become completely normal, which fits in with the whole bizarro world logic going on everywhere else.Moekan is not diamond in the rough, it's a rough in the diamond. If you like bad anime, it may be worth your time to study this and learn just what makes something truly bad. Become a scholar of crappy shows, and judge them against a proper metric. If you're looking for genuine entertainment, leave now, there's none to be had here. Here there be Moekan, wary traveler. Tread lightly.;Not Recommended

It got pulled due to media outrage about this new animated style of Japanese pornography.After watching it I can say, don't expect it to be the porn it was accused of being, it's actually like an 80s Lum episode with a few not sexy sex scenes added and the sexual humor ramped up a few notches. That said, it's pretty funny and the characters are madcap, over the top and a lot of fun in a way that exemplifies that specific 80s style. I watched it for its history but ended up enjoying it more than expected, there's a good number of laughs and I personally love 80s anime, so the art and animation work for me.Edited to add: I'm actually going to up my score to an 8, because there's a scene in here (it starts inside a tank) that I'm still laughing about half a day later, and few comedies ever crack me up that much. The humor is crude, but dang it really is funny!;Recommended

0;Mikan Enikki;Diogo_Gomes_1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Diogo_Gomes_1995;9;"Here we go again with yet another Nippon Animation anime show. And this time around, it's an anime adaptation of a manga series known as ""Mikan Enikki"". Or ""Mikan's Picture Diary"" as it's translated.Mikan Enikki is an anime show based on a manga of the same name by Miwa Abiko and animated by, you guessed it, Nippon Animation. Now, i've already talked a bit about the studio before in my reviews of Vickie the Viking, Wakakusa no Charlotte, Dogtanian and the three Muskehound and Corrector Yui. So you should probably be familiar with the anime studio by now.Not much is known about this show's popularity since it lasted for 30 episodes with 2 specials created and sadly faded to obscurity.Now while i said that it was based off the manga, i said it very loosely because there are many occasions where the studio did made some changes and made some new stories and characters to differenciate from the manga.But is it any good? Let's find out:The show started with a boy named ""Tom"" who was about to go home with his friends until he noticed an orange cat. At first, he never saw a cat whose fur was orange which was odd to him. But he tend to ignore it and move on. While he was going home, the orange cat decided to follow him and eventually reached home, which surprised Tom for seeing the cat following him. So he decided to ask his parents if they would adopt the cat. The parents agreed to keep the cat with them and call him ""Mikan"".It seems like things were going fine until Tom noticed something suspicious about Mikan. He noticed that the cat could laugh and has been drunk after coming back to his room to sleep. He had no idea what was going on with Mikan. So later that night, he decided to sneak onto him to find out who he really is. In which he found out that the cat was drinking Sake and not only that, but he was also talking and standing with only two hint pants. Tom got shocked with what he just witnessed and decided to take him to his room to find out what was up with him and why he was capable to do thoses things.From there, Mikan explained that he came from another village where he was taken care of by his late grandfather known as Tatsuzo. Who he originally also called Mikan ""Tom"" as well. However ever since his passing, he had to leave the village because Tatsuzo's neighborhood couldn't accept him as a real cat, but rather, as a speaking yokai-like creature.Tom felt bad for him so they decided to resolve to speak with Tom's parents to explain that Mikan is no ordinary cat and convinced them to let him live with them even if he can speak and stand with two hint paws. In which the parents agreed to, but in exchange, do not let Mikan get caught speaking to a human being.So from there, the show would tell the adventures and misadventures of Mikan, his family, his friends and what he would do through out his life.Now with all that said, let me say that the story so far has been great! Each and every stories were quite fun, interesting, hilarious, serious and sometimes a bit sad as well as there are a few moments where we'd see Mikan in some serious situations. Such as having a fight with other cats and sometimes trying to save others from getting injured.The story is very well written, as well. As you get invested into the anime, more and more you'll end up loving alot about this show and it's episodes it's been told.My favourite episodes are the ones involved with Mikan's reunion with his brother named ""Jerry"". And yes, their grandfather really did called them both Tom and Jerry (Totally not violating copyright infringements!)Anyway, i loved the episodes with Jerry because we get to see Mikan trying to understand Jerry's feelings and trying to help him out whenever he can.But like i said before, the anime is loosely based off the manga. So there were things that were changed from the manga (Like Mikan's backstory for example) and some of the chapters were never adapted into the anime. Like for example, the chapter where Mikan and his friends went into each worlds where there were magics and dragons. That was never adapted into animation.And also, unlike the manga's stories where tend to be long and introspective, the anime's stories are much shorter, eventful and suspenseful.Not to mention, some of the characters' personalities have changed here as well. For example, Mikan acts like a selfish troublemaker and does whatever he wants, while the manga despite being nosy, is well-behaved. Or how Kelly got pregnant in the anime compared to the manga version.So you can easily say that the anime's story execution is more or less original than you may think so.But is it a bad thing? Nope. I personally think they did a great job at telling it's own stories than just trying to adapt the manga faithfully.Though i do wish that we'd have more episodes to have an proper ending because the anime's ending was more of a cup-out ending than it was an open-ending to the show. I'm not gonna spoil the whole show for all of you, so you can watch the anime for yourself to make up your own thoughts on the ending.Now that i got the story out of the way, let's get into the characters:First, there's Mikan, who like i said earlier, is one crazy troublemaker who does whatever he pleases. He'd talk, stand on his own with his legs and often times play his own harmonica that he received as a present. I had a great time seeing this cat being himself. Seeing him do what he knows best, having fun playing around with Tom and of course being a troublemaker himself, he makes me giggle seeing him do something that's not normal.There's also characters that i do really enjoy. Such as the Kusanagi family. Tom is an ingenuous and caring kid who does anything he can to resolve the problems with Mikan even if they bicker at each others. His parents, Tojiro and Kikuko, are a very loving couple who rarely argue againts each others, but instead, do what they know best to make Tom's life and Mikan's life much better.There's also the cats themselves like Kurobochi, who portrays himself as a lady's man who always falls in love with a cat named ""Hana"", there's Botan, who is the fattest of the group who's always honest with Mikan's troubles and wants to stay away from his crazy stunts, there's Kelly, who would later become Mikan's love interest and more.Same thing with the human characters. There's Kyoko, who would serve as a love interest, Sera, who appears later on in the show and becomes friends with Tom when they start talking to each others and a few more.All of theses characters do serve a purpose to each episodes' stories and do make the show more interesting and fun to watch.The animation looks nice to see as well. While the character designs aren't anything new here, it gets the job done. Since this is Nippon Animation we are talking about, they do a pretty good job with what they know best. Giving more life to the characters' designs and animations and the backgrounds as well.The same thing can be said about the sound as well. The music is very well composed. You get some moments where the background musics can fit well into scenes that happen and the OP and EDs are very cute, fun and catchy to listen and sing to.And as far as the voice acting goes, the seiyuus do a great job at giving their all with their voices for the characters they voice in. Including Tarako (The second voice of Monokuma from Danganronpa series) as the voice of Mikan.So in conclusion, what do i have to say about Mikan Enikki? Well... It's yet another great hidden gem from Nippon Animation! NA does it yet again with this anime.The story is great, the art and animations are very cute, the characters are fun, the music is great, the voice acting is spectacular and of course i had a great time with this one! This is easily my favourite pet anime show ever.And the good news, people, is that the anime has been fansubbed by Ibuki Fukoi fansubs, So you can pretty much find this anime through torrents or pirated sites like gogoanime for example.But seriously though, if you're an animal lover and an anime fan, don't miss this show out. In fact, give it a watch if you can. It's a show that will definitely get you invested into it more and more as you watch the show. I know this because after i finished this show, i was satisfied with it. So i thank Nippon Animation once again for yet another masterpiece.Anyway, that's been my review of Mikan Enikki. This is José Diogo and i'll see you guys on the other side.";Recommended
0;Ankoku Shinwa;T-Wazoo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/T-Wazoo;8;"Imagine my surprise as I stumbled on The Dark Myth while browsing through Takashi Anno's resume, a director whose unique and eccentric directing skills fascinates me to no bound (he's responsible for Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou's first OVA, The Hakkenden pt.1, Spirit of Wonder: Shounen Kagaku Club, Youma, Miracle Girls, parts of Maison Ikokku, and some other obscure Magical Girls I just can't wait to watch, that is if I ever find the time...).Imagine my surprise, again, coming here and discovering the existence of The Dark Myth, aka one of the lowest average I've seen on this website, directed by one of my all-time favorite directors. Thank to y'all damn memers, I then decided I'd stay away from what seemed like a laughing stock of an anime. Then eventually, more than one year later, I finally gave it a shot. Unsurprisingly it was great. Just like most of Anno's work, it was somewhat clumsy, somewhat cheap (for God's sake, give that man a real budget already), but also somehow a fascinating piece of outsider art with strokes of genius.I'll adress the elephant in the room: yes, the almost constant flow of verbious exposition is annoying. Well to be fair it's more than that; it is inescapable, it is suffocating. Probably even moreso in the horrible English dub I've watched. At times it is more or less justified, but mostly it happens without warning, a random dude opens his mouth and then you're in for a flow of poorly articulated, confusing lore about ancient legends. Exposition in this OVA is not conveyed through animated representations of what is contained in the legends; rather, we're either presented with drawings, abstract symbolism or the scene just continues normally as the character speaks. I get why most viewers would stop taking the show seriously as soon as they are confronted with that. Maybe the only reason I didn't embark on the hater bandwagon after the 5 first minutes is that I already had a strong motivation to watch it and suspend my disbelief, as they say. Ultimately I think not having animated legends is kinda cool, it keeps history as purely oral tradition, you'll never know or see what actually happens. It's not immediately visually entertaining, but it surely is interesting in the long run. But in any case, the show has much to offer beyond annoying exposition (and unpleasant chara-design) and I'll try to present some of its best features.[The rest of this review is carelessly spoiling the plot]Basically I'll just be praising Takashi Anno's style and the way it is used to convey the script of The Dark Myth. Overall this OVA has great directing. Anno's works are never perfect (minus YKK's 1st OVA); the chara-design is often awkward, some scenes are clearly clumsily animated, the narration is often confusing... It often makes for a weird first impression and the start of DM is no stranger to that rule. Anno has a very singular way of cutting scenes, making abrupt - sometimes seemingly random - transitions. It helps create confusion... as well as mystery. DM is about a random kid that slowly discovers he's the reincarnation of an old God, being the final piece in a very intricate and complicated puzzle. We're probably as annoyed as he is with the way all those characters come to him to blabber mythical nonsense. If we're suffocated by exposition, imagine how he must feel. I'd say it's appropriate. Amidst this flow of jabbering, we'll see those characters slowly lose their humanity and sanity. See for example that scene where Kakuchiko forces Takashi to give him the other half of the golden artifact that summons Susanoah-oh. Rocks start to fly around, killing some of Kakuchiko's clan members. The chief is distressed at first, but stops as soon as he sees the scriptures written on one of the stones that just killed his friend. He starts reading and getting into that good ol' exposition vortex, no more does he pay any attention to the body squashed by that piece of rock. It's somewhat hilarious, but also morbid and shiver-inducing. Just after that, monster-ghosts start genociding the clan, in a short and beautifully animated and designed fight scene (you can feel it's the same guy that directed the amazing opening scene of The Hakkenden). Horror and death flow at high speed, flesh becomes nothing more than soft pudding waiting to be blown apart by the mere touch of the ghosts - and all the while Takashi just stares silently at the statue of Susanoah-oh, unconcerned by the massacre.Takashi Anno shows a great fascination - I'd even say a deep respect - for nature, natural phenomenon, and generally for everything that happens outside of human control. Sometimes he uses those to highlight emotions, plot elements, or whatever, and at other times it feels like nature appears on its own, at random - exactly how it should. Anno is one of the directors that understands and illustrates that the best. If you watched Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou you know what I'm talking about, but it appears in his other historical/horror OVAs like Hakkenden or Youma, in the soft-science OVA Shounen Kagaku Club and even in Miracle Girls. The easiest way to illustrate this is to pay attention to the way Anno uses lighting in general. A huge cloud that randomly obscures the characters as the speak; the soft light of street lamps caressing Takashi's sleeping body; the treasure hunter's flashlight that seems to cut through deep in the rocks; the way the sunset bends the shadows of Kakuchiko and his friend; the way Anno vividly cuts lightning shots... At times those evoke the sentiment that humans are merely third party protagonists at the mercy of natural phenomenons. It's not hard to see how those shots conveys atmosphere in a mystical setting such as this one. (It has to be noted that The Dark Myth has plenty of great dark shots, the coloring of night sceneries, caves and such, are great.)Something as simple as human shadows being projected on round rocks (in the scene where Takashi and Takeuchi stand before the rock-like eggs) and the way its shapes and curves get deformed becomes an unsettling sight. Takashi's shape gets the most deformation while Takeuchi stays normal. This is not fantastical, it's just the way shadows naturally appear when projected on rocks, but this simple shot suggests the internal deformity of the now haunted Takashi, trapped in the claws of an obscure prophecy and already on the way to losing part of his humanity, developing snake-shaped marks on his body. Takeuchi on the other hand is the monolith that has lived several centuries thanks to rock hibernation (or something), he stays exactly as he was centuries ago, his mission remains the same as ever, his shadow appears intact, human-shaped as you'd expect.Great effort are made in rendering such seemingly random elements. It is indeed a recurring quality in Anno's work, and it makes the world feel so much more tangible, despite the animation in The Dark Myth being mostly clunky. I'd say if you're trying to set atmosphere in a lovecraftian horror and mystery show, you'd better get attached to picturing small eerie elements rather than making epic gestures. The Dark Myth has been criticized for being too slow, but it's not that simple. Indeed it is slow-paced, but:1. that's an efficient way of setting ""atmosphere""2. Takashi Anno won't let you rest for too long, as he's very prone to insert lightning-fast cuts amidst contemplative shots. And once you've experienced that you know you're never fully safe from surprise and horror, as it might hide in the most lowkey places. The slow shots become that much more ominous, aquiring a more ""physical"" quality to them, a weight that might slowly evolve into dread.Anno is an experimental director, sometimes prone to let pure visual abstraction override more traditional narration, adding to the feel of mystery, wandering through a world we don't really know the rules of. One thing remarkable about those visual breakthroughs, is that they are scarcely presented with mannerism. They don't feel forced, epic, grandiose; most of the time these just... happen, naturally. And one of the way he does this is by using minimal sound effects, sometimes even mere silence. Take for example the strange walk of Hayato into the forest, following Takashi as he's entered into a trance. Hayato just disappears softly, then reappears further down the road, then does it again. With no reason other than to create a soft, non-emphasized strangeness. That's probably what makes them so powerful and puzzling, they don't feel detached from reality, rather they fit right in. They are just part of the world and the viewer can't just rationalize them, we just accept it. It is as unsettling as it is subtle.It is quite the opposite though, with pure horror scenes, which are more ostentatiously highlighted with sound effects, screams, sudden gory shots, deformations animated with care. According to Anno's directing, horror should not be understated, but the subtle way of magic in nature should have a discreet glow. Making art is surely displaying your views about the world in your esthetics. As with all of the works I've seen of Takashi Anno, The Dark Myth expresses a strong sensibility on life, one that can be expressed on magical girls show as well as in lovecraftian horror, or in a contemplative post-apocalyptic countryside series (:eyes:). Ain't that a sign of genius?I am surely not denying The Dark Myth's faults, the shots that just don't work because they're too cheap, nor will I deny some specific parts were hilarious, or that the plot was definitely too confusing even with all the f***** explanations. But I'd say the great parts overwhelmed the bad parts and I suggest you try to take it seriously, you might just be rewarded. And yeah, that goes without saying but you should try more of Takashi Anno's strange but intense filmography. He's one of the forgotten and this is nothing short of tragic.NB: here's a small list of great scenes:- Takashi going home to see his mother taken hostage; the lights, the shadows, the shot compositions are all beautiful- Takashi traveling whilst in a trance and all we see is him wandering in white spaces, his silhouette being cutted by invisible environment; train doors, shapes of people and furniture, branches and grass... I've never seen anything like this in anime- The bathing scene, introduced by an abstract underwater view of the naked lady, followed by the horrific transformation- The Kikuchi clan gets beautifully decimated by ghosts (I adressed this one already)- Kikuchiko getting killed by Takashi, then the latter gets engulfed in a ray of golden light and vanishes in front of Hayatou. There's a strange surreal feel to this scene, the colours as always are beautiful, the fountain never ceases to pour, indifferent to the drama- The treasure hunter's car getting highjacked in a dimension made of black and white stripes, the car turns slowly, revealing Takashi as smoothly as if he'd been pulled out of a magician hat, the car gets crushed seemingly by pure darkness... great trippy scene";Recommended
0;Ankoku Shinwa;WILDskf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WILDskf;6;I'm not entirely sure why this anime gets such a bad reputation. Everyone I've ever talked to who has seen it says that it is terrible, but I feel like it really wasn't that bad at all.Okay, so the art design and sound is definitely not up to par with what anime was being broadcast at the time, but it's not the art or sound that makes this suspense anime what it is. Frankly, I found the slow tense pacing of this anime very enjoyable- it's hard to find good horror anime that doesn't immediately throw tricks at you right out of the gate. A good horror story is one that uses a tense atmosphere to make you afraid even when the monster isn't on screen. And The Dark Myth is really very good at building atmosphere, albeit it does so at a crawling pace so I understand why many people find it tiresome.As far as the mini mythology lessons throughout the film, I found them to be very interesting and makes the film a lot easier to enjoy. I think I would have been terribly confused without them. Unfortunately, I cannot attest to the accuracy of The Dark Myth's telling of these myths, but from what I understood of it, they seemed clear and believable. There is far more talking than there is action, so I see why many anime fans would be frustrated with that as well. It seems to me that The Dark Myth is definitely geared as an adult mystery and not really something for teens.I think that this thriller anime definitely needs to be given a chance, and fans of horror anime who are looking for suspense should watch through it at least once.;Mixed Feelings
1;Ankoku Shinwa;Napoleon1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Napoleon1;6;You will probably find many pronouncing this anime to be one of the worst ever made, and chances are, after such negativity, you too will form a similar opinion. But looking from a completely neutral lens, this show isn't half as bad as it is made out to be. Sure it isn't one of the best, in fact not even by a large margin, but it DEFINITELY isn't the worst, at least if you have even the slightest interest in mythology.Ankoku Shinwa narrates some pretty unknown mythology (as in very less promoted over the mainstream media), which I personally find more enjoyable than going over the more known mythologies of Greece and the like. And indeed, most of the anime is pure narration of a section of Hindu mythology, set in a dark atmosphere. Those who know nothing of it yet find discovering new things enjoyable, and are also not averse to the horror theme, may actually find it pretty enjoyable. The music also wasn't unsuited to the environment against which it is employed, and the art was typical of the era, nothing unusual there.But as regards to any sort of character development or a sound plot, you won't find any, this show simply isn't designed for that. mind you, most horror shows also do not showcase their plot, but their horror element as their main theme. It is the same with this anime.Lastly, the anime itself could have achieved much more if it had been more properly directed, as the base was pretty solid. Herein lies its greatest weakness, it has everything, but nothing seems to have been put in it's proper place.Overall, do not watch this anime if you're looking for some excellent plot or fighting sequences, you won't find any. This show is only for those with an appetite for horror and who can stand a lesson in mythology.;Mixed Feelings
2;Ankoku Shinwa;therex55213;https://myanimelist.net/profile/therex55213;6;"Bad, but nowhere near as bad as everyone gives it credit, I've definitely watched much much worse things.It's very clumsy, has no character arcs, has way too much exposition, and 60% of the time the animation is sub par. That being said: the character concepts and motivations are uncommon and not particularly cliched, with mixtures of grey moralities at play that aren't exactly bland.The setting is curious, attempting to use admittedly weak representations of various mythologies to build up what seems like a shinto fantasy story, only instead tell a surprise cosmic horror story.Then there is the anomaly of the animation. As stated before, 60% of the time it's kinda shitty, but then about 40% of the time it'll surprise you with whole scenes of pretty damn fluid movement, shading and clever perspective, and at times actually getting interesting in a legitimately artistic way that it kinda had no reason doing besides to flex. I think one of the members of this OVA's animation team was much more skilled than the others, and I think you'll know when he's at the helm when you see it.The atmosphere and tone are also pretty interesting, they did a pretty good job at playing with the idea of making this more of a horror/thriller, as others have stated, if you can get past the frequent exposition dumps.Overall, this is probably objectively ""bad"" holistically as a piece of media, but it's also fascinating how much good snakes its way through the cracks of the surface, like garbage bits of it were some sort of metaphorical barrier holding back a genuinely good horror fantasy abomination of a story which we only get glimpses of beyond.6/10, watch it as something to think about the work that went into this profoundly rough gem, but don't expect to enjoy it on its own. It's for us admirers of ugly ducklings.";Mixed Feelings
0;Ankoku Shinwa;Archaeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Archaeon;1;There's a long standing debate about what the worst anime ever made actually is. Some people like to think that shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, or even some harem rom-com or blatantly ecchi shows is the worst.To the people who think of shows like those I say this - be glad you've never watched Dark Myth.Dark Myth is quite literally the worst anime ever made - period. It is to anime what Plan 9 From Outer Space is to movies - and then some.The story actually had a half-decent premise, in that the God of Darknes, Susanoah-oh, is about to be reborn, and there's a bunch of people trying to stop this from happening. The problem lies with the execution though, as Dark Myth, for some reason, decides to stop the story numerous times in order to give you a crash course in mythology - complete with repetitive syllables (and if you watch the show then you'll understand what I mean).This stopping and starting of the story leaves one feeling more than a little confused about what the hell is going on, and add to that the fact that the story gives very little information about the characters and you have a show that feels more like watching a train wreck (complete with bits flying off everywhere, people screaming and running for cover, etc).The art and animation in the show is dreadful. Considering when the show was made (1990 to be exact), it's odd that such a show could actually pass muster for release in the western market, especially as the characters are pathetically designed, the animation is oft times very disjointed, and the overuse of gore in scenes that didn't actually need it. The inclusion of so much gore made it seem more like Braindead - without the cheesy humour.The sound is, once again, shockingly bad in comparison to other shows that were made at the same time. The effects are nothing but annoying, the music doesn't really suit the scenes, and the voices are definitely forgettable.Characters in the show are pathetic at best. There may be numerous times when watching this when you'll wish that everyone dies, or you do. None of the characters have any actual depth, and all of the event in the show are aimed at simply recounting a story rather than developing a character.This is not an enjoyable show in the slightest. The poor attempt at pschological and supernatural horror, the over-use of gore, the less than one-dimensional characters, the constant and patronizing explanations, all serve to ruin what could have been at least a half decent show. This show takes itself far too seriously, and for that reason it fails in every area. The creators spent far too much time ensuring that the story they wanted was put into the show, and because of this the show lacks everything.This show is so bad that I would honestly consider it to be a form of medieval toture, and given the choice between being hung, drawn and quartered, or watching Dark Myth again, I would choose the former option. At least I know the torture will end, and I won't be constantly patronized during it.;Not Recommended
1;Ankoku Shinwa;MaddieManga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MaddieManga;1;This is, by far the most boring anime I have ever seen. I am not exaggerating. This is just awful.I’ve sat through countless slice of life anime, several terrible cgi anime, and have seen many terrible ovas. I’ve sat through my sister my writer, Master of Ragnarok, and Music girls. But this is the most boring anime I have ever seen.Sitting through this anime is like sitting through a college lecture out of context.This analogy doesn’t come from nowhere. Throughout the entire OVA there’s characters who explain myths that ultimately do nothing but pad the runtime. They do absolutely nothing for the plot whatsoever. And this isn’t just a few parts of anime either. This happens at least 6 times throughout the entire runtime. They don’t even animate the myths either, it’s just characters flapping their lips explaining stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with the OVA. It is SO uninteresting. I got so bored that I almost fell asleep FOUR TIMES.I sincerely cannot explain enough how boring this is. It’s simply not worth your time.;Not Recommended
2;Ankoku Shinwa;Yemi_Hikari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yemi_Hikari;1;"As someone who loves mythology, I found myself majorly disappointed at the butchering of Susanoo by whoever created The Dark Myth. It’s as if the creator thought, “I’m going to make the hero the villain and the villain the hero” which in turn resulted in this mess. Truthfully, gore, gore, gore – a ton of pointless gore was the only point of this, yet the creator couldn’t be bothered to develop his characters in any manner, not to mention the storyline was rushed.Actually, I wonder if the reason the narrative spends so much time “telling” the myth is because it’s not the actual myth.- According to The Dark Myth, Susanoo ended up renamed “The God of Darkness”, yet this never happened in the original myth; in fact, he reconciled with his sister Amaterasu.- According to The Dark Myth, he threw a tantrum because he was thrown out of heaven, when in reality he was thrown out of heaven because of his tantrum.- According to The Dark Myth, the tantrum came before he threw his tantrum, when in reality it came after he threw his tantrum – and not for the reason the Anime says. It was because his sister, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess went into hiding.- He didn’t end up fighting the eight-headed dragon because a bunch of monsters appeared, but because when he was banished to Earth he found someone in need and rescued them.- According to The Dark Myth, killing the dragon was a bad thing, but in the actual myth it was a good thing.In fact, one of the things which majorly bothered me about The Dark Myth was the fact I couldn’t recognize the mythology the story was based on until after I decided to take the chance to look it up. It wasn’t at all because it was some obscure Japanese myth which is relatively unknown, but because said myth doesn’t exist and is instead a butchering of Japanese mythology – a very disappointing one at that.";Not Recommended
3;Ankoku Shinwa;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"The “Ankoku Shinwa” OVA has less than a two hour runtime, but it feels much longer than that. This anime is chock full of Buddhist, Shinto and Hindu esotericism as well as Japanese mythology and folklore, and it tries to connect all of these together into one coherent story, but will likely leave the viewer more confused than anything else.The story centers on a teenage boy named Takeshi and his destiny to become some sort of supernatural being. It’s not determined what kind of being he is to become — good or evil — and there are various factions pulling him to one side or the other. It ends on an inconclusive note, making the viewer wonder what all of this is supposed to mean.Much of the plot is repetitive. We often see Takeshi getting into strangers’ cars without a second thought, getting pulled into an inter-dimensional space and winding up lying somewhere unconscious, and opening doors to secret passageways in ancient monuments. We also see him get snake-shaped marks on his body (he’s supposed to “awaken” to his powers when he gets a total of 8), and receive the three Imperial Regalia thought the course of the story. All characters, including Takeshi, serve as either plot devices or exposition mouthpieces; calling them one-dimensional would be an insult to one-dimensional characters.And speaking of exposition mouthpieces, the flow of the story is interrupted frequently so that someone (usually the old man) can explain some sort of legend or religious factoid. The information just gets dumped on you without warning, and it’s hard to take it all in at once.The animation is not too bad, although it’s a little stiff. The art is rather bland. There are interesting artistic/directorial choices taken during some parts, like when Takeshi is in a trance, everything around him is white or just barely traced in, and the inter-dimensional space truly looks out of this world.Most of the voice actors in “Ankoku Shinwa” are well known, but their performances are sorely lacking here, probably due to the repetitive, obtuse and verbose dialogue. The soundtrack is completely instrumental and it doesn’t leave much of an impression.Regarding objectionable content, there’s a short scene with nudity in the first episode, and both episodes feature graphic deaths (characters getting dismembered by demons). However, most of the deaths themselves are not shown on screen, just the gruesome aftermath.Overall, perhaps someone well versed in Japanese folklore and mythology, as well as Eastern religions in general, might be able to take away something from this, but I think this will just feel pointless to the average viewer. It tries too hard to connect a variety of religious concepts and legends together, and doesn’t really get anywhere. For the most part, the technical aspects are subpar, and the OVA feels like it drags on for an eternity. I wouldn’t recommend this for a general audience.";Not Recommended
0;Gakuen Tokusou Hikaruon;zombihead1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zombihead1;10;What a gem this is to stumble upon! As a fan of the metal hero genre of tokusatsu, I was delighted to run into this anime, which captures the spirit of it very well indeed.The story isn't anything terribly complicated. The jist of it is, boy transfers to school, angers the local rowdies, saves girl from rowdies, evil monsters from another dimension attack, transfer student transform into super powered hero of justice, kicks ass, saves day, rides off into the sunset like the badass he is. Cool. Like I said. Nothing complicated but for what seems to be an animated tribute to the Uchuu Keiji series, no problem there at al.The art is a bit dated by todays standards. But then this is fairly old. Whatever I dig it. The transformed hero, Gakuen Tokusou Hikaruon reminds me alot of Jikuu Senshi Spielban and also some Uchuu Keiji Sharivan thrown in for good measure. No idea what I'm taling about? Wikipedia or Henshin Justice Unlimited is your friend.I really liked the characters. Their pretty basic, and not alot of character development is done, since this was only one episode.For enjoyment purposes, I think it great. A bit fanservicey at times, but thats not really much of problem. If one can throw away their seriousness and let loose that part of them that longs to be a true hero of justice then you can join be for a ride!Thats my two cents and I sticking with it.;Recommended
0;Gakuen Tokusou Hikaruon;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;3;"This is a short one-episode Tokusatsu with one of those corny superheroes made of metal and with the glowing buttons no one presses. There's no backstory or character development at all (probably a good thing, actually) and very little characterization for our cardboard cutouts; the villain's motivations are also unclear. Granted, plotting and character nonsense is not usually the main factor drawing people to series like this, but it does help to have some kind of hook to keep the viewer interested—the appeal is the shortness and fast-pace, fun imagery, and a few bits of interesting animation. There is a mishmash of effective elements, but not one thing that is done enough or consistently well to make this anything more than a forgettable time waster.The storyboarding is often pretty good, with the chosen shots being quite dramatic (love the bit with the car trying to run over the protagonists). This was a period of animation where they weren't afraid to incorporate background animation somewhat regularly, and there is a bit of that. Hideki Tamura's running sequence is nice, though short. Both Shinya Ohira and Yoshinori Kanada animate parts of the final fight scene. Not really among the best work of either, though some of the effects animation predict stronger efforts of Ohira's, such as his scenes in Angel Cop or Akira. Kanada's scenes are probably the most stylish—especially those great silhouette light shows, and he was always a shining light in the darkness for so many of these old TV series.The biggest standout, other than exposure to obscure work from a few industry veterans, is probably a much darker atmosphere than is usual for a show of this nature. It starts with a suicide, depicted in a creative fashion, and they even use unshaded and colorless bystanders to good effect. The multiple dimensions also lend this a bit of a surreal touch, with the chessboard setting being the most notable. Most of the scenes outside of the short school segments are nocturnal urban scenes that are well-rendered and moody.";Not Recommended

Some minor flaws such as the wig.Sound- the tempo of the music is the same bloody one as the season one specials. I will admit during the first two episodes of season one specials it was okay but to here it season 2 specials as well is annoying.Enjoyment: These specials would best enjoyed if you read the manga. If you had not you wouldn't get much out of watching these.;Mixed Feelings
0;Bonobono (TV 2016);djsunshine;https://myanimelist.net/profile/djsunshine;8;"Ratings:Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 9Characters: 8Bonobono is an anime short that is focused on the lives of a few animals. Each episode is about five and a half minutes long, and the cast of characters is fairly small. Bonobono originally aired in the 90s, and this is the 2016 take on the show. To be clear, I have not seen the original so this review is just based on the 2016 version.While some episodes do continue on into the next one or reference each other, the story is for the most part not exactly fluid. Each episode is extremely mellow, and shows us Bonobono (the blue sea otter guy in the picture) living a peaceful life with his animal friends and father. There's a chipmunk, a racoon, and more. Even though Bonobono's life is peaceful, him and his friends seem to wonder about strange things and often find themselves looking for answers to the many questions of life.The sound for this show is something that I imagine is not for everyone. Bonobono's voice actor and the rest of the cast fit perfectly in my opinion, but I could see some people being turned off by Bonobono and his father's voices in particular. They almost seem kind of... slow... The background music is again, very mellow, but perfectly fitting in my opinion. The ED is great as well, it always gets stuck in my head.Each character in Bonobono is unique and clueless in their own way. They rely on each other to try and answer their many curiosities. The show is comical in this way, as sometimes the ""conclusions"" they come to based off of their friends' information are quite ridiculous. It is definitely dry humor, and will probably make you shake your head a few times.I like the art for this show because it is simple and represents the show perfectly. Everything about this show is simple, but rightfully so.The episodes are a perfect time length, and I really enjoy this show every week. I don't foresee this changing, and if you have seen the show you would know why. You kind of know what to expect each week with this show. Not in terms of story, but what kind of show you are going to get. It has not changed in 22 episodes and is successfully heartwarming each time I watch it. Give this show a shot, as I am not sure why it has such a low rating on here. It's only 5.5 minutes and definitely worth it.";Recommended
1;Bonobono (TV 2016);Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;7;"It's been a decent year for anthropomorphic animals in TV animé. 2016 saw the CGI enhanced return of Chi's Sweet Adventure; the unique side scrolling comedy Sengoku Wildlife Caricatures; & the charmingly oddball CG-live action hybrid Nyanbo – probably as close as we'll get to a Yostuba&! adaptation. Quietly running throughout 2016 & still ongoing, though, was the return of an even older series, Mikio Igarashi's BonoBono.Consisting of fifty, five minute vignettes, the first season follows the relaxing, amusing & often meandering days of the titular blue otter. Laid back, absent minded & always holding a clamshell, it doesn't take much for Bono to find pleasures in the simple things or have his mind fired, or distracted by, the most mundane or unusual occurrences. Imagine if Osaka from Azumanga Daioh got lost in the forest.Rarely able to answer his own questions, Bono's woodland wanders are often accompanied by the brash yet earnest Raccoon (not a Tanuki!) & the adorably cynical Chipmunk. Though often of little help, they make for entertaining company, the trio having echoes of Pooh, Piglet & Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. A strong recurring support cast further add to the series – my favourites being Bono's lackadaisical father & Chipmonk's sisters.Accompanying the entertaining characters is a commendable production from director Hidenori Yamaguchi & studio Eiken. The series maintains a consistently mellow pacing, resisting the possible temptation to heighten the emotion of scenes or overindulge in giffable character reactions. The only thing that might seem odd at first is the characters tendency to switch between using conventional mouth flaps & something that looks more like the trumpet mouths in Pingu. A bright yet soft colour palette more akin to children's illustration than typical TV anime further adds to the relaxed mood, as does the music. It's hard to resist the urge to hum or whistle along to Moonbright's theme song.It's not all smooth sailing, though. As fun as the main trio can be, their shtick can get old. Raccoon often fills the role of tsukkomi, which means lots of hitting & shouting at other characters. An otherwise fun character, it's unfortunate that arguably he's at his weakest when purposely trying to be funny. Chipmunk, while their cynicism & occasional sinister turns are adorable, also has “are you going to bully me?” for a catchphrase, repeated ad nauseum in some episodes. There is also a lot of toilet humour, which is fine but there is only so many times you can laugh at poo.Then again, Bono Bono isn't a series that's really meant to be binged, which is when the more repetitive elements of its humour become obvious. While not quite as episodic as it appears, with many vignettes being paired by theme or characters if not direct continuations, none the less it's arguably best enjoyed a few episodes at a time. Its laid back atmosphere & quietly comic musing on the big issues (to a small animal) make for a great visual palette cleanser to relax & clear the mind - or maybe even get you thinking yourself.Made for children but enjoyable by all, Bono Bono is the kind of laid back, family friendly TV that one sometimes wishes there was more of. Pleasantly relaxing & often amusing, if you're looking for an anthropomorphic alternative to the usual anime fare, you'll find it here.";Recommended
0;Bonobono (TV 2016);Ganji-MEX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ganji-MEX;6;"Alright, I didn't want my first review to be something relatively complex, so I decided to choose this thing that I watched back when it first aired.Bonobono is well... A manga for salarymans. For those who don't know theses terms, Salarymans in Japan are hard workers who don't have a lot of time to spare. Adapted from a 4-Koma series, Bonobono isn't a complex thriller or anything that'll make you question humanity, but hey, atleast it's a relaxing ride.Our main character here is Bonobono, a blue otter who isn't a smart guy in any terms. Along with his friends, Araiguma the Raccon, known for being lazy and a tsukkomi, and Shimarisu the Chipmunk, a chipmunk with an absurd amount of sisters, live their daily lives and the woods. Nothing outta this world.Episodes last for 5 minutes, they're mini SOL stories, and most of theses don't have a story line, but I think what makes theses worth it is the silly interactions with all the characters. They're not complex, but the main trio actually feels like a bunch of children just doing dumb stuff, which on a SOL series is actually a nice breath of fresh air from the usual ""anime girls doing cute stuff"".The series doesn't have a complex humor, as I'm pretty sure the jokes are child-friendly. Talking about child-friendly, there's a lot of poop jokes over here, and all of theses fall flat, like a turd in a toilet. Humor provided by Araiguma's is either screaming or kicking, Bonobono is a airhead, and Shimarisu just says ""Are you gonna bully me"" a lot. I mean, A LOT. A few jokes are wholesome, others make you smile, and all the poop humor is... poop humor.OST is relaxing, as all of theses soundtracks give serious Math Rock vibes. The series doesn't have a OP, ED isn't really memorable, and the animation on ED feels like a children's story book.There isn't much to say about this series. Bonobono is a cult-hit in Japan, but western viewers aren't much familiar to this series. The series isn't made for average anime-fans, as this is something that Nick Jr. or Discovery Kids could easily air. I'd say give it a watch if you're stressed, or just want a relaxing SOL series with no anime girls, no ecchi, no romance, just Bonobono.Final rating: 6.5/10";Mixed Feelings
0;Azuki-chan;Diogo_Gomes_1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Diogo_Gomes_1995;8;"Before i start my review, i want to make clarification that i've watched the entire show in japanese dub with barely any english subs. Now even though watching the anime in that way was a challenge at first, i did find the stories of each episodes of this anime to be so simple that i can almost understand what the show's all about.So keep in mind that i won't go into too much details about the show. I'm just gonna give my normal review of this anime to explain what i loved about this anime and about a few that i didn't.Anyway, with all that said, what is this show's about?Azuki-chan is an anime series based off the manga of the same name by Yasushi Akimoto. Who believe it or not, he has been involved in the Idol industry since he's known for creating a group of idols such as AKB48 and 22/7 (Which also got it's own anime and it also so happens to be one of my favourite anime shows ever).The show was animated by MADHOUSE. The same studio that brought us Cardcaptor Sakura, Death Note, Kaiji, Hunter X Hunter and of course One Punch Man.Again, not much is known about this show other than thoses facts that i mentioned. In fact, not many people seem to talk about this show nor even had made a fansub to this anime other than Episode 1 and the movie that it was based off.So why is this one's forgotten as well? I guess that's where i have to enter in action to see it for myself.First off, the story is very simple:It tells a story about a girl named Azusa Noyama. Who was always nicknamed by her friends as ""Azuki-chan"" mostly because of one of the kids named Ken, who was the one who gave her her nickname and teased her about it.At first, Azusa used to hate that nickname because she always gets made fun off because of it and not a single person seem like the name.But things has changed when a new student named Yunosuke Ogasawara, met her for the first time and heard of her nickname. But unlike Ken, Yunosuke liked her name since he finds it to be a nice nickname for a girl like Azusa.From there, Azusa became surprised with the response to the point that she starts to have a crush on him, Even to the point of falling in love with him.As the show progresses, both Azusa and Yunosuke would begin to talk each others more often and start to like each other. From having a conversation to have some fun to visit some certain places they like to go. From there, Azusa starts to have feelings to him. Though, she gets a bit jealous when he's talking to other girls. Especially Yoko, who also happens to have a crush on Yunosuke.Outside of the romance, each episodes tells a story about certain things that kids would usually do and sometimes some crazy ones as well. Especially if we have Makoto involved.Now, even though i'm no good at japanese, the stories are much simpler, fun and a bit easier to follow, thankfully. So i have no issues with the stories. Although some episodes can get a bit silly and sometimes even weird, like there's one episode where Makoto had to be taking care of a old chimpanzee at the Zoo. Pretty Awkward for a kids show, don't you think?The characters are, for the most part, pretty good. You have of course the main character Azusa, who basically does have a few days where she had a hardtime having some of the stuff that she doesn't like, but there are other days where things go pretty well for her. She's usually bothered with how Ken would make fun of her and eventually tease her and, like i said, gets jealous when Yunosuke is talking with Yoko.Yunosuke is also great here. He serves as a pretty good love interest. He's kindhearted and does treat everyone with respect. Especially Azusa. He would every so often go out with her, talk to her, have fun with her and help her out whenever she needs it. Showing a heart of gold.There are also other characters who do serve a purpose to each stories. You have Azusa's friends, Kaoru and Midori (Also known as ""Jidama""). Kaoru is usually a shy girl who has a crush on Ken, while Midori/Jidama is a tomboy who shows no interest in boys since she doesn't give a crap about love.There's also Yoko, who is Azusa's rival who has a crush on Yunosuke and would eventually try to take him away from her whenever she can. But she's never able to do it.And finally, Tomo, who although doesn't show that much through out the show, she does appears occasionally when it has to do with Makoto and talking with Azusa and her friends.As for the boys, outside of Yunosuke, you have Daizu, who's Azusa's little brother who enjoys annoying her big sister and sometimes would complain when doesn't get what he wants.There's also Makoto, who is an absolute dork and the one that makes me laugh. He's one silly guy who always puts himself into trouble and his friends would have to try to help him out before things gets out of hands.And finally, you have probably the worst character in the show named Ken, who's not only an complete jerk to Azusa who enjoys making fun of her name and pull her skirt and make fun of her panties (Typical bullying stuff), but he's also quite an asshole to the people. Sometimes when someone tries to have an conversation with him, especially Kaoru who has a crush on him, he wants them to shut up and let him do his own thing. Not to mention the way he talks to others. Once again, asshole.There are also other characters that appear in the show, like the parents, the teachers and other people that Azusa and her friends meet. Though not much to say about them, other than some other adults that are not the kids' parents that gets some episodes about them.So far, other than Ken and some other bullies, the characters are fun to watch. They all serve a purpose to make you smile even when you have a bad day.As for the animation and character designs, they all look very simple, but cute to look at. You have many characters who have only have dot eyes while others have their eyes closed and some foreign characters have their dot eyes colored.Same thing with the background animations. They all look good and they fit the mood of certain characters and situations.As for the sound, the Music is pretty good to listen to. It's very relaxing, can be sometimes joyful, others can be funny and sometimes a bit sad whenever it needs to. Again, fitting the mood of certain moments in the anime's episodes.The voice acting is pretty good as well, many seiyuus have done a pretty good job voicing each characters and giving more life to them. You have Yukana voicing Azusa, who's known for voicing Cure White/Honoka from Futari Wa! Precure and Meiling from Cardcaptor Sakura, Then you have Rei Sakuma voicing Yoko, who's known for voicing My Melody from Onegai My Melody and Shampoo from Ranma 1/2, you have Taeko Kawata voicing Kaoru, who's also known for voicing Amy Rose in the Sonic The Hedgehog video games, you have Mitsuaki voicing Ken, who also voices Close from Go! Princess Precure and Part 8 Josuke Higashikata from JoJolion in the JoJo's Bizzare Adventure video games and you even have Rica Matsumoto voicing Jidama, who not only she's known for voicing Ash Ketchum/Satoshi from the Pokémon series, but she's also known for being the singer for most Pokémon songs and being one of the founding members of JAM Project. Yes. That Rica Matsumoto!Sorry for the mouthfull, but i couldn't resist how great the performances were during my watchthrough of this anime.Aaaanyway, what do i have to say about this anime, overall? Well... It's pretty good! I loved the stories about each of the characters, minus Ken, again, the music is great, the characters are mostly great and the animation is very cute and charming to look at.I can say that i had a good time watching this anime without worrying too much about having a bad day.Sadly, like i said before, there's only one episode and a movie translated into english. The show itself has yet to be translated into english anytime soon. So the only real way to watch this show is if you understand Japanese and watch the show with no english subs. But even then, the language used in this anime is very simple and easy to understand, minus some of the quirky words used in the anime. So maybe you'll be able to watch it with little to no problems, whatsoever.But if you do manage to find all the RAW episodes of this anime, i recommend you guys to watch it if you're into romance anime or kids anime in general. Though beware of the scene where Yunosuke gets punched in the stomach by the bullies. While it's not that violence, it can be a bit shocking to look at. And of course that dumbass Ken being a jerk to Azusa, as well.But even then, for the most part, you'll definitely enjoy the anime regardless of theses scenes. it's cute, colorful and gives out that Peanuts cartoons vibe to it. It's definitely a hidden gem that i will not forget.Anyway, there you have it. My review on Azuki-chan. My name's José Diogo and i'll see you guys next time.";Recommended

And who doesn't love a good mix of 3D and stop motion? It's like watching two completely different styles of animation fight to the death for your attention.All in all, ""Akatsuki no Chinkonka"" is a trip, to say the least.

I doth confess that my previous review hath been taken down for my sinful spamming of the string ""AOE IS REAL"". 'Twas a grave transgression and I doth hang my head in shame. But lo, I have seen the error of my ways and now come before thee, a changed man for the better. I hereby pledge to write a new, legible review with sincerity and honesty. May the lords of the internet have mercy on my soul and verily, without more ado...Hark ye, good people, for I have tidings to share that will cause a great tumult in thy hearts. Yea, verily, it is said that the anime ""Attack on Titan"" hath a most strange and wondrous ending, known as the Anime Original Ending, or AOE for short.Forsooth, the AOE is said to be a thing of great marvel, a denouement unlike any seen before in the annals of anime. It is said that this ending shall be a thing apart from the manga, a creation all its own, unique and singular in its artistry.And yet, some of ye may be asking, ""How can this be? Is not the anime an adaptation of the manga? Doth not the story come from the pen of Hajime Isayama?""Indeed, good people, thou art wise to ask such things. For it is true that the anime ""Attack on Titan"" is indeed based on the manga of the same name, which was penned by the aforementioned Isayama. And yet, even as the anime doth follow the story of the manga, it doth also take its own path, carving a new road through the world of the Titans.And thus, it is said that the AOE is not a mere whim, a sudden fancy of the anime's creators. Nay, it is a thing that hath been planned for some time, a seed that hath been planted in the soil of the story since the very beginning.Forsooth, Isayama himself hath spoken of this matter, saying that he doth approve of the AOE and that it is indeed a part of his grand design for the story. He hath said that the anime shall take its own path, and that this path shall lead to a conclusion that is both unexpected and satisfying.And so it is that we, the fans of ""Attack on Titan"", must prepare ourselves for a great event, a happening that shall shake the very foundations of the anime world. We must ready our hearts and minds for the AOE, for it shall be a thing of great wonder, a tale that shall be told and retold for ages to come.In conclusion, good people, let us not fear the Anime Original Ending, for it is a thing that hath been planned and prepared for with great care and attention. Let us embrace it, and let us celebrate the creativity and artistry that hath brought us this far. For the AOE is a testament to the power of the human imagination, a reminder that there are still new stories to be told and new worlds to be explored.So let us raise our voices and cry out with joy, for the AOE is coming, and it shall be a thing of great wonder and beauty. Let us rejoice in the power of storytelling, and let us give thanks to Hajime Isayama and the creators of the anime ""Attack on Titan"" for bringing us this gift. And let us remember always that the human spirit is a thing of great resilience and strength, capable of creating wonders beyond our wildest imaginings.";Recommended

0;gdMen;Gundroog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gundroog;6;GudaGuda is one of the weirdest series of anime I had the pleasure to watch. They’re always weird, wacky and cheap but most of all they’re genuine and laid back. Hell, how often do you watch comedy anime that have actual adlib segments or embrace their low production values and use it for laughs? Those two are some of the staples for this franchise and unfortunately it’s not for everybody.With that said GDMen is perhaps one of the weaker shows in the series. It still has all the staples but the focus of jokes and tone shifted a bit from casual discussions with absurd non-squirts to a slightly more focused story about characters that embody anime archetypes going on a mission to save the princess. Naturally it’s choke full of parodies of shonen, from a paranoid princess that sees kidnapping as little more than a dating opportunity to a fired up youthful protagonist whose hopes for a hot blooded adventured get curbed with every opportunity.It sounds good on paper and I personally did get quite a few good laughs but like with all comedy your mileage might vary. There’s no denying that rapid fire of references to other shows in GDMen can get quite stale and self-awareness doesn’t always lead to the most witty humour but luckily it doesn’t dwell on any one segment for too long. Thanks to good pacing each 12 minutes episode felt like it was over in a flash and sometimes just left me wanting more.With how harmless and quirky this show is I think it would be worth your time to give it a quick little try. Though you’re probably better off checking out GdGdFairies.;Mixed Feelings
0;gdMen;Mehless;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mehless;4;A spin-off that unfortunately pales in comparison to the original.After finishing watching gdgd Fairies I was delighted to hear shortly after that a spin-off with male characters would come out. With each episode that then came out my excitement dipped as the things I hoped to see come out of this series did not transpire. This review will compare both series.Both are intended as pure comedy series. Story does not matter, though I welcomed the attempt at having a running theme, though I wish it was more appropriately used instead of being forced most of the time. A lot of the jokes I felt failed to land, nor did they have a good set-up. The scripted segments felt bland and the improv sections even flatter. I was willing to cut some slack for the VAs since I assumed their ad-lib would improve over time, but it did not.The series lacks the crazy, bizarre atmosphere of the original. The characters in gdMen felt boring and unrelatable. Some of the jokes relied WAY too much on throwing in random references just for the sake of it. When the original series used references it was often part of a much larger, grander joke, or is simply thrown in right before the OP.I really wanted to like this series, but it failed. Please consider watching the original instead.;Not Recommended
0;Shin Tennis no Ouji-sama: Hyoutei vs. Rikkai - Game of Future;Sakoori;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sakoori;9;I’m still in awe after watching this two-part ONA. I absolutely loved it and it really revived the passion I had for this series. Thank you to Funimation for getting the relicensing rights to the ENTIRE series. Without it, I would have been stuck trying to suffer through VPN-ing into Japan to try and watch it on U-NEXT. I’ll try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible and be as objective as I can.The story is essentially written in a way to close out the entire TeniPuri and ShinTeni series. I’m glad that Komomi was the one writing/supervising the script’s direction. Objectively speaking, the premise is pretty mid and it’s just your typical “this is the last time I get to play with my senpais” story that you see in every sports anime based in a middle/high school setting. In terms of the story relative to the rest of the TeniPuri/ShinTeni series, it was surprisingly better than I expected. If you knew the backstories to the Hyoutei and Rikkai players, this ONA would be a very exciting watch. If you’ve only recently gotten into the series and haven’t taken in much of the material, asides from the manga and the non-filler anime, this will be a confusing watch. The story itself is set after the events of ShinTeni, so I’m excited to see what direction the rest of the ShinTeni manga will take after the release of this ONA (at the time of airing, ShinTeni is still being serialized in Jump SQ).The visual metaphors for the new techniques were absolutely ridiculous. I knew a lot of it was just Konomi taking the piss out of everything and it was just trying to 1-up the other dumb supernatural techniques that were previously animated. I have to say, the visual metaphors were very well done and I was surprised that it looked this good. The rest of the animation is your standard Production I.G. anime. The CG usage wasn’t offensive. If you’re not looking hard, you wouldn’t even notice it, but there were some times where it bothered me slightly. It was pretty fanservice-y at times, which is fine if you’re into that. It’s pretty unfair of me to compare this ONA to its predecessors, since animation technology has developed a lot since the last OVA released (vs. Genius 10). That being said, if you’ve seen Kuroko’s Basketball and Haikyuu, it’s pretty comparable in terms of the animation. It’s very good for sports anime standards and it’s S-tier for TeniPuri standards.I love the new original character songs that were used for the OPs and EDs. The voice acting in it was probably the best I’ve seen out of all the anime in this franchise. I’ve watched a lot of the livestreams on the TeniPuri Anime channel on YouTube with the VAs discussing the ONA and they all seemed super excited about being able to work on something related to the series again. Suwabe and Nagai were especially good at Atobe and Yukimura, but I have to give my kudos to Morikubo and Iwasaki for their Kirihara and Hiyoshi performances.Overall, this is a great watch if you’re a fan of the TeniPuri series. If you want to get into this series, this might not be the best place to start, but it will give you a glimpse into how ridiculous one of the OG sports manga/anime actually is. Getting into this series will be a lot easier now, thanks to Funimation (and they’re going to redub everything too, which is going to be super interesting to see and I can’t wait to see who they’re going to cast). Hyoutei vs. Rikkai is a 9/10 in my heart.;Recommended

The art and characters was... meh fine. The reason i liked this one is because it kinda shows us how our reality would look if everyone were attempting to be perfect. This short movie is something i can relate to. What i also liked is how dark and disturbing it looks because of the characters and overall. This deserves a 7 and i would recommend it to those who like this kind of stuff and to those who probably don't like anime so much and all.;Recommended
1;Children;Mr_Panda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mr_Panda;7;"What Children lacks in classy anime polish it makes up for in its artistic rebellion against the fable of Japanese social hegemony. You might see parallels with Zealous Creative's ""Zero"" in simplicity or perhaps to THX 1138 by the detached numbering system for individuals in the story. This isn't an unusual device employed for dystopian or pseudo-dystopian narratives and it serves its purpose here. Adults mask their features with a smile. Students go through motions that please the adults: high marks and activities/sports participation. Our central child looks at the dead and dying world about him and can't take it. Turns out, neither can his compatriots. Once it becomes too much it turns into rebellion and delinquency. But also a previously untapped kindness for the the little things.";Recommended

0;You Yao;banichan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/banichan;10;I don't really understand why this show is rated under a 7. It's one of the best shows I've seen lately, but I guess maybe the humor doesn't work for everyone. Admittedly, this show is much funnier if you understand Chinese and also Chinese pop culture/slang.Story - so...the initial part of the show is mostly humor-focused, but it does build up toward an actual story. I feel like it actually sets you up in the first half for a lighthearted comedy, and then by about the halfway point you suddenly realize there's actually a storyline and you're already super invested in these characters. But basically, the main story takes a while to actually take shape, so have some patience. It also does a really good job of storyboarding, something that is a struggle in other Chinese animations sometimes (like Legend of Exorcist), where each episode's structure clearly has a lot of thought put into the order and where it ends, and the season itself ends in a cliffhanger in a way that makes a lot of sense.Art - I really loved the character designs, the hilarious references and modern-ancient fusions. The art is quite good for being CG-based.Sound - the music is also quite good. The OP is very unique and well-suited to the comedic aspect of the show, and the ED is very good, albeit more on the emotional side.Character - oh man, everyone is great?? The concubine is surprisingly enjoyable, and I'm very here for Dr Tao's straightforwardness. I legitimately ended up wildly curious about the backstories of everyone and enjoying everyone you're supposed to enjoy.Enjoyment - I mean. You could skip this show. But then you would miss out on Lin Kai's Disneyesque musical scene. Or the scene equivalent of the Titanic song on recorder.Okay, I know I'm biased, but I LOVED this show and am very much looking forward to season 2. The comedy is on point, the characters are fascinating, and the story is surprisingly well-written. On top of that, it plays around with transmigration tropes in a fun and hilarious (but never mean-spirited) way.;Recommended

This donghua is seriously underrated!First, I almost dropped this donghua. The reason is that I dislike comedies and I got a little annoyed on episode 2.However, I am glad that I didn't drop it because this is a hidden gem. Under the comedy, there is a serious story that is both intriguing and thought-provoking. I laughed, got annoyed, and even cried.Second, I liked the characters and the relationships. Although there isn't any romance, you can feel the undertones. Most of the time, I normally don't bother too much with side couples. However, my favourite ship in this donghua is a side couple. On the contrary, I don't really care about the main CP.All in all, this donghua is worth watching. I can't wait for season 2.;Recommended

1;Dyogrammaton;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;2;Dyogrammaton… I sadly do not have much to say about this title other than it is just bad. The characters have bad hair, most characters you feel you have seen somewhere before in a better quality story. It is also plagued by mixing in poor quality 3D shots along with average quality anime. The hentai portions of the series are sluggish and lack a lot of in-between animation, so it feels like a bunch of stills being run together instead of a smooth animation. I honestly felt cheated by the animators and think they must of used every trick in the book to lower the cost of the 2D animation so that they could fit in more 3D garbage.Ok, so the story… bad alien monster verses team of giant robots. There is an attempt at some psychological, hallucination plot twist, but it is mostly so that there is more H content in the hentai. This title is fully uncensored and offers an English Dub for those who prefer not to read. I have to say that the English dub does offer something that the Japanese version does not… extremely foul language.Overall, I found this to be a poor quality series, and I honestly cannot recommend it to anyone. There are far better hentai titles out there and there are far better mecha titles too… no need to waste time on a poorly created merger of the two.;Not Recommended

0;Hyakki;colderthanice;https://myanimelist.net/profile/colderthanice;10;Fantastic hentai with plot. You will end up watching the whole thing. In general, most people watch hentai to fap/look for fap scenes and then they're done. How many people actually continue because they want to see the story, and is what you're seeing more than just a stage show for sex? That is probably a good way to define if a hentai has plot. A hentai is definitely good hentai when you want/able to fap to it, but it is the sex scene that hooks you in. When I see a hentai with plot, I desire to hold any fap intentions in just to see the story play out. I go back and pick a part to fap after I finished watching. This hentai is exactly that hentai with plot. It got an excellent, interesting, and really developed plot. All the girls get to have sex through plot development not because its her turn to have sex. The characters are honest which I like, acting human with great backstories. Right off the bat, I'm going to say this hentai is a hidden gem. It has a lot of elements, ROMANCE, consensual, bondage, stun gun, rape, mild feeling of NTR, teens, oniichan, all incorporated very well. The main character Ryuichi is a much better guy than the average loser. Hiromi got a sexy body, and Wakaba is a cute imouto. The flashbacks Ryuichi gets really presents much buildup and suspense. Don't be intimidated by the synopsis that someone dies. It does happen, but it's not painful to watch and contributes to the suspense/peril of the current situation/story. The ending is really suspenseful, adds a lot of emotions, and is a good end/make sure to watch past credits of episode 3. To describe my experience with this hentai, thumbs up it's my favorite.;Recommended
0;Hyakki;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;1;"It's Valentines Day! According to tradition, this is the day I review a horrible hentai for young couples to watch together! Today's specimen is ""Hyakki: The Devil's Island"". This was written and directed by the sick motherfucker behind ""Master of Martial Hearts"", which is among the worst anime I've ever seen. This is going to be a rough ride!A group of stupid teenagers decide to take a ""mystery cruise"" that promises to drop them off on a random, unknown island for a day. I have no idea why anyone would do that, but that's the plot they went with. It turns out one of the guys was raised on this small island, but it was abandoned due to a coal fire and is haunted. Sweet Jesus, we're 5 minutes in and they ripped off Silent Hill for no reason! Since this is the Martial Hearts guy, most of the ""plot"" revolves around torture and rape. However, the English dub was absolutely hellbent on making this a dark comedy. It worked with ""A Time to Screw"" and ""Sextra Credit"" but this is a different script writer and it's not nearly as good. This translation was the same dude who did ""Milk Money"".Sound: This is a media blasters dub, so most of the original Berserk cast is in this along with some folks from Central Park media. Casca's voice actress gives no fucks, so she used her real name. Most people used ridiculous pseudonyms. I believe ""Pete Meat"" is the original voice of Guts, but this has sadly never been confirmed. I also heard who I thought might be Eric Stuart, Dan Green, and Veronica Taylor, but I'm not positive. Also there's a fat, bald rapist that sounds suspiciously like Meowth from Pokémon.Art: This was made by the fine folks at Studio ARMS, because of course it was. Sadly, this doesn't look nearly as well animated as Gauss because Rin Shin wasn't involved. The blood actually looks better than most ARMS anime because Yasuomi Umetsu also took a rain check on this garbage. This kind of makes me sad because I wanted that thick, ketchup blood from Kite, Elfen Lied and Mezzo Forte!Overall:The English dub makes this worth watching. It's not as good as Sextra Credit, but there're a few laughs to be had here. So if you have absolutely ZERO standards and are desperate for a good laugh, cuddle up with your Valentine's date and listen to dialogue like ""Your tongue is as soft a baby lamb's intestinal tract!""";Not Recommended
0;Kakyuusei 2: Anthology;Simonian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Simonian;5;The male lead, Oria Ryoma, is a lazy lecherous pervert without an objective in his life and the IQ of an insect. He does however have one redeeming quality - he's a strong kick-boxer and knows how to protect women. As such, all the girls around him constantly feel the urge to jump on his manhood and suffocate him with their breasts. Not the most romantic of stories is it? Not at all, but such is the case with most hentai.The female cast is not worth mentioning at all. At times I was under the impression that the male lead was having sex with inflatable dolls rather than something that resembles characters. Moreover, everything is made extremely convenient because the girls apparently have no conscience and are absolutely fine with Oria banging everything in sight as long as they get their turn.Moving on to the art, it was well drawn and the style comparable to most of the overwhelmingly average hentai series. Likewise voice acting was decent however the constant low-bass run-of-the-mill porn music can easily get on your nerves after a while. If anything, I wish they would stop putting the same annoying melody in, you know which one it is I'm talking about, if you've seen your share of hentai you would have heard it about a million times by now.Overall, the story was far fetched, unrealistic and cheesy. The sex scenes themselves were somewhat satisfactory. Taking all things into account this series is average at best. Watchable without smashing your head against the keyboard but not something I'd personally recommend. If you're looking only for well drawn hanky-panky scenes then yes, if you want a decent story to go with it then no.;Mixed Feelings
0;2x1;ThatRandomDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatRandomDude;10;"I must say that I am impressed by this film... it made my initial opinion of it falter; deep down after everything, the creators tried to bring down a lesson to people...About the struggles of those who suffer from hyper-sexuality. Specially those who are conscious about it and doesn't like it and try to fight against those instincts.The follow contains spoilers since i am going to discus the story of this film before my analysis and explain exactly the situation in it so read at own risk, or come back after watching the film or just skip forward to my review analysis and conclusion:This story is about a middle school girl(?) who suffers from hyper-sexuality in a 90s society when those illness were not well known and just was known as 'sex maniacs' or 'nympho'.She left school because she herself is conscious of it and did not want to involve anyone, or go through the shame of people knowing she is sick in the head so she gave the excuse of having a severe flu.Then the teacher send two boys that may know her to give her the school work.She confessed to them that her illness was ""I always think dirty thoughts"" and showed to them by actually requesting the boys to bang her as she let them know she can not control it willingly and hurts her every time she gets aroused by just anything.Blond guy is more assertive and open minded so, like any typical teenager with hormones, he jumped her bones, consequences be damned (hey, free sex from a willing girl, right? is a miracle she did not end pregnant).Glassed boy got scared at this, seen how both acquaintances easily just engage in intimacy as if it was just like eating a cake...But the girl did not leave him alone as she also requested him to join, and so he did.After this incident both boys and girl spend more time together and began to grow close, blond guy began to like her but she was clear from the beginning that their relationship was going to be just ""really close friends with benefits"", (What we know as sex friends). Is all physical but not emotional or feelings.This was confirmed after the girl saw how depressed the glasses boy was with his insecurities and she decided to cheer him up by using her body and built up his confidence.he semi confesses that he liked her but there was the blond buy as well and he could not compare to, thing that the girl semi-rejected him and told him that she sees both him and blond guy as just really close friends that engage in sex just to have a good time and be close, and that she would like to have sex with both of them more often in the near future, even 3-ways.Glasses boy consented and agreed with it, officially stamping the label of sex friends.Then, there is the blond guy's sister who has a brother complex and got heart broken when she discovered her brother and the girl doing sexual intercourse and decided to take action about it.She confronted nympho girl and while sister was arguing and accusing the girl for being a two timer, nympho girl grew guilty and depressed and tried to explain to sister that she has an illness, by sexually molesting the sister... (This also show that nympho girl perhaps has no sex preferences and may be a bisexual girl, as long as she gets to have sex, anyone would be fine, right?)After a slap on the face, and run away... nympho girl calls blond guy to apologize... and they all talk it out and he didn't blame her in the end.Also, i am pleased that deep down, the author showed that the blond guy is a good guy and a true man as when his sister confesses her love to him, he says that lovers her like a sister and set boundaries that should never be crossed, but made both siblings grow closer as siblings and sister gave up her brother complex.Also another thing that pleased me was that, bad rumors were going about in school that were harmful to nympho girl.But blond guy had the balls to step up and confront everyone and truly defend the girl out of good will and not to hide the fact that they all were sex friends.(This is confirmed by his speech to the classmates; the way he said it as he clears the rumors).In the end the nympho girl felt extremely guilty for dragging them into her problems and began to set herself some distance between herself and both boys to avoid rumors and ruining their reputation, but in the end they stayed as close friends.How ever, the end doesn't say if they continued as regular close friends or sex friends.I would like to confirm all this with the manga, since the manga is the canon story, how ever I haven't found anywhere translation into english of it. The manga is quiet old and since its hentai, maybe no one payed attention to it... but I see no clue if there is any translations.So i do not know how things really ended; did the four children ended in a 4-way relationship?Or did she end up dragging other boys and banging anyone else in school and her becoming a whore.I do not know what route the original author took, but for what i saw in this fill, the creators tried to indirectly show the struggle and suffering of someone who suffers from hyper sexuality.-Now for my analysis:Like I said; I am impressed by this film... it made my initial opinion of it falter; deep down after everything, the creators tried to bring down a lesson to people...About the struggles of those who suffer from hyper-sexuality. Specially those who are conscious about it and doesn't like it and try to fight against those instincts.There is a fine line that shows a difference between sex addicts and those with hyper sexuality... both cases are similar yet different.Most people with HS can not control it and let their desire for passion take over because they feel empty and look for something to fill it up.Sex addicts do so voluntary and just wants to bang who ever comes along without thinking on consequences to ""feel good"" and these types doesn't feel remorse on doing so. (These ones are the ones mostly known as nymphos).The nympho girl heroine... she clearly shows that she suffers from hyper sexuality since she actually feels remorse for her actions and guilt and wish to be normal but she can not control her self.Blond boy and glasses boy learned this and decided to help her; I am please that the author actually made them good guys instead of scumbags and actually defended her out of good will and not just to hide a pervert or their sex plays or that they were sex friends (also back in the 90s the term 'sex friend' was not known as').The author actually showed the real side of those who suffers from this instead of just going on the path of making a generic uncontrollable sex whore, gang bangs, ntr and the such other hentai flicks shows about. Author actually decided to show a deeper meaning so people see how card is life for these people... and worst, these are children... if they were real i would be sad for the future of this girl.This holds a grain of truth since it reflects real life people who suffers from this sickness (yes, it is a sickness, look it up).Usually these people needs professional help and therapy to overcome this, but sadly shrinks in Japan are low and people believes going to one is taboo because of shame. For not being view to the public as crazy.What saddens me is that they used children in this flick to portrait this aspect instead of using adults (these kids are at least middle school students no more)... but there is an unofficial rule that children should be the star of character development because they are growing up and getting molded by life...Now I am speaking now metaphorical so bare with me here; unfortunately there would be a chance the nympho girl would drag someone else or many others into sex plays and may end up a whore...Or worst case scenario, a scumbag alpha male will appear and trap her and make her his pet or sex slave.At least I can count that there may be justice for her as blond guy will try to save her from such situation and protect her... if she tells them about it that is.Knowing how Japanese women in their culture are... there is a 90% chance she would stay quiet about it and not tell them, as to not worry them, or involve them, or bring public shame on herself, since she would be scared and black mailed as she gets sexually abused day by day and gets mind broken by the passion and enslaved to pleasure...It is sad because nympho maniacs doesn't know what true love is since for them love = sex and they only love sex and will who with anyone who gives it best and make her ""feel good"".That is the route that most hentai involving this topic take now-days... some involve rape or netorare, other just shows queen whores.Again, i do not know if the original author left her be exclusive to only these two (blond guy and glasses boy) as sex friend just them three or showed her banging other people as well in school since there is no English translation of the manga so i do not know how the canon story went and/or ended.But for what the anime adaptation showed at the end of episode 2, she felt really guilty for dragging them (blond and glasses) into her problems and decided to put a bit of distance... so we don't know if they continued as sex friends or not but at least they ended as close friends.hmmm, when she molested the sister... nympho girl surprised me. I guess this means that nympho girl is bisexual and has no boundaries or preferences on who to bang as long as she gets to have sex.I wonder if the sister ended up being dragged into their sex plays, but I will never know since, again, the manga is not translated.I feel proud and satisfied that the author made the blond guy be a true man and set boundaries after learning his sister's feelings and not just jumped her bones and consequences be damned like other flicks had done.And the sister was mature enough to accept and give up her brother complex, which was nice... (again, dont know how this went in the manga).believe it or not, Incest is deep frown upon in Japan and consider it a family dishonor, and since no one wants to bring dishonor to their family name because they avoid shame like the plague, there is so many incest hentai out there to ""relief"" such desires...but there are the cases when some actually crosses the line.My opinion about incest is another topic... but I'll i say that if is true love, then i do not mind, but mostly those topics it ends up with lust and sexual abuse... and just the thrill of the forbidden fruit. Just few show true love, if any, at all.Truth to be told, relationships and marriages between cousins in Japan is legal and accepted by society, unlike us westerners.So yeah, I have no idea if in the manga, all four ended in a 4-way relationship... which nympho girl would not had minded... and sister actually admitted that she might be similar to nympho girl... but on her side is more like a true pervert rather than an illness.I give this story points for realism as it tries to show the struggle in life from someone who suffers from hyper sexuality and how society judge them.Most of these people ends with severe mayor depression and just get addicted to sex just to forget those problems as if they were taking a drug... other just get enough and sickened of such like that commit suicide to escape their torment...And others actually managed to ask for help and seek therapy so they can live a normal life.It all depends on the subject's will.";Recommended

Only thing i miss was my classmates. That and the drama. In this anime a simple act of kindness of two classmates for another turns into much more.A some what complicated love triangle between two guys and a girl in other words.As for the ending it was not what i had wanted but it left on a kind note so there is that.Art- characters seemed slightly poorly drawn. In terms of a scale of 1 being terrible and 5 being average i would say 4.5.Another thing of note is that the artwork mostly in the beginning was choppy. A result of what i deem to be poorly time animation. But the rest was okay.Sound-voices in some moments were off timed-there was gap filled noises. By which i am referring to award time fill ins. Where there is no lips moving(no talking) but put in to add a more realistic flair. Sadly, that approached failed. Luckily, that mainly happened in the sex scenes. If it beings to irate you like for me you can always mute the sound.- also one of the main male characters voices for sure seemed to be monotone (voice unchanged) leading to a robotic feel. Great, if this anime was a science fiction but it is not. Although, since it is drawn artwork and not actual people one could say that fictitious but not science(bad joke i know).Enjoyment: best viewed if highschool/college drama is a passion of yours.;Mixed Feelings
0;2x1;Angel-With-Gunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angel-With-Gunz;4;SUMMARY2x1 explores the friendship and bonding between two boys and a girl in their class who is addicted to sex, it is hentai light and focuses more on the relationship between the three characters as well as the sister of one of the boys.STORYThe boys (Ieda - a popular sporty boy and Akiyama, a more reserved nerdy boy) go to visit a classmate, Yoshifuku, who has missed a number of classes due to sickness, upon arriving at her home they find her sickness is in fact an addiction to sex which quickly results in Ieda and the girl having sex.The two boys, especially Akiyama, become infatuated with the girl and sleep with her individually. This annoys Ieda's sister who goes to speak with Yoshifuku directly. Only for Yoshifuku to give in to her urges and attempt to have lesbian sex with Ieda's sister. We learn later that Ieda's sister herself also has her own physical desires, a wish to sleep with her own brother.The anime cumulates with the classmates of the three main antagonists bullying Yoshifuku for having two boyfriends. only for Ieda to defend the friendship as three friends simply helping one another. Later he also consoles his sister and says that a sibling relationship has boundaries that should not be crossed.CHARACTERSIf there is one thing I can praise this anime for, it is the characters. They are each well developed and react differently to their environment and do not fit into most of the cookie cutter characters usually expected of the genre.The two female characters are attractive enough but are held back by a rather flat art style and uninteresting appearance.VISUALS and EROTICSAs mentioned above, the visuals are nothing spectacular and lack some of the beauty that can be found in other anime from this era.The sex scenes felt very rushed in the first episode with a lot of cuts and not much build up, but in the second episode they worked a lot better and seemed to be far more comfortable with the pacing.HIGHLIGHT MOMENTThe sister sub-arc was interesting and ended on quite a happy and well written climax.CONCLUSIONThe anime felt a lot more like someone trying to create a metaphor about friendship and bond hood rather than a straight up hentai. The story elements may appeal to some people, but this fits far more into a 'plot with a side of hentai' rather than the reversed that many would be used to seeing.OVERALL43/100;Not Recommended

Still takes place in some weird sex-slave manor, where girls are forced to perform humiliating favors. It focuses on the individual girls from the original, and the whole 26 minutes is just the sadistic dude toying around the the girls. Still contains ton of rape and other gross shit.Compared the original, its a bit less bizarre. It was a relief too see that it wasn't as gruesome as the original. There's less of a variety of fetishes, which can be good or bad thing, depending who you are. Mostly just bondage, inflation, and scat. Still horrible though.It was nice to see the old characters alive I guess, its hard to find anything good about this episode if you're not a sadist.Overall, not a bad prequel to the original, it was just as disturbing.

The first is just the standard slice of life part in their high school. Then after that is usually some wack-ass segment where they're taught by their manager how to be proper idols. It usually ends with the last ""quiz"" part. It's hard to explain, but I assume this part was recorded completely improv. The VA's (not exactly the characters) are asked random questions by their manager, and the entire conversations were animated over after the fact. This structure can change around depending on the episode, but that's the basic gist of it. I realize now typing it out that it doesn't sound too exciting, but just trust me it's absolutely insane in the best way possible.This show was absolutely hilarious as a first time watch. I'd say it's best experienced with at least one or two other people watching along with you. Highly recommend the show, wish more people knew about it.";Recommended
0;Keifuku-san;Shioxus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shioxus;6;"Here comes a short review for a short ONA!Keifuku-san is about a girl and her manta ray creature in a strange seemingly abandoned (by humans) world. I think they are getting parts to piece together a world or something? There's not much to say about the story, as it is pretty vague.The animation is primarily CG and it's decent. Nothing impressive to behold, but you won't find yourself cringing at anything either. The color palette is pleasing to the eyes at least.My favorite part of it was the sound direction. It had simple, yet fitting, BGM, but the best part were the sound effect/voices. The manta ray flies around murmuring ""kosho~ kosho~"" in a pleasant whisper throughout. I know that hardly sounds praise worthy, but something about it is just so fundamentally pleasing to my ears.This was able to catch my attention enough that if it were made into a movie or longer series I would check it out.This is worth a watch if you have five minutes to spare and want to see something carefree and pleasant.";Mixed Feelings
0;Tokyo Requiem;HentaiReviewer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HentaiReviewer;3;"Be aware that is an H-Anime review, and so it will judged accordingly.STORY: 3/10There seems to be unrest in tokyo between the forces of evil, and good. Criminal masterminds have been working rigorously to bring under their control, the four micos (priestesses): Hinomico, Mizunomico, Kazenomico and Tsuchinomico in order to break a certain magical seal in order to release a God of sorts. Why they want to release this God is unclear, other than the fact that they want to ""kill a man"". Government special agents are dispatched in order to protect the micos. We first see Homura, a lonely prostitute who also happens to be a mico, servicing a client. It appears that the girls don't actually know that they are micos, as when Homura is being chased by an assassin, she has no clue why. (We all know that this is an H-Anime, so it goes without saying that having intercourse is the way to unlock the hidden mico powers, and having intercourse is a way to also protect them.) With one mico captured already, and the bad guys hot on Homuras tail, who knows what will happen next? (Well, you will if you decide to watch this. If you're confused so far don't worry, I was too, and still am.)ART: 3/10Early on it seemed that the art was okay, that is until the sex scenes, and the later half. They were pretty poor. The animation was bad and inconsistent. During a few scenes Homuras hands looked like a mix between reptile hands, and humans. Some scenes the entire lower half of her body was shaking, and the upper half of completely still. Sometimes it seems like it improves, then just goes downhill a minute later. Even still frames when they are just sitting there, their faces are drawn weird. The second episode was a joke in terms of the quality of the intercourse scenes involved. The sex scenes were so badly done, I almost got disgusted by it. Her vagina seemed as if it warping during a gangbang. I can honestly go on and on about this. So that explains my art score.SOUND: 4/10Brought nothing to the table. Talking voices were pretty okay, surprisingly. But during intercourse scenes, it sounds like they told the female actress to moan just one time, and they'll keep playing that particular moan over and over with no variation to it. Don't get me started on the ""music"", which I can't really even remember at this point.CHARACTER: 4/10Homura the mico/prostitute has an average school girl look. High stockings, short skirt, uniform. Red hair with weird bangs in the front, and big green eyes.Hiroto is the average looking special agent is assigned to protect Homura. He also has powers. If a girl is poisoned. All he has to do is have sex with her to remove the poison. He can also create magical force fields, and wield Katanas.The captured mico also looks like a basic schoolgirl, though we don't see much of her with her clothes on.There were other characters like the mob bosses, and other criminals, but I don't think they're interesting enough to even mention.ENJOYMENT: 2/10To be completely honest, I almost fell asleep a few times during this one. I just couldn't get into it. Very uninteresting.FAP METER: 2/10This is a hardcore title, and feature strong elements such as: Lesbian futa assassins, double penetration, tentacles, rape, and anal. I did not enjoy this, and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a good H-Anime.PROS:Uncensored.CONS:Everything else.";Not Recommended
0;Miboujin: Numeriau Nikuyoku to Midara ni Nureru Mitsusubo;Pelsia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pelsia;8;"The title and story background while accurate, are a bit misleading; or at least incomplete. When the second episode ends it has a too be continued at the end for which there weren't anymore episode made. To evaluate this based on plot seems unfair as its unfinished, as is though the final product is more like an all action kind of hentai with little bits of the plot here and there.Story:The story starts out through the lens of a video camera videotaping a couple in the act. Afterwords its revealed that the main female character is now a widow, her husband having just recently died. Her daughter is living with her, and she's got two tutors that come over on a daily basis to teach her. The main female (the widow) is fond of 'slipping a Mickey' into people's drinks which acts as a delayed story aphrodisiac that turns the person into an insatiable lust monster.Art:Characters are well drawn and the animation quality is very good. H scenes may bit a tad longer than normal but are full of action. One aspect that I find particularly bothersome, though others might find it heavenly is that all the females have extremely large breasts for their size. Even the daughter that is being tutored (presumably she's either in the first year of college, or last of high school) has at least DD's.This will likely be a large selling point for most men, though as a female it gets to be redundant and annoying. One, or two depending on the cast size, characters with large chests is to be expected; when they all have them and each is larger than the others is a big turn off for me.Sound:Voices are well done, they match well with the characters personalities (at least as far is revealed). Background music is non-existent or otherwise not worth noting.Characters:Each character has their own personal tastes which is nice for variety. With the storyline being cut off its hard to really say much about them beyond the stereotypical mold they start out with. The widow and one of the tutors (apparently a childhood friend of hers) are the only ones with much character development. The foundations are laid for some good roles but we never know what the final intentions of anyone is. When things finally start to happen the door gets slammed shut and we're all left hanging.Enjoyment:There's enough of a story to hold what's there together well enough, without any kind of conclusion it ends up being more of an all action type of hentai. Since the art and animation is well done it makes for something highly re-watchable when you're all you want is action.Overall:Widow isn't something that you watch for the plot; which is a shame since it has the potential to be really interesting if finished. By no means is it something dirty on the scale of something like Dark Chapel, the action scenes don't have a lot of foreplay and focus more on h-play making it very enjoyable when that's the kind of video you're looking for.";Recommended
0;Ore, Tsushima (ONA);Wallanimx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wallanimx;7;Ore is a very simple anime. Grandma owns many cats that go in and out as they please, and the cats make her life a bit more interesting. They have shelter and food if needed, and she gains that bit of oomph from them that makes life less bland.But there's more to it. Sure, it has its realism like in the episode with the cat VS the cicada and how Grandma absolutely hated it. But the cat considered it a fun toy. I've experienced that with my cats. Just got to throw the suckers back outside if you can get them before the cat does.Then there's the episode where we witness Grandma's deceased cat in her dreams and how much she misses them. How she wanted to take them back home just for them to keep walking away. I sobbed, no lie. But then her other cats came to comfort her and she was able to heal a bit more from it.This show isn't a masterpiece or a wonder of animation. Its just a love letter between cat owners and their cats. The ups, the downs, the cicadas, and the loafing on you just because.I really enjoyed watching several new episodes every week and now that its gone its left a fat cat sized hole in my heart. Sure, I'll fill it with a new cat anime...but this one was very sweet.If you like animals you may like this. If you don't, this is a decent portrayal of what having a cat entails. <3;Recommended
0;Ore, Tsushima (ONA);CataOrShane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CataOrShane;6;Ore, Tsushima (ONA) is a series of very short episodes about an old person named Ojii-chan living with a bunch of cats, each with their own personality. The main cat-rcter (pardon my pun) is Tsushima which is a street cat turned into a domestic cat and each episode shows us a day in the lives of Tsushima and how he bonds with Ojii-chan and the rest of her cats.The animation is very simple but also pretty to look at. The seiyuus are all living legends in the industry. Unless this is one of your very first animes you're watching, you'll recognize most of them at least.As far the episodes go, some are hilarious, other are touching. or insanely cute.

0;First Kiss Monogatari;Orbi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Orbi;6;This story was fairly average, the art and sound are nothing spectacular but are pretty decent for an ova created 8 years ago. While watching this ova, the first part kind of dragged on while the end just felt rushed. It could have been a lot better if there was more depth to the characters or if there had been a true conflict, but the little conflict that there was was just brushed off and never really allowed to develop. Granted, there are time constraints in an OVA, but I was still expecting...something.Bottom line: If you want to see some fluffy, feel-good story, this OVA is for you. If you're looking for something with more meaning, I'd steer clear of it.;Mixed Feelings
0;First Kiss Monogatari;alx222000;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alx222000;2;Before I begin, you can probably tell from the scores, but I have nothing good to say about this anime. Keep reading if you would like more detail on what I thought was bad about it.Very simple romance story. Couple love each other (5%), relationship strained by circumstances(90%), guess the end(5%). (Percentages are of estimated time used)Of course, even a simple story can be made entertaining in the right circumstances.......but that doesn't apply here.The art is a bit dated, but along with the sound, it mostly does it's job, except, I'm not sure if it was the character art, the voice-acting, or a combination of both, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion from either of the important characters. It felt more like I was watching a couple of bad actors.In this anime, only two characters are of any real importance, only one of those gets much developement, and no time at all is wasted on developing the unimportant ones. Unfortunately, the main character doesn't seem (to me anyway), very real. She regularly gets upset, (understandable) and then she starts giving strange responses (Stranger than you would expect) to whoever she's talking to. I'm starting to think all the stress is affecting her sanity.It doesn't help that there's regularly an odd delay between one person speaking and another person responding.Now, 30 minutes isn't a long time, but for me it wasn't nearly short enough. it took maybe 10 seconds of watching for me to start bracing myself for impact. I'm serious.Admittedly, a few of the things I've said might be overstated, but I'm not going back to check.So, in conclusion, this anime just doesn't have anything going for it. I can't recommend it to anyone. The only reason to watch this is if you like romance and you honestly can't find/be bothered to find another.And yes, I probably spent longer writing this review than watching the anime. I also enjoyed writing this review more than watching the anime.;Not Recommended
0;Doukyuusei (OVA): Natsu no Owari ni;Energetic-Nova;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Energetic-Nova;9;"First, I would like to say, I was out on the search for a more female audience oriented hentai that featured more consentual acts that didn't have things like x-ray, blood with their virgins, and stuff like that and I more than got that sort of thing.I also got a hentai which focused heavily on dare I say it, a captain save a hoe style character. He is always there when these women are sad and yeah, he does take advantage of that. But it doesn't feel like it is wrong. He always knows what to say, and what to do, and how to please them. And I really like that. There aren't many hentai like this. I really appreciated the lingering shots on his cum face. Not many hentai do that.I enjoyed the retro art and animation. I thought it was well done given how old it was. It was certainly better animated than even some later hentai I have seen. Like even some hentai animated ten years later for some reason don't look as good as this to me. Probably do to the highly appealing characters for me.I very much appreciated the standard breast sizes which were not fetish. I enjoyed the bounces that were ""normal"". I enjoyed things like no xray... no weird cum faces... no blowjob faces... people looked how they should actually look. Everything was very much normal. It was like just a normal story that happened to have sex in it. I appreciated it.I really want to give bonus points to this hentai because with each episode I wanted more and more to actually have sex. And I did have sex in episode three with my husband to the girl who was tied up. I did appreciate that the protag did not have sex with her like that and waited for her to calm herself before actually screwing her. It was about the nicest girlfriend stealing I ever saw in hentai. lol. He was... very polite. And someone I wanted to fuck to while watching. He was quite sexy for me.Someday I will have to out together a list of men in hentai I liked a lot. This guy is up there. Sexfriend guy is up there. Junjou Shojou ex Cetera guy is up there. anyway.Ribbon Chan girl- she was slightly disappointing. I love ribbon chan girls. I think I loved the fantasy of her more than the actual time with her. Maybe if there is one criticism, it is that I don't think he should have even been able to get with miss princess. lol. It just might have been a better thing. Honestly not sure where my real rating will stand but for now, I just had sex and it felt so good. lol. So I kinda want to score it really high. It did get me in the mood.

0;Doukyuusei (OVA): Natsu no Owari ni;brynolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brynolf;2;I thought this was going to be a comedy about a horny asshole of a main character, who dated too many girls at the same time, and eventually got into trouble for it. Well, it wasn't.To put it short: This was a really bad anime. But with boobs...AnimationConsidering it was made in 1994 it looks ok, but compared to newer stuff it is very inferior. The characters look rather dull. All the girls are portrayed as doll angels and the main character looks just like someone that usually walks past in the background of other animes.The sex scenes are better drawn than the rest, but they are too long due to pointlessability IMO.SoundDecent intro track, decent voice acting (Wataru sounds very much like Onizuka, BTW) and the background music consists of a single pianist that, however skilled, gets a bit boring after a while.StoryStory? No.CharacterWataru is a pretty decent guy, which I hoped he would not be. It just happens that he is present when girls are sad and heartbroken, and need to f!ck the pain away. All the ladies are intellectually and dramaturgically questionable and do not give a proper picture of the opposite sex to the 14 year old boys for whom this anime was clearly made.;Not Recommended
0;Parol no Miraijima;TimeFliesAway;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TimeFliesAway;9;So, first, the description of the anime is wrong. Paroru is not the one, who wants to see the fireworks. It’s rikotto. Paroru is actually literally afraid of anything and respects the rules of their island very much. Zazu is a collector, but he never thought about leaving the island. Rikotto on the other hand is very adventurous and as soon as she sees the photo with the fireworks, she immediately makes the decision to go and see them (because she loves all shiny things).Overall, I find the story really cute and a nice cartoon for kids.The species looks very nice and i actually would love to see more of them. The island as well looks pretty comfortable and the art is amazing.What I also love about this short film, is that it doesn’t really have a specific moral. You can interpret so many things into it and in the end, it’s still subjective. There are so many morals I thought about after watching it and I think each of it works pretty fine, although some of them are rather dark.Tho, I’d still recommend it to anyone, who’d like to smile after a stressful day. :)My score: 9/10;Recommended
0;Mori no Andou;xXTenderTacosXx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xXTenderTacosXx;9;After rating this 5 minute short at a 9 despite the overall score being so much lower, I couldn't help but leave a short review to defend it.Mr. Ando has been around a long time, I remember watching it 7 or 8 years ago on YouTube as a middle-schooler. I thought it was goofy for sure, but after coming back to it as an adult, I have a newfound appreciation for this spectacular short. I'd forgotten all about Mr. Ando until I saw that its director, Takashi Taniguchi, would be returning with a series of shorts for this Summer 2017 season, titled Piko-tarou no Lullaby Lullaby.Every character in this sketch is voiced by one gentleman, Takashi himseslf. He writes and animates all of his shorts and brings life to all of his characters himself, making his work incredibly unique to him and him alone. His delivery in Mr. Ando is beautiful, utilizing his crude recording equipment to create a comical comradery between the forest creatures (some of which include a bear, a penguin, and a trout.) The sparing sound effects are performed by Takashi as well, often in a very dull tone of voice to add to the droll atmosphere.The story is simple, of course. It's just enough to allow the forest creatures and their personalities to be presented and tested, without overstaying its 5 minutes. The main focus of this short is placed on the curious nature of Mr. Ando, the local forest penguin. I wish I could go into detail as to why this is such a clever absurdity, but I don't want to spoil such a short adventure. Hopefully you will come to realize the genius behind this story's subtleties yourself.The only fair criticism I can give to an ONA thats strong points lie in its crudeness, is the music (or rather, lack thereof). Ando of the Woods ends with a heartfelt ballad, written and performed by Takashi himself, but this is the only soundtrack held to an otherwise perfect short film. The silence assists in emphasizing the comedic awkwardness that comes from the sound direction consisting entirely of Takashi's mouth and hands, but I honestly feel that a few short and simple background tracks would aid in delivering the flow of the short.Please watch this. It's 5 minutes and it's uploaded on YouTube. You're not honestly going to complain that you wasted your time. I promise you'll at least get a few chuckles out of it, really.;Recommended
1;Mori no Andou;KimmoKuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KimmoKuu;10;Only 5 minutes were needed to tell this masterpiece.The story simply tells about a forest and it's residents.At the beginning of the story we meet a bee and a bear. They seem to have a discussion about honey, which leads to a fight. Then the star of the anime, Mr. Ando comes to the rescue. Mr. Ando is clearly the protector of the forest.He brings peace everywhere with his powerful message: ''STRIKE MR ANDO STRIKE''.For some reason the animals suspect that Mr. Ando might be a human. Which is impossible, because he is obviously a penguin. (This can be determined by the peng peng sound he makes)At the climax of the episode a human is trying to ''develop'', and this means destroying the animals home. Humans truly are greedy beings. But no worries Mr. Ando comes to the rescue and saves the day.The episode is coming to an end and the animals still couldn't find out if Mr. Ando was a human. But Mr. Ando will always be a penguin in their hearts. The episode fades out with a wonderful solo about Mr. Ando, sung by the fish.After watching it I immediately recommended it to about a dozen people, some hate me now, some think this was the funniest thing ever. To me it's just magnificent.You have nothing to lose by watching a 5 minute short, do it.;Recommended
2;Mori no Andou;alonewestand;https://myanimelist.net/profile/alonewestand;10;"You either get it or you don't, and it's quite clear from the score this has received the people reviewing it don't.Perhaps the subtleties are lost on those with no knowledge of Japanese.Perhaps people thought this was a true, studio produce animation feature. It's not. It was drawn, animated, and voiced by the same man, Takashi Taniguchi, who animates both as a hobby and professionally. He started his own anime production while still in university because he enjoyed it.People ranting about the art and animation is equivalent to ranting about the art and animation of the asdf movies, or the lazer collection, or ""look at my horse"" end of ze world, schfifty five. These works are tongue in cheek, satirical, and self-aware. To put it succinctly, ""lighten up.""I've given this 10 across the board. That does not mean it has Art as good as a Ghibli film, or sound design as good as a Jojo series. Things must be judged in the proper context, and in the context of a five minute youtube video created by a single person as a passion project, it is indeed worthy of the highest praise.The humor hits all the marks. Most are immediately thrown off guard by the human-like faces on the animals, and by the same person doing all of the voices. I think the divisiveness probably first really hits when the bee, describing the last time the bear asked him for honey, does an exaggerated, sexualized mockery of the bear. If you find a grown man's girlish moans of a human-faced bee saying ""lick lick"" in Japanese funny, you'll probably enjoy the rest.Most laudable is the voice acting, which constantly lampshades its low budget-ness as Taniguchi, instead of inserting sound effects, simply uses the Japanese onomatopoeia: instead of a building shaking he simply drolly states ""go go go go, go go go go"" (rumble rumble). And the carefully chosen gaffes ""ぺーおれペンギンだよ"" (Pe-- I'm a penguin!) that sound (and perhaps are) ad-libed add to the charm.Like all humor, not everyone will enjoy it, but for those that do like myself, it has secured a special place in my mind of the vault of classics that the internet has produced.";Recommended

Some people hate the idea, while others enjoy it. Surprised i haven't mentioned before.StoryI was surprised at the same time not surprised by the start for this season. Where we left on last episode the ideal match was made for one of the two main characters. With no other strong pull to grab at anything else it appeared to have ended with no promise of continuing. Alas, i was mistaken. At the time i thought it was a means to an end but it turned into something more.The new character from season 3 ended up being a star for this season. While we don't exactly learn much about the character's background we do get to have plenty of fun learning what he or she or better yet it is capable of.When the season comes to an end the season goes out with a mini bang of sorts. I am not revering to a costly ending or dramatic moment but more of slightly heavy on action. Which in turns opens the possibility for a continuance to pretty much anything. While at the same time provides a possible conclusion if there wasn't a season 5 already made.My stand on this season was neutral. Mainly more disappointed rather than appreciative. For we the audience still didn't get to know any big background questions. Such as why the odd chicken? Or more importantly is there a reason behind the shoe love?In addition, while it was interesting to see some past jokes thrown in from other seasons doing so like i mentioned before only tears down at that joke's value.P.s.

I don't think I laughed so much before.The story follows a young man and a group of women who follow him around, occasionally to each have sex with him/get raped/have sex with one another. There are some Pillars of Light which the demons have created that would destroy their land, and it is their duty to stop the demons.So, the Super Sentai--I mean, Power Rangers--uh, F-Force go around and use their super powers to save mankind. And have lots of sex.The art was a a bummer, since it wasn't as good as it should have been. There were some interesting character design and settings, but it wasn't as crisp and detailed as it could have been. The sound wasn't that great, either.Now, here's where I liked it--the characters. Each one of them, believe it or not, has a personality. Mostly that personality is determined by their clothes...I think F-Force was also one of the few hentai where there was actual consensual sex as well. And there's a smattering of lesbian sex, so for those who like that, there you go. Unfortunately, there was so much demon rape that I was turned off. Literally.

0;Watashi no Kao;WhatDothLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WhatDothLife;8;Watashi no Kao is a hauntingly cool (yet sadly, very short) work by the (in)famous Keita Kurosaka.Right off the bat, the story is not the focus, as there is very little.What is of focus is the incredible art style that Kurosaka employs. A twisted, surreal depiction of humanity that embodies the grotesque, creating a style that is oddly part-realistic and part-surrealistic. This style is often seen in his works, and speaks to the unique nature of his artistry. I love it.The sound design is very good, and backs up the intense imagery with an equal dose of intense sounds. It feels demented, out of this world, and engrosses you into the images therein.I greatly enjoyed this short animation, and would recommend it highly to open-minded animation fans and Kurosaka devotees (all of which seem to be only me so far).5/10/8/7/9/8;Recommended

It's unsettling, erratic and most of all, fitting for the message the piece seems to want to impart. The animation is exceedingly smooth at times but also jerky at others, but only when the jerkiness is intentional. The sound really gives a sense of... Unease and discomfort. Truly a good piece if you are interested in these short, dementia horror animations.";Recommended
2;Watashi no Kao;IrrelevantGuy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IrrelevantGuy;10;"** Actually serious review at the end **I thought Mochibei was good, but this.... This is otherworldly!Watashi no Kao exemplifies everything that I love about abstract short films. It's only 3 minutes long, yet so profound and genius! Unlike Mochibei, the story isn't that hard to understand, but it's executed even more exquisitely.Watashi no Kao primarily tells the coming-of-age story of a little girl who's trying her best to grow up as a normal person. Throughout the entire short, we see this girl constantly conforming herself to the ever changing society. And although these changes might not always be to her liking, she never complains; because she doesn't want to be isolated and ridiculed by others. She just stomachs everything without ever telling someone about it. That really says something about our society, doesn't it?These aren't the only themes that Watashi no Kao tackles though. Many more relevant social issues, such as the sudden and rapid increase of weebs all around the world, people committing war crimes for their waifus, etc. are dealth with in this short, that are all portrayed very realistically and masterfully. And all of this is done in only 3 minutes. Can you believe it!? I can't even solve a simple math problem in 3 minutes to be honest.As expected from Keita Kurosaka, the animation is flawless. Keita has utilized various visual metaphors and imageries to add subtle details to some scenes, and it is mind-blowing how much effort he has put into doing that. Moreover, character emotions are depicted so beautifully that they actually feel they are genuine.If you've read my review of Mochibei (which I bet you haven't), I said its soundtrack was a bit lacking, but Watashi no Kao absolutely slaps in this department. The music synchronizes perfectly with the events that occur in the short, and it's used to further enhance the viewing experience instead of being there just for the sake of it.Watashi no Kao is a life-changing experience. Forget Koe no Katachi, forget Gintama – Watashi no Kao is the best anime that I have ever watched. It's even better than Mochibei. So what are you doing right now? Stop reading this review, and just go watch the short film on YouTube or any other website you can find. And of course, don't forget to thank me later for introducing you to such a tremendous piece.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, in all seriousness, even if you look at it with the most rose-colored glasses, Watashi no Kao doesn't have an inkling of meaning or writing substance behind it, or at least that's what it seems like to me. As with almost all abstract short films, especially those that are horror, Watashi no Kao appears to be a purely experimental project with singular focus on the art, and with sound design that is frankly very shit. Considering that I personally don't like this kind of experimental works, it's completely unsurprising that I found nothing of value in Watashi no Kao. You might think differently, though it is highly unlikely, so I won't stop you from watching it. It's just 3 minutes long, and it's not exactly what I would call very disturbing either (unless you can't handle this any sort of ""grotesque"" stuff at all); there will be no harm in watching it if you are somewhat curious. At the very least, it will be a unique experience.";Recommended

Personally, I can't get enough of well crafted avant-garde horror films, and this very brief animated short, while not exactly great, does certainly have many elements I found to be extremely impressive and interesting. The animation is heavily stylized, and the visuals presented are highly unique, creative, strange, etc. Those who appreciate surrealism as much as I do will definitely find plenty in here to like; however, I will say, the sound design is pretty bad. Maybe it was just the copy I viewed, but the audio was actually terrible. You could argue it ""ads to the atmosphere"" or something, but I think it just made the short seem a bit more amateurish than necessary. In general, this short is certainly an interesting work that's intense, vibrant, although mostly meaningless and inaccessibly abstract.";Recommended

It definitely has that dark, surreal kind of demonic horror vibe that is seen in a lot of psychological horrors. Definitely worth a watch if you want to see something really weird and creepy, it's not mind blowing but it does its job as a 3 minute horror movie just fine.";Mixed Feelings
0;Watashi no Kao;Verty_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Verty_;3;Pay no attention to the people saying this is deep, it's not. It's just a girls face morphing into different faces for a few minutes. An old man's face, or a demonic face, and everything in-between as it stretches, squeezes, and growls quite loudly. That is mostly it.I liked the way the different faces melded together and stretched as they were changing in a psychedelic nightmare of an lsd trip that this short was. The wall of nightmare sounds (demonic growling and a metal pole being hit with a stick?) added another level of uncomfortable surrealism. Overall though it was pretty pointless. I appreciate the amount of effort went into the art though. Making complex scribbles into animation takes a different effort than drawing standard in-between frames.Eventually you see her real face, which was probably already spoiled for you. She looks at the camera and says a short phrase, then it ends, leaving you wondering why this exists.It is what it is, a short art piece with little meaning or point other than displaying the grotesque. 3/10;Not Recommended
0;Spelunker Sensei;haydenluvsanime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/haydenluvsanime;7;"It may seem strange at first to make an anime adaptation of a game that was released over 25 years ago, but it makes a lot more sense with context. Spelunker on the Famicom is a very notorious game in Japan for how easy it is to die. You literally cannot drop 2 feet without dying mid-air, à la Action 52. How do you make an anime with a weak protagonist like that? Make him a scrawny teacher, of course!Spelunker Sensei is reminiscent of classic web animation with its sense of humor and pacing. Me putting it that way could lead you to believe that it's going to be nothing but a bunch of amateurishly-made slapstick shorts which would only be funny to people who have played the game. However, that is absolutely not the case. Spelunker Sensei takes the concept of having a super weak protagonist and goes all out with it, creating several creative scenarios that will defy your expectations and have you laughing out loud. I was actually taken by surprise just how smart the setups were and how well the punchlines were handled.With that being said, can you watch it and still get some enjoyment out of it if you haven't played the game or know of its infamous status? Well, you can definitely get a chuckle or two if you know the context, but being more familiar with it is what I think will really sell this OVA to fans of Spelunker and hardcore retro gamers as a whole. Otherwise it's a solid 30 minutes of fun for everybody else.But for those who are deeper into gaming culture, you may associate bad games with angry nerds and irate gamers, which were all the rage in the late 2000s with their fruity language and high tempers. Meanwhile in Japan a lot of these bad games, or ""kusoge"", are actually quite celebrated for numerous reasons. The is that seeing people get angry over games is funny, but why would you wanna be the one behind the controller yourself? Playing bad games doesn't sound like fun, does it? Not necessarily in the traditional sense, however, there definitely is a level of passion behind getting the most out of the flawed. There's something other-worldly about getting that AAA experience out of a piece of media. Contrasting that on the other side of the coin, there's also something very human about the more niche and indie stuff. Watching Spelunker Sensei, I could tell that everybody who worked on it loved Spelunker and had a blast putting this OVA together. It's is a love letter to anybody who can feel that very human energy out of media. Maybe it doesn't have the greatest and most professional production out there, but I wouldn't have it any other way.";Recommended
0;Spelunker Sensei;Zzyli;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zzyli;6;Spelunker Sensei (or Spelunker is a Teacher) is a 30 minute comedy OVA following the misadventures of a teacher who is a Spelunker and those around him. The idea is based on the video game Spelunker which is a rogue-like game about exploring caves and obtaining treasure. A more modern game based on the same idea is Spelunky, which has some of the same features of cave exploration and easy death.The OVA is made up of numerous short gags, mostly focused on the fact that Spelunker Sensei can die from seemingly minor events. Sometimes the same set up is used multiple times with a different outcome, which I found amusing because it was hard to predict exactly how the situation would play out each time. It seems really similar to a lot of shows with 3-minute episode length, except that all the material is in one episode.The animation is done in Flash and very basic, but I don’t think that this is a detriment to the show. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and the backgrounds are simple, but the comedy mostly revolves around dialogue so the visuals are of secondary importance. Most of the show is in a simple traditional anime style, although there are also some 8-bit style visuals and a few scenes which have been shot in real settings.I found the music very enjoyable. The opening song ‘Risk My Life’ is lyrics set to the tune of Spelunker BGM and it was exciting and to me evoked the feeling of the adventure and difficulty of Spelunker Sensei’s life. The ending theme 恋は探検 (Love is an Expedition) was very cheerful and perhaps didn’t suit the very dry humour of the show as well, but it was catchy and fun to listen to. The background music during the show featured mainly some simple synthesiser sounds which I think complemented the comedy in an unobtrusive way.As the comedy of the show is based around dialogue, the voice acting is important and I think that the cast performs very well. Sugita Tomokazu, known for his roles playing cynical characters, is definitely worth a special mention as I think he does a great job showing Spelunker Sensei's resigned attitude to life.I really, really liked this show! I would definitely recommend it for fans of dry humour or if you like seeing a nod to retro games.;Mixed Feelings
0;Spelunker Sensei;andredrezefilth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/andredrezefilth;3;"OK, first of all, I could not help but to notice the number of people who actually finished this half hour OVA (500 and something). The 8 guys or chicks who scored this with a 10 must have never watch a single comedy show, anime or not, in their short pre-teen lifes.Spelunker Sensei does not deserve such a note, neither a big review, so I'm gonna be short:Spelunker Sensei is a failed OVA containing 30 minutes of short jokes in the traditional random anime style. The characters are poor, the budget surely did not help in the art and sound department, and the premise, which could have been entertaining if well developed, was poorly handled by the producers.Some of the jokes were a little bit funny, but most were pretty dumb and not good enough to be called ""good non-sense humour"". It's hard to understand what did Spelunker Sensei try to say to its viewers, especially when the main character seems to be constantly dying with no aparent explanation. Sure, this is a reference to a game from 1983, in which dying was as easy as taking baby from a child. But there was no particular care in this OVA to let the viewer understand this. Would that be so hard? However, this show did not have a hard time turning 30 minutes of my life into a boring moment which I will never forget, right next to Pale Cocoon and Shiki.So, I decided to score Spelunker Sensei with a 3.

2;Spelunker Sensei;megafat;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megafat;2;When it comes to a bad piece of media, whether it be a movie, TV show, music, or anime, the worst thing is a bad comedy. When it comes to every other genre, there is at least something to enjoy or appreciate, like it's atmosphere, technical quality, soundtrack, maybe a great performance or two, or it's potential. With a comedy, it relies entirely on it's jokes, and when it's jokes aren't funny, it has absolutely nothing to go on. And there isn't a point in pointing out the good parts of a comedy when the entire reason you're there is terrible. That's where Spelunker Sensei comes in.Based on the Spelunker Sensei video game franchise, Spelunker Sensei (AKA Spelunker is a Teacher) is a one shot OVA that was released in March of 2011 about a man named Spelunker (yes, that really is his name) being a teacher in your stereotypical Japanese high school. That's pretty much the entire premise, since it relies entirely on the jokes. Or joke, singular, in Spelunker Sensei's case.The entire joke is that Spelunker dies really easily, and he continually dies over and over again from things that don't normally kill people. It's literally one setup and premise repeated over and over again over 30 minutes, and it's not even that great joke to begin with. I wish it had been a lot more creative with it's joke. The OVA could have been Spelunker telling stories of his dying in various absurd or silly situations, but everyone points out that he couldn't have died because he's still alive, and that maybe he has a faulty memory, but maybe he was telling the truth the entire time because no one would believe that a man could die over and over again.But i guess that would have cost too much money, because the OVA has some pretty bad animation. The OVA looks like it was animated by one person on Newgrounds in the mid 2000's. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Tomokazu Sugita, who is known for his roles such as Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Gintoki Sakata from Gintama. Did the guy owe someone something or lose a bet? There isn't an English dub, but i doubt anyone was expecting one of this.In conclusion, don't watch Spelunker Sensei. Even so-bad-it's-good anime have more laughs than this. And there's plenty of good anime comedy out there, or at least interesting ones.;Not Recommended
0;Wakakusa no Charlotte;Aoa1235;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aoa1235;9;"I just want to preface this by saying this, this show is not a great pick me up for those who are looking for something good. This is most certainly a kids show, and it shows. The characters are flat, the main character is a mary sue, and this show is very low on the quality standard in many areas. Heck you can't even show this to your kids with the way they teach: ""lying is wrong, unless its to deceive someone you don't like"". Now as for my reasoning for the 9 is very simple, story fluidity.When you watch a typical anime, the show is split into arcs, and each arc should flow from one to the other well and with ease. What I love about this show is that the story flows from episode to episode in this fashion. Each episode has a purpose of some kind, and is used to build onto the story in some way. In other shows however, it feels more that the episodes are built into these blocks we call arcs, and when we put them side by side to each other, we just expect them to connect perfectly, and on the surface they do, but there is always a space of some sort that keeps it from staying together. That is exactly what charlotte fixes in my opinion.Now if you want to know whether to watch this from a more grounded view, I would say the show presents a journey of sorts for the main character, not to grow, but walk in the foot steps of the people dear to her, and meet people her loved ones had once known. She doesn't show much growth in character development from my opinion even if the show explicitly says it, but that's another topic altogether.Frankly the current summary for this show is not a good fit, because those ""arcs"" they bring up, while are in the show, are less ""arcs"" and more so conglomerated experiences that are experienced throughout the show rather than in blocks, with each one connecting themselves to the previous episodes that they are based off of.In the end, it was a pick me up that happened to work for me for what I was in the mood for at the time, and just happen to stick with, so won't be for everyone.";Recommended

After awhile he tells the girl his real name and with that she comes to the conclusion he is Macchan. Who is this girl? and why does she know my nickname? Asmuch as he thinks about it after alot of though he remembers a girl in his past that was called Sacchan.

0;KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi;Archaeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Archaeon;6;"Back in the early 90s anime was undergoing a transitional phase. One of the problems many studios faced was figuring out what would appeal to the new Western markets that had opened to the medium thanks to movies like Akira, Wings of Honneamise, Patlabor, etc. It was during this time that anime spawned some of it's stranger titles, one of which is KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi (KO Century Beast Warriors).The story is set the future, at a time when the Earth has been split in half. Humanity has fled to the Southern hemisphere, and the Northern world is now ruled by the Beast Tribes. However, humanity is now attempting to reclaim the planet in an attempt to find the mysterious treasure known as Gaia. In order to facilitate this, Uranus (leader of humanity), sends V-Dan and V-Zhon, along with their sidekick Akumako, to capture the heirs of three of the main Beast Tribes - Tgier, Mermaid and Bird. Enter then, Wan Dabada, Mei Mei and Badd Mint, three of the strangest (and in the case of Wan and Badd, dumbest), prisoners/hostages in anime.Now, some of you will have noticed that the names I'm using are different from those on MAL, Wiki, etc. Well there's a good reason for this. The names are taken from the original AnimeUK release of the OVA. The names were changed slightly in the US release some time later. Of the two versions though, the UK release is by far the funnier, for a number of reasons.One of the reasons why this is a very strange anime is because the show can't make up it's mind. The OVA begins as a straightforward combat comedy, however it then heads off down a mecha route, with added touches of mysticism, science fiction, and fantasy. In all honesty, while the story isn't particularly bad, the lack of any coherent plot direction means that the reasons for events and actions sometimes gets confusing.But that's only if you're taking this show seriously.KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi is, above all else, a comedy show, and it provides that in abundance (especially the AnimeUK release with it's dodgy accents). The puns and visual gags are quick and punchy, and while the comedy is a little dated in comparison to shows like Gintama, the OVA still has the capacity to make you giggle.As far as looks go, this is a fairly well animated show, especially for it's time. The colours are bright and bold, and while the character designs are a little on the spikey haired side, they're not as bad as some I could mention. The characters move well for the most part, however the animation does suffer from little oddities in a number of places, in particular during the hand to hand action sequences (surprisingly enough, the mech action sequences are pretty decent).The music for the OVA matches the visuals fairly well, however the tendency to switch from happy-boppy to overly dramatic can cause some confusion, especially when it happens before any dramatic event. The OP is a bit confusing because there's two to choose from. The revamped US version features a heavy rock track called B-O-M-B-E-R, which isn't a bad song, but I actually prefer the original, annoyingly catchy J-Pop theme tune that began ""Wandabadabadabdatta, Wandabadabadabadabadatta datta"". The original track is so annoying in fact, that you'll find yourself humming it decades later, even if you've only heard it once.As for the voice acting, oh my, where do I begin. The revamped US version of the series is nowhere near as funny as the original AnimeUK release, and while the UK version only covered three episodes, they were a damn sight funnier because of the voice acting than the later version. That's not to say the voice actors were good though, as the acting is fairly mediocre in either release (I have, sadly, yet to find the Japanese version), however the UK release had one major advantage - accents.Much like the notorious accents found in the original Catgirl Nuku Nuku OVA (which, ironically enough, also came out in 1992), KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi featured a range of differing accents, from fake cockney (also known as mockney), to American, and a whole bunch in between. It's because of these accents that the original release had a charm that just wasn't present in the US re-vamp.The characters are, on the whole, a bit hit and miss. The main three in the UK release, Wan, Mei Mei and Badd, are pretty fair as comedy leads, with V-Dan and V-Zhon being suitably evil and funny as well. Unfortunately, the US version loses a lot of what made the characters funny, especially as the emphasis in that version is not on comedy, but on action. Because of this the characters, who are underdeveloped anyway, go from being decent comedy roles to mediocre action heroes/villains. The characterisations simply aren't strong enough to support this shift in perspective, so the viewer is left with relatively hollow characters that, while not being bad, will never be good either.To be completely honest, I prefer the original AnimeUK release to the American remake. The UK version has a charm about it that is missing from the later version in particular because a lot more thought was put into the dialogue, but one can't ignore the impact of those accents.That said, there will be many people who may not ever get to see the UK version, as it is a rarity in anime these days. The US version, being easier to get hold of, isn't a bad show on the whole, and I will admit to a degree of bias in my preference for the UK release, however the flaws are more obvious in the US version because of the emphasis on action.This, like most anime, won't appeal to everyone, although comedy enthusiasts and fans of mecha may enjoy it. It may also appeal to people who just want something odd and funny to watch, although there are some better choices these days.Given that there's more comedic diversity in anime now though, imagine what it was like trying to find funny anime in 1992.";Mixed Feelings

By which i mean you have something that looks and represents what you want it to but detail is not there. Since, it is not there it fails to make the art realistic. The other feature of art is the backdrop. A clear hack and paste fix. Budget must have been cheap for they took what looked like to be actual real life pictures and footage and added some buffing effects to make it a tad cartoonish. If you ask me it reassembles more of a picture taken at high speed. The ones where you tried last second to catch the license of the car that smashed into you as it sped off. Those kind of shots.

What should be known about this movie is that its focus Kumiko & Kyouko as they were the ones responsible for the criminal's capture. The morals focused in the movie are the most complex of the 3 Nube films as it explores courage & regrets along with the justification of hurting criminals. That being said the movie begins on a slow pace then ends up being a bit unnecessarily complicated towards the end.While Nube isn't the focus in this movie he stills remains in character saving the day as usual. Overall Hell Teacher Nube The Movie could serve as an introduction to the series but as a fan of the anime or manga, the film version doesn't offer too many benefits. Whenever you finish the anime, I recommend to watching the 2nd movie & the OVAs. The OVA episodes are actually cannon, being based on much later manga chapters with its final episode being the best way to finish the anime series.";Mixed Feelings

Back to a time when you might find a hentai uncensored, and probably the only old art style hentai that keeps me coming back every year. Even if the plot is a little ""dropped you in the third book of a series"" you can actually feel the quality each character. That's probably why its one of the only single story arc that is 6 ep of hentai I know. There are so many everyone can find something. there is old fashion rape, inescapable rape, Aztec sacrificing, tentacles, & monsters is there anything else to life?Overall: 10Art: 10 - For its time it was probably the best it could be. If your faulting this for being hand drawn you probably didnt grow up with any good anime that way *cough* dbz, gundam, ect. *cough*.Sounds: 10 - Background music doesnt get in the way and the voice acting is top notch.Characters: 9 - Different from each other and each one gets plenty of screen time, but if you have a favorite ep you might forget about the others.Story: 6 - But what hentai would you rate any higher... exactly fair is great in the hentai world.Favorite scene?Skip to ep. 6 the second time the main character gets raped has it all. Fear, resistance, giving in, possession, double orgasm, tentacles, a throat gulp that still makes me lose it 4 years later and hasn't been copied. And a confusing end that makes you wonder if they will ever come out with a 4th book... one day....";Recommended

0;Konpeki no Kantai;donhumberto;https://myanimelist.net/profile/donhumberto;10;The reason why I’m writing this review of an ultra-obscure OVA that’s more than 20 years old now is because it is at long last being subbed (more info on that at the series subforum).For those who are unfamiliar with KNK I'll just say it's an epic 32 episodes (each one 45 min on average) OVA that run from 1993 to 2003. So yes, it took JC Staff (the studio) 10 years to make it. That can give you an idea of the quality level and the effort that was put into creating this.The story is set in an alternate WW2 where a Japanese admiral is trying to change Japan's role in the war. It plays out pretty much as a political thriller with a ton of absolutely gorgeous action scenes, all of which are fully handrawn and joy to watch to any (realistic) 2D animation fan (Think Legend of the Galactic Heroes meets Zipang with the quality level of Patlabor 2 or Jin Roh in the action scenes). I guess the fact that I've watched the series several times Raw with my broken japanese should give you an indication of just how good the action scenes are.I’m not even a history or military buff but I sure as hell am a hardcore handrawn animation fan who loves a good, gripping story and interesting characters. And, really, it doesn’t get much better than thisThey just don't make them like they used to and it’s painfully obvious that we won't be able to get any military-political thriller of this caliber any time soon (if ever).;Recommended
1;Konpeki no Kantai;zhoungxhina;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zhoungxhina;10;I'm going to skip introductions or whatever that is.The anime is gold in a gold mine, if you like WW2 and specifically the Pacific war like me, this anime is gold. Although some of the things that happened in this anime like 9- 10 ratio win rate of the Imperial Japanese Navy in almost every encounter against the US Navy, which is pretty much absurd, but that's okay since it is centered on Imperial Japanese Navy toppling over US in technology.I overall enjoyed the show since it shows us the famous figures in Word War 2, I don't think we will be getting another anime like this in these days, since majority of anime fans prefer the exact opposite of Konpeki no Kantai. I don't have much to say, but if you want to watch this anime and you are interested in World War 2, you will be having the time of your lifeTENNO HEIKA BANZAI !!!;Recommended

0;Momiji;ravenrage;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ravenrage;6;"May not be suitable for minors-------------------------------------Momiji is one of those ""Maid who serves her master"" hentai, usually filled with torture, BDSM and abusing. While Momiji features BDSM, it's only for a little while. It's mostly abusal and public sex. So if BDMS & torture is a turn off don't look away this one yet. Just skip it as there is no story telling going on at all in this.7 minutes into this and you get a good picture of what you are about to get into. We meet Momiji, a girl lacking a will of her own who have accepted to be one of Kazuto's maids. Kazuto is the lord and owner of a mansion where he have several maids at his disposal. All of the maids wants a piece of him but Momiji gets most of his attention. So mainly what this whole hentai is about is Kazuto abusing the poor, brain washed girl Momiji as his sex doll to enjoy his fetish to have sex in public areas. There is that comedy character put in to make it funny but it's a poor addition in my opinion.Although it's lacking a story, the backgrounds and characters are decent. Surprisingly for a hentai, the underwear is well detailed and nice to look on. Usually in hentai the underwear is plain with no details on it, so it's nice with a change. The art quality is kinda stiff and pointy but it has that 90's feel to it. Genitals are shown in their glory with nice details but the ""rod"" is simple.Sex is repetive. Guy dresses his girl up for his tastes, takes her to a public place like school or carneval, abuses girl by molesting her before he takes his position and end it with a pie or load. It's the same thing over and over with little variations like diferent girls, other positions and areas. I found this to be good for a few watches but it is easily replaced by better hentais out there.If slave and master relationship with public sex and BDSM thrown in is your cup of tea don't leave this one out. Nice details like variated underwear and different girls for all tastes makes this worth a watch.";Mixed Feelings
0;Taimanin Shiranui: Inyoku no Dorei Shoufu;Crowniko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Crowniko;5;"I remember being very excited when ZiZ announced this show on their website as a new entry to the Taimanin-verse is always welcomed in my eyes, however, Shiranui ended up being rather disappointing to me. Let's get into why!The story:Taimanin Shiranui opens up with recap of the Taimanin Yukikaze box-set special that looked absolutely fucking abysmal which isn't really a good way to start the show. After the recap we see Yukikaze's dead body decapitated with her mother, Shiranui, standing above it covered in blood. Shiranui is then told she will be given a reward for her good job which happens to be about 18 minutes of prostitution sex! Woohoo I'm so happy!! (not). The rest of the episode is just sex and more sex that only serves as a reminder that the ""Under Eden"" brothel is evil.The art/animation:Taimanin Shiranui is a production by ZiZ. The animation was handled by the rather new ""Teatro Nishi Tokyo Studio"" who has only ever done a few (not very good) ZiZ productions. Surprisingly this actually looks stunning in the modern hentai market as it doesn't suffer from ""smudging"". One gripe I do have with the art is the weird aspect ratio the show is in, I don't know if that was just the source I was watching it from but the two black bars at the top and bottom are annoying. Animation-wise it's decent nothing spectacular but I'm just happy to see art where the facial features are defined and it doesn't look like shit.Sound:The voice acting is good and the ending song is really fun even if it is just a generic techno beat. No real gripes with it and other than the ED I have no real praises.Overall:This is a ""pseudo-adaptation"" of Taimanin Yukikaze. It's supposed to tie in with the box-set special that at max 4 people watched, luckily I happened to be one of the ones who watched it so I understood the story it was going for. Unfortunately making a completely different ending to an already finished story doesn't really work and for that reason I'll have to give it a 5/10.";Mixed Feelings
1;Taimanin Shiranui: Inyoku no Dorei Shoufu;slaaack666;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slaaack666;5;"""Looks like you're enjoying this sideshow today, Shiranui.""Story: The story picks up from where the Taimanin Yukikaze Special left off. Shiranui was captured, had her body tempered with aphrodisiacs and started being trained as a prostitute slave by countless men (classic Taimanin).Art: Art looked good enough. I really liked the usage of pink but the aspect ratio bothered me quite a bit and I saw no reason for it to be the way it was. Animation was mostly fine, but sometimes it would look like a .png being dragged across the screen on Photoshop.Sound: Shiranui's voice sounded real good, and her moans were very sexy. The men's voices were annoying, but that's to be expected. Sound effects were by far the worst thing here, especially in the x-rays, making me burst out laughing twice during the creampie and double penetration. The soundtrack throughout the whole thing sounded like an austistic kid trying to play the bar's piano as his mom tries to drag his alcoholic dad home. I kind of liked the credit's song, but it felt too out of place.Character: Shiranui looked gorgeous, even though her cup size did seemed a bit off and inconsistent, but I can imagine how hard it is to animate something that big. The men were all generic, obnoxious, ugly middle-aged creeps and just made me miss the demons and tentacles.Enjoyment: Quality overall seemed to keep randomly dropping, all the creampies felt static and boring, animation was too looped and most scenes dragged on for too long, like they made 10 minutes of material and then stretched it up to 20. The ending was also very unsatisfying.Overall: I wasn't expecting much, but it doesn't make it feel less of a letdown to think this was supposed to be the Taimanin Yukikaze game's 10th anniversary celebration. Still, if you just wanted to see more of Shiranui, it's definitely worth a shot.";Mixed Feelings

Though the way I phrased it makes it sound like I hate them or something, it's just that I have never been interested in that side of otaku culture and only gained some knowledge about it through random memes.This is relevant because I barely knew Marine Houshou before watching this, yet despite that I honestly thought it was ""good"". ""good"" in quotation marks because I'm still reflecting on what I really watched, but what I can guarantee is that I did enjoy what I watched. I definitely wasn't expecting something like this going into it (was anybody?), especially considering that it's an MV made by a vtuber and her agency, and it was no doubt a pleasant (and erotic) surprise.To be honest, Marine's voice in Marine Shukkou wasn't exactly my cup of tea (except for the ending segment), and I didn't like her singing that much the first time I heard this song. The more I listened to it though, the more I started liking it. The music is clearly well-produced and catchy, plus there are many parts in the song where Marine comes off as really charming – albeit unconventionally, if you get what I mean. The lyrics are surprisingly funny. I say ""surprisingly"", because it could have easily been the exact opposite given the amount of lewd humor and content (well, 100% of the MV). They somehow not only avoided that, but also made the MV very entertaining to watch. That's a big fucking achievement.Nothing else to say really. I'm just glad that there is a vtuber who is making content like this, and definitely not for the reasons you are thinking of.

Murder? You go to hell. Suicide from mental distress? We'll work you hard but you might have another shot at a better life the next time around.The main character Santa deals with folk that have lost their way in life and gives them exactly what they deserve. Is it always fair? No. But they deserve some punishment for their wrongdoings.I really want to say if Laughing Salesman and Gegege had a kid, this would be it. A more morally upstandard hellish being that wants all humans to do well in life, yet deals with those that don't.Honestly if you enjoy Laughing Salesman AND/OR Gegege you'd enjoy this.

The final episode (also the best one) concluded this narrative with a satisfying ending with a cool moral message and a neat one liner from Santa. So how come the show still didn't work? Well-the story wasn't well executed. Most of the dialogues and fight scenes were mediocre, Santa seemed like a good character for whom they just didn't manage to write good material. You'll get glimpses of quality but not much more. It's not a very engaging show and it feels like there's an indecision on whether it wants to be wacky or educative and serious.

Luckily thanks to aid of the young and old the main character gets off his coaster only to walk to his true enlightened path. Where he steps he takes will be long but will build him up to what he needs to become. Questions being will there be conflict? Who will get in his way if anyone? As for the ending it is a nice light comedic romance.The most entertaining aspect of the story was the underlying message. Where there is one there is another. Alas, one must step aside to make room for the next up and comer. In other words say you were a champion in your area of expertise. It will never stay that way. Someone else will come along better and stronger. For that to happen certain things have to happen. Such as opening position to the lower position of the totem pole of your area. In a more clear insight to how this message is kind, love who you are for no matter what changes await you there is a better future ahead.ArtworkGiven the context this good have been a blood bath of sorts. I am glad it wasn't. For in this scope the audience won't be steered away from the main events. For face it while gore does make certain aspects more entertaining most find it hard to stomach and thus look away.Overall: I would say this show is similar to the television series of Rocky(boxer). The main difference is position in life. In Rocky he is in prime and has the cameras/audience's attention for this show the main character is not the 'main' but learns he can be. Too many show exist of godlike main characters. Rare is it to see what came before.;Mixed Feelings

Soon those luscious curves get her into real trouble late one night when Nami rushes to the aid of an injured woman behind the restaurant where she works. The woman hands her a strange looking pendant and begs her to ""take her place"", and soon, lots of perverted men along with monsters end up want to do perverted things to her.On the sex front, there is some variety, ranging from one character being felt up on a train, to another character being double penetrated by a monster, which is probably the best animated scene out of the whole thing. So there's bound to be something that fits one of your fetishes.The animation is actually half decent, but unfortunately it still has a hentai budget. You'd be surprised at just how much hentai has atrocious animation. I know that expectations are low, but since I've started reviewing a lot of hentai, I've been kinda spoiled by stuff like ""Words Worth"", ""Front Innocent"", and ""Kuroinu: Kedakaki Seijo wa Hakudaku ni Somaru"". If want me to get off to it, give it a budget, or at least spend the budget you have on the sex scenes.As far as the English dub, the script is a bit inconsistent, and I even think that some of the lines were placed out of order. The voice acting itself is adequate, so if you like your English dubs in your hentai, then you could do much worse than this.Sexy Sailor Soldiers is a pretty obvious parody of the ""magical girl"" genre, but with a lot less fighting and a lot more fucking (although there is still a lot of fighting). Unfortunately, it the plot doesn't really go anywhere, as it's stuck with just the one episode. It would have been neat with a few more episodes so it can incorporate and play off of more magical girl tropes, but with one episodes, it leaves little wiggle room, and it plays it more like a regular magical girl series just with more sex rather than straight up parody.Is Sexy Sailor Soldiers (AKA Nami SOS!

1;Sexy Sailor Soldiers;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;Rate a 4English DubbedStoryWasn’t pleased nor angry at the introduction. Mainly for how I see breasts. They say size doesn’t manner it is the same thing just slightly different. Although, I think most will agree that the bigger the bust the more emphasis on alleged beauty. Which I can see to be true. For that is one key element that makes a woman distinguishable from a man. Going back to the intro there is little to no straight pretext to what the audience is going to get from their purchase of Sexy Sailors Soldiers. Like a narrator for example. Instead there is music and other sound elements to boost the glamour that is the setting. Which told me art was held a higher standard than plot.Plot or what made the story was not original. It was sailor moon but from a hentai perspective with no cat. From costume chances not being entirely different from original clothes. To common magical abilities like flying. Speaking of which what is it that even provided said lift? Yes, the pendant play a huge part but issue remain.There were a few wording discrepancies. Such as when the enemy invades a dwelling belonging to the main character. During a fight a character makes an appearance with an identifying remark like, “stay away from my sister”. Yet, the enemy responds with, “who are you?” Sure, a name wasn’t dropped but does a name really matter in that situation when it was already clear what position he had? I would agree the situation would be okay if the name of the individual was someone of high importance but it was a minor character.As for the conclusion I was saddened. Rather than sticking to the introduction by having something artistic like a drawn orgy it ended on a joke. Which by itself was a joke for a joke is plot based. If they wanted to end on a plot note why not start on one?Art-not a fan of certain night town settings. Did not blend in for it was almost as if it wasn’t drawn but more like a real life image added to a drawn world.-some grunts or other non-vocals weren’t illustrated in the drawings.-I applaud the lack of blood in the rape scenes.-the Impression of defeat in the eyes of the blue haired girl was wonderful.;Not Recommended

If you were patient for 2 seasons you will be rewarded with some neat stuff from the characters and some plot twists from the story. I gotta mention that episodes 60-78 I watched them on Youtube and despite the 480p quality the story was so damn good that I didn't care too much about animation and sound.We have new characters that are introduced which brings a diversity for this show and more enjoyment because this is what matters the most from an anime!Season 3 handles so well the reasons of the characters that did different things who put them in a positive or negative light. Li Muchou (or Ribakshou in Japanese) is one character that you cannot hate and she manages to leave a good impression after her journey comes to an end. One of the strongest points in this season is Xiao, Lung Nu's disappearance(or running away) which gives a reason of existence for our main character Yang Gou.We get too see Xangier all grown up as a fine gorgeous lady with a pure and big heart that helps here to make a lot of friends. Thank god she didn't grew up and become a bitch like her big sister Lu Fou who you cannot like her no matter what.Huang Rong is probably the best character from this series along with the Condor which is my bro despite being a bird.Also the development of our main character is impressive and the fact that he maintains his modest mentality of doing things despite acquiring a lot of knowledge and power in the martial arts is a plus and praise worthy stuff for this show.The quality of story is good as always and the enjoyment is even better in this season.While the animation and sound (especially the chinese va) sucks everything else compensate and I had a blast watching this. I wanted more episodes after the show ended to be honest. So my recommendation is to watch this no matter what!

0;Ontama!;HidamariSeashore;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HidamariSeashore;7;"No one would want the people they care about to be sad; they’d do whatever they can to make sure they’re happy. For those in a loving family, that would include those in their family. There is one anime girl like that, who went back in time just to make her mother happy in the future....but not many people know that the anime she is in exists. I certainly didn’t know it existed until the day I randomly decided to scroll through the list of anime produced by the studio Encourage Films and instantly got attracted to this particular anime’s cute art style. Thus, I decided to watch it, although despite its cute art style, I honestly didn’t expect much. Little did I know that I was in for a bit of a treat.Lads, ladies, and non-binaries, here is my review of the not-so-well-known cutesy anime, Ontama!The story of Ontama begins with an elementary school girl named Ichigo Tamura being distressed about her family issues; her mother is a very nice woman, but her stepfather doesn’t act the same way, always berating the two of them. One day, while she’s crying in the park about it, she is approached by a person in a bus driver’s outfit, who asks her what her wish is; in response, Ichigo says that her wish is for her mother and her father - her REAL father, that is - to get married instead, as she feels that her real father would have made her mother happier. Next thing Ichigo knows, she is thrown into a magical bus (not to be confused with the Magic School Bus) and driven back in time to before she was born. She ends up meeting her real father, the clumsy Kyousuke Hikami, and, while posing as his little sister, sets off to set him up with her mother, Miyuki. However, she must first overcome some obstacles, such as Kyousuke’s best friend and Ichigo’s future stepfather, Yuuji, who also clearly has feelings for Miyuki.Oh, did I mention how Ichigo ended up meeting Kyousuke? He cracked her out of an egg. I’m not kidding; that actually happened. That is only one of the many completely random things to happen in Ontama’s story, and most of the time, these random moments can actually be quite funny; I ended up laughing out loud a lot more than I thought I would. However, what I didn’t appreciate was the fact that the comedy took time away from the story, which gave the relationship between Kyousuke and Miyuki less time to develop than it already had and made it feel really rushed as a result. Plus, the plot twist revealed in the last episode was so predictable that it was honestly kind of irritating, and although it answered one potential question a viewer who possibly might not figure it out may have, it just leaves them with more; as a result, I wasn’t as emotionally invested as I could have been.Despite the story not being that good, I can say that the characters were charming. Ichigo is a decent protagonist; I liked how supportive she was of her parents’ love lives. The one who granted her wish, Cappy, had a cute appearance, but otherwise....he was kind of forgettable. Honestly, not a lot of the characters in the cast stand out that much, not even Kyousuke and Miyuki, who are both important parts of the story; no one was really unlikable, but I didn’t really like them, either. I will give a special mention to Yuuji, however; he is perhaps the most complex character in this simple anime, although I won’t get into it because of the possibility of accidentally entering spoiler territory.I said at the beginning of this review that the art was what made me watch Ontama, and aside from that, the animation was decent. The quality I watched it in wasn’t that good, but the animation flowed well for the tone it was setting. The character designs were cute, too, and while the backgrounds weren’t anything special, they weren’t awful, either. The voice acting was also decent; while there were times where I felt like the voice actors weren’t portraying the emotions the characters feel good enough, it’s still easy to tell that they’re having fun. Finally, the opening and ending themes were decent in their own ways, but ultimately, I wouldn’t listen to them again.Overall, Ontama was just a decent anime. If you like zany comedy with a bit of romance on the side, I’d recommend you watch it, but at the same time, no one is going to kill you if you don’t. There are other anime out there where characters take field trips through time, after all.";Mixed Feelings
0;Ochame na Futago: Claire Gakuin Monogatari;oswallt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/oswallt;4;The first half was enjoyable, but the second half was really disappointing. The first 14 episodes are a charming story about a boarding school in England. The rest feel more like a modem Japanese high school, the characters personalities change, and the stories become trite. I've now read the books that this is based on and know that the last 12 episodes are original and not from the books at all.When I started watching this, I wondered why it wasn't more popular, but now I know. I struggled to finish the series and only my strong completionist tendencies saw me through.If this series sounds interesting to you, I would suggest not going to the trouble of tracking down a copy of the DVD and read the books instead. They're quick reads and, since they were written in the 1940's, they're in the public domain. Unless you're in the US were copyright is a century long :(;Not Recommended
0;Chikan Juunin-tai The Animation;Victor2K;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Victor2K;7;The series itself is just another excuse to do a chikan anime themed series, but the point of the 'association' adds a little to put something new at the categoryThe fourth movie, all-lesbian one, seems the best IMHO. It goes away from the plotline from the other movies (moved by a student who wants help to get her teacher to her clutches) and the lesbian train scenes got the best of me and put this movie ahead of the others and many other train hentai storiesI reccomend you to watch fourth movie first or even just see that movie if you don't want to see the regular chikan thing appearing all over again;Recommended

That's the story, nothing more; I don't know if it's a criticism to molesters or something like this, If it is, so I think that it should be done differently, else it's an awful thing made.Now about the art, the characters are so ugly, I can compare it to Hametsu no Mars, the difference is that the animation is a little bit better.But it is it, I really don't know anything more to say, this anime is so bad, don't spend your time with it, there are many other options to watch that are so many better, and the most important thing, don't reproduce anything you've seen in this anime.";Not Recommended
0;Tottoko Hamtarou Movie 1: Ham-Ham Land Daibouken;DanVS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DanVS;9;"Story: 6 (Decent)It was about them all going to this magical hamster world where there was a legend about a sunflower seed that could let you talk to humans that Hamtaro wanted so he could speak with Laura who forgot about him on her birthday.It was cute, most of the movie seemed like filler since the main plot wasn't as complex as it could have been, but it was fun filler.Art: 10 (I loved it!)It was cute, the characters had a lot of energy, emotions were clear, there was this one scene though where Hamtaro falls onto this trampoline. But he sorta just teleported up and down for a second instead of actually bouncing!Though, that's clearly a nit pick.The settings, especially the magical land they travel to, are so atmospheric and almost a little creepy at times with as dark the colour scheme is. In a weird contrast for how happy all the hamster there are shown being. I liked it.The villain looked almost like a cat at first. I was wrong, but because of how dark the setting seemed to be I instantly assumed this whole world was just a trap to lure in hamsters for him to eat.I was thinking of Coraline I guess. I mean it makes sense. First Hamtaro is having trouble at home, then he's whisked away to a world built to make hamsters like him happy. Both worlds looked fun and happy with a sort of dark twist to their designs.I feel the comparison works.Sound: 8 (Very good)There was a lot of singing through out the movie. There was even a hamster idol group which I thought was hilarious.Welll, the songs weren't exactly play list worthy, but I still really liked them.Character: 4 (decent)I had a tough time figuring out what score. I think it's clear by now that I like the movie, but none of the characters really grew or changed.Hamtaro just sorta has a falling out with his human, Laura, he's mad at her, then the movie just sorta ends with him going back to normal.I doubt that counts as a spoiler. I mean, do you really expect a Hamtaro movie to not have a happy ending? Even if it does a good job faking you out you should still expect that happy ending to come anyways.As for the other characters, they were all there through out the movie but they sorta fade into the background.Actually, now that I think about it, they felt less like characters and more like a group of mindless robots following Hamtaro around. I think it was all that speaking in unison stuff they did. Hamtaro was the only one aside from the new characters that actually stood out.As for the new characters. I loved them. The Hamster ninjas were cute, the villain was pretty funny, then there was the girl, I can't recall her name, I skipped around the movie for a few seconds trying to find it but... I don't think she ever introduces herself.Odd... And the Hamtaro Wiki page for this movie didn't even have it. I might see it the next time I watch the movie.She's was probably the coolest character, I'd say more but the things I really want to say feel like spoilers even if it isn't exactly plot related. Though look forward to the end of the movie. She's a candidate for most random line of dialogue ever. Like, what the heck? XDThe one thing I feel like I can say is, she's one of this worlds guardians and she sorta acts as the villains opposite. Look forward to seeing some pretty cool magic from her!୧☉□☉୨ I want to say it but I won't say it, because of spoilers, but she's to thank for best scene in the movie. Like holy crap. I bet the animators had a blast on this thing.Enjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)I get distracted easily. If an anime can't hold my interest I think to myself, ""I'll just pause it for a second and check something."" Or, ""Now I have a song stuck in my head, hold on, I gotta visit youtube for a second."" Or, ""Should I finish that quest in Skyrim? I'll watch the rest later.""Didn't happen one time during this movie. So it must have been pretty good, right?Would most certainly watch again.Overall: 9 (Great)That thing about the rest of the main cast turning into background robots kinda bugs me or it would have been ten here too. I mean this world was so creative and there was so much they packed into it, maybe they just didn't have the time to give everyone a chance in the spotlight.So.. I guess it's more of a nit pick if anything, especially considering how many characters there are.I hope this anime has an official subbed version. I want to buy the DVD so I can watch it again in better quality.";Recommended
0;Shusaku;Crowniko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Crowniko;6;Continuing the -saku series here is Shusaku! A slightly less good show than its predecessor. Let's get into why!The story:There's this music academy and a bunch of girls come to attend it in order to strengthen their music abilities. Inside this academy there's a janitor named Shusaku, he's an old fart who picks up information and uses it to blackmail and have sex with the girls at the academy.Easily the strongest part of the show is the characters as the plot is rather lacking. There are funny moments, sad moments, and in general just enjoyable interactions between a bunch of the characters.Unfortunately, even with that the show ends up being rather confusing at a few times, which definitely lowers my rating for it.The protagonist, Eri Takabe, doesn't really have ample time to shine in this entry (she will in the later Shusaku seasons though) but I will say she helps end Shusaku's rampage in a rather satisfying way.The art/animation:Shusaku is an Elf game turned OVA by Pink Pineapple. The animation was handled by the little-known Production D.M.H and, to be honest, it really doesn't look bad. The character designs were done by Hiroya Iijima, who you may know for Afro fucking Samurai. Safe to say the art looks really good. Also, for whatever reason Shusaku's penis is glowing yellow, I don't know if this was for censoring or what, but it looks goofy as shit.Sound:Easily one of the weirdest soundtrack's I've ever heard in a show, it isn't bad but it does NOT fit at ALL with the circumstances. The voice acting on the other hand is good, which is nice.Overall:This genuinely wasn't a bad watch, but a lot of the show is confusing and/or terribly paced, which lowers the rating substantially. Shusaku isn't really a compelling villain in this first season, but he does get better in the coming seasons (foreshadowing!!!). Would I suggest this show? I mean if you like rape or fun characters yeah, other than that no. All in all, I'd give Shusaku a 6/10, enjoyable'ish but not brilliant.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shusaku;Arrvilja;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arrvilja;1;I don't really know how to review this thing, because I really disliked it.The story is just average for the anime of this kind (I mean hentai actually). It consists of constant blackmailing and sex scenes that follow, and I really wonder who would like it. In fact, the story could be described in a few words and it is just a small introduction to the sexual content. So let me say there is no actual story at all. I forced myself to watch it up to the end just to see what all this nonsense will finally lead to, and the ending disappointed me, too.The characters also were of nothing special: one bad guy and a huge tribe of frightened innocent girls who later stop being innocent. I've seen many of that kind already.The sound was ok, and the art reflected the atmosphere (was supposed to, at least), but imho was too dark.To sum up, a mediocre product that can will most likely arouse the feeling of disgust, but not pleasure from watching.;Not Recommended
1;Shusaku;cthulhuplush;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cthulhuplush;2;"I've seen enough hentai, that at this point more or less nothing offends me. With that said Shuusaku is terrible and fail to accomplish anything it sets out to do. It fails as porn, it fails as an anime. Its story and characters are horrible and bland, and as porn it's far to soft core to provide anything of any interest. It attempts to play to fetishes, but fails to deliver anything of any interest, that can't just be obtained better elsewhere.It's most glaring flaw is of course it's characters. The most vital part of any hentai is its characters. If porn is to be a vicarious sexual experience, it's rather vital to provide people who are actually interesting in some way. Even the shallowest of people would want to have sex with any of these characters because of their lack of personality. The cast consists of a character who lost her right to be considered a loli five years ago, doing her best to be the loli character; the rich girl, who I assume was supposed to refined or something; a girl who is tan, and apparently a whore because she has had sex, not that that plays any role in how she acts in the series; a girl whose primary character trait is that she has irritable bowel syndrome (nope, I'm not kidding); two girls I almost always forget exist; a teacher, who never actually acts as a teacher; and the protagonist/antagonist, I don't really know since there isn't really a main character. It would either be her, or maybe Shuusaku. Oh yeah, there's also him, a gray skinned janitor with a glowing yellow penis.It's a minor complaint, but the glowing yellow penis is a problem. This OVA came out in 1999, when series began to become more hard core, and more genitals started being shown. I suppose there was some experimentation with censoring technique or something, but when it got here his penis is yellow. This ruin any chance of anything going on being taken seriously. It's hard to tell if you should be facepalming or laughing whenever it shows up, both of which will make it hard to fap, not that you'd really want to to this.Shuusaku doesn't have anything interesting to offer pornographically. Animation wise is okay for it's time, and the character design is passable, but it's lacking in sexual content and what content is there is isn't particularly graphic. Most scenes are simply soft core porn with stupid dialogue explaining what's going on. Okay series, we'll take your word for it that that is anal sex, because it would be impossible to tell otherwise, good thing you told us. Mostly it's just bland uninspired sex scenes between a nasty gray dude and some girl you only want to see in a sex scene because it might mean she will be talking less.Shuusaku goes for a darker tone, but doesn't execute it well. It consists exclusively of rape, which is par for the course I guess, and tries to incorporate scatological and urination fetishes. As I said nothing bothers me, so I won't complain about such fetishes being present in something. I will however complain about their execution, and Shuusaku doesn't do a very good job of this. This series has an irrational amount of enemas, but no actual scat. I really don't want to see it, but if you are going to include stuff like that, go all the way. People who aren't interested still won't be interested, and people who want to see geysers of shit shooting out of girls asses will be disappointed in the lack thereof. Don't stop halfway and please no one. Fundamentally it fails to be intense with any of its fetishes, and isn't interesting enough with them to make those who don't care about them interested in it.So what about it's story. A good story can keep us interested in what's going on and possibly distract us from the yellow penis that takes us out of the action whenever anything happens. Shuusaku also fails in this aspect. There really is no story or coherent narrative to this series. There is a gray janitor, he blackmails girls using photographs that would be in all ways impossible to obtain, and then rapes them. That's really it. There is no flow to it, and each sex scene/new victim seems to come out of no where. It all ends with the [pro/an]tagonist informing him that she is putting an end to his evil ways, she has called the cops and they're on their way, and with all that evidence on his computer he will be put away. One would think that he would have a contingency for just this kind of thing, but no it really never occurred to him that one of the girls he raped, might inform the authorities, and maybe using evidence of your crimes to blackmail the victims isn't the best idea in the world. Thus he runs away and is hit by a car. What a stupid and anticlimactic ending.Shuusaku really has no positive aspects, as porn it's uninteresting, as a story it's complete garbage, and as something awesomely bad it has little to offer. The yellow penis is kind of funny, but it's not worth watching just to see. Overall it's neither good or bad enough to warrant watching. Just bland and pointless.";Not Recommended
0;Kujakuou;BlokeTokes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlokeTokes;6;"This is basically a series of three different movies, so much so that the art-style isn't even the same throughout. Each ova does carry the same cast of main characters though, but the story isn't continuous and is more a set of three different supernatural mysteries. That isn't saying this is a detective show though. This is more of an atmospheric action series as-well as a light thriller (mostly due to the ominous presentation at many times). The stories are at varying degrees of interesting.The first story isn't very intriguing and is actually more of an opening to the characters, but that isn't a justification as that'd be an unnecessarily long introduction - the first ova just has a bland story. The second ova also has a cliche run-of-the-mill story for the Akira 80's, but it isn't quite bland since it carries all of that Akira gore. The second ova is definitely the most action-heavy of the three. The third ova is the most story-focused and carries the most impressive animation in a reserved and well-proportioned sense. The third ova definitely doesn't have as wild and wacky of action, but there are no scenes that you might wince at, it's continuously of good quality. The directing is also more-or-less good throughout all there, but the third ova really was striking in its presentation which led me to believe there were different directors working on these, but MAL seems to disagree - only linking to Rintaro (who is a great director still). Beyond directing, the characters aren't that great and are at times solely tolerable. There is a macho guy throughout who is constantly portrayed as a bro-mance tsundere to the main character, risking his butt to help the MC then turning to the side to say ""it wasn't for you, you know?"" Get's old, but thankfully the third ova seemed to care very little for the characters and more for the story and the villain. The villains of the first two ovas aren't interesting in the least and are typical world-conquering powerhouses, while the third is actually quite a bit more unique and detailed. Even though the third is a better and more interesting character though, her story isn't that exciting still and her ranting about it dragged on too long for my tastes. I got to say though that the soundtrack for these ovas are effective and I found myself ripping a lot of the end-credits songs to listen later. The soundtracks are all 80's electronic in some fashion, but they sound different enough that you can also reinforce that feeling that these ovas are all made separately as different beasts. I'd love to download the soundtracks for these.I'd say all three of these movies are worth the watch, but if you don't feel like watching them all I can be more refined in my recommendations.* If you love 80's animation, it's gore, and it's wackiness, watch the second ova.* If you love something that's well-directed and good cinema, watch the third ova.* If you just want a little dark-grittiness with simplicity and action as-well (basically somewhere in-between what the other two ova's offer) watch the first ova.In my opinion, I'd say I enjoyed the 2nd and 3rd the most. Overall, the Spirit Warrior trilogy is some good 80's fun, but don't expect to be uncovering a diamond among these.P.S. I also thought I'd mention the other film of this franchise ""Spirit Warrior - Peacock King"". It's worse than any of these three short ovas. Peacock King is basically an extended cliche world-dominating villain story with a lackluster ending attempting to make these dull characters part of an epic story-line. I'd skip that one and just watch these, but feel free to satisfy your curiosity. It does, at the least, have two great end-credits songs I ripped to my music library.";Mixed Feelings

Seriously only thing that followed it. The characters. They were all the same and liked the same people. Thooooough someone who died in the first series is alive. And another chick who went away for a time was still there Oh and one chick who just disappeared is still there. I did enjoy the sex scenes though. They were more detailed than in the first series. In the first one they didn't really show a lot of what was going on until the like last episode. Some of them a bit weird. But being in the genre it is. Understandable. If you go with the fact that maybe they decided to be all ""Let's call it a sequel but it reaaally be a retelling"" then It has a Okay story. I suppose if you are into this kind of hentai then you might like it but if you wish to watch it thinking they are gonna follow original storyline. Yeaaah nope.

0;Yodaka no Hoshi;Lemon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lemon;7;"A very interesting short: beautiful art, great use of colours, and fantastic music.The story itself was written between the two World Wars and explores the idea of pacifism, sacrifice, and in a way - the Japanese spirit of 我慢. It's written around the same time Ghandi was active but it's not clear if there are subtle references to him specifically or just general Buddist ideals.In this bitter-sweet story the bullied Nighthawk is taunted by more powerful birds to abandon its identity, but it refuses to do so and resolves to pacifism and chooses to sacrifice itself rather than to inconvenience others/fighting - a silent resistance if you will. During its journey the Nighthawk questions the nature of the food cycles and the interaction between the weak and the strong. If you're familiar with history, at this point you can probably see the clear connections between the Nighthawk and Ghandi's principles of valuing truth and non-resistance.It's interesting viewing in the sense that it shows very clearly the change in values over time and places; what is regarded as weakness in contemporary Western eyes is a sign of strength in 1920s Japan etc..In summary, a fantastic short - absolutely worth watching!";Recommended
0;Ashita no Yukinojou;Angel-With-Gunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angel-With-Gunz;4;SUMMARYAshita no Yukinojou is an anime about a group of school friends and their interactions with a mysterious (and fairly bland) transfer student. Unlike many hentai based animes this series is incredibly plot driven and the hentai scenes make up approximately only 25% of the run time of the whole series.STORYThe main plot is a pretty dull, inconsequential and hard to follow affair, with multiple characters having fairly similar appearances, names and personalities. Even the main male character himself getting confused between two of the girls at one point. The only topic of interest in the story is that it seems to involve boxing, however it is only mentioned a few times in each episode.VISUALS and EROTICSThe sex scenes are all very vanilla with very heavy censoring and involve the male transfer student with one of the female students from the school. The only exception to this is one attempted rape scene which does not get too extreme.HIGHLIGHT MOMENTHonestly it is hard to pick anything out as a highlight.CONCLUSIONOverall it is hard to know what the creators were going for with this series. It is incredibly plot heavy, however the plot is very thin. And honestly I find it hard to think of a reason to recommend this series.OVERALL44/100;Not Recommended
0;Shitai wo Arau The Animation;BlackMagic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlackMagic;7;I'll start off by saying this anime is targeted toward a pretty niche audience. It contains a variety of fetishes including drugging, necrophilia, some enema play, bondage, rape, quite a bit of cum, guro, and a bit of inflation as well. While the show does touch on a number of these things, there is a focus on the necrophilia aspect which makes it a must see for those with that inclination. It's definitely at the forefront of its kind in that respect.AnimationI felt that the animation here was pretty average or slightly above. I wish it could have been better, but at the same time nothing really got on my nerves.SoundI was pleasantly surprised by the music. The OP has a somewhat haunting feel to it that really sets the mood considering the show's content. I think the music did a good job adding weight to the story's atmosphere, intensity, and unpleasantness at the proper times.CharactersThere was a decent assortment of characters here: the somewhat average guy who is a bit hesitant about his new job washing corpses, the seemingly detached guy who works too many nightshifts, the nympho doctor, the cheery and somewhat cute romantic interest, the cute and willing nurse, and then another nurse who is a bit of a mixed bag.I liked following the protagonist in episode 1 as he struggled to get accustomed to his new job and come to terms with the strange things in his head. He devolves to quite the monster in very little time and is pretty enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately none of the characters really left their mark on me, but I feel they served their purpose. The real treat of this anime is the content.StoryI watched this RAW, so I may have missed out on some of the finer points, but I felt that I could follow things pretty easily. The plot setup is pretty simple: a young guy gets a job cleaning up corpses in a hospital and unwittingly becomes a doctor's guinea pig as she develops a kind of hallucinogenic sex drug. The stage is then set for a sexual rampage with some pretty trippy (and disturbing) hallucinations as icing on the cake.EnjoymentI'm a fan of depravity and this anime delivered. I thoroughly enjoyed the hallucinations and the very very disturbing content found during some of the sex scenes. I was also treated to one of the most magnificent anal rape scenes ever. It reminded me of Dragon Ball Z when a guy is screaming and powering up, except this was an orgasm. The music really tipped the balance and I think this scene in particular is among my favorite choreographed sequences in animation right up there with the frog dissection scene from Ichi the Killer: Episode 0. Toward the end of episode 3, I was feeling quite pleased and just a bit unsettled, which is usually the sign of a good show ^_^For fans of guro and necrophilia this is truly a gem of a hentai and a favorite of mine within the genre.;Recommended
0;Shitai wo Arau The Animation;PandaJerk007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PandaJerk007;5;Story:The story is one of the more disturbing things I've ever seen. It is pretty unique and interesting, it's the reason I wanted to watch this over other hentai. I think the story had a lot of potential, but they could have made so much more with it.Art:The art was decent. There's a lot of better looking hentai out there nowadays, but this still looks fine. It's creepy when it wants to be, and no animation seems to drag on for too long (in some older hentai they would keep animations looping for a while to fill time to stay within their budget). There are also some pretty creative things they did in the art for this. The main character does look ridiculously creepy at points, but the only significant downside with the art is that none of the scenes really stand out for being amazingly hot.Sound:The sound is fine, it didn't really impress me, but I can't really think of anything to complain about it. It did have one pretty unique piece of music that I've never heard anything like in a hentai before. The opening theme music is also really creepy and well done. Overall the sound was decent, it's just very possible that it could have been better.Characters:The characters are the only part of this hentai that were bad (although it is pretty rare for hentai to have really good characters.) You'll feel a little bit of sympathy for the main character, but he gets so insane that there's no way you'll like him by the end. The females don't really get any character development.Enjoyment:I could see some people enjoying this series a lot, but I didn't all that much. It was so disturbing that I couldn't get into the sex scenes. The story was pretty good, but I was hoping for a lot more.Overall:Overall the series gets a 5/10. It's a slightly below average hentai to me, but it would definitely be worth watching if you want to see necrophilia type stuff. I wanted to see that and that's what I got, but it just turns out I'm not very into that.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shitai wo Arau The Animation;d9i032i0e9i23dg;https://myanimelist.net/profile/d9i032i0e9i23dg;2;"After finishing this anime, I am left thinking two things... ""What the actual hell did I just watch?"" and ""Why did I waste my time on this?"" Not worth the watch for the hentai, not worth the watch for the disturbed druggy crap.The story line is an embarrassment. Absolutely terrible. It was impossible to follow, especially the final two episodes. The ""drugs"" concept was translated very poorly and was very corny. I can't imagine how this story line could have been worse... well, maybe if their heads blew up with scat and if they added Larry King and the Nesquik bunny.The sound wasn't terrible, just really annoying. Some of the girls gave me an earache. To be fair, squeaky voices are common in hentai. To each their own.The characters are completely brain dead personality wise. Hell, I couldn't tell you all of their names. The most tolerable character is the other male from the beginning of the first episode who also ""body washes"". I wish I could say the females were likable in the first episode but my liking for them quickly turned to manure as the series progressed...This was a chore to finish. There are a few scenes that are meant to be disturbing just completely failed. Nothing more, just a complete fail. No enjoyment at all.Only reason this anime is receiving a 2 is because of the art, which wasn't too bad. The nurses were cute. Compared to other content from Pink Pineapple, Shitai wo Arau The Animation has better art than most.Don't bother watching this. What little decent hentai scenes were in this anime are not enough to compensate pathetic characters and a pathetic story line.

0;Onboro Film;Bizancio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bizancio;9;"Excuse me, I'm Spanish and I don't usually write in English. If you want you can read my review in Spanish.When I watch this film, I wonder: What adjective is the most appropriate to define this short film? So, the one that comes to mind is undoubtedly “brilliant”. Here we find a parodic tribute to the western, one where Tezuka limits himself to narrating a story known to all: a cowboy saving a damsel in distress. You may wonder what is so extraordinary about something that sounds as unexciting as throwing a tissue in the trash can. However, my praise is justified by how it carries out the imitation.The idea of Tezuka is basically to imitate those classic tapes where the problems to reproduce them on the cassette were counted by the hundreds. And boy did he make it. The presentation is so perfect that the short film pretends to be a spoiled movie. By clicking ""play"" we already noticed how the image and sound quality are very poor. The background music is a lively melody, but very repetitive. The drawing style is reminiscent of American animation from the first half of the 20th century. In case it no longer appears sufficiently old, the film's titles indicate that it is from 1885.This presentation can be misleading, so much so that there have been few unsuspecting people who, ignoring the date of the first animation in history, have thought for a minute if they had made the wrong short film to play. However, in the middle of the footage there is a wink of about half a second where an angry lady appears hitting a television to improve the quality of the image. Although this is the most important clue to realize that there was a planning here, there are plenty of signs that allow us to capture the author's intention regarding this short.What are these clues? Well, nothing more and nothing less, than a series of audiovisual problems. Tape playback encounters obstacles such as dust, scratches, skewed planes, poor sound, or temporary loss of picture, among many others. Each of these inconveniences is a hindrance for the cowboy, who did not have them at first. However, as if he were the wise Bugs Bunny, he applies his ingenuity to break through. Is there an out of square plane? Well, I move it with the gun to place it well. Can't see well because of the dust? I clean the image. Can't I stop the train in time? I take advantage of the damsel's “Help” sandwich to throw it at her and stop her going. In other cases, bad fortune works against him and he only has to get angry without the possibility of doing much. Clear examples would be when he becomes entangled in a tangle of cables that looked like dust on the screen or when a sudden red line prevents him from kissing the rescued.The visual humor of the film and the way it takes advantage of all these resources is simply brilliant. As if he were a magician capable of inventing a new trick in a few seconds, also playing with our expectations. Proof of this would be when the image is miraculously restored and the color returns, although as expected the joy of the spectator and the cowboy does not last long. This lively wit is likely to cause huge laughter to those who see it, especially with the funny solutions that the protagonist adopts. As I mentioned before, he takes advantage of them to his advantage, especially with the villain by stealing his gun when there is a stop in the image or the way he goes from frame to frame to catch him off guard. Anyway, I can say little else that explains the genius of this short film.You can read my review here: https://elarmarioanimados.blogspot.com/2020/06/cortometrajes-de-osamu-tezuka-anos-80.html";Recommended
1;Onboro Film;YoungVagabond;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YoungVagabond;7;Highly creative, which is no surprise coming from Tezuka.Done in a purposely archaic animation style, complete with cigarette burns, lines, and two frames jammed together on screen simultaneously long before it was cool, the characters interact with these defects in an amusing manner. Tezuka's Disney-inspired animation style works particularly well with what is supposedly an animated Western from 1885.It's a single idea executed well over 5 minutes, perhaps even overstaying its welcome with a few gags at the end that fell flat.Overall though, it's a worthwhile, original animation. Recommended to fans of anime looking for something short and unique.;Recommended

Often right? To be fair that was age of starting animation. Nothing was bound to be perfect let alone the quality we see now a days. This director, whom is starting to become a favorite of mine decides enough is enough let's stop our current pieces and make a piece based on the troubles we have to work with grandfathering animation.ArtOf course it is grainy. Of course it is in black and white. Of course there is a tilting error. All of these and other bad things art is made of were intended. You have to understand the plot to understand the art in this case. Which is why i will say on rarity this crappy art was perfect.SoundWorks with the audio. Although some minor touches of unneeded noises could have been removed.CharacterThe main character or characters in general were not solely on this film.

The quality here is no joke too. If you had told me this was a pre-50s movie, I would have believed anyone who said that.It's just a short based on a cowboy and the stereotypical events that come along with it, with the scene consistently shifting due to frames being reeled up and down (from what I'd imagine) or some other old cartoon gag being used. Considering what actually goes down, I'd say that such a story is a perfect fit for such a self-aware movie. Really gives the chance to shine to abuse current and old cartoon cliches.Aside from that and the already nailed down visual quality—of course, sound quality is equally respected (very retro here)—there's not a lot to go on about.But give it a try. Only 5 mins of fun.;Recommended

0;Kunoichi Bakumatsu Kitan;thenwhowasphone;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thenwhowasphone;9;The Last Kunoichi is one interesting hentai title because it attempts to insert into Japanese history a story about three female shinobi.Story - 10/10It was interesting to see how the studio used some aspects of Japanese history such as the Ikedaya incident and the assassination of Ryoma Sakamoto and placed the story of the three main protagonists. You can clearly see the effort to make a good enough narrative to keep the viewer hooked not only to the sex scenes but to the story as well.Art - 10/10I really liked the animation in this one especially how Kaede, Kikyoo and Ayame's faces and bodies were drawn. The muscularity of the male characters made the sex sequences all the more erotic. There is a consistency on how the character models are all drawn.Sound - 9/10There were some good music pieces and the sounds of katanas and short swords clashing were spot on.Character - 9/10It was quite fascinating to see the studio's take on famous Japanese figures. Aside from the Shinsengumi and Rebels, I liked Kaede and Kikyoo among the three kunoichis. It's a shame that Kaede did not get a scene with Toshizo Hijikata who she built a good relationship with.Enjoyment - 8/10History and sex. Yep, I enjoyed.This has got to be one of my favorite hentai titles of all time and I'm asking myself why I only made this review now. I wish there were more episodes so we could *ehem* explore more of Kaede's story after what happened to her two colleagues. A major disadvantage to appreciating the story in my opinion is that the second episode was both censored (in contrast to the first episode) and did not have any English subtitles--meaning this was released only in Japan and the American studio that published the first episode did not do the same for the second. If you have not watched enough anime to understand Japanese, you'd be lost in the dialogue and may possibly affect one's opinion on the title as a whole. Still, The Last Kunoichi is one of the best yet underrated hentai titles out there.Do yourself a favor and watch it.;Recommended
1;Kunoichi Bakumatsu Kitan;dj_taz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dj_taz;7;"I first found a short clip of this hentai on a rondom webblog. I've been on the hunt for it since then for like 2 weeks. Had high hopes and expectations for it. And for me to be completely honest? quite a bit of a let down. Granted it's quite a nice hentai, but certainly not the top one's I would recommend.It looks either quite an old anime or just low budget on animation. The only character I liked was the red head ninja, and the best scene was when she got raped but the grey skin samurai. The story I say isn't that brilliant, too complex and there's no real connection between every sub plots and events. On the brighter side? I'd say it's a good ""overall"" but no real peak in any particular points and factors. I liked the whole theme with ninjas and the ancient Japan, alot of good animes made fortunes on that subject. Maybe it's quite a let down since I've expected more from such a good base. I reckon if this is remade perhaps? get a better artist on the job of animation and picture quality, a better story with connections and less complex, and finish that rape scene! I was actually expecting the grey samurai to return in episode 2, but it never came.But to be fair, I'd say if you don't have as much expectations as much as I did, you might actually enjoy it! It's a good 7/10 overall from me!";Recommended
2;Kunoichi Bakumatsu Kitan;sdb68;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sdb68;8;"this was a really good hentai i thought, with great potential but was sadly unfinished with only 2 episodes made. it is not often you find a hentai with a decent plot, but this was one of them. i notice that all the reviews for this anime have been rated down. why? i fully expect mine to be rated down too. nevertheless, here goes...the art is lush, the characters are very attractively drawn, including the men for once, which adds to the appeal of the hentai scenes. the sex scenes are explicit (in the first episode - the second ep. is censored, and i'm sorry to say, done in very crass way with huge mosaics that completely ruins the art) and shows the men as well as the women enjoying themselves, which was refreshing. with one exception all the sex is consensual, and are acts of love between people who care for each other.the storyline is set during the time of the shinsengumi, so there is a lot of political intrigue, which i found a little hard to follow as with only 2 eps there wasn't time to further expand the plot. there was some swordplay also but that was limited which is a bit of a negative.this is well worth a watch; a political drama with a feminist element and appealing characters. what a darn shame this series did not continue.";Recommended

0;G-9;HybridMedia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HybridMedia;5;The plot follows a woman who awakes in a deserted town with no memories and no clothing. The story continues to show how she regains these memories of which she was and her mission in the town with the help of a voice that speaks directly to her thoughts via her earring. Her name is Agarta, the Devourer of Dragons, and her mission is to destroy the dragons that plague the consciousness of humans in return for her own long past memories.Now, the animation is done by Toei Animation, who is most known for making anime such as Dragonball & One Piece, two series that one of them, being the former I only watched and the animation is a bit lackluster and it’s not because of the black and white only color scheme. There wasn’t any animation at all and it just feels like they should’ve made this into a manga (either printed or digital) because the production just feels cheap, even for a short. But the art does compliment the dark and eerie surroundings of the environment in the anime. I get that it feels like a painting in motion or like motion webcomics in a way but it’s nothing to be at awe about.The story of it is average at best but still passable to an extent. I could blab on about the minimal character development of Agarta and the dragons but they only have 17 minutes to cover it and for what it’s worth, it’s actually decent.FINAL VERDICT: It’s very stiff and flat but it may appeal to other watchers but it’s just not worth watching over and over. It is mostly an artsy fare and I can appreciate that kind of anime but most of the time, it’s a complete bore.;Mixed Feelings

0;Kimi to Boku;Fall;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fall;5;Kimi to Boku is a flash animation created in early 2001 that has since been lost to the sands of time after being overshadowed by Makoto Shinkai's Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko, an eerily similar animation project released just a year later. It's very clear that Shinkai drew a great deal of inspiration from Kimi to Boku, from the idea to the narrative and even the art style, dialogue and overall portrayal. Hence, Kimi to Boku is the predecessor to Shinkai's work, and it might be worth it alone just to learn about the animation that inspired Shinkai.However, Kimi to Boku also excels in ways that Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko doesn't, delving deeper into its subject matter and forming a more cohesive, complete story with every loose end tied up. By the same token, the dialogue quickly wore repetitive, and the animation started to drag on as it neared its end, but because of that sacrifice, the narrative is multi-faceted and deeper in ways that Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko isn't, speaking more intimately to the viewer's heart. That said, four precious minutes are spent on expositing the tale of Orihime and Hikoboshi that only parallel very loosely with the narrative by the end, which ultimately detracts from the narrative and possibly sending the viewer to sleep. It isn't difficult to imagine this actually happening, either, as the music pieces that are constantly overlayed on the animation are slow and soothing tunes, though it's nothing very special.If you've ever owned a cat, this story will most definitely resonate with you, though some narrative and character elements may seem foreign. At 14 minutes, it's an easy but worthy investment -- what can you lose?;Mixed Feelings

However, these were lame, lame, lame. So if you can't find them, don't be too sad about it. Basically each ending consisted of a different character walking up to the Akane under Sakura trees and monologing about how she had saved them while reviews of their parts in the series flash through the screen. Akane never says anything in reply, just watches them talk or hugs them. If it wasn’t bad enough that they didn’t bother adding any kind of a dialogue about why she chose the one she chose to be with at the end . . . they also stretched it a bit too far to suggest that her relationship with Inori, Shimon, Tackamichi, or Yasuaki could suddenly turn Romantic, even though it never really has been. And in each ending they suggest that she is going to be with her chosen one forever. Bla, Bla, Bla . . . it was disappointing.;Not Recommended

0;Summer: Inaka no Seikatsu;TheOffbrandBaron;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheOffbrandBaron;4;Summer: Inaka no Seikatsu was not the enjoyable offbrand that I hoped it would be. While it had a few positive elements about it the overall experience was incredibly mediocre.Plot and structure: Protagonist-kun is called to the country by his relatives to look after Hazuki for the summer, who has been left alone in the house. And ultimately that's as far as the plot goes because the pacing of the episode is so ridiculously fast and abrupt that all we get afterwards is a speedrun of sex scenes. One second our character's are on the couch watching TV and the next Hazuki is upstairs masturbating in her bedroom while Protag-kun is watching. How did we get here? This wouldn't be an issue if the transitions were just a little smoother between scenes and even during scenes but you won't get that here.Characters: This offbrand's Protagonist-kun has got to be one of the most boring MCs I have ever seen. He never says a word, only ever grunting or shaking his head (despite the occasional subtitle that makes no sense), which does not do his character any favours. I would much rather have hair-covering-eyes protagonist number 73 instead of this guy as they'd no doubt be much more interesting or at least have some kind of personality. As for Hazuki, she's not much better. While she gets plenty of lines throughout the episode the ridiculous pacing leaves her very little to say outside of the sex scenes. And those lines are either just moans or the typical dialogue you'd hear from any character from any offbrand during these scenes. Despite her quality design she does not stand out in the slightest when compared to other characters from other offbrands.Animation and art: The character designs, while being nothing new as we've seen them plenty of times before in other offbrands, are well done. The same can be said for the animation, well done but nothing special. There's nothing here that really distinguishes Summer: Inaka no Seikatsu from other shows stylistically but at least the generic animation style the creators went with is decent and nice to look at. If only it flowed better though. The animation quality itself is actually really good - nothing looks like a Queen Bee slideshow in this show - but the transitions between scenes and even during scenes as mentioned before were terrible. If they had just added a few more shots and keyframes between their jump cuts then there's be far less issue, or even just some better transition effects like a slower fadeout instead of just non-stop jump cuts and cuts to black. Oh well, at least the scenes themselves ain't too shabby.Sound design: There was a lot to be desired here. I've already talked about Protag-kun's near nonexistent voice acting, but couple that with the lack of music or other background noise and it made for an extremely dull end result. Sure there were cicadas in the background which gave some much needed life to the world but this did very little to improve things given how common they are in other projects. It's just white noise at this point. Hazuki's voice acting was fine, until the lack of music and Protag-kun dialogue to work off made her copy paste moans all the more repetitive. Very little variety that makes it difficult to engage and immerse yourself into the story. And the pacing doesn't help much here either. Can you tell how much I hate the pacing in this OVA?Summary: I know I have said a lot of bad things about this show but that doesn't mean that it's awful. Like mentioned before the animation is decent, the character designs are well done and the scenes that a large number of you clicked to watch won't disappoint. However the weak points in this show just drag it down too much. Boring characters, dull sound, generic art and terrible pacing make it extremely hard to recommend this offbrand. Maybe things will get better when we get more episodes (whenever that's gonna happen) but as of right now, this show gets a 4/10. Not terrible, just incredibly mediocre. I'm gonna go watch Imaizumin Chi wa Douyara Gal no Tamariba ni Natteru Rashii again.;Not Recommended

0;Iron Virgin Jun;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;3;"Overview:It is well known that Go Nagai is one of the most influential and controversial mangaka in the industry's history. He gave us the giant transforming robot genre and Sentai with Mazinger Z. He gave us the Magical Girl genre with Cutie Honey. He even helped give us the seinen demographic with the bold and brutally violent twin works of Devilman and Violence Jack during the 1970s, which showed that manga could be for older readers as well.However, if you write 2,000 different comics, one shot doujins, and anime, you are going to have a few flubs. Stan Lee has written plenty of bad comic issues by his own admission and even Alan Moore has been known to occasionally write something less than stellar. Go Nagai is no exception to this rule. So what is generally considered to be the nadir of Uncle Go's insanely prolific career? I've looked into it and most would say Iron Virgin Jun. Having seen this anime and the manga it was adapted from...yeah I can see why.Before we begin the review, we must sing the obligatory Go Nagai tribute song!Go Nagai! His violence is over the top!Go Nagai! So much blood you will need a mop!Go Nagai! The guy that wrote Mazinger Z!Go Nagai! The guy likes likes to draw women pee!Go Nagai! His rape scenes incur censors wrath!Go Nagai! Dude might be a sociopath!HOORAH UNCLE GOOO!!!Plot:Iron Virgin Jun, as you can probably surmise, is about a young maiden named Jun. On her 18th birthday, Jun is forced into an arranged marriage by her giant ogre of a mother. Jun refuses to accept this and runs away into the woods, so her mother sends a bunch of minions after her. Jun beats up the minions and joins with a young butler of her household named Kuratta, who is basically her only friend. When Jun's mother learns her minions have been defeated, she goes into a rage and puts a ""virginity bounty"" on Jun. Whoever manages to catch and rape her gets to marry her! This soon leads to Jun fighting against rapist ninjas using robot penises that transform into giant drills. ""Mine is the dick that will pierce the heavens!!!"" Jun comes across her kindly aunt, who states that she and Kuratta can live with her on her magic island, but unfortunately the island will appear upside down until Jun has set her own life right. This means confronting the source of her family's evil, her demonic grandmother! Jun teams up with her good guy father, who jumps at the chance of finally killing his bitch mother in law! It turns out she is already dead and they must defeat her ghost, which they do without much effort because this is a 1 episode anime. Jun and Kuratta then basically live happily ever after. The end.Art:This OVA came out in 1992 and it looks like SHIT! Despite the fact that movies and OVAs tended to have better art than long running anime series in the early 1990s, Jun's art and animation is repugnant. Jun makes other schlock OVAs from the same time period look like their art cells belong in the Louvre!Sound:The voice acting here is BAD! The English dub is unsurprisingly abominable and even the Japanese dub is so lazy and underwhelming that non-Japanese speakers can tell it sucks! Jun can't even claim to have enjoyably cheesy music like so many of its fellow 90s OVAs.Overall:While a few of the jokes are at least sort of funny, mostly this show just falls on its face. The manga is MUCH more risque and insane with its humor, so it at least has that vintage Go Nagai feel. The anime is a watered down version of an already shitty manga, that was only passable because of shock humor. With most of the shock humor removed, this just feels like an empty husk. I really wouldn't recommend this anime unless you just HAVE to see what Go Nagai's worst looks like.";Not Recommended

2;Iron Virgin Jun;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;1;Iron Virgin Jun is a comedic action OVA based off of a manga by Nagai Go. I’ve never reviewed anything by him. He’s best known for Devilman and Devil Lady. It was handled by Dynamic Planning. Which is Nagai’s own baby company. So, you know they’ll handle his vision properly at least.Story:Jun is having her 18th birthday and, as per family tradition, she’s “required” to get married. So she does what any sensible person would do and nopes out of there followed by the loyal servant, Kurata. Her mother responds by… sending a group of rapists after her. Because, clearly, if she doesn’t want to get married to some random man getting brutally assaulted by random men will assuage her fears. Seriously though, this is supposed to be a comedy there shouldn’t be the threat of rape.The OVA basically follows Jun as she tries to escape her mother and the gang of rapists in order to determine her own fate. There are some huge problems. First off, sexual assault and comedy don’t mesh. I don’t care if you make their genitalia floaties with ducks, turtles and other various bollocks. It doesn’t work. So, having a group of rapists as major antagonists don’t work. The lack of logic from characters (Jun refusing to throw away her tracker, her mother wanting her to get married at 18 but not having a fiancée set up or anything) could work in a comedy if there was strong humour. There are no good jokes in this. About the “height” of its jokes is Jun being cornered, flexing out of her party clothes and beating up some guys. Which isn’t really funny, it’s just unexpected.Characters:The characters are one note and rubbish. Yes, comedic characters can get by with being somewhat shallow if they’re endearing and they have strong comedic dynamics. The characters in this don’t have that because there are no funny jokes. So, they just come across as paper thin, low effort characters. Nagai tries to add some depth by giving the mother some informed characteristics at the end but it doesn’t work to tell us a character has these motivations or these traits when those traits are never demonstrated.Art:The artwork is really bad. The action doesn’t flow well. It’s clumsy and disjointed. Nagai is clearly going for a Wrestling aesthetic with it. Not Olympic style, the fake one. But it just fails to deliver any excitement or flair. The character art is lazy at its best and absolute rubbish at worst.Sound:The acting is of the “nobody gives a shit” variety. Yokoyama Chisa, Komiya Kazue, Nakamura Daiki… none of them seem to be putting in any effort. And these aren’t bad actors. Yokoyama was the voice of Biscuit Kreuger. It just sounds like they got their scripts and decided they didn’t need to try. The music is probably the best part of the OVA because it’s, at least, sub-par.Ho-yay:There isn’t any.Areas of Improvement:1. Have some comedy. Because wading through these non-jokes is painful.2. Develop your characters enough to give them comedic quirks and dynamics. Characters in a comedy don’t need to be all that complex but they do need to be funny.3. Get the Basics down. I realise that a lot of bad anime don’t give their actors enough to work with for them to give good performances, but you could at least direct them so they sound like they’re trying and put any kind of effort into the art.Final Thoughts:Iron Virgin Jun is pretty horrendously bad. No effort. Terrible comedy. There are many, many better things you can do in forty six minutes. To name a few examples, you could play with your pet, shiny hunt in Pokemon, watch any episode of any Star Trek series that isn’t Discovery, grind some levels in an RPG or light some candles and play with your genitalia. I mean, most things are going to be better than this. My rating is a 1/10.;Not Recommended
0;Abciee Shuugyou Nikki;Wallanimx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wallanimx;7;ABCiee is a fun, short anime about the ins and outs of running tv shows. We're introduced to an intern who although very hardworking, can be clumsy and forgetful at times. The cast is made up of tv anchor/staff veterans who are sometimes a bit eccentric and I respect how hard they work ABCiee to get him to have a bit of a backbone. Getting into the tv biz is rough afterall.This show is fun and a great one to watch if you just need to turn your mind off for a bit and relax. There's no deep history in this show, so what you see is exactly what you get. I'd recommend this to those who just want to chill out with an anime that you can easily finish in one sitting. I'd also recommend this to children as it is fairly educational about the ins and outs of a tv network without getting technical.<3;Recommended

There, he lives many funny and dynamic adventures, where the anime becomes educational and, in almost his totality, made for the child The show does not have many required qualities, since it has only the intention of being a pastime in the middle of popular animes, getting to be unknown by most.I must say that I am fascinated with this type of show. It's cool to relax while you're seeing something playful at the end of the day, it's a very nice experience. I recommend a lot if you feel like consuming small content, even more if you are short of time to watch anything. Abciee can be ideal for you.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kuro no Danshou;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;5;"With the amount of hentai out there that are filled with tentacles galore, it was only time before hentai adapted one of H.P. Lovecraft's tentacle filled stories, which leads us to Mystery of the Necronomicon.The anime follows private detective Satoshi Suzuhara and his adoptive daughter, Asuka Kashiwagi, as they spend time at an isolated ski resort. But when a snowstorm cuts off all links to the outside, a string of gruesome murders occurs, and Satoshi becomes the main suspect. It becomes a race against time as Satoshi must find out who is behind the murders. As the plot goes on, it becomes obvious that Mystery of the Necronomicon takes inspiration from several different Lovecraft stories.Up front, I'm going to say that the sex scenes are too few and far between, and are far too short, with most of the running time being taken up by the plot. I could see someone maybe getting their rocks off the one of the situations in this hentai, but the whole thing is filled with budget 90's hentai animation, so I don't know how many people are going to get their jollies off to this one.And I'm pretty sure some of these sex scenes have been done better in some other schlocky 90's softcore porn. So I wouldn't recommend it for the porn. So if you don't mind me, I'm going to be regretfully spending the rest of the review pulling apart the plot of a cheesy hentai that doesn't need this level of criticism.Right off the bat, if I were the main character, the one thing that I wouldn't be doing if I was the main character is going around to different people claiming that I'm a detective. Already, people aren't going to trust one another because of the murder, and I'm pretty sure people aren't going to trust me just because I claim that I'm a detective. Plus I haven't seen our main character do any even remotely like detective work outside trying to solve a case that he's one of the suspects in.Unsurprisingly, this has all of the cliches. Premonition of future events in dreams, running into the character without knowing their the bad guy despite the fact that it was very obviously telegraphed to the audience, one of the characters creepily talking about the Necronomicon, making him look like a really obvious bad guy, or red herring. Gotta fill out the plot in your porno somehow, even if that's not what we came here for.The hentai even brings up the main characters names, places, and dates and times as text on the screen as they appear. You have time for the most tired cliches in the book, but not enough time to introduce your characters properly. I know that porn is supposed to have low standards when it comes to the plot, but you don't include this much plot unless you want to actually write something meant to entertain people. If Stephen King can write cheesy plots and dialogue and still be considered a good writer, then you need to keep up.Most people don't have a fetish that requires filling in ~75-80 minutes of your 90 minute porn with backstory and character motivations. Fucking is and should be the backstory and character motivation for a porn, and that's worked fantastically for decades. Although the fact that that the main character just stumbles into somehow fucking women, and even HE is surprised by the fact that he's getting laid out of nowhere, which is kind of humorous.Plus this has some violence and gore, like one of the main characters coming across a dead body with the skin on their face ripped off. I guess if you've ever been annoyed that your horror movies had their sex scenes cut down to barely anything by the ratings board of your country, maybe I could see someone liking this, but that's an incredibly niche group of people.Somehow this anime falls into the trope of ""Well, they're not actually related, so it's technically not incest"", because characters keep bringing up the fact that our main character and the girl he adopted are more like a couple than blood relations. I guess hentai can't help but shove in SOME sort of hentai trope.The main character is voiced by the sexy voice of Dan Green, who is probably most famous for playing Yami from Yu-Gi-Oh. Looking at his list of roles, he seemed to act in a few different hentai, Mystery of the Necronomicon being one of it. I'm guessing that this isn't one of the roles that he talks about, but I still appreciate hearing his voice, even if it is in an embarresment of an anime. He's also the only one in this whole thing giving a good performance. I don't blame him from taking a role for a paycheck though. The rest of it borders on so-bad-it's-good, but none of it's really all that memorable.The plot is pretty much that of a schlocky made-for-cable film that would have been made in the 90s to sell cable subscriptions just so you'd hope you could see maybe see one maybe half decent sex scene out of the dozens on ""movies"" on their service. It even has the cheesy saxophone playing over sex scenes. And one song that sounds like it came out of a NES game .Although, for some reason it plays over the climactic scene near the end of the anime, which is hilariously out of place.So if cheesy so-bad-its-good horror/thriller with a strong Stephen King vibe (the main character even mentions Maine like Stephen King does in every single one of his novels) with a few sex scenes thrown in sounds like fun to you, then this might be worth checking out.";Mixed Feelings
0;100% Pascal-sensei (TV);Lyvranz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lyvranz;5;It's a gag reel anime, really, so there's not much that can be said. Tackling on the more technical aspects first? I'd say the artstyle is vibrant and the animation fluid, surprisingly so sometimes so it definitely meets expectations in those regards, but considering there is no story, the characters are one-note, the shorts often make no sense, if at all, and that it's aimed at an audience of kids no older than 12 at best? I'd say this one misses the mark for adult viewers unless one is looking for a cheap, noncommital laugh or two by avoiding better comedies out there.Regarding the characters, they're all middle schoolers who really wish they weren't there but carry with themselves their own unique attributes. One, for example, is a character which is initially introduced as a 'rival' to the main characters but ends up being an actually nice-hearted kid who is always willing to help despite his fearsome (for a kid, at least) appearance which would suggest otherwise. They're not exactly complex and not entirely one-note? But once a character has been assigned an episodic gag, they will live and die by that gag which can get tiring really fast.The only thing keeping me from dropping this show is my absurd and stubborn dedication to finish an anime once I've started it. Sometimes I chuckled and at other times I was bored, but the one thing I can say with confidence is that 100% Pascal-sensei is, at the very least, a show most kids who don't care about joke layers or context will enjoy so, if that's your cup of tea, then by all means go for it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Gotou ni Naritai.;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;8;"Just when I thought all hope was lost for the three ""disability movies"" which I like to call them, I randomly come across the fact that Evetaku just fansubbed this...months ago! Whoa! When I saw that on MAL, I rushed over to the site to confirm it, and there it was, right on the bottom of the front page! I immediately downloaded it and watched it right after I got home from school. Thank GOD this thing got subbed! Maybe there's some hope for Happy Birthday: Inochi Kagayaku Toki and Momoko: Kaeru no Uta ga Kikoeru yo after all in terms of the fansubbing department!Considering that this was made in 1995, the animation is clearly rather sub-par, at best. However, the animators did a great job at giving every single character a distinct look and, once again, giving them physical flaws, such as obesity and small eyes and big teeth. One problem I notice in a lot of new anime nowadays is that everyone doesn't have their own distinct look. Everyone looks the same, except with different hair styles, hair colors, and eye colors, which is especially apparent in a lot of harem and moe anime. Not only that, they're so obsessed with beauty that they have no physical flaws, like big teeth or braces or acne or anything else like that! Even American shows feature characters with those peculiarities and insecurities! What is it with Japan and making everyone look impossibly beautiful and flawless?! Thank God this anime subverted that trope awesomely! The soundtrack isn't memorable, really. I don't remember any of it.Again, like with the other two disability movies, its characters are awesome, realistic, and wonderfully developed. While they look and act slightly generic, they're not flat-out stereotypes either, and there's always a reason behind their actions. Heck, later on in the movie, the two main bullies who pick on Ritsuko have their reasons for being so cruel. The movie addresses the issue of love, hate, jealousy (NOT romantic jealousy, mind you), and acceptance, and it follows through its themes wonderfully. They're all great and perfectly normal characters. The adults are good too, even though some of them may be a little weird.If I had to name some problems this movie has, one notable one would be that at times, it gets a little too melodramatic, particularly with Ritsuko's mother and how she reacts to the bullies. But in this case, it's justified because Ritsuko's mother is portrayed as an overprotective person, and Ritsuko is embarrassed by her reckless actions (Hey, what kid ISN'T embarrassed by the things their parents do at one point?), so I can let it slide. Also, while I do like Ritsuko's doctor for being so supportive of her, I'm really confused: are blind people even allowed to be doctors? Or is he just a therapist? I have no idea, even with the subs! Are blind people allowed to be therapists?Well, even with it's glaringly obvious flaws, I still liked this movie. Unfortunately, the two other disability movies trump it, though it definitely shouldn't be so neglected.";Recommended
1;Gotou ni Naritai.;koro_una;https://myanimelist.net/profile/koro_una;10;This is my very first review so if it's not that awesome, I apologize.I'm usually not a fan of old anime, but it's not like I never give them a chance. This was also an exception, and oh how glad I am it was.Ritsuko has trouble walking, she's been ill since birth, but did her best to keep up with the others, to be able to walk like the others.If I really don't want to spoiler anything, I better not write anything, because that's the way I watched this too. I barely knew anything about what would happen.The art is of course old, but not in the way that it ruins the enjoyment, not at all. I don't find it bad the least bit, but in comparison to the anime of today of course it looks a bit worse. I think this shouldn't discourage anyone to watch it.Personally what I loved most about this was the character staff and the story. I don't have any disability but there were several things in it that I could connect with, and I'm sure many of you would have a lot too.This was the first anime that I literally sobbed because of. I just couldn't hold my tears back.;Recommended

0;Ryoujoku no Machi: Kyouen no Ceremony;nicoduches;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nicoduches;7;*Warning: This is a hentai title review. It features graphic language.Out of all the low budget hentai titles out there, City of Sin is what you’d call a hidden gem. Its narrative, unconventional for an H title, and the great quality of its soundtrack make it an interesting, underappreciated title.STORY: 7/10City of Sin depicts the harsh reality of a medieval era kingdom overthrown by an army of brutal, immoral men. This theme is suitable for a more mature audience and a certain amount of emotional detachment might be needed to fully appreciate it. Be warned that all of the women in this movie are treated cruelly and raped. This dark content, however, artfully illustrates the theme, and never does the violence feel gratuitous or presented merely for shock value. The story also features a few mild twists throughout the movie and never was I bored with the events presented.The first scene, a shot of the evil king’s castle under a stormy sky, immediately draws you in and sets the tone. The story follows Princess Beatrice as she is forced to marry a neighboring king to stop the war. The immoral, intimidating, fat king, whose ultimate goal is to generate an army of strong soldiers, orders his men to rape every woman in the kingdom for procreation, because being without child in his country is against the law. There is a good amount of dark humor in the dialogs and scenes although some of us might believe it clashes with the brutal nature of the plot. I felt that the story progressed a little too fast and that character development wasn’t given proper time, but this ultimately added to the feeling of urgency and danger Princess Beatrice must have went through trying to adapt to her new reality.ART: 5/10City of Sin’s biggest flaw is its unbalanced quality.For a 2001 release, character art is below average and feels sketchy, yet the shading is at times fairly good and the uncensored, although not entirely realistic genitals are drawn with more detail than many other H titles. Background art is sometimes quite detailed and shows realistic textures, and sometimes much simpler and forgettable.The animation quality is rich, featuring different facial expressions and movements, but the amount and fluidity of the frames in motion is only average.SOUND: 8/10One of the most remarkable features of City of Sin is its soundtrack, which is definitely among the best ones I’ve heard in a hentai title. The very first short theme you hear sounds like it came out of a Batman flick, ominous brass setting the mood. Fanfares and powerful sound effects are heard during key moments, a few ambient, vocal themes nicely fit the different settings and other tracks portray the characters’ feelings during given scenes. Even the ending theme features beautiful movements and is fully orchestrated.Both the Japanese and English dubs are fine. The English version features a few better-written lines and at least one cheesy, hilarious voice, while the Japanese dub is more serious and better fits the characters’ emotions. Take your pick.CHARACTER: 5/10The female characters look a lot alike and have normal-sized breasts. Their bodies are slim and tight but a few shots also feature nice curves. The three noble women have blond hair that varies in length and shade.Princess Beatrice, the main character, is most notable for her wide variety of facial expressions during sex. The ones she makes in the second half of the movie can be quite sexy.Queen Vanessa is a little taller and has slightly bigger breasts than Beatrice, and Princess Kathleen is a little shorter and thinner, but otherwise look a lot like her.Beatrice also has two female servants, a dark-skinned redhead, Faye, and a black-haired girl, Adele. Other random women and masked soldiers take part in sex scenes as well and have no distinctive features or lines of dialog.ENJOYMENT: 6/10Sex sounds effects are a little unrealistic at times but are usually subtle. Despite being forced into sex most of the times, some of the female characters eventually unveil their lewd nature and take pleasure. Many scenes include a lot of secondary characters, either naked or lightly dressed, listening to their king atop the castle walls or having an orgy.If any of you can relate to the evil king, you might enjoy the fantasy of being an almighty ruler who can do as he pleases with his country and his people. Most scenes include rape and group sex. Personally I did not enjoy the scenes much in terms of H material because of their mediocre quality, but I appreciated how well they fitted in the theme and plot.There are 7 sex scenes and they feature:1: (2 servants) vaginal penetration, spit roast, cum inside, facial.2: (crowd) orgy, vaginal penetration, blowjob, spit roast, facial, piss, age difference (older men).3: (Beatrice, 2 servants) exhibitionism, piercing (no blood), blowjob, first time (a bit of blood), vaginal penetration, lifted position, doggie, cum inside.4: (Beatrice) pussy licking, doggie, cum inside.5: (Beatrice + crowd) spit roast, facial, cum inside, handjob, cum on lower body, throat fuck.6: (Beatrice, Vanessa, Kathleen) blowjob, threesome, breasts grab, vaginal penetration, penis licking, lifted pussy licking, cum inside, lifted position.7: (crowd) orgy, blowjob, pussy licking, vaginal penetration, spit roast, handjob (shown during scene 6).Most memorable moment: It is impossible to talk about any of the dark humor scenes without spoiling them, so take my word for it: some of these scenes are truly worth it.OVERALL: 7/10Funny fact, City of Sin is, in tone and plot, reminiscent of the well-known and highly acclaimed Berserk series, and its plot could very well fit in its universe. I’m not saying that Berserk lovers should all watch and enjoy City of Sin, but those who know Kentaro Miura’s work will notice the similarities. It is a dark, edgy, mature title definitely not for everyone. Despite its unbalanced quality it stands as one of the more unique and interesting hentai titles out there.Final words:“This is a message from God: Get on all fours!”Hilarious.;Recommended

1;Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;7;Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt is a 1995 film brought to us by our old friends at Studio Hibari, whom you may recall from their work on Kashimashi & Venus Versus Virus. So, how do these folks handle a children's film and is it going to be any better than their track record would indicate? Let's give it a shot and delve in.Story:Papadoll has gone missing. His smallest human, Meeko, is convinced that he's been kidnapped by aliens but her brother, Toriyasu, doesn't take her seriously. In fact, the little brat doesn't seem to care saying that Papadoll just lay about all day anyway. That's when Meeko notices a strange cat observing them. That night, three strange cats burst into their room, wanting to take Toriyasu away. Meeko insists on going along.The big flaw with the film on a narrative level is that it's paced pretty awkwardly. You get a long, kind of boring scene where the characters plan their next move intermixed with scenes of what the antagonists are doing and ending with an action sequence that's welcome, at first, but just drags after a while And the film is barely an hour and a quarter long so the way the scenes still manage to drag, even if just a bit, is kind of a big deal.On the positive side, the concept behind this is fairly creative. I also do like that it makes a big theme of Toriyasu being forced to come to terms with his own behaviour and how it's contributed to the problem. There aren't many works of children's media that demand that level of self-reflection.Characters:The characters vary a bit as well. Some of the dynamics come across as contrived and don't work very well. The whole conflict turned into a kind of creepily close respect between Toriyasu & ChuChu being the prime example. A lot of the side characters are also pretty one-note. However, I do have to give the film some credit. Toriyasu's character arc works quite well. The antagonist, Buburina, is pretty terrible but she's not just the purely evil villain you get in a lot of children's media. She does have redeeming qualities. She may not be at the level of a Ghibli villain, but it does give her some dimension.Art:The art also varies. One the negative side, the character designs don't look very good. That being said, a lot of the backgrounds are creative and interesting. The whole world of Banipal Witt looks like a drug-induced hallucination. It's almost like Hibari took visual inspiration from Apple Films' opus, Yellow Submarine. It's a very strange looking world, but one with a lot of atmosphere. The film's action scenes also work quite nicely.Sound:The cast is pretty decent. Hiroaki Hori, Sasaki Mirai & Hidaka Noriko all do quite well. Saegusa Shigeaki handles the music and it works nicely enough.Ho-yay:Don't expect any. To be fair, an emphasis on romance really wouldn't work for the film in general.Final Thoughts:Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt was actually pretty enjoyable. Yes, it could have been better, particularly in some areas. However, it's also creative and interesting enough in its own right. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Tomorrow I'll end this year's film festival week with a look at Mononoke Hime.;Recommended

After she spoke that out, he rapes her (more or less, she seems to enjoy it... blame her! :D) and takes some picture of her. Now who should keep his mouth shut, huh? =DAnyways. In that school studies our teachers sister or something like that and, since he is our good-looking pheromone tally-wally, he is not only up to listen to the song ""where 2 become 1"", no of course he also want's to exercise it. Will he able to do it? Who care... erm, sorry i mean: Who knows? ;)That's everything about Eisei Kyoiku. To be perfectly honest, the animation and art are not good or bad, no, they are Hentai standard, nothing to get excited about. The characters got no deepness at all and the story feels like they forced to give us a pretty good story. Well, if Eisei Kyoiku would have got more episodes then just one, it could have been a pretty good Hentai, because the possibilities for some background stuff for the characters and the story overall are definitly present. But since there is only 1 episode i give this stuff 3/10 Points. Nothing u have to see.That's my truth. And nothing but my truth.";Not Recommended
0;Ryokan Shirasagi;loplop;https://myanimelist.net/profile/loplop;9;Swallowtail Inn is a nice change of pace for what we are seeing with most Hentai these days. The 2 part series is extremely well drawn, there appears to be no reuse of parts of scenes, and all characters look fantastic. Even better is the fact that the OVA was created in a wide screen format, making it look even better. The heroine of the story is struggling to keep an Inn that she ran with her husband open, and she is willing to do what ever is necessary to keep it open. Kenji, a chef that had studied under the heroine's late husband comes back to help keep the inn in business and begins to train some of the staff on special features that the inn's cliental will enjoy. In addition, there are a couple of side plots at the same time that add to the story. For a change, even the music helps to add to the story and the atmosphere that it is trying to create. This is the type of Hentai titles that I wish we would see more of in the future. In my opinion, not everything has to be degrading to all parties involved unlike most Hentai titles that are being made today.;Recommended
0;Ryokan Shirasagi;mikefromireland;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mikefromireland;6;As far as it goes Swallowtail inn would not be one of my favourite anime. At first I thought that I would really like it because the plot sounded good but then I saw it. To be quite fair the animation and the artwork was pretty decent but certain scenes in the 2 episodes I felt did not fit in very well.The back plot, which involves Yuriko's husband dying and the business that she had to run was good but I did not feel that the current plot concerning the new man that she met was very well written. I think that it could have been done better like what happened in Rumbling Hearts (except in this one a guy's girlfriend falls into a coma and she dates another). I think that since Yuriko just met the man that she develops feelings for in this anime it would have been better for them to take their relationship slowly. I found that the way they grew to like each other was too sudden and it would have been better for them to go on a few dates and for the series to have more than 2 episodes.Other than that it was a pretty decent anime. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes quick love stories, you might enjoy it because it has its moments.;Mixed Feelings

I would definatley give this anime 16s+ or even 15s.The characters are alright, not much of the plot involves her man-puppet Pipi he is like the center of the shows humour for certain scenes and the rest deals with Kaguya the goddess who seems very friendly but she can be like a devil when she is manipulating the fabric of reality.I would reccomend this anime to anyone who is a fan of mature anime that do not go overboard.

0;Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai (2018);Confucius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Confucius;8;This OVA continues exactly where the 12 episode left off, in fact it might as well be renamed to episode 13. But this won't completely be the end of 我是江小白 (Wo Shi JIang Xiao Bai). There will be closure and the major questions unanswered are addressed in this OVA. I personally found the ending to be very satisfactory and bittersweet and it left me wanting for a bit more. Fortunately for those who feel the same way, there is an announcement that season 2 will come in November 2018. I have some qualms on how they want to take this, but I am assuming this time the new season will be free of mystery.The soundtracks and animation quality are completely the same as the series, no surprises there. Like the main series, the soundtracks are timed perfectly to hit you at the right moment to alleviate the emotional scenes. Also, the ending song will probably hit you twice as hard after this OVA because it did for me.You can't really say you completed Wo Shi JIang Xiao Bai's 1st season without watching this OVA, so I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a proper conclusion.

0;The Hakkenden: Shin Shou;explicit707;https://myanimelist.net/profile/explicit707;7;"This is the second part of this OVA series. This run was from 1993-1995. I am again assuming that the synopsis for the first part of this series has been read. These are the last 7 of the 13 episodes in this series.This part of the OVA series blurs the lines between reality and illusion even further than the first 6 episodes. Strange is the word, but you will see plenty of bloody battles, and a lot of the dark side of humanity. I want to also remind of the time period this is based in, we are talking the mid 1400's.The animation styles vary in a couple episodes, in fact I absolutely hated the animation in episode 10/13. I loved the episode as a psychosis snapping episode, but I barely made it through the episode due to the animation style. That episode aside, the rest is pretty much right in line with the first part of the series in animation and sound. It wasn't the best of the time period, and it was mediocre in these categories at best.The story however takes a turn towards the realm of very strange, and I really liked that about this story. It isn't your happy ""the good guys will triumph in glory"" type of story. In fact, you will most likely end this series asking ""what the heck did I just watch"" or you'll feel strangely at ease with the open feeling at the end. It really is a cerebral challenge, and that's what makes it good. The ending of the story ties you back to the beginning, which is necessary after the roller coaster ride they take you on through the story. I cannot say that they tie everything up in a pretty ribbon for you, in fact I had a similar feeling at the end of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Now I am not saying they are the same, but I am merely comparing to the emotional state I had as a viewer with the ending of both.This is different than the current norm, and that's what I liked. Keep these comments in mind if you want to check this series out. Lastly I will explain why I gave both runs of this OVA series a 7 overall. Quite simply I liked it, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. I like strange and different in my anime at times, and though I liked it, I didn't love it. It is worth watching once or twice, but it doesn't have high repeat value.";Recommended
0;Akiko;Venneh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Venneh;7;"Title: AkikoAnime: Akiko is a two episode OVA that was produced by Triple X Studios (known for their work on the My Sexual Harassment OVA) and directed by Kaoru Toyouka. It was released in Japan in July of 1996, and was bought Stateside in August of 2003 by Soft Cel Pictures (with such luminares as Kandy Kanal and Rod O'Steel on production).Story: The students at the prestigious Nobel Academy seem to be having uncontrollable sexual urges. After one female student spends the entire summer in her room masturbating, her father contacts the Central Genetic Research Institute to help. They send an undercover agent, code named Akiko, into the Academy to find out what's up. However, something far more sinister lurks beneath the school's exterior...Honestly, as set up for a porn OVA, the story's not that bad. There's some holes in the plot, and characterization isn't fully fleshed out, but really, it could be far, far worse. And, for the most part, the sex scenes have decent transition into them, and aren't all that over the top ridiculous. Plus, there's a good balance between porn scenes and plot. All in all, the story's not that bad, but could be better.Art: Typical 90s style; big hair, minimal nose, pretty decently animated in general. There's a distinct difference in quality between the normal scenes (which are pretty decently animated, but not the greatest) and anything involving sex and nudity (lovlingly rendered), but, again, given the focus of this OVA, this is not that surprising. It's not the greatest art, and it doesn't hold up well almost a decade later, but hey, it could be far worse.Music: Didn't really notice it, as it didn't stand out all that much.Seiyuu: Seiyuu for this did a pretty decent job, didn't sound ridiculous/exaggerated on the porn parts, all in all, pretty decent.Length: The OVA's at the perfect length; not overly long and ridiculous, but not short enough that it doesn't make sense.Overall: A pretty decent OVA that's a good balance between plot and porn, decently animated and voice acted, just the right length, and with music that doesn't stand out that much.

In fact, many times when I was watching the anime, I was more attracted to the location or the surroundings more than the characters themselves.Yes, the world of work is very beautiful and wonderful, especially before the last 10 episodes that turns the events into the world becomes more brutal and horrible than captivating with the beauty of its nature.And one of the most important factors for the aesthetics of the sites is drawing the backgrounds, without a doubt, as they were picturesque, and it may not be full of intense details, for example, like the backgrounds of Ghibli, Kazu, and others, but it has a special aesthetic, For example, the differences in the colors of the soil, herbs and rocks, which gave an aesthetic and realistic site, in addition to the flowers, animals and trees, whose drawing was also wonderful, And all these and many more managed to create an enchanting adventure experience in the wilds of AfricaIn addition to a wealth of information, although I had a desire for more and more, but in the end it is not a documentary!The soundtrack is good and varied and the most of it suitable to be used in the anime, as the funny music when Murphy is playing around, Or high-pitched music when dangerous events occur, Or jungle music that gave a great feeling when going into the jungle, But yes, it did not have a strong special touch in the jungle or had a touch of African music.;Recommended

0;Sprite: Between Two Worlds;The_Boogiepope;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The_Boogiepope;8;In the twenty or so years I have watched anime I have come across some rather unusual titles. But nothing and I mean nothing prepared me for Sprite: Between Two Worlds. A bargain bin title from the now defunct Central Park Media. I don't know what I was expecting from this title but what I discovered maybe pure gold.Lets not mince words here. Sprite or Manami & Nami Sprite is awful. It just maybe one of the worst things I have sat through, but unlike forgettable crap this has stuck with me since the moment I watched it. This DVD deserves a case study in how companies like CPM would license anything cheap regardless of it's value or quality in the late 90s and early 00s. Popping this disc in will do more to explain why the anime bubble popped about a decade back then anything else you will read online.The story is about as simple as it gets. Main character Tooru moves in with his cousin Manami because his mother is ill (Personally, I felt his mother was just sick of his shit). The only real twist on this formulaic plot is that Manami has a split personality named...get this Nami. And the split personality angle is played about as elegant as a pregnant cow being used as a wrecking ball. The front of the DVD includes a quote to a review that states 'The Anime Equivalent of Sybil'. Which excuse my lack of memory for the 1976 made for TV film but I don't remember that story being about a teenage girl with a slutty split personality. And yes Nami is just a loud slutty alter ego. Nothing more. While I don't want to spoil how Nami came about existing just know that you'll smack yourself in the forehead by the time the anime concludes.Sprite was an OVA series which would lead you to assume that the art would fair better then say a TV series. Well you would be DEAD wrong. The corner cutting in animation is almost impossible to ignore. One of the most noticeable oddities is that Manami's feet were drawn with no toes. In fact they were all fused together like the artist forgot to draw lines to separate them. Then the team went to color and just didn't give a shit. And this isn't just from a distance. There are several close up shots were they are the focus point. The second episode fairs better in terms of quality but by that time the damage is done.I know you want to ask me how the English dub is. And I can say it's one of the worst CPM has provided. I never got their practice of finding nobodies to fill in their bargain bin titles. If you weren't going to put any work into the dub why not just make it a subtitle only release? But then again common sense would have done wonders for the company. Case in point is the blatant dialog changes. See during my golden age of anime watching there seemed to be a paranoia about none adult characters (read: high school or younger) engaging in possible sexual acts. Which if you haven't been living under a rock is the general age of most protagonist. Fearing a lawsuit or a mob of angry parents companies would either put warning labels or lie about the ages. The issue with that one is that it isn't subtle. Two episodes the word 'college' is uttered enough that you could make a killer drinking game from it. These are high school students and everyone knows it. Saying they are in college doesn't change that.The quality of the audio is what you expect from a VHS to DVD transfer. The Japanese dub is fair but let's face it if you are in the mood for trash the English dub is the only way. You also may have noted the score of 2 for the audio instead of a 1. This has nothing to do with the dub but instead has to do with a song played during the anime. This song is a complete rip off of the theme from Top Gun. Not Danger Zone from Kenny Loggins, but the 'Top Gun Anthem' itself. It is so obviously stolen it blew me away. And it's a highlight trying to find it once you know about it.The less I say about the main cast the better. There isn't a single likeable person in the bunch. Tooru being the worst of them all. On the first night our main character masturbates to the thought of his cousins breasts. So if you find that to be a redeeming quality you may like him better then I did.Despite my literal page worth of complaints I couldn't stop watching this. It's a train wreck, a shameless porn filled wreck. Oh did I not mention it becomes a porn at the end? Yeah the sexual content ramps to 11 with little warning it would become such. While it isn't hardcore you'll excuse me if I wasn't shocked by the semen run down Manami's mouth. In fact the DVD tells you this is a 16+ rated anime. However, the first warning that pops up on the movie is an 18+ rating. Which I completely ignored my first time through. Because let's face it who doesn't skip those? It seems that the only thing this anime got right with split personality was the DVD box.If you have a group of like-minded friends this is a blast. The less you tell them about the ending the better because the look of confusion on their face will be priceless. This DVD is pretty damn cheap and the entertainment value is there if you are in the mindset. Just make sure someone brings the alcohol.;Recommended
0;Sprite: Between Two Worlds;Kalendraf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kalendraf;4;"This is a review of the DVD version of ""Sprite: Between Two Worlds"" released by U.S. Manga Corps in 2001. It was viewed with English voice overs and English sub-titles.""Sprite: Between Two Worlds"" mainly falls into the category of romance anime with a significant number of ecchi scenes along the way, and also incorporates elements of comedy and drama with some psychological undertones.Parental Warning:This is not for children. While there is nothing explicit shown in ""Sprite"", it contains multiple sex scenes, or implied ones. There is also a significant amount of nudity, though no genitalia is shown. Oddly, the age on the box indicated 16 and up, but the warnings included with the video state it is for 18 and up.Story: 4/10The main tale focuses on Toru and his interactions with Manami and Nami who are actually two different personalities of the same girl. While not expanded upon, it also turns out that Toru and Manami/Nami are apparently related, likely making them at least distant cousins if not more closely related. The mother of Manami/Nami appears in a few scenes, but doesn't play much of a role. Some of their classmates appear in multiple scenes, often serving roles as rivals or alternate interests of affection. However, the bulk of the scenes involve Toru and Manami/Nami and how they deal with the split personality issue.The fundamental difference is that one personality is timid and shy and the other is confident and out-going. However, this confidence and resulting out-going attitude that Nami possesses has could also be viewed as a simple maturity aspect of Manami. In other words, Nami could just represent an older, more mature version of Manami. A story with Toru witnessing and perhaps even facilitating this gradual shift between a once-timid girl to the eventual confident version may have been an interesting coming-of-age tale.The split personality condition could have also been covered in a number of ways such as a full-blown comedy focusing on the humorous situations it leads to for Manami/Nami. Or it could have been a full-blown drama that explored the tension that builds between Toru and Manami/Nami. Or it could be an ecchi romance that turns a simple boy-girl relationship into some sort of psycho-sexual menage-a-trois. At times, ""Sprite"" seems to be attempting to be any one of these, yet it never manages to fully deliver on any of them.Characters: 3/10Toru is your typical horny adolescent boy. He seems rather stereotyped and there is not much character development for him. Manami/Nami is the most interesting character in the show and she is the only one that really undergoes any notable character development. The mother has little depth, and the fact she seems completely unconcerned or completely oblivious to the romantic relationship between Toru and Manami seems unrealistic for a parent. Meanwhile, all of the fellow high school students seem to be two-dimensional.Art / Animation: 5/10This seems roughly on par for a 1997 OVA. There's nothing all that good or bad about the quality of the animation or character models. The character physiques seem more realistic than those found in some other anime, but their faces look a bit outdated by today's standards.Sound / Voice: 4/10The sound is average. There's nothing all that memorable about the soundtrack or background that stands out.The english voice actor for Toru was poor, but the voice actresses for Manami/Nami and her mother were acceptable. The other students were ok.As this disk offered the chance to both listen to English and see English subtitles simultaneously, I found it interesting that the two often differ. Typically, it was only a couple words change, but sometimes and entire phrase was omitted or changed.Enjoyment: 4/10There are a few memorable scenes in the show, but they are few and far between. From a comedic standpoint, some of the humor is rather juvenile, though I chuckled at a couple of the ""nosebleed"" moments which involved Nami sans panties. From a dramatic stand-point, the situations and emotions the characters felt never seemed strong enough to pull me in. From a romance standpoint, it never seemed heartfelt. Some of the nudity and sex scenes seemed overly gratuitous, and likely could have been left out entirely.Final Verdict: 4/10""Sprite: Between Two Worlds"" had the opportunity to explore the issue of split personality in a number of ways. Had it focused on a single approach, such as just drama or comedy, it may have achieved a much stronger delivery. Instead, the anime seems to suffer from its own multiple personality syndrome, never quite sure if it's a comedy, drama, romance, or something else. Unfortunately, the end result is less than the sum of its schizophrenic parts, and the final work misses the mark, never reaching its full potential.";Not Recommended

0;Dinghai Fusheng Lu;banichan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/banichan;7;"A summary of my thoughts:- The things that really made this series work were the interesting storyline, worldbuilding, and a selection of the major characters. The main character was quite charming if oblivious, Xiang Shu's irritation was fun to watch, and the wolf and deer were intriguing.- Out of all the danmei series I've watched recently, this one in particular was obviously lower budget. There were a lot of production issues like lower-quality CG art and poorly-handled storyboarding and novel-to-screen conversion problems.- I will say that Legend of Exorcist, to which this is a prequel of sorts, has similar storyboarding issues, so I suspect a small part of the problem may be the author's writing style not being in distinct movie-able ""scenes"".- I haven't read the novel and have found that I enjoy series more this way. I didn't have any issues with the adaptation and am actually interested in knowing more about everything.Overall, not the best danmei series of the lot, but I still enjoyed following the story.

Of course, Shu Xiang is not up for the challenge at first. It doesn't take long, though, for him to answer the call (and take care of Chen). Chen also has a ticking time bomb over him which also adds impetus to the story\star crossed lovers.This anime gets the pacing right: with the exception of the weird first fifteen minutes, every episode furthered the storyline perfectly. There really isn't 10 episodes of laying down the backstory and introducing the characters.The CG art\animation is top notch. Full stop. One of the COOL things they do is 1) during the end credits they alternate between video of an artist actually qouaching\watercoloring in the storyboard or 2) showing you...um...landscape scenes from an important plot point. The cut scenes are either elements of period\historical items that were utilized in the show or storyboarding artwork for individual items used in the show.How cool is that?The last two episodes were, in a word, *heartbreak.* Like...some of the saddest plot lines I've seen to date in *any* anime (and I'm a Tang San\Wu fan for life\BTTH gazebo in the rain storm with Dad fan). They were total misdirects and I wanted to see more! Unfortunately, the machine translation for the webnovel is so horrific that it's kinda hard to pick up where this season left off.So, here's the bad news: As good as this anime was, and as great as it's the prequel to Tianbao Fuyao Lu, it looks like it's on hiatus. What does that mean? No clue. Did COVID interrupt it? No clue.I'd like to think that, because this anime wasn't on *one* list and wasn't promoted, perhaps people just didn't know about it? The studio didn't think it was worthwhile to continue?Lesson learned: if you see something worthwhile that has been left off of everyone's radar, say something! :). Maybe if enough people watch this Season the studio may pick it back up?I really, really hope so.You should check this one out.;Recommended

0;Hanare Toride no Yonna;Archaeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Archaeon;5;"Over the years animation has progressed from the basic ""onion skin"" technique through to cel shaded CG, so it's only natural that the next step would be full 3D animation. It's thanks to companies like Square-Enix, Pixar, Dreamworks, Blue Sky, Toei, and a whole heap of other studios, that 3D animation has evolved rapidly since the turn of the millenium, and while the presence of such movies may still be a rarity in anime, there are some that appear from time to time.It's just unfortunate that most of them aren't really all that good.Hanare Toride no Yonna is one of those rare, fully 3D animated movies that, like CENCOROLL and Hoshi no Koe, is almost completely the work of one man (aside from the music andthe voice acting). Conceived, written, directed and animated by Takeuchi Kengo, the movie received mixed reviews upon it's release in April 2006.The movie is about two siblings who live in a remote castle - Stan and Yonna. Both possesses certain abilities that have caused them to be driven from their original home, and because of the unjust cruelty they have both faced, Stan has become fiercely protective of his younger sister. However, the government believe that Yonna in particular would be a useful asset to them, and send two agents to ""liberate"" her.One of the problems I've found with ""one man shows"" (i.e. made by one person), is that the plot is often lacking in certain areas, and it's in this area that Yonna really fails to deliver. The main problem is that the story never really covers anything about the powers that Stan and Yonna possess, nor does it explain how they may be useful to the government. In addition to that, the plot has an aimless quality, as if the writer couldn't make up his mind where he wanted the story to go.Another problem with the plot is the pacing of the story. Yonna is very slow at times, but can switch gears in an instant, and it's this ""stopping and starting"" of the plot that can really throw the viewer off, especially given the lack of detail in the story.That said, Yonna does look good - on paper anyway. The art and animation has a very Final Fantasy feel to it, especially the character designs. The characters are expressive enough, but have a decidedly odd look about them which makes them look not quite human. While this is acceptable because of the fantasy setting, the pixie-like quality of the characters makes some scenes difficult to take seriously. Character animation is good for the most part, however there are quite a few occasions where the movements look strange, especially during action sequences, while other bits of animation can appear jerky or unreal.Yonna's biggest plus is the artwork. The castle and surrounding countryside is very well rendered and detailed, with great use of colours, tones and shades, which is more than can be said about the interior of the castle. Visually, Yonna's biggest problem is lighting, and this is especially noticeable in the confines of the castle.Pretty much the only part of the movie not made directly by Takeuchi is sound. The voice acting isn't bad, however the seiyuu are decidedly wooden in their delivery, something which is especially noticeable during the more emotional moments. The music used throughout the movie is actually rather good. Okazawa Toshio, who also worked on the music for 5cm Per Second and The Place Promised in our Early Days, has done a fine job with the score for Yonna. The only problem is that the music is sometimes at odds with the on-screen action, something which is mainly due to poor choreography rather than Okazawa's musical ability.The single biggest problem with the movie though, is the characters. As this is only a 33 minute ""movie"", there is understandably going to be a lack of development, however this could have been offset by making the characters more interesting, more real, more approachable. Unfortunately the movie suffers from poor characterisation, and because of this the characters are one dimensional and uninteresting.To be completely honest, this is a show that can only really be recommended to fans of 3D animation, as there's very little else to it aside from that. A lot can be forgiven given that this is the work of one man, however even this fact can't lift Yonna out of the realms of mediocrity. The audience has no reason to sympathise with either Yonna or Stan, especially as there's very little history given about them, and this plays a major part in whether one likes the movie or not.This isn't a bad effort though, and the biggest positive about Hanare Toride no Yonna is that it's another example of one man animation at work, and no matter how mediocre the movie may be, it gets a lot of kudos for that reason.And now I'm off to watch a fifty foot woman fight aliens :)";Mixed Feelings
0;Hanare Toride no Yonna;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;3;Hanare Toride no Yonna is a CGI film from CoMix Wave Films. You may remember them from Hoshi wo ou Kodomo & Byousoku 5 Centimeter. This film was released in 2006. So, how does it hold up compared to the other CoMix Wave Films productions I've seen? Let's check it out and see.Story:We open with a brother and sister going about their daily lives. Then a strange boy comes by, sees the sister and scarpers. We cut to an indeterminate amount of time later when the siblings are living together in a fortress without anyone else nearby and a young man is trying to break in and it might seem like I'm skipping crucial plot details, but that's exactly how the information is presented to us.Therein lies the first major flaw of the series. The story is all over the place. While you do eventually gather why the siblings are on their own, it gets thrown at you far later than it should be and in a stilted exposition dump. Which is a general problem with the dialogue, actually. Nothing sounds natural. The pacing is also pretty bad with the story rushing through things that need more time and wasting time on random scenes where Yonna interacts with little imps.Characters:The biggest issue with the characters in this film is that their motivations are vague, ill-defined and don't really make that much sense. Stan's motivation seems to be wanting what's best for his sister, which would make sense, but he also doesn't seem to give a shit what she thinks or has to say. Yonna has a vague “wanting more” motivation but she somehow needs someone else to taker her away from solitude instead of just talking to her brother. Garuda starts out doing a mission but decides to help Yonna for no adequately explored reason. So, ultimately, you get motivations that are both one-dimensional and nonsensical.Art:The art in this looks pretty bad. It's not the first time I've reviewed something with bad CGI animation and I doubt it'll be the last. The big issues are with the movements, which look janky and awkward and with the facial expressions, which largely look like “dull surprise.”Sound:The acting and music aren't bad. They aren't good, but there's also not a lot that's wrong with them. About the worst I can say is that Mitsuhashi Kanako & Kenn both under-act a bit.Ho-yay:There isn't much in terms of romance at all.Final Thoughts:Hanare Toride no Yonna is a pretty bad film. The story is nonsense. The characters don't have anything to them. The artwork looks terrible and the sound is weak. That being said, it isn't one of the worst things I've ever reviewed. It's mainly just kind of stupid and boring. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Tomorrow I'll continue film festival week with Totsuzen! Neko no Kuni Banipal Witt.;Not Recommended
1;Hanare Toride no Yonna;rebmastu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rebmastu;3;"Half an hour I've never regretted wasting more in my life.Spoilers included, because seriously? Don't waste your time.Writing/storyKid and older brother are ostracized because they apparently have magic powers. A span of time passes, and some other kid comes to free the sister. Why? No freakin clue. That's what he was told to do, and by god, this kid takes his role as lacky seriously.We know this kid is sent to free the girl from the tower (and why was a kid sent to free the princess in the tower, so to speak?), but aside from a vaguely worded throwaway comment from a throwaway character, there's no indication of their intentions whatsoever. Somewhere near the end, the boy quips that this monarchy, or whoever's employ he's under will have his head for what he'd done, but given that we know he was told to ""Get her out of the tower,"" which he DID, the viewer is left wondering why he'd be wanted for capture after fulfilling his mission.I also question using the older brother as the villain. I got more of a protective vibe from him in the beginning, which contrasted sharply with his presentation later. Shared none of the same traits, and for that, they might as well have used some ogre or something with no personality at all.Rating:3We got the bare bones, I guess. Pretty cookie-cutter.MusicThey recycled what felt like the same five tracks over and over again which would have been fine had the score held any merit of worth to begin with. In particular, one of the tracks sounded like it was ripped straight from a Final Fantasy battle sequence, which would have worked fine had it been in a video game to begin with, but it just felt out of place.Score: 3Music seemed design to annoy or elicit as many eye-rolling melodramatic moments as possible.ArtCharacter designs weren't endearing, and the quality of the CG itself was low. The girl chooses one point in the story to summon a particularly demonic creature while she's moping around in her room, which struck me as odd, not to mention out of place considering the otherwise almost childish setting and characters.Score: 3Yeah, I'm sure it took a long time but dayum. Well.. The hair looked nice. And the characters did too, as long as they weren't talking.EnjoymentIf you keep looking at the timer every thirty seconds, you're not enjoying yourself.Score: Make it END, GODIn the end, maybe it would have done fine as a video game, but otherwise I highly reccomend steering clear. I didn't enjoy it in the least.Overall: 3, and that's being generous.";Not Recommended

0;Kiratto Pri☆chan Season 2;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;8;Kiratto pri chan is an ugly duckling of an anime. Season 1 was packed with a lot of potential and a lot of insufficiencies. It was a series filled with interesting artistic choices and strange things to love about it, but it was marred by a sludgy stream of mediocrities. I think a lot of people have had that same experience of watching a fifty episode kids show, loving a lot about it, but ultimately giving it a 6 or a 7 because it had 30 episodes of bullshit holding it down. What a shock was it to me then, when, for a brief period in time, about half a year of airing, this show didn’t just deliver on its potential, it spectacularly over delivered. For a brief period of time it was one of the best anime airing on TV, with me looking forward to it every week more than anything else, and for a brief period in time, this ugly duckling spread its wings and flew off, a beautiful swan.I am of course being over dramatic, as I was in my review of season 1, but I’m just so pleasantly surprised that the underdog I had almost jokingly been rooting for really did overcome the Chad Aikatsu. This season was an improvement to season 1 in pretty much every way, too. It’s not just that the central stretch of episodes was so solid, even the mediocrities have become less pronounced. Though there is still one tiny thing that this season doesn’t do as well as the first one. But we’ll get into that.To imagine what makes season 2 so great, you first have to imagine what makes the best parts of the show in general so great. Famously, pri chan and its predecessors have always had much lower production qualities than its rival Aikatsu. Moreover, Aikatsu is noteworthy for taking a much more serious approach to its idol activities. Though I can’t speak about its predecessors, pri chan is a lot less concerned about making sense, and a lot more about simply being fun. Whereas Aikatsu puts a lot of strain on the fact that being an idol is a lot of hard work, Pri chan forgoes all that ‘hard work’ crap and goes straight to the fun parts. Because Aikatsu is much more tightly written, the overall quality of episodic episodes is much higher. Pri chan has to hustle every episode to be engaging and, in season one, failed at that quite often. But there were all these eccentricities that kept me watching: Anna and Emo constantly bitching at each other, Anna’s maid sometimes having superpowers, Rinka’s pathetic brother being dragged around by Meganee-san, the leader of one of the group’s fan clubs being an 8 foot tall middleschooler, and who can forget about Meru Meru’s spastic antics and crazy inventions. Just now I opened a random episode of season one, scrolled through it a bit and landed on a scene where Emo and Anna were leading a tug of war battle between their fan-groups and when Mirai tells Anna to go talk to Sara, Anna has Mirai take her place at the rope, at which point Emo’s team start yelling at her that she’s a traitor and that they knew all along that she was on their side and Mirai is like: “You’ve got it all wrong!”, with this cute, dopey facial expression. Random moments like that, that come out of nowhere, always get me smiling from ear to ear and are what kept me watching the show, despite me recognizing its insufficiencies.Other than that, Pri chan has a lot of random interesting design choices. A lot of side characters have weird out-there designs, like the aforementioned 8 foot tall middleschooler, Anna’s petite dad, reminiscent of the dad in Minky Momo and Anna’s maid who has gigantic eyes, but no irises. There’s lots of side characters that have these weird character designs, and I absolutely love it. Of course I want to see weird, creative character designs in a funny and eccentric show like this! Why do you even have to ask? The designs of the main characters are a lot more ‘normal’, but they’re also unlike any other anime and very solid. You can definitely tell that the meltic star girls are a lot better designed than the main girls, likely because the main girls need to be more generic and relatable. Their designs have grown on me considerably, though. Somewhere along season two I grew a much greater appreciation for the character designs and the design of the show as a whole. I don’t know if that is just me or the show or what, but I’ve been enjoying the main characters a lot more this season.I also love how the rest of the show looks. A lot of the show will look somewhat generic, with very normal locations with very normal looking background characters, but sometimes you’ll see weird looking side characters or interestingly designed locations. The kirajuku square, where the pri chan studio, or whatever it is, where Meganee works, is located, is always a great location. However my favourite has to be Sara’s house, which is this weird round house with a flat roof, sorta resembling an old mill house you see in the countryside, but with the mill taken off and equally broad near the top. This house is located in the middle of the suburbs, surrounded by properties with totally normal looking houses on them, and every time I see it I’m absolutely delighted. Aikatsu has all of these well crafted locations and well designed characters and is very consistent with that, but pri chan, usually much more generic, can totally get one over on The Chad whenever it feels like it. And that shows what this show misses: Consistency.Because of that, I was very surprised to see that, starting just under a third of the way through the season, the show suddenly becomes consistent. Every single episode until the last ten is at least merely good and many of them are great. It was in the early twenties of episodes I noticed how every episode I had recently watched of the show had been a banger and as I continued to watch the episodes as they got translated, I was surprised to see how every single one of them continued the streak. I started looking forward to every new episode more than anything else. It truly was one of the best shows airing during that time. And that was all because it took what made Pri chan so great for me and made it most of the episode, instead of just the spice on top of an otherwise average episodic episode.To help you understand what makes these episodes so fun to watch for me, I’ll briefly go over part of an episode of the show. This is what happens in that episode:Daia-chan gives her introOPAnno and Emo are on the beach of a deserted island, dressed in leavesEmo says this is karma for Anna being a bitchAfter Emo askes, Anna says they can’t contact anyone, because they can’t get a signalFlashback to everyone on a massive cruise shipAnna and Emo are scoffing at each other and everyone’s concerned, because they still haven’t settled their argumentFlashback to Meganee excitedly telling them to go to this resort for a promotional event(to make her money)Maria states that it would be cute if the two of them would cutely make upAnna’s maid presses a giant doom buttonThe gigantic cruise ship just splits in two and Emo and Anna are separated from the restMaria surmises that the manner in which the ship is splitting in two is very cuteBack to the deserted island, Emo calls Anna’s ship junk and they fightEmo heads into the forest and Anna follows herEmo gets mad about Anna following her and Anna almost lets out that she’s concerned about her and blushes. God these girls are cute.Montage of Anna and Emo having dangerous adventures in the forest and getting chased by animals and almost drowning and fallingThey come across some ruins and they both simultaneously say that some giant stone monkey head looks like the other.At this point we get to the scene where it turns out that this was all done on purpose to help these two make up. This is six minutes into the episode, four if you don’t count the op and other stuff, and the whole episode has been packed with stuff happening. There was lots of fun dialogue, some cute scenes with Emo and Anna secretly liking each other and two really crazy and funny moments. And the setting for the episode is really unique too with these weird Aztec/Easter island looking ruins on this deserted island. This episode then ramps up with the two of them eventually making up and deciding to do a song together, at which point they decide to make a raft to get off the island. This is of course bad because they get immediately attacked by sharks and Anna’s maid, who is shown to be on the other side of the island, comes falling from the air, presumably jumping from miles away, to kick the shark’s asses. The last bit of the episode is a bit slower and the dialogue is a bit less substantial, but regardless, this episode remains one of my favourites of the show because there’s just so much in it. In season 1 of Pri chan you don’t get a lot of episodes that are this packed with good stuff. This episode really shows that when Pri chan delivers, it’s an amazing show. God I hope season 3 is like this too.It’s not just this central stretch of episodes, even the rest of the show is a bit better than the last season. There aren’t any episodes in this season that are as horrible generic as the worst episodes of season 1. Moreover, the contest episodes, which I usually disliked, were absent, which was coincidentally also true for the seconds season of aikatsu friends. Because Maria and Suzu were there, there were just a lot fewer moments where the three main girls were on their own and as a result there was a lot less room for any episode to be too generic. You can’t be that bored when Maria is pasting stickers all over everyone as a reward for their cuteness.Speaking of her, the two new idols, Maria and Suzu are great. I was so afraid that Maria’s spiel would get tiring, but it never did, and there were some real good laughs to be had from it too. Suzu, who wants to be a cool dancer, is adorable, just as Maria says and the two of them have incredible chemistry together. Then there are the characters of Dia and Nijonosaki-san, who are the driving force behind the overall plot of the season, which culminates in the final ten episode arc, which is where this season, sadly, drops the ball again. There are a couple of great episodes in the last stretch, but for the most part, I find Daia and Nijinosaki’s episodes a lot less engaging. Her awkwardness doesn’t go too well with the eccentricities of the show, so when an episode is focused on her, it tends to be a lot less funny. She has a bit of a character arc throughout the season and some of it is very good, but it’s never quite enough to carry a whole episode.Overall, this season of Pri chan does a lot better of a job at delivering on the potential of the series, but sadly it flops a bit again near the end. I hope season 3 gets back on its feet and becomes the best season of the show by far. I have my doubts that that will happen though, but I’m sure it will at least be better than season 1. Some people actually liked season 1 better than 2, though. It’s clear that many people get something completely different out of pri chan than I did, but that’s okay. This is all just how I feel about the show and what makes it great. The show that was the underdog between two pretty good kid shows spread its wings and showed itself to be more brilliant than I could have ever expected. Season 1 doesn’t stand up to any season of Aikatsu, but season 2 crushes them all under foot. Of course I’m not talking about the Chad Precure, because Healin’ good Precure isn’t even the best Precure series airing right now. For as good as it is, Mewkledreamy has completely eclipsed it. Anyways. Just as I rooted for Season 1 as the ultimate underdog of anime, Season 2 turned out to be the ultimate ugly duckling of anime that, against all opposition, became a beautiful swan, completely defying all expectations.That is what I would say of course, if this season had delivered on the best part of the show. Why is there so little Meru Meru in this season? She was the best part of season 1 and now she’s barely there. Unacceptable! 2/10;Recommended

It's a predictable underdog story as a team of cute but underpowered girls go against the odds (and two of the odder ladies at that). Lots of training.

0;Jokuana;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;4;Tags: Idol, Old Men, Rape, Urination, YuriCensorship: NoneJokuana (or 'Horney Ladies in the News' as it is marketed in English) is a hentai series that focuses on a young man named Kazuya Mano and his relationships with the women he works with at a television studio. Kazuya uses his sexual powers to manipulate his female co-workers and move up in his career.Ok, so the story is fairly lame and is pretty much Kazuya sweet talking, conning and raping his way through four of the women he works with. Looking to advance in his career he is able to manipulate the women he sleeps with so that things happen to eventually get him promoted. Along the way we have a lesbian love affair and some nasty sex with the old guy that runs the studio. Kazuya is the typical hentai male in that when he sleeps with a woman she almost instantly climaxes and of course is willing to do his bidding.The animation is not bad, but its not great either. I honestly did not care for the artwork and the character models, with the exception of Mayu, were not all that appealing. The hentai content was very vanilla and really didn't start any sparks. Overall the quality was alright, but nothing worth noting. This series has been licensed outside of Japan and thus comes blissfully uncensored and has an English dub for those of you who would rather not read your hentai.In conclusion, this is a fairly mediocre hentai title that probably would have been better if the animators had a little more imagination. Feel free to skip over it if you want to, or if you just have to see everything then this one will not rot your brains too much.;Not Recommended
0;Wan Jie Fa Shen;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;5;I was looking for a show to replace Yao Shen Ji (Tale of Demons and Gods) as a brainless revenge fantasy cultivation genre with a little bit of a school life and team work element. The setup between these two shows are similar: the protagonist is a super powerful cultivator from another time that somehow finds himself reincarnated in the past, where he must try to prevent the downfall of the world as he knows it. But in the mean time, they're high school students, and have to deal with all the high school anime tropes. In Yao Shen Ji, the protagonist enlists a small group of students of low economic class and helps them discover their true abilities, and that camaraderie was by far the best aspect of that show. In retrospect, Wu Shang Shen Di (Supreme God Emperor) has some of that.But while the protagonist of this show, Wan Jie Fa Shen (Magician God of Ten Thousand Realms) also attracts a small group of allies, it's treatment of their camaraderie is much more cliche. Instead of devising training regimes together, Ye Xuan just has a roommate sidekick as comedic relief, and a number of groupies in his potential harem. He'll give them pointers from time to time, but more so in a cocky way, just because he can, because he knows everything about medicine and alchemy, and he comes from a future where the understanding of magic is far more advanced. There are the standard cultivation cliches, like telling someone their exact pains and offering them a recipe, or answering all the alchemy questions and easily passing the exams, or concocting pills that no one else knows about to help train super fast. To be fair, these are staples of the run of the mill cultivation genre, and Yao Shen Ji has them as well. But Wan Jie Fa Shen is only these things, and barely anything else.That might have been buoyed by some fancy fight scenes, but the visuals are decidedly low budget, with fights often playing out like shounen cliches, like Dragon Ball Z, where people will punch each other in the fists like a game of bloody knuckles, and the weaker person falls back, somehow injuring their lungs and coughs blood.With that said, at least in the first half of it, the plot pacing goes along quite smoothly, and if you're a fan of this genre, it isn't that bad to watch over some food. It isn't too egregious in damsel in distress tropes, which I hate (shows like Wan Jie Du Zun and Xing Wu Shen Jue are replete with them). The underdog revenge strucure is quite ridiculous as usual, but it doesn't contrivedly find a way to maximize your anger at every given opportunity like Wu Shen Zhu Zai (Martial Master). It's smooth and passable.It just isn't good.After the school arc, there's the stereotypical training excursion in the mountain to kill beasts arc, where of course, there's the stereotypical perfect opportunity to sabotage the protagonist subplot. I found this part much less enjoyable. Practically every cultivation show has this exact same plot point, sometimes more than once in the same show. I guess it's the execution that matters, and in this case the potential just isn't there. Watch it if you're a fan of the genre, but don't get your hopes up.;Mixed Feelings
1;Wan Jie Fa Shen;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;6;Wan Jie Fa Shen ReviewGod of Ten thousand realms is a reincarnated-cultivation donghua about a prestigious Wizard/God who succumbs to the fate of an asteroid in his previous life, where being a mage is rare due to cultivation resource exhaustion. He is reincarnated 3000 years into the past to Ye Xuan, a trash magician character of Sith Magic academy. As all reincarnation-cultivation manhua/donghua, his fate is to regain power at a fast rate and prevent tragedies that follow in the future. Along the road of his cultivation, Ye Xuan meets several characters in which he assists in cultivation and enlightenment thus gathering his allies.This donghua would have been more interesting if this first season didn't focus on small-fry characters like the Lin family and their grudge. Ye Xuan, who is more than capable of anything despite being realms lower than all his peers could have wiped the Lin Family from the map but it's decided that he lays low and endures the grudge which ends up being the main narrative of his first season. The arcs are expected of Chinese cultivation but it would have been more entertaining watching MC fight than watching side characters fight and fail, the story also has a lot of running scenes which uses a lot of the screen time ( can be skipped easily for entertainment )The main character design is bad. His clothes are typical of eastern style MMORPG adventurer clothing. For a cultivation series, it would have been better to dress MC in a more fluent design which could have contributed to his character development arcs in the Magic guild's training room or when he went to refine his physical strength upon first visiting the Magic Academy's potion refinement facilities. The story lacks development which is why the characters feel empty and distant in terms of personality.The art/animation quality is substandard which suggests this is production is of lower value than most donghua. Every few episodes it feels like I'm watching a Mafia City advert with how the characters walk and talk. Even more so, when they turn around and walk away (such as the case when Ye Xuan first meets with the Manager and President of the Magic Guild) it feels like I'm watching a 2005 Barbie film with low poly models and bad character rigging.The Audio is another problem, for some reason the sound designers believe it's okay to use a stock sad music from Audio Library and play it every time the mood gets serious. It was very disturbing listening to the audio, even the door sounds are unnatural.In terms of enjoyment and overall opinion, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. However, the story is at least tolerable for me to complete it and rate it 6/10 overall. I look forward to a season 2 with hopes this series improves.;Mixed Feelings
0;Hitotsubu ni Kawaranu Ai wo Komete;Fujaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fujaku;7;Hitotsubu ni Kawaranu Ai wo Komete is a short two-minute anime that was made to celebrate the anniversary of a caramel. It's about a mom who one day is stressed out with her kid when a young strange girl grabs a caramel from a box and runs away with it. The mom chases her, and the rest is spoilers. Kind of.This is only two minutes long, and it's by Studio 4C, who does a lot of short anime like this that are either really bad or really good. I actually think this might be the first average work I've seen from them. I mean, it's a very simple story. I watched this in raw and yet I was able to understand most of it expect one or two words just from what I've picked up from watching other anime. The story is simple and easy to understand and gets everything out in only two minutes. The art is simple with generic character designs. The music is good but simple and likely the theme for this caramel company or something, the voice acting is average.This is about as average as you can get. No real high points but no flaws ever. It is engaging though and I enjoyed it. However, average is not everyone's cup of tea, and no one cares about these shorts anyway. I say watch this if you want to waste 2 minutes. Actually, just watch it. It's only two minutes and the story is average but yet charming. It's barely recommended.;Recommended
0;Kurutta Kyoutou: Danzai no Gakuen;VulgarLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VulgarLife;7;One off ero anime are usually hard-pressed to stick in your head but Kurutta Kyoutou did just that when I first ventured into the world of ero anime even whilst watching a poor quality rip with no subs. Revisiting this series further down the line when I’ve become more than a bit acquainted with the ero world it’s time to see if it holds up as well as it did back then.Noumori is the new vice principal of a school, taking over from previous vice principal who nearly caused a scandal with a pupil, Noumori vows to right the wrongs and ensure all students set an example, he will enforce his own increasingly perverse methods to bring order and control to the school.That is a simple setup but one that works well in enabling all sort of sordid acts to occur. The teachers engage in the perversion thanks to Noumoris lead and act with glee when the chance arises for them to put these acts into motion. Noumori is determined to enforce his strict policy through sexual means if necessary on all the students but this leads to some funny moments as well where he fantasizes, loses control or in general tries to establish new rules whilst being serious. It made me laugh on more than one occasion.Of the girls of note there are really three: the pink haired Misao, a purple haired delinquent (it actually does not give her name) and the green haired Touko. The latter is almost an authoritative figure because her uncle is the principal of the school and thus is immune to all the seedy antics. Misao is the girl who Noumori had his eyes on and even fantasizes about toying with her sexually whilst the purple haired girl acts like a delinquent and gets punished for it one more than one occasion. To be honest you aren’t going to remember their names, you’ll most likely just remember them from their hair colours which makes it distinct.This is only one episode long and it fills that time with a lot of content yet surprisingly manages to not feel bloated or rushed. The content segues naturally and the acts likewise with the lewd acts only escalating in perverseness. We have policies to see if the girls are wearing the correct panties, thorough body checks to make sure they are not hiding any unapproved items in school and that’s just to start with before the real fun begins.This escalates with the punishments handed out including the girls rubbing their crotches with towels, cleaning the gym floor whilst their asses are in the air and panties pulled down before being raped by members of staff in the finale. Of particular note is the purple haired girl receiving a unique punishment along with the others where the girls have to rub a towel between their legs on their crotch, she does it wrongly and is forced to remove her bloomers and use a towel with large knots to rub against her crotch and exposed panties causing more pain, pleasure and humiliation as the teacher even helps.The final scene is the only one throughout the episode where we really get actual sex scenes though, sure we had the video at the beginning and a fantasy scene but they amount to so little, everything else before hand is teasing, groping or some form thereof. I actually liked this as the humiliation they laid upon the girls was more to my liking and the final scene felt like a fitting end after the build up. If you aren’t into the humiliating aspect and just prefer more action then this may not be for you.Visually the shows hold up quite well. Whilst the animation may not be great and sometimes characters are off model there is little use of recycled animation and the art is appealing with a very colourful palette. The girls have different figures to cater for all viewer preferences and this works well to distinguish them.As a standalone episode this is a good, fun ride that is more comedic than most. It doesn’t break ground but does introduce memorable scenes involving the girls even with little actual sex. There are dozens of series that do it better but this is a nice introduction to the sub genres on display. On that basis it is certainly a recommend.;Recommended

Rather than sex scenes, sexual harrassment is more of the main thing shown here(altogether, sex scenes last around 3 min only). And thats it for the H. The way the vice-principal ""lays"" down the law could be amusing to some people since it''s completely ridiculous, but thats what makes it funny.If you like seeing tsundere/delinquent getting embarassed, there's a short scene here(it's too bad that they only harrass).

0;Shizuku;Moon_River;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Moon_River;8;Early animation in America started with Looney Toons and Disney. Disney had a series of early silent cartoons set to music where mickey mouse was a captain of a steam boat. This anime is exactly like that. Every form of animation has it's start, so this film is great to learn how vast different current anime is today. Just like comparing early Disney films to current ones.The anime's story may seem odd to some but it is in fact an abstract film. Simply meaning it has no dialogue and relys on imagery alone for the plot. It depicts what man will do at any costs for water through slap stick humor mimicking American cartoons style of that time period. Okay so that description alone may seem pretty boring but if you're an art enthusiast you may enjoy seeing a different form of story telling with no dialogue.So if you'd like to see one of the early forms of what anime originated from I encourage you to watch. But in all fair warning this film is more to be appreciated as history/ an art form rather than just for entertainment sake. Don't get me wrong it is pretty fun to watch but if you rather prefer anime with bishies and shojo .... this probably won't be your thing. But if you're like me and enjoy memorabilia from the 60's and 1950s cartoons this is a great.;Recommended

Again, it's 60's quality.Character: It's just a guy trying to drink a couple drops of water, he shows the range of emotion and personality a gag character in a looney toons would. What do you really expect in the way of character development in a 4 minute gag not intended for plot?Art: What you'd expect from an old 60's animation. A bit jumpy but it does the job.Enjoyment: 6/10 it was funny what else do you want?Just say N/A instead of seriously evaluating and scoring these aspects.edit: rant removed in short this was intended as a gag comedy but other reviewers decided to overly critique lack of plot/character development in a mere 4 minute slapstick comedy, best just give n/a for those aspects.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shizuku;ScarletCelestial;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ScarletCelestial;3;Story - 3The story is simple, it is of a man trying to gain a drop of water through comical slapstick. So, as to rate this, I must look to the comedy and think of how good it is and that is, of course, relative. In my opinion it is not that funny at all.On the flip side, it also shows his descent into madness as he runs out of water. How it is shown visually, I can comment that the pursuit is shown very well. However, I cannot fathom some of the occurrences that occur in what was seemingly a hallucination.Ergo, it was not that interesting in terms of story.Art - 5The lack of colour to show the bleak world (as well as it likely being a constraint of the medium of the time) is marvellous. The background is strangely surreal, fitting for the short. The character feels somewhat comical which aligns with the style.Sadly, it just feels so basic. Like there was not much effort induced in this piece. Ergo, a 5. A good concept, but not the best execution.Sound - 1It is a silent film, so has music running only. This music does not fit to the animation in my eyes so is not deserving of anything more.Character - 2The character simply has no exposition, however there are hints to his nature. The shoe he wears is nailed, so likely leather. As a result he's a businessman going insane.So not much on the character front, but there's a hint.Enjoyment - 3I just didn't enjoy it.

0;Oz.;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;7;"The music video for ""Oz."" by Yama for the Ousama Ranking series is a visual treat for fans of the show. The video serves as the first ending song for the series and it truly captures the essence of the series in an artistic and creative way.The video starts with a shot of Bojji and Kage in their childhood, depicting their initial encounter and the start of their friendship. As the song progresses, we see them grow and evolve as they go through different adventures and challenges together. The animation style is cartoony and childish, fitting perfectly with the spirit of Bojji and Kage's friendship. The childish art style helps to emphasize the innocence and pure bond of friendship between the two characters.The video also features scenes from the series, including the iconic moments between Bojji and Kage as they help each other through their journey. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the colors are vibrant and eye-catching. The video is also well-edited and the cuts are seamless, making it easy to follow the story.One of the most striking aspects of the video is the way it showcases the bond between Bojji and Kage, and how their friendship is the backbone of the series. The lyrics of the song, ""Oz."" by Yama, also adds to the emotional impact, with lines like ""Even though we're small, we can still shine,"" and ""Together, we're unstoppable."" The song and the video work together to deliver a powerful message of friendship, positivity, and courage.";Recommended

1;Inma Daitoshi: Beast City;inim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/inim;3;"Crazy guro hentai by Shinichi ""Nabeshin"" Watanabe of Excel Saga fame. The plot is like a parody version of Legend of the Overfiend (1987), with Apocalypse Zero (1996) visuals and 90s slapstick comedy gags. Episode 1 is seriously funny, self-aware and definitely worth watching. Even more so when one like myself is a fan of cosmic horror and end of the world scenarios brought on by sexualized grotesque demons. This show can go one step beyond Wicked City (1987) as it's actually Rx rated. The biggest asset of episode one is that it doesn't take itself seriously. Episode one is a little guro hentai comedy gem, the only other similar specimen I can think of is Yarima Queen (2000). Note: Nabeshin's trademark cameo is at the beginning of episode two.Unfortunately then there came two more episodes. The second is still acceptable and continues the war between the ""Demon Beasts"" and the ""Draculons"". It does so by introducing the demon lord's daughter and with her comes plenty of femdom style kink. The third episode wasn't published in the West anymore and only recently dug out by one of the large pirate portals for hentai. Not only that suddenly the story takes itself seriously and becomes a pretentious and lesser version of the Overfiend finale. The animation budget basically ceased to exist. So while the story would require end of the world destruction and fighting action, we get re-used animation, mouth flaps and kindergarten quality drawings.So this is a hard to rate show. Episode three clearly calls for a 1/10, whereas episode one comes quite close to a 7/10 (if one shares my taste for demon kink). This somehow then middles out and rounds down to an overall 3-4/10. Pro tip: watch episode 1, smile, and move on. (3.5/10)";Mixed Feelings
0;Midnight Panther;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;7;"The anime follows the traveling musical group ""The Pussy Cats"" are the hottest thing around. Lou, Kei and Sonya are three, sexy singers with a legion of screaming fans in every town. But these pussycats have claws. Singers by day, assassins by night, unbeknownst to their fans, The Pussy Cats are also The Midnight Panthers, female assassins who will kill anyone if the price is right. Their next target is a despotic king who rules by fear and crushes dissension with an iron fist. But for one of the Panthers, it's not just another job, it's personal.There aren't a lot of sex scenes, and the sex scenes there are are short and are there to push the plot forward. Looking back at them, they're pretty quaint considering the amount of high quality explicit porn that we have these days. There wasn't much in the way of hentai to see back when this was released in the mid 90s, so the few short sex scenes that Midnight Panther had to offer had to do. This series only technically counts as a hentai since the sex is explicit to some extent.But on the other hand, this 2 episode OVA is actually pretty fun watch. The animation is actually pretty good, the action scenes are are fun to watch, the English dub is actually enjoyable to some degree, and all of the characters feel fleshed out, and even have some character development, which I'm pretty sure has to do with the fact that it's based on a 4-volume manga, where the characters and world have a lot more going on.In fact, this anime reminded me of another favorite, Words Worth, and lo and behold, the director, script, and storyboard artist for this was Shigenori Kageyama, who also did the same on Words Worth, sans directing, along with Rinshin, who was the Animation Director, Character Designer, and Key Animator on that series, along with doing the art for the manga. So I guess if you like Word's Worth, this is probably worth checking out for you.If you don't mind putting up with an occasional semi-explicit sex scene, I can recommend Midnight Panther as something that you could watch outside of it's wank material, which is rarity for a hentai series. I know that is not something that you would expect from your jerk off material, and it feels weird recommending a hentai for something other than it's intended use, but I'd still recommend Midnight Panther as a short fun watch.";Recommended

0;Midnight Panther;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;5;I do not normally watch Hentai, in fact, most times it’s because someone has asked me to review it. There is a lot of Hentai out there that is made for shock value and I am normally grossed out by how the woman are treated as sex objects or the whole anime is revolved around some guy or girl getting laid. This one however had a very interesting plot element and story. I think I have to thank the fact that this was a 23 volume manga before it became an OVA.Let’s start talking about the characters. Just a small warning that spoilers may end up being part of this review as it’s a very large portion of the OVA. There isn’t much that we know about Sonya and Kei, we probably get more in the manga but I never read it. All I know is that both of them are rather sexually active in their job, one turning into a leopard and the other using her hair to strangle the men. We also don’t get much on the Old Hag who has no name. She seems to be like how Charlie’s Angels had Charlie, the boss who told them their orders, took care of them, and gave them what they need to do the job. Unlike Charlie, we see the Old Hag whether we want to or not, mostly not for me. I just always felt very uneasy when she came on the screen, partly because her mouth looks like she has a mustache and partly because she seems to be the comedy in this. She forces Lou to hunt down ingredients for her alchemy while sending the other two out to kill.Lou is the most interesting of the group in my opinion. Her story begins long before the Old Hag found her and saved her from dieing when she was a child but this is the point where it becomes a bit of a spoiler. While they do lay down most of the story for you in the first episode, I still consider it slightly spoilers. She used to be the ‘brother’ of King Bad a long time ago, until he killed off his mother and Father for the throne. He would of killed Lou too if not for her falling off the side of the castle. They never explained how Bad ended up going crazy but from glimpses of the past, you can piece together that he was extremely in love with Lou.Hentai’s don’t do it for me because I’m more interested in stories then to just here the slap slap slap of two people banging. There was rarely any sex in this even if there was a lot of fan service and sexual descriptions so it opened up a lot for the story to come out. That and I did like how the women did not just want to have sex, they had a reason they were seducing them.The animation is… well it isn’t the greatest but it isn’t bad. It reminds me a lot of the first season of ‘The Slayers’ in that it is a very old style. The characters are pretty well detailed with shadows and colors that are bright and set the mood. This goes also for the backgrounds which were mostly medieval style castles and forests. The only gripe I had with the main characters designs were their proportions being a little off like the women’s legs being way to long or the hips of the men look like they could break in half with how thick their chests are. The Old Hag is the one I really wish we didn’t have to see. She seems to be like rubber in how she bends, talks, and even jumps. Sometimes it was so fast that it looked like she was a slide show like the frames couldn’t keep up with her. I can understand the comedy in the way she and Lou react to each other, but she didn’t feel like she fit at all in the story.For those that love subs, I did watch the sub version of this OVA and found it to be not that bad. The voices were rather decent and fit he characters well but I could not fully grasp the emotion of the translation. The only one that seemed to stand out was if a character was turned on or trying to be sexy… which I guess is all you really need for a hentai. The music didn’t stand out to much for me so I really don’t have much to say on that and the sex sounds were pretty much what you would expect for a hentai, loud and sloppy…This was one of the better hentai’s I have seen more so for the story then for anything else. It’s a ok one to check out if you want a good story with a small bit of hentai.;Mixed Feelings

The action scenes are wonderfully directed and if you have a 5.1 surround system, the mayhem combined with jazzy music will blow your head off!Yes, the 3DCG is bad, but it's not that jarring, at least not most of the time. The characters look weird from some angles, but good for the most part. Cat's suits could have been better too, they looked a bit uninspiring.

0;Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye;jonunderw00d;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jonunderw00d;6;"Before I present my brief review, I have to state clearly that I am only familiar with and mainly concerned with Cat's Eye in this movie, and so most of my review will reflect that. I'll leave the critical review of Lupin III to other reviewers.Let's start with the most obvious stuff. The CGI is HORRIBLE. It is painful to watch the whole movie at normal speed. For an anime that relies on a whole lot of fast action and motion, the CGI should be handled with utmost care, if CGI was even appropriate at all in the first place. That has not occurred. It is as if you're watching a typical stop claymotion at twice the speed. The only way I personally could enjoy this CGI product is if the movie was sped up at twice (2.0x) the original speed.Then, the character design of the Cat's Eye trio is so foreign that I could barely recognize them if there was no ""Cat's Eye"" in the movie title. The CGI only made it worse. They look like barbie dolls swinging around Beverly Hills in a typical Totally Spies episode, and even one of those episodes has better animation than the Cat's Eye trio does in this movie. In addition, the 2019 City Hunter movie had short but brief cameo featuring the titular trio in an almost identical fashion but with modern animation. There, they looked better in all possible ways one could imagine a Cat's Eye anime in our present day.The story itself is not exceptional. It is a typical heist action movie with a small grain of mystical element of treasure hunting sprinkled in. It's not terrible in any way, but it's nothing to write home about either. The only concern I have is that the overall (and I emphasize ""overall"") role of Cat's Eye in this movie has been reduced to nothing but mere stepping stones for Lupin III and gang to shine. Until the very end of the movie, Cat's Eye had everything handed down to them on a silver platter. If you're a Lupin III fan, you may rejoice at Lupin's and his gang's overwhelming appearance, but for one who thinks fondly of Cat's Eye after having finished the whole anime just a few weeks ago, it is rather disappointing to see Cat's Eye constantly overshadowed everywhere they got into action.I would say that I still enjoyed the movie the first time I watched it, but as the movie concluded, the bitter epiphany began to sink in, especially with regards to Cat's Eye and the trio's involvement in this movie.If you're looking forward to watching this movie, then try to banish all negative thoughts of CGI anime that might be swirling in your head right now. Oh, and don't expect too much of Cat's Eye in this movie. Do that, and you might just enjoy this movie like any other.";Mixed Feelings

Combining two classic franchises known for beloved characters, memorable music, and fun action sounds like a love letter for the ages. Unfortunately, no amount of goodwill could have saved it from atrocious animation that brings the entire production down, and a story that deserves it. Whether you're a lover of Lupin or an admirer of Cat's Eye, you have nothing to gain from this -- and an hour and thirty one minutes to lose.-Story and Characters-Combining these master thieves in one movie is a comfortable fit, but the story that brings them together is shamefully mediocre. The smart writing from previous Lupin outings is unfortunately missing from this by-the-numbers story, leaving it planted in with the worst of the franchise OVAs. Knowing anything about these characters will immediately expose exactly how the plot will go, and the ""vs."" in the title is a paper-thin attempt at conflict that gets thrown in the trash before the halfway mark.When you're making a story like ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"", it's a must to earn the crossover -- to something that celebrates the union of two iconic franchises. Instead, I have never seen a more dumbed-down, one-note version of these characters and their pathetic attempt at a plot. It's a disappointment.-Art and Sound-Clearly, the animation does not look good in ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"". The models are stiff, action is clunky, and there is a sense of lifelessness that permeates the whole picture. Action figures and statues have more expression than these character models, and honestly that's the worst part. Even in the worst movies, the Lupin gang have always been expressive and filled with personality, but even the actors seem dragged down by their on-screen counterparts. All these actors are veterans of the Japanese voice-over industry, some having played their character for decades, but were chained to animation that sank them like a weight.It's a shame, because the character designs themselves are sharp and fun, and Yuji Ohno's music should be enjoyed on its own without this disaster of a project.Had ""Lupin III vs. Cat's Eye"" been a traditional 2D animation on par with some of Lupin's recent projects or CG on the level of ""Lupin III The First"" maybe something could be salvaged from this Lupin letdown. As is, this is an embarrassing tribute to the franchises it's trying to celebrate. In the 50 years of Lupin, and 40 of Cat's Eye, this entry should be wiped from history.";Not Recommended

She is given an aphrodisiac and raped by an orc.Art: They tried to make the art so it has an 80's feel for some reason, but it worked quite well. Animation was good, but the angles were all very bad and too zoomed-in.Sound: Shiranui's voice sound very good. Sound effects were a bit artificial and too loud. I really liked the metal song playing in the 30 seconds intro and there was also some short music at both the very start and very end, but there was nothing playing during the main scene.Character: Shiranui is looking gorgeous with her balloon tits, but they didn't show much of her personality and she broke pretty much immediately. There was also another girl, but she was only shown for 8 seconds and I can only assume she's from the VN? Orc was an orc, not much to say about it.Enjoyment: I liked it quite a bit, even though it was only 5 minutes with the opening covering up 30% of it (not complaining by the way, I love the opening). It was also good to see at least a bit of Shiranui, since she didn't appear in the main episodes.Overall: Why not? It's very short, sweet, looks different and if you wanted to see more Shiranui, it's a no-brainer.* Also, if anyone's still looking for it, the only place I managed to find it subbed was at muchohentai dot cum. *";Mixed Feelings
0;Fuuma no Kojirou: Yasha-hen;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;7;Esta review también está en español.After Ring no Kakero, his first great success as an author, Masami Kurumada created another battle shonen series, this time focused on ninja clans (in which, obviously, no member is older than fifteen years old) fighting to death, using ingenious and crazy techniques: Fuuma no Kojirou (FnK). In this series, many elements will be born and reused in what will be Mr Kurumada's masterpiece: Saint Seiya. Yasha-hen is the first set of OVA, and adapts the first story arc of the manga (there's also a second set, Seiken Sensou-hen, and a final OVA, Fuuma Hanran-hen). Despite being a series that can be enjoyed on its own, just like Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE is specially interesting for Card Captor Sakura fans, or whatever created by Leiji Matsumoto is appealing for Matsumoto fans, FnK is especially attractive for Saint Seiya fans (mostly because Kurumada tends to use the same characters in all his works, just like Matsumoto), so throughout this review, don't be surprised to see several comparisons between the two series.FnK's story shows us that the Hakou High School is having serious problems: bad boys from the Seishikan High never stop pestering (read: beating the crap out) their students! In such situation, Hojo Himeko, the leader of the Hakou, takes the only reasonable conclusion: hiring a ninja clan. Thus, Kojiro, a representative of the Fuuma clan, leaves his desolate mountain and go to the civilization to kick some evil asses.Of course, Seishikan fellas have their own shinobi clan, the Yasha, so after a few skirmishes, both clans (since Kojiro's companions arrive shortly after) agree to face their best warriors in a fight without rules, Basilisk style.That's basically the plot of FnK. Not a very deep story, and it doesn't try to be: what's important here is the excitement and action, and in that regard this six part OVA doesn't disappoint. There's a constant succession of battles (especially from the third episode onward, since the first two are introductory and rather slow), in which the most varied techniques are implemented. And something very important, anyone can die in these duels, which makes the result even more exciting (since not always the good ones survive).On the character department... this is where a series oriented exclusively on combats suffers: there's practically no character development, since a good chunk of the cast will die pretty fast n_n. The hero, Kojiro, is a pretty common guy, if a bit annoying. But, like Seiya, he's determined, stubborn and cares for his clanmates. His bokken (wooden sword) skills defy the laws of physics, even for the standards of a ninja show. Also, from the Fuuma clan, we have Ryoma, the Dokugan Ryu (that's right, he shares his nickname with the legendary Date Masamune, since both characters lost an eye). All in all, he is the more focused and respectful of the clan, and is who challenged the Yasha. His psychic abilities are the strongest of their clan. There are other Fuuma members, but the last one I want to mention is Kirikaze. Not only he physically resembles Andromeda Shun, but he's also the only member that at least expressed his discontent with the fight. Of course, he still kicks ass, and without much remorse.On the opposing side, the most important character (by far) is the leader of Yasha, who, ironically, is someone outside the clan: Asuka Musashi. He's not only ridiculously powerful, but it's the only one who really has an established background: he fights as a mercenary for the highest bidder to pay the bills from the hospital where his sister is interned. Although not evil per se, he's very efficient, practical and ruthless: when an opponent is considered especially dangerous, he will kill him quickly, to avoid problems in the future. No hate or honor in the table, just pragmatism. Like Kojiro, his weapon is a bokken that cuts flesh like butter.The visuals are correct... but it could be better. In fact, it should be better. The manga of FnK is older than Saint Seiya, but these OVA are newer than the anime of the bronze saints. That's why I can't understand why the quality is slightly higher in the case of Saint Seiya. Not only everything has a greater brightness and color in SS, but the character design in FnK borders the ridiculous. Kojiro is a clone of Seiya, and that's fine, since it's intentional (every Kurumada MC has the same face). The same is true with 95% of the characters, all of which can be homologated with a Saint (Musashi-Dohko, Kirikaze-Shun, etc)... the problem is that the same design is used in various characters. There are three characters that look like Shiryu (Ryoma, Anki and Mibu), and in the future, there will be even more! All the female characters are either Athena or Pandora (who are essentially the same, to begin with), and minor character are so generic it's scary. This is particularly serious because these are OVA...Anyways, although (a little) below the expected, it complies by the standards of the eighties. The animation is fluid, the techniques are well animated, and there's blood everywhere (especially on the foreheads... seriously, no matter what happens, there will be blood on the forehead, and always a few seconds later after the attack, not immediately).The sound's fine. An interesting detail is that, while both Kojiro and Seiya anime share some seiyuus, none of them act as the character with the same face. To name a few, Keiichi Nanba is Kojiro's voice actor, while in Saint Seiya was Pisces Aphrodite and Poseidon (and many other characters, like Ziocite in Sailor Moon, Ryo Hayabusa in Ninja Gaiden, Raoh in Hokuto no Ken, and so on), not Seiya (whose original seiyuu was Toru Furuya). Sho Hayami is Musashi's voice, and was Sea Horse Baian (and Wolfwood in Trigun, Sairei in Shakugan no Shana III, Akira Hojo in Sanctuary, etc). Hideyuki Hori is Ryoma and Phoenix Ikki's voice (and Roberto Hongo in Captain Tsubasa J, Ginyu in Dragon Ball Z, Nobuo Tanaka in Memories, and many more). Finally, Kazuhiko Inoue is Mibu in FnK and Ohko in SS (as well as Mamoru Kusanagi in Blue Seed, Anthony in Candy Candy, and Kakashi in Naruto).As for the music, although not even close in quality to the one used in Saint Seiya (although, to be fair, not many can compare), it goes well with the ninja atmosphere of the series. The opening, Don't go away, is a calm rock song, and the ending, Good-bye Marry, is a powerful heavy metal song (both are interpreted by Night Hawks).Anyways, verdict time. I'll try to be direct cause I wrote more than usual: Fuuma no Kojirou is highly recommended for Saint Seiya fans in particular, and for battle shounen fans in general. Here, you will not find lots of character development or a great story: the important thing here are the fights. And luckily, the combats are fast paced, unpredictable and ingenious, so, in the end, the whole experience is pretty enjoyable. If you liked this, the next logical step would be Seiken Sensou-hen, the second set of episodes of FnK.--------Después de Ring no Kakero, su primer gran éxito como autor, Masami Kurumada idearía otro shonen de batallas, esta vez enfocado en clanes ninja (en el que, obviamente, ningún miembro tiene más de quince años) luchando hasta morir, usando técnicas tan ingeniosas como locas: Fuma no Kojiro (FnK). En esta serie, además, nacerían muchos de los elementos que después serian usados en la obra prima del señor Kurumada: Saint Seiya. Yasha-hen es la primera tanda de OVAS, que adapta el primer arco argumental del manga (habiendo disponibles una segunda tanda, Seiken Sensou-hen, y una OVA final, Fuuma Hanran-hen). A pesar de ser una serie que puede apreciarse en sí misma, de la misma forma que Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE es especialmente interesante para los fans de Card Captor Sakura, y lo que sea de Leiji Matsumoto es especialmente atrayente para los fans de Matsumoto, FnK es especialmente llamativa para los fans de Saint Seiya (más que nada porque el señor Kurumada tiene la costumbre de usar siempre a los mismos personajes en situaciones distintas, al igual que el señor Matsumoto), así que, a lo largo de esta review, no se sorprendan al ver varias comparaciones entre ambas series.La historia de FnK nos muestra que la secundaria Hakou atraviesa serios problemas: alumnos malos de la escuela Seishikan no dejan de molestar (léase, moler a golpes) a sus estudiantes! Ante tamaña situación, Himeko Hojo, la encargada de Hakou, llega a la única conclusión razonable: contratar a un clan ninja. Es así como Kojiro, representante del clan Fuuma, deja su desolada montaña para dirigirse a la civilización y dar una seria y merecida paliza a ese grupo de abusones. Por supuesto, los muchachos de Seishikan tienen a su propia clan shinobi, los Yasha, por lo que después de una serie de escaramuzas, se ponen de acuerdo y ambos clanes (porque al poco tiempo llegan los compañeros de Kojiro) enfrentan a sus 10 mejores guerreros, en una lucha rastrera y sin reglas, bien a lo Basilisk.Esa es básicamente la trama de FnK. No es una historia muy profunda, ni pretende serlo: acá lo importante es la emoción y la acción, y en eso esta miniserie de 6 capítulos no decepciona. Hay una constante sucesión de batallas (especialmente a partir del tercer capítulo, ya que los dos primeros son más bien introductorios y algo lentos), en las que las más variopintas técnicas son ejecutadas, con resultados muy variables. Y lo más importante: cualquiera puede morir en estos duelos, lo que hace que el resultado sea todavía más emocionante (nada de que los buenos ganan siempre, o no tienen bajas).Por el lado de los personajes… acá es donde una serie de puros combates sufre: prácticamente no hay un gran desarrollo de personajes, dado que muchos no duran más de cinco minutos n_n. El protagonista, Kojiro, es un chico bastante común para haber sido entrenado en las oscurísimas artes ninjas, y la verdad, es algo molesto. Eso sí: al igual que Seiya, es determinado, tozudo, y quiere mucho a sus compañeros. Su manejo del bokken (espada de madera) desafía las leyes de la física, incluso para una serie de ninjas. También, del clan Fuuma, tenemos a Ryoma, el Dokugan Ryu (comparte su apodo con Date Masamune, dado que ambos personajes perdieron un ojo). Dentro de todo, el es el más centrado y respetuoso del clan, y es el que lanza el desafío formal al clan Yasha. Sus habilidades psíquicas están entra las más fuertes de su clan. Hay varios Fuuma más, pero el último que me gustaría comentar es Kirikaze. No solamente se parece físicamente a Shun de Andrómeda, sino que también es el único miembro del clan que al menos manifestó su desagrado por pelear. Eso no evita que en solo segundos reparta golpes para todos lados, pero bueno, al menos tiene intenciones pacifistas.Del lado antagonista, el más importante (por mucho) es el líder de los Yasha, que irónicamente, es alguien ajeno al clan: Musashi Asuka. No solamente es ridículamente poderoso, si no que es el único que realmente tiene un background establecido: pelea como mercenario al mejor postor para poder pagar las cuentas del hospital donde está internada su hermanita. Aunque no es maligno per se, si es muy eficiente, práctico, y despiadado: cuando considera que un rival es especialmente peligroso, lo asesina rápidamente, para que no de problemas en el futuro. No hay odio ni honor relacionados, solo pragmatismo. Al igual que Kojiro, su arma es una bokken que corta carne como si fuera manteca.La animación en si es correcta… pero podría ser mejor. De hecho, debería ser mejor. Tal vez el manga de FnK sea anterior a Saint Seiya, pero las OVAS de Yasha-hen son posteriores (por solo unos meses, pero son mas nuevas) al anime de los caballeros. Es por esto que no se entiende como la calidad es ligeramente mayor en el caso de Saint Seiya. No solo todo tiene un brillo y un color mayor en la serie de los caballeros de bronce, si no que el diseño de personajes bordea lo cómico. Que Kojiro sea un clon de Seiya es intencional, y es parte del encanto de la obra de Kurumada. Lo mismo ocurre con un 97% de los personajes, todos pueden ser homologados a algún caballero (Musashi-Dohko, Kirikaze-Shun, etc)… el problema es que los diseños se repiten varias veces DENTRO de la serie. Hay tres personajes que se parecen a Shiryu (Ryoma, Mibu y Anki), y en el futuro van a aparecer más! xD. Todos los personajes femeninos son o Athena o Pandora (que en esencia, son iguales), y los personajes de menor importancia son tan genéricos que asusta. Esto es especialmente grave porque se trata de OVAS…Pero bueno, aunque inferior a la media, cumple (para los estándares de los 80). La animación es fluida, las técnicas están bien representadas, y lo más importante de todo, hay sangre por todos lados (especialmente en las frentes… en serio, pase lo que pase, sea el ataque que sea, como mínimo, va a haber sangre en la frente, y solo después de un par de segundos de ejecutado el ataque, como para dar dramatismo).El sonido está bien. Un detalle llamativo es que, si bien los animes de Seiya y Kojiro comparten algunos miembros de cast, ninguno representa al personaje de la misma cara. Por ejemplo, Keiichi Nanba, la voz de Kojiro, es Afrodita de Piscis y Poseidón (y varios más, como Ziocite en Sailor Moon, Ryo Hayabusa en Ninja Gaiden, Raoh en Hokuto no Ken, y un largo etcétera), y no Seiya (cuyo seiyuu original es Toru Furuya). El rol de Musashi lo representa Hayami Sho, quien fuera Baian de Caballo Marino (y también Wolfwood en Trigun, Sairei en Shakugan no Shana III, Akira Hojo en Sanctuary, etc). Hideyuki Hori es Ikki de Fénix y Ryoma (y Roberto Hongo en Captain Tsubasa J, Ginyu en Dragon Ball Z, Nobuo Tanaka en Memories y varios más). Finalmente Kazuhiko Inoue es Mibu en FnK, y Ohko en SS (además de ser Mamoru Kusanagi en Blue Seed, Anthony en Candy Candy, Kakashi en Naruto).En cuanto a la música, si bien no puede compararse a la de Saint Seiya (aunque siendo justos, muy pocas pueden), va bien con la atmosfera ninja de la serie. El opening, Don't go away, es relativamente tranquilo (para los parámetros del Rock), y el ending, Good-bye Marry, es una poderosa canción heavy. Ambas interpretadas por Night Hawks.Pero bueno, después de semejante parrafada, es momento del veredicto. Voy a procurar ser directo, dado que ya escribí más de lo usual: Fuuma no Kojirou es una serie muy recomendable para los fans de Saint Seiya, y también para los seguidores de los shonen de batallas. Acá no hay una gran historia o un notable desarrollo de personajes, acá hay muchas peleas. Lo bueno es que están bien hechas, y su resultado es impredecible. Además, la mayoría se resuelven bastante rápido, lo que siempre es un plus. Si estas OVAS les gustaron, el paso lógico a seguir es ver es Seiken Sensou-hen, la segunda tanda de capítulos.Gente que busque un gran desarrollo argumental, personajes profundos o animación de gran calidad, mantenerse alejados.;Recommended
0;Fuuma no Kojirou: Yasha-hen;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;“Fuuma no Kojirou: Yasha-hen” essentially consists of a pointless ninja battle royale with lots of bloodied foreheads. The paper-thin plot, which doesn’t make much sense, revolves around two schools, Seishikan and Hakuo. Students from Seishikan have been bullying and beating up students from Hakuo, forcing them to transfer to their school. Normally, one would get the police involved in an issue like this, but a teacher at Hakuo (I guess she’s a teacher, although she’s dressed like a student) sends for a member of an elusive clan of ninjas, the Fuma, to solve the problem. After killing several rival ninjas who had intercepted the teacher’s letter, the intended recipient, Kojiro, heads to the school and is immediately smitten with the principal of the school, another young woman in a school uniform. She is mostly forgotten about after the first episode, however. Also, despite the premise being centered on schools, we never once see students in a class, so I’m not sure what kind of schools these are supposed to be.Anyway, Seishikan has its own elite group of ninjas protecting it, and when it’s obvious that Kojiro can’t handle this job alone, his fellow Fuma ninjas come to his aid. For reasons not adequately explained, both of the clans then decide to fight each other to the death. The majority of the content of this OVA is just that — ninjas barely getting introduced before fighting and killing each other. Naturally, there’s a lot of blood, and oddly, the characters often bleed from the forehead. Perhaps that’s just the creator’s style, but it’s repetitive and unrealistic.Due to the nature of this OVA, there is little character development. The main character, Kojiro, doesn’t change much, though in the first episode he’s portrayed in a more comical style. The main antagonist, Musashi, has a cliched backstory consisting of a sick younger sister, and he is working at Seishikan to pay her hospital bill. Ranko, the teacher who hired Kojiro, is shown as illogically mean in the first episode, but in subsequent episodes, she does a complete 180 in terms of personality and suddenly acts like she cares about, and may even have feelings for, Kojiro. The other characters are hardly given any screen time, and most are killed off just minutes after their initial appearances.The fights themselves are somewhat interesting, as each ninja uses a unique supernatural attack — one uses feathers, another uses fog, et cetera. Two of the strongest ones call themselves “psychic soldiers,” and they use psychic attacks. I’m not sure how these are different from the supernatural attacks, but apparently they’re more powerful.The dialogue is cliched and repetitive. The direction is all over the place, and there are lots of close ups of the characters’ eyes for some reason. The character designs are different from the typical anime look — the author of “Saint Seiya” created this, so there’s a similarity in style between the two. The characters are kind of difficult to tell apart, though, since many of them look alike. The animation is limited and choppy.The opening theme is a rock ballad, while the ending theme is an upbeat heavy metal song, both by the same artist. These two songs are decent. The background music is just generic Japanese-sounding music, typical for something ninja-related and not very memorable.With a cast of many popular/veteran voice actors, the voice acting is okay, but it’s wasted on the substandard dialogue. Keiichi Nanba and Show Hayami particularly stand out as the voices of the protagonist and antagonist.As for objectionable content, in addition to the excessive blood and killing, there is an upskirt panty shot in the first episode, which added absolutely nothing to the series and felt like a cheap attempt to reach a fanservice quota.Overall, while some of the fights are innovative and interesting, this OVA is difficult to recommend, mainly because of the nonsensical plot and near-zero character development. It all boils down to ninjas killing each other for no reason. If that’s your thing, then you may enjoy this, but otherwise, I would say avoid this one.;Not Recommended
0;Kyojin no Hoshi;NadeshikoDamashi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NadeshikoDamashi;8;Introduction:This is the one anime that every Japanese person must watch for sake of their 'common knowledge.' Although this is not very popular in the United States and other countries, due to the long history since its airing in the late 1960s, many of its aspects has become iconic for Japanese culture. Even the recent anime industry incessantly refers to this anime, such as Bakemonogatari and Doraemon. I was born in 1993, but had the opportunity to watch this when I was young as a result of my parents' recommendation, and I had never regretted once that I had watched the entire series.Story: 9The executive producer had really put a lot of effort into the plot, spanning 182 episodes. Throughout the course the story, the protagonist encounters many hardships, including academic, athletic, and family matters. He is forced to make sacrifices in order to pursue his dream to become a professional baseball player, sometimes even if it results in expressing disapproval against his own father. Eventually, he succeeds in becoming an excellent pitcher, and meets several tough batters with whom he establishes a rival relationship.Art: 7I will have to mention that back in the 1960s, there were no computers used for animation, and thus the only way to have anime was to draw EVERY SINGLE FRAME on a different piece of paper. As a reference, several minutes required about 1000 frames or drawings. Thus, one must respect the time and effort it took to produce something that is 182 episodes long. Perhaps the only complaint I have for this anime is the art style: it is simply too old for my taste.Sound: 8Considering the technology that was available back in the 1960s, this is much better than average. Sound effects when sliding in a base, hitting the ball, or someone huffing and puffing, were all well done. I have nothing much else to say here.Character: 9Each character's unique attribute contributes to the overall audience's enjoyment. This can be as simple as the hair style, or something complex like having to undergo long years of intense baseball training in the woods. Each character (even the minor ones) is made sure to possess at least trait that somehow relates to another character's. Furthermore, the roles of the minor characters serve to highlight the major ones, and plot balances are well maintained.Enjoyment: 9If you've read everything so far, my review might sound like senseless babbling, but this is a result of my trying to not spoil anything. I guarantee: not spoiling anything will increase your overall satisfaction when watching this anime. As mentioned before, this is extremely popular in Japan (about 30% of the population recognize the title name), and can be attributed to the great enjoyment that this provides. Unless they detest baseball in general, people of all age groups are guaranteed to enjoy.Overall: 8;Recommended
1;Kyojin no Hoshi;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;Essentially this series is a story about a boy and his father, their relationship and struggle they share together during the youth of the boy. It is also about the relationship that someone can have to a sport, what that means and how it relates to the human relationships outside and inside of that sport. The series also explores youth, growth success and the price of that success.You might notice similarities in the presentation and some of the themes if you're familiar with series such as Ashita no Joe, Attack No 1 and Ace wo Nerae, however Kyojin no Hoshi is more about family, and the individual relationships of the MC than those other series, these relationships are explored through fierce rivalry, drama and struggle that is constant throughout the series. The struggle explored in the series is both physical and emotional.The art in the series is incredible, utilising visual gimmicks that you might be familiar with from series like Attack No 1, the animation and the art also enhances the culmination points of the series. Visually the art gets more detailed on those parts which makes you feel tension of the situation through that visual presentation. I'd say the usage of such presentation enables another level of engagement from the audience in those parts where the tension and struggle culminates. The series also features lot of sports commentary which I think makes the experience of the matches feel more immersive as it is almost as if you were watching a real match.Other than the above visual presentation I mentioned the series also puts emphasis on the emotional aspect of the sport and portrays it visually creating impactful visuals throughout the series. While the method that is used exploring some of the themes is more focused on the relationships of the group and family than the individuals own struggle like in Ashita no Joe and the others I mentioned earlier, I'd say that it doesn't really make the any less enjoyable. The struggle when it comes to the relationships in the series is also presented from multiple perspectives, and how different characters experience their relationship and struggle relating to that in different ways.There is also a sentiment about war and tragedy explored in the series as one of the themes, featuring footage from the war and exploring the effects of war to the individual, relationships and to the sport.Throughout the series as you grow with the characters you start feeling the weight of their struggle yourself and get immersed to the deep relationships and dynamic that the characters share, I'd say this enables another layer of enjoyment when it comes to the series.Overall I'd say that the series is an epic journey through youth and the struggle relating to that and what it means to when it comes to the relationships as you strive towards something as specific as success/sport and presenting a question if it is worth that price.;Recommended
0;Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol;The_Psychiatrist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The_Psychiatrist;8;"Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol or Il était une fois la vie (once upon a time... life) Is a French Japanese Animation financed by several EU countries (Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Holland) and Canada.It belongs to the label ""Il était une fois"" (""once upon a time"") created by Albert Barillé. Under his works, all the series are dedicated to entertain and educate the children in a very well balanced way, with good story line and funny or interesting characters. It was made a at a time producers wished the children to have a good time but also to make them think and learn in the framework of an anime with good artistic value. Very nice combination...this was a success : Millions of children have seen it in the 1980s and 1990s.This one which is the third installment is about the human biology. Main human body functions are addressed all in good mix of science, suspense, comical situations, and original design.All biological entities are anthropomorphized and all the characters of the previous series (about history and space) reprised their role but as neurons, lymphocytes, virus and so on...! Even the wise Maestro is here (guess where?)! The heroes are often the protectors of the body, they even kept their science fiction clothes from the previous series.Story of each episode is really enjoyable and can raise interest among children and adult viewers alike with a good amount of suspense.Regarding the biological aspect, as a medical doctor myself, I confirm that they explain in a very clear and entertaining way all the essential mechanisms from immunity, to organs functions, brain role, reproduction and even genetics. Everything is scientifically sounds and relevant.Drawing involved artists from Japan and France. Animation done by the Eiken studios (Testujin 28) is definitely dated but still satisfactory and fluid enough for viewing in the 21th century. Character are simply designed but are easily recognizable and relatable. In 2016, all the series benefit from a complete remastered version (color palette improvement, drawing error correction, sounds remaster) to fit the 1080p enhanced edition.Music is classical and its agreeable melodies fits perfectly the action and are very well composed by Michel Legrand, a famous multi Oscars winner composer.French Dubbing have involved Dramatic Art Theater actors and is very enjoyable. Roger Carel is perfect as the voice of the wise Maestro. Dutch dubbing is very good, the Italian version is excellent, German version is really professional and Spanish dubbing is a success. I do not know about the other languages, maybe some of you can tell us...EDIT : RobdeFR told me that the Portuguese version was popular, efficient and ""Iconic"". Thanks Rob for the info!Overall, this anime is a perfect way for children and adults alike to learn about the human body all the while being captivated by the story taking place inside our very organism. The travel to the microscopic world begins!";Recommended
0;Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol” is a Japanese and French co-produced educational 26-episode OVA that covers different aspects of bodily processes, from how various organs function to what happens if you don’t brush your teeth, using kid-friendly characters in easy-to-understand situations. Apparently, this series was quite popular in various parts of the world when it came out, and it seems that there is a lot of nostalgia for it. Watching it as an adult and for the first time, however, I have to say that at least the English dubbed version was a real slog to get through.Each episode is self-contained and focuses on a different body part or function, but the episodes are arranged in a logical order corresponding to the subject matter, so it’s best to watch them in that order.The characters are confusing. You have a central cast of “kid” characters, “bully” characters and “adult” characters, and some of these have their own forms as white blood cells, viruses, etc. in the body. The “kid” characters will look like they’re around 8 years old in some episodes, and in others they’re closer to 15.The in-body characters appear to be the same for everyone — basically, everyone’s bodies are run by old white guys who sleep on the job half the time, and they have 2 kids that patrol the body in little hover ships, making sure there isn’t any trouble from bacteria or viruses lurking about. And the three main red blood cells, Hemo, Globin and the Professor, seem to be ubiquitous as well. Regarding the Professor, he dies 3 times during the course of the series, only to be shown alive and well like nothing happened in the following episode. So don’t expect any consistency from this anime.The depictions of various bodily processes are interesting, informative and memorable, particularly due to the unique character designs each part of the body has. I especially liked the frog-like macrophages. This anime also does a good job from a public health standpoint, showing what could happen to you if you don’t wash your hands, brush your teeth, get vaccinated, etc. Some of the facts they espouse on the show are outdated, however. For instance, they say that the appendix isn’t important, and they make it seem like it’s easy to fully recover from leukemia.What really makes this show difficult to watch is the dialogue, but this may only be an issue with the English dub. Interactions between characters are stiff and awkward, and often don’t sound like natural conversations. Some of the voices don’t fit the characters well, and voices often don’t match lip movements. Here’s an example quote from the series that shows how bad the writing can be at times: “I love to eat when I’m hungry; don’t you?”Characters also react unrealistically to events they experience. For instance, when a couple of characters break their legs in a fall, they just sit there and laugh, like it’s no big deal.Animation-wise, there’s a lot of recycled animation and a few animation errors, but at least the art is unique. It definitely doesn’t look like a typical anime. There are a few odd sequences, particularly the opening sequence, which shows a naked man and woman hugging each other, and then combining to form a blob as they rise into the sky. A baby then comes down, grows and repeats the process with another naked person.The horn-heavy background music gets grating after a while. It sounds like something that would be more at home in a ‘70s variety show than an ‘80s anime.The ending takes a sharp turn away from all of the educational content delivered up to that point and delves into strictly sci-fi material. Some of the “future history” covered is controversial, such as human experimentation and genetic engineering; they even say that animal-human hybrids were created to “perform menial tasks.”There is, surprisingly, a fair amount of potentially objectionable content in this, although it’s supposed to be a show for kids. Besides the male and female nudity which appears in the opening sequence and in one other episode, we get to see two different kids urinating on a tree, a rather gross depiction of a mosquito bite, and some more injuries and even deaths (both the injuries and deaths are oddly uneventful and anticlimactic, though).Overall, while I wouldn’t say watching ""Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol” was a waste of time, and I feel like I learned something, I can’t say that I enjoyed it. The inconsistencies, awkward dialogue and reactions from the characters, as well as the background music made it difficult to sit through all 26 episodes. And the ending was just odd. Perhaps other versions are better, but I don’t recommend watching the English dub of this.";Mixed Feelings

You spend 30 hours over the week end guarding the art room, confiscating idiots' cameras, and being chewed out for taking initiative to solve reputation-destroying problems which nobody else is stepping up to deal with. Exhausted, you finally are given one half hour in which to 'experience' the con, and head directly to the line for the overcrowded dealers' room. 15 minutes later you enter the room proper, and after another 10 minutes of rapidly browsing the horrendously overpriced generic schlock you're growing desperate; you'll be damned if you're going to leave here empty handed. Then you spot it – a boxed set entitled 'Twin Angels'. You vaguely remember enjoying Kei and Yuri's antics in a graphic novel you once read, and make the purchase. Why did the dealer give you a creepy, sly look like that? Later that evening you drag yourself into your house, plop down in front of your computer, and put the first disc of your new acquisition into the DVD tray. Shortly thereafter you realize that the title you were thinking of was 'Dirty Pair', not 'Twin Angels'.So, what is there to say about this, really? It's hentai. With gore. Concurrently. Don't expect a clever plot or much character development from a show which is essentially La Blue Girl with a hamstrung sense of humour. Depending on your proclivities, don't expect a lot of sexy, either; but hey, maybe you like snuff. All in all, the best thing I got out of Twin Angels was an amusing story to tell.";Not Recommended
0;Jungle no Ouja Tar-chan;Tenth;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tenth;2;"*First review and mild spoilers please bear with me*So Jungle no Ouja Taa-chan or Jungle King Tar-chan for the English title is an anime that aired in the 90s though the original source material, the manga started publishing in the 80s and got lots of more volumes than the anime only covered with it's 50 episodes length which to me is a good thing anyways given how awful this anime is but I'm sure my rating for this spoiled it already, yes I did end up hating it and let me explain my reasons as to why.Plot:Basically there is none but I didn't go into this expecting it anyways, true it starts out very episodic and heavily focused on the comedy aspect of it which they fail miserably at or maybe succeed at if you are 12 years old and like piss/poop jokes with the occasional boner jokes because those are just too funny or maybe it's just me having no humor these days. Then we got the serious arcs which are basically just tournament arcs which not many anime can pull off even making interesting and again I know this is an older anime but it still failed to even make me remotely interested in them when all that happens are repeat things like Tarzan and his friends always beating up the bad guys and the characters from that arc gets their happy endings and you never see them again as they are quickly forgotten and back to Africa again. Only the first arc was a bit different in the sense that another character from that arc now joined Tarzan's gang and became a regular but that's it. Otherwise it's Africa>new tournament arc>Africa>new tournament arc etc and it's never anything else so overall there really is no plot to this anime, no overarching nemesis or anything of the like only the tournament arc villains that are just there and they are never a real threat and once their arc is done so are they. I like my plot being good or even there be some at all but there is something I prioritize more than plot and that is what we come to next.Characters:Oh boy... where to even start when there was literally no character I liked in this anime, lets get the annoying ones out of the way before the bland like Jane...and in particular fat Jane because there is a difference as clearly showed in the past when NOT living in Africa she was kind, sexy and a total fit for Tarzan (cover really fooled me, false advertising yo!) but then somehow she got lazy and fat out in Africa in the present? I thought it would be the opposite that living without technology and society would make you work out more for stuff like food, building huts, just trying to survive in general but apparently not in this case. She constantly treats Tarzan like shit and gets jealous on every female introduced with their ALWAYS great bodies too she wishes she still have but never once do the fat joke go away as I thought it would do so if you read this review and that thought cross your mind then yeah, it never goes away and not her irredeemable behavior either. Atleast she got less annoying in the tournament arcs but not by much. And then we got our bland MC Tarzan that just take all this stuff, acts like an idiot all the time and being a pervert that always gets boners whenever he see the newly introduced female in each episodes and again the cover giving me the wrong impression because here I thought he would be sort of stoic badass that protects the jungle but I guess I've watched too much Fist of the North Star so maybe that's my fault for thinking that but still doesn't make his character any less bland, or maybe he's annoying too.When it comes to the supporting cast then they are all over the place like Helen, the first girl introduced that had a crush on Tarzan quickly got forgotten even though technically she was still there at their place in Africa but I guess no one cared anymore once they ditched her always when they took off to the country tournaments took place in never taking her with them, oh well. Ryou and Pedro are just fine, not too much personality to even distinguish between them tbh, both are fighters that just want to learn more and get stronger, nothing wrong with that but not too interesting either and shame you never get much background info on these characters for me to give a shit about them, given how little I did it could have a impact. There is a character I genuinely liked though (is this my first thing I mention I actually liked?!) and that's Anabebe and his antics, his jokes and rivalry with Tarzan was pretty funny I have to say and there is a point he gets rich and that makes him like an entirely different characters and you just never knew with that guy what he would do next, sadly he got underused a lot more later on as it became more about Tarzan in general but still for me he was my favorite character in this whole mess.Artstyle & Sound:What were they even thinking when making these character designs? alright the bodies are fine both for the male & female, they are all respectively either buff or busty and they are all sexy with the exception of Jane which somehow got shorter when she became fat because that's an anime trope thing I guess... but what is up with those derpy faces? their mouth to nose ratio are so close to each other to it just looks weird with most of them having a huge chin, especially noticeable on all the females, so click on Jane's character profile pic here on MAL and you'll notice immediately, every female and some males are like that in this and it really bothered me at the start but then I got used to it later on but still that's not a very good design and it being old or based on the original source is no excuse, the mouths could be just a little more closer to the chin like come on now. It's also weird when so many of them just looks the same but with different hairstyle/hair-colors, it's like they are all the same design with just added accessory on their head. Most of them do look different but there were just some minor characters that looked too much like some of the main cast so it made me confused sometimes but that was fine since it was only the minor characters that showed up in the tournament arcs.As for sound I'm sure they only really got the composer to make 2-3 different OSTs that gets used throughout the whole anime, also the first theme song gets used a lot in hype moments where Tarzan punch out someone and even though they always repeat I have to say I am a fan of that song and it did actually make those moments more hype even for me that disliked this anime those were still one of the better moments to those dragged out tournament arcs.So those are my thoughts, wouldn't really recommend it to anyone and it was 50 episodes long too and the manga cover much more than that and hey maybe that is better paced etc than this garbage but after this I wouldn't even want to give it a try and it's barely even translated anyways. Even to people that want their ""manly men"" fix from the 80/90s like Fist of the North Star, JoJo, Be A Man! Samurai School etc they won't get it here, trust me.";Not Recommended
0;Himesama Goyoujin;megara;https://myanimelist.net/profile/megara;5;I gave this anime a try after looking at the art. I thought it was cute and the story looked promising.Well, I won't exactly call watching this a big mistake, but boy did I have a hard time finishing it. The main character Himeko is so annoyingly dumb that I wanted to quit watching it by the 2nd episode. The only redeeming character for me was Na-Na and I couldn't understand anything that she said.One good thing about this series is the opening song. It's catchy and I found myself singing and bopping my head to it.But overall, I would have to say that it was just okay.

1;Himesama Goyoujin;Karlo_C;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Karlo_C;6;"This anime, according to that person(pointing up), is for girls.But I'm a guy with a female avatar and since nobody wants to review this crazy series then I will.The story is about a xenophobic girl named Himeko(Christy) who was on her way to school to face her tyrannic tennis coach when all of a sudden two thieves appeared in front of her then they somehow swapped belongings. The thieves were carrying with them a crown which can turn any female into a princess. Not long after the crown gets stuck on Himeko's head. Everything gets wackier soonafter.I'm very much surprised at the somewhat light-hearted description I see on MAL. Life into turmoil, typical xenopho...this anime is wacky! It's crazy! It's downright insane!. . .The idea of someone accidentally turning into royalty is a cliche in the world of anime. The way this idea is used in this anime, however, is pretty unique. Hime-Sama Goyojin is bombarded with several nonsensical, stupid and (synonym) situations which surprisingly doesn't blur the storyline.It's animation I cannot praise. In my opinion it would've done much better. Yes the art is the cutesy-styled Nomad but Bandai Visual's involved. The characters are well-designed enough but the backgrounds are very lazily done. I would've given it a lower rating but a 4 because of its form of comedy.And I like the way they look like sticks when they're running.Being a comedy anime, the soundtrack's jolly. The high-pitched voices and merry tune of the singers makes me wanna dance. The theme song videos are lively too.Sound. Read the next statement please.The characters are all funny in some way but character development is absent. I like the characters though. A xenophobic fake princess, a nonsense talking little princess, two thieves working for an organization of people wearing black cat costumes and many more.*MILD SPOILER WARNING* oh I was suppose to put this up there.Though I gave three exclamatory sentences in the first statement, I never said it's terrible. It actually gave a me a lot of enjoyment. It can be annoying at times especially Himeko's ignorance and excessive crying but all of that will be erased from you memory if you concentrate on other characters.&quot;You are under arrest for treason of indecency!&quot; who wouldn't laugh at that.Overall I think this is a funny but flawed anime.

0;Within the Bloody Woods;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;5;"Esta review también está en español.Within the Bloody Woods (WtBW) is the fourth work of Nagao Takena (the only one in this page that didn't have a review until now n_n), and brings a few new features.First, it's episodic: there are two chapters, unlike the other shorts, which were self conclusive. Second, there are voices! But I will expand about this later...WtBW is about a man wondering in a dark wood. Fortunately, he meets a person. Unfortunately, that person's a zombie! But not everything is lost: our protagonist (for some reason) has a machete, and is willing to fight bravely against the undead!The animation is quite good, in Takena's lines of quality. Very, very superior to his earlier works (Battle of Clay 1 and 2), and quite similar to the one in Bloody Night. The characters are in the realistic side of the specter (that means, no dummies or anthropomorphic animals, just people). In the special effects department, we have a few scenes in slow motion, but, instead of being flashy or spectacular, is pretty darn funny. And the landscapes, well... Bloody woods must be the first wood without trees xDSound... well, no music. At all. As for the voices, we have two. On one hand, we have our friend the zombie, which sounds so much like their friends in Resident Evil, that they probably used the same seiyuu xD. And in the same line of RE, we have the dialogues of our hero (which, by the way, are in english!). Seriously, the voice acting is so bad/hammy, that if this weren't Takena and was, instead, something a bit more massive, lines such as ""Are you alright?"" or ""Jesus!"" will be huge memes, like Master of Unlocking or Jill Sandwich. The other sounds, like the hitting, slicing or bloodspalsh, are correct (colorful at best, but correct).In summary, this is another title recommended for Takena fans, and for people who want to try new stuff (cause, you know, the horror genre with clay is not very abundant). Plus, the voice acting is so bad is good (I really think it is a tribute to the classic RE, specially the first one), and the action is so outrageously violent, that is funny. Unfortunately, there's something quite bad: although there are two episodes, at the end of the second it was quite obvious it was supposed to be a continuation, which sadly, was never done. But hey, it's not like the whole experience is ruined or anything.And like I always say: if you liked this short, I recommend the other works of Nagao Takena, especially Bloody Date.--------Within the Bloody Woods (WtBW) es el cuarto trabajo de Nagao Takena (el único que nos faltaba en esta pag n_n) y trae varias novedades. Primero, es episódico: hay dos capítulos, a diferencia de todos los otros cortos, que eran autoconclusivos. Segundo: hay voces! Pero de estas voy a ampliar más adelante...WtBW trata sobre un hombre deambulando en un bosque. Por suerte, encuentra a una persona. Por desgracia, esa persona es un zombie! Pero no todo está perdido: nuestro protagonista (por alguna razón) tiene un machete, y está dispuesto a vender cara su vida!La animación es bastante buena, en las líneas de Takena. Muy, muy superior a la de sus primeros trabajos (como Battle of Clay 1 y 2), y similar a la vista es Bloody Night. Los personajes están hechos en de forma “realista” (o sea, forma humana, y no monigotes o animales antropomórficos), y en cuanto a los efectos especiales, tenemos un par de escenas hechas en cámara lenta, que mas que espectacular, son muy, muy cómicas. Por el lado del paisaje, estamos en lo que debe ser el primer bosque sin árboles xD.El sonido... bueno no hay música. De ningún tipo. Y en cuanto a las voces, tenemos dos. Por un lado tenemos a nuestro amigo el zombie, que suena tan parecido a sus congeneres de Resident Evil, que bien podría ser el mismo actor de voz xD. Y en la misma línea de RE están los diálogos de nuestro protagonista no muerto (que por cierto, están en ingles). En serio, sus líneas tienen una entonación tan cómica, que si esto no fuera Takena y fuera algo de llegada más masiva, “Are you alright?” y “Jesus!” serian memes de la talla de Master of Unlocking o Jill Sandwich. El resto de los sonidos, como los golpes y la salida de sangre, son correctos (pintorescos, pero correctos).En resumen, este es otro título recomendable para los fans de Takena, y para aquellos que quieran probar con algo distinto (por que vamos, el género del terror con plastilina no es muy abundante xD). Además, las voces son tan malas que son buenas (en lo que realmente considero es un homenaje a los Resident Evil clásicos, especialmente al primero), y la acción transcurre de forma tan pintorescamente violenta, que es cómico. El punto más negro que veo en este trabajo es que, si bien hay dos episodios, al final del segundo es más que obvio que se pensaba continuar, cosa que al final no se hizo. Por lo que nos quedamos con las ganas de ver el final :(. Pero bueno, tampoco es algo que arruine la experiencia.Y lo de siempre: si les gusto este corto, recomiendo los otros trabajos de Nagao Takena, especialmente Bloody Date.";Mixed Feelings

Everything i have seen clay related have passed my skills so i generally wont give a 1 or a 2.Likesthe writer or plot remained true per-say. I say that for after first episode it continue in the second right where episode 1 left off. However, when episode 2 ended it was followed with a to be continued. Granted, that could have been error, lack of funds, an indication of Within the Bloody Woods 2, or anything. So, to be fair i will give the benefit of the doubt and not show too much critique in that retrospect. Although, would have been nice if it was a couple of those listed above if they went back in episode 2 and changed it.I would say more but that is all i liked.Dislikessound: it was nice to hear a natural English speaker for a change. Although, that speaker should have been canned from the get go. The only reason to have kept him was for a character that is either caught in a time dilemma, smoking weed, 'special' character, not a character whom is faced with evil. I think that is the main reason why this horror did not scare me. For it was very clear on the ears the vocalist did not have good enthusiasm . just saw this as another paycheck. ""oh i have to read this? Okay, how much will i get paid? That much?! So, little. *demonstrates sadness in the vocal reading.""Intro to the art was rather choppy on both episodes. I.e. the frame rate was slow.

To win these seven sabers, Yukito must face off against their lusty owners in a sensual skirmish, where sex is the name of the game, and the winner is the one who can keep going the longest!Hooligan (AKA: Hooligan: Quest for the Seven Holy Dildos) is filled with what I like to call ""Almost Jokes"". ""Almost Jokes"" are jokes that have a solid premise an obvious idea of where they wanted to go, but just fall short of being funny due to a mix of having a poor execution and missing the mark with the ""punchlines"". And this short OVA is filled with nothing but ""Almost Jokes"".For example, in the second episode, the show tries to make fun of the tournament arcs that a lot of fighting shounen have. If it was done right, it could have been a mildly amusing sex version of said arc, where it spends the whole episode dragging out the sex in the same way Dragon Ball Z infamously dragged out it's fights. It's sad that the jokes in the English outtakes have slightly (very slightly) better jokes.The animation is not that great either. I know that animation shouldn't really matter much in a hentai, since the whole thing is there just for someone to jerk off to, but it can still be distracting if it still doesn't reach a certain level of quality. The art style is a bit better for what that's worth, but is a good art style really going to make up for in a hentai of all things?This two episode OVA is the worst kind of sex comedy. The one where the comedy is lame and the sex is unappealing. Would I recommend this? No, not really. Especially not when there are better comedy hentai out there, such as, Toumei Ningen R (The Invisible Stud Returns), Teizokurei Daydream, and Spaceship Agga Ruter, which is written and created by Masaki Kajishima, and set in the same universe as ""Tenchi Muyo!

0;Ganbare Genki;Dotanuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Dotanuki;10;Genki... An anime classic.I regularly watched the Genki on tv back in the early 90s. It was amazing... The anime started with strong Father and Son bond. Genki and his Father were trying to survive under the harsh circumtances of the concuret jungle.

Father and Son would run for miles together every morning as an excersise.Then, the tragedy stroke, Because of mal nutrution, Genki's Father was having hard time execising and fighting...

0;Fantasia;BlokeTokes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlokeTokes;5;"I happened to run into this on YouTube and was drawn by the title, ""Fantasia"". A title of that caliber generally brings to the imagination something special, containing some unique quality. It may also bring to mind the old Disney movie for those who've seen it (I would have to admit I haven't as of yet). While it wasn't known until after in my case, the OVA was even worked on by the people who did the first ""Ghost in the Shell"" movie a couple of years after. Production I.G. would be those people and they certainly chose a relatable name, in a way still being relatable to those of the anime community. That relatable feeling may feel different to each person, however.Production I.G. doesn't disappoint with their visual work, and does a great job working with proportions and keeping animation stable with a good sensation of a 3D object on the screen at times. It is less apparent to see that type of animation now, as it seems now the attention has shifted to maximizing the actual motion, but there's still a lot of motion here to be had. The sound work met the requirements to flow with the visuals, yet it didn't stick out at any time and didn't immerse or play particularly catchy songs. The animation is only around twenty years old, but I have to say if any animation was to be considered timeless, it is likely this kind as it always feels perfectly proportioned. Production I.G. also did a fairly well job at directing Fantasia as it features some interesting animation for the bland setting, and some interesting angles and character movements.So, it's good to know Production I.G. wasn't cheapening out on the design of Fantasia superficially, but the same could certainly not be said to the actual content of the story. If I were to cut it short, Fantasia features your average, high-school boy having come upon a magical girl. Relatable, yes? Don't expect too much to find that will surprise you in this setting. The characters are as you would expect, the magical girl being exceptionally weak and desperate in this case. A surprising subtlety this time, however, was that there was brief attempted justification for it. It was definitely brief, but given the comical situation the characters were placed in, I could fairly say it convinced me to a small extent. Besides the magical girl, the boy is dropped in the typical love-triangle situation and he acts relatively as one who's seen anime with similar premises would expect. He was able to get me to do a small chuckle from one of his lines, and he is emotive thanks to the visuals, but he's dry as is everyone present here. The characters all feel reasonably justified for their moods, but that's the limit to the character descriptions they carry.The story around the magical girl isn't too unique in general, involving a magical rug, but it's enjoyably simple and relatable again. Nothing is taken seriously in the context, while the direction seems to battle the ridiculousness they have to work with simultaneously. It molds conflicting moods at times, but by the mid-point everyone can safely agree there is nothing to be taken seriously in Fantasia. The design for the villain and all the characters looks as it would in the 90's, and it could add to the enjoyment a bit as it can add to the ridiculousness. The designs are simplistic, and so is basically everything beyond the Production I.G. work. An interesting thing to question, however, is who this is even directed at. There is ecchi scenes with the magical girl, yet the other girl characters all look very reasonable. That is odd if the direction was at the perverted, but it could make sense if the one girl gave the audience plenty of service in her screen-time. She doesn't, however, only being with the main boy closely for about a third of the OVA. The rest is filled with flat drama and non-ecchi characters, at least to today's standards.I can't be sure who this was made for, but Production I.G. felt the need to create Fantasia. Production I.G. doesn't hold back too much though and still creates a visually pleasing short. To the writing, it doesn't take an expert to come to the conclusion that it's very uninspired. It has its own magical girl take on her fantasy history, but that's about it. From the start, though, the simplistic town setting doesn't set expectations too high, and I can't say what is here isn't enjoyable. There is some enjoyment to be had with Fantasia's silliness, and some may like it more or less than others, but there isn't much worth to put this OVA on a high priority. It was a pleasure to watch visually and it's short length surely aids that. The OVA does feel like the pilot for your typical boy meets magical girl series and it doesn't end with an ending that gives closure. From the over-done nature of the premise, however, the viewer can safely imagine what happens counting up the conclusions of all the other series I know they've seen in the same bucket. I didn't feel unsatisfied because of it, and because of the nonchalant viewing. Fantasia is worth a watch if one can bear everything I mention to it, but it isn't anything you have to worry about at the moment.*By the way, the art in the actual OVA is much better than what is shown in the MAL cover of it.

1;Fantasia;supermario4ever;https://myanimelist.net/profile/supermario4ever;5;I can't believe, that Production I.G, which animated such masterpieces, like Haikyuu!!, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, created a totally mediorce anime in the ancient time with full of fan services.Akihiro is a big otaku, who doesn't have much success with girls. They only live in his fantasy. One day he gets a magic carpet, where a beautiful girl comes out from. She has magic abilities, and uses it imprudently, and cause problems to Akihiro. So, the girl is pretty, but clumsy. The girl, Maron falls in love with Akihiro, and wants him to take to her world and live together with him. He goes, but Akihiro doesn't have time to admire Maron's world, because another girl, Roll appeared, who always wants to kill Maron. Who's this girl, and what she want from Maron?Who knows. The complete OVA is about 30 mintues long, and as you can read, the story is really poor. But what really nice in this OVA, is the art and animation. It seems, the Production I.G always did the best in animation. It's very nice compared to other animes from the beginning of the 90s.I would highlight Furumoto Shinnosuke, who was the seiyuu of Akihiro. I think, he's the most underrated seiyuu, I really like his voice. He has similar voice, like Yamaguchi Kappei, but unfortunately he was casted in very few animes. I think, he deserved much more.The music is also quite good. The theme song is performed by Okui Masami, who's like muse for me in japanese music. This is her debut song, and I think, it's ideal as debut song, it forecasted a very good singing career, as Okui Masami had during the years. On the theme song single a radio dorama of the anime is also available.Well, the anime is not like a miracle, but if you feel like, you want to watch an anime with fan services just for fun, then, it's ideal for it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Fantasia;Timz0r;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Timz0r;3;"From the studio Production I.G. that have blessed us an one episode OVA from 1993 called Fantasia. I have no idea why they made this, but I'm sure they should have used the time investment in creating this in something better instead of making this one episode OVA.Story: 2/10 (Horrible)If you can expect a good story in one episode of 25 minutes long, you're wrong. The ""story"" pretty boils down to a dude that trips over a carpet and later stumbles down on a pink haired magical girl on the pretty much one of the most stereotypical way guys stuble upon anime girls because anime physics. The OVA tries to tell us a story with pretty much every anime trope you can think off that was popular in the '90 jammed into 25 minutes and fails. I've seen average hentai in the past that contains a better plot that did made more sense and I'm not even joking.Art: 5/10 (Average)As this OVA got released in 1993, you can expect the typical art-style from the '90's. For modern standards you can write it off as 'bad', but in 1993 I think the art-style would be decent for it's time. Some may like it, some don't.Sound: 4/10 (Bad)The audio, well, I don't think it's that good. It's just your typical sound effects from the 90's and quite bad voice acting combined together. I even can't recall anymore I've heard any music used aswell, but as you guess by now I was not very fond of the sound in general.Charather: 3/10 (Very Bad)The charathers are very bland in pretty much every way possible. I've seen much more interessing charathers in similair shows.Enjoyment: 3/10 (Very Bad)I'm going to be honest and I really didn't liked the time investment for the one episode OVA. It was quite boring to say the least and I could have done something more productive with that small half hour. Sure, it was only about a small half hour, but still...Overall: 3/10 (Very Bad)In overall, I don't really recommend this one episode OVA unless you really want to waste a small half hour watching popular anime tropes of the '90's and hearing comical sound effects jammed in together that tries to tell you a story.";Not Recommended
1;Fantasia;Fel_Temp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fel_Temp;3;Quite possibly the most generic magic girlfriend show ever made. The generic teenage protagonist finds a fancy carpet by the garbage that he takes home in hopes of impressing a girl, but surprise, the carpet actually contains a whole fantasy world in it somehow and a dumb, magic powered girl comes through it boobs first and decides she's in love with him. None of that makes any more sense in context, nor does it manage to be interesting or funny. Characters just show up, do something uninteresting and/or stupid, and then it eventually ends. Everything about this is done far, far better in countless series.;Not Recommended

It lacks in many ways. Story, sound, character. It's a basic retelling of the mythos of Susano'o. Although, making him a more likable character. But the art!Oh my, the art!It's absolutely beautiful. I love animation of all kinds. I don't care where it's from, I love animation. The techniques, the history. I see on Wikipedia that when this first came out it made quite the splash in animation circles and I can see why! The scene with the dancer luring Amaterasu out of her cave, and of Orochi drinking the sake. And the fight with Orochi was truly something to behold!For anyone on their own journey into a love of animation I would highly recommend this film.Fair warning there are some standard old school prejudices on display.;Recommended
1;Wanpaku Ouji no Orochi Taiji;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;10;After five films trying to imitate the whirlwind success of Disney for Japanese audiences that disappointed my expectations in one way or another, TOEI doga finally find their footing and discover a unique identity that would lay the seeds for modern anime, dramatic and complex battle choreography and perhaps most modern Kaiju movies.Susanoo and the Yamato no Orochi sets its sights on portraying the creation story at the center of Japanese myth itself - Susanoo's search for his mother, the female creator of the Island Nation, Izanami, who departed into heaven. Susanoo is a herculean individual who fails to comprehend the vastness of his own physical strength and how it puts him at odds with the relatively fragile world around him. At the same time, a veil of innocence shields his mind from the deeper truths of the world and bolsters his bull headed optimism.The writers of this movie finally managed to crack the code of the perfect balance in narrative progression and the need to water down the ideas for younger audience. The Disney inspired background characters that have been a forceful addition to most of the previous TOEI doga films take a backseat and Susanoo ends up with just a single animal companion, whose presence does not interfere with the broader narrative focus of the film.The story is constantly fixtured on Susanoo himself, and the journey of his increasing collection of companions until he encounters the titular Yamata no Orochi - a Japanese mythological demon with some physiological similarities to the hydra. The reveal of this particular demon itself, was one of the most amazing sequences ever brought to realization in Japanese animation. A long sequence in poorly lit dusk lingers on the vast shadows of the eight gigantic serpent heads as the battle music reminiscent of world War 2 propaganda films slowly builds tension and emphasizes the sheer scale of this tyrannical opponent.;Recommended
0;Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi;Nate515;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nate515;8;I didn't even know this anime existed until I saw the movie pop up in my recommendations by a friend. Since I'm an anime fan, I immediately searched the movie on here and found out it had a tv adaptation. After enjoying the movie version quite a bit, I was wanting to check out the TV series. However, after reading a review saying it was incomplete, I was hesitant. Anime is notorious for leaving open ended endings, some will still leave you with a wholesome feeling towards the end while others will leave a gaping hole that might keep you up at night and regretful you ever tried. I don't like the push to manga as I don't read manga, period.Anyhow, after much debate, I decided to give it a try. A previous review said how the series lack in many ways to the movie but I kind of enjoyed this tv series more than the movie. While the movie did give this show a conclusion, the tv series had the luxury to give you time to let it soak in. The bond between the characters and relationship that formed had more time and room to grow and shape itself. I'm also glad to say that, though the anime ended a bit prematurely, it did cover the main parts of the show and the ending was not so bad, though I was saddened it didn't continue for another 12 episodes or so.The voice acting for this anime was perfect for me. The two main characters had adorable voices that fit them very well.I also very much adored the CG animation. Their CG wasn't great in details, but their facial and body movements were very energetic, full of life, charismatic, and on point for me. It was one of the main reasons that made me fall in love with this, everything just fits. Perfect? No way, but the most important stuff I think they got it right.This is a real feel good anime, it brought a smile to my face and I really needed one. Even though the anime was aimed at kids, as an adult, I appreciate the message that it was showing and there were some conflicts that show that deep down it had a more complex and thoughtful plot and message. I would definitely recommend anyone that liked the movie to watch. Sad that there weren't more episodes, but happy that it didn't get milked to the point where I hated it.;Recommended
0;CCW: Crazy Clay Wrestling;Samimaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Samimaru;10;"A wonderfully creative and inventive sports anime from arguably the industry's freshest director, Nagao Takena.Centered around the conflict between the Red Wrestler (listed on MAL as ""Orange"" but generally referred to as Red Wrestler within the fandom) and the Yellow Wrestler, portrayed as a wrestling match on a surface level, C.C.W. is a microcosm of the duality of man.The animation is excellent, rivaling such esteemed claymation works as The Wrong Trousers and Takena's earlier work Within the Bloody Woods. The action is fluid and the impact visceral.The soundtrack and sound design are also noteworthy, with tracks such as ""CCW theme"" and repeated audio motifs like ""3 2 1"" contributing immensely thematically.C.C.W.'s characters are primarily simple, representing internal conflict within the human psyche as well as greater societal issues faced by humanity today. The ""X-factor,"" if you will, can be said to be the unnamed announcer character, who, by my reading, represents an outside arbiter of human civilization, perhaps God or an advanced alien species.Arguably C.C.W.'s strongest element is its mastery of pacing. I've heard somewhat paradoxical complaints in the past of it being paced ""too well"" (leading to the viewer neglecting real-life responsibilities for the sake of watching and rewatching) and such concerns are understandable but I frankly disagree. The series maintains such a masterful control over its suspense and tension that its cathartic moments (especially near the end) carry an impact similar to slow-burn television series such as Aria.Overall I enjoyed C.C.W immensely, and consider it one of my favorite anime. For further recommendations I'd posit any of Nagao Takena's other works, especially No Littering, Pussycat, and Shitcom.Final score: 10/10";Recommended

0;CCW: Crazy Clay Wrestling;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;5;Esta review también está en español.CCW: Crazy Clay Wrestling is a six-minute short directed by Nagao Takena, a specialist in claymation. CCW is basically a wrestling match between a yellow little man and a red little man, in a ring which, curiously, has no ropes. The fight is pretty intense (read: violent) in the wrestling standards, but nothing compared to the other works of Mr. Takena, which are, well, quite brutal.The animation is well done (I personally love claymation, thanks to PSOne's cult classic SkullMonkeys), stop motion animation with clay dudes pounding each other. The hits and keys are based on actual wrestling moves, and are well executed. Everything is very artisanal. As for the character design, a five years old could do it in less than five minutes xD.The sound is a weak point: although there isn't much, it can be very irritating, specially the constant CCW!, CCW!, CCW! chant. The cheers (yaaay) are as dull as possible.All in all, there's not much to say about this. CCW is, to say at least, an interesting short. Just two clayman wrestling, nothing more. I think it worth watching for the style (I already say I find it very appealing), after all, claymation is not that abundant. I recommend it for the simple fact that it's only six minutes long, so is not that big of a loss if you don't like it anyways.For those who enjoy this style of animation, I recommend the other works of Takena, especially Bloody Date and Chainsaw Maid. In general, those are better than this one (more stuff happens, better story and characters), but beware: BD and CM are sick, sick gorefest (so, if you are not in the violent stuff, don't watch those).--------CCW: Crazy Clay Wrestling es un corto de seis minutos dirigido por Nagao Takena, un especialista en claymation. Es, básicamente un encuentro de lucha libre entre un hombrecito amarillo y uno rojo en cuadrilátero, que, curiosamente, no tiene cuerdas. La pelea es bastante cruenta para los estándares de la lucha libre, pero nada comparada con los otros trabajos del señor Takena, que son, lisa y llanamente, brutales.La animación está muy bien hecha, tecnología en stop motion con hombrecitos de arcilla golpeándose. Los golpes y las llaves se basan en movimientos de lucha reales, y están bien ejecutados. Muy artesanal todo. En cuanto al diseño de personaje, ninguno de nosotros tardaría más de dos minutos en hacerlos xD.El sonido es un punto flojo: aunque no hay mucho, puede llegar a ser muy, muy irritante, especialmente los constantes gritos de CCW, CCW, CCW! Los vítores (yaaay!) tienen menos onda que un renglón.En resumen, porque no hay mucho más que decir, CCW es un corto, como mínimo, interesante. Son solo dos hombrecitos de plastilina golpeándose. Pero vale la pena verlo por el estilo, dado que la claymation no abunda. Al menos a mi me parece muy atrayente. Recomiendo verlo por el simple hecho de que dura solo seis minutos, así que tampoco es que se pierda mucho.A los que les guste este estilo de animación, recomiendo los otros trabajos de Takena, especialmente Bloody Date y Chainsaw Maid. Son, a líneas generales, mejores que este, pasan más cosas, hay mejor diseño de personajes, y hasta hay una historia (especialmente en Bloody Date... es muy bueno, en serio)... pero cuidado, son extremadamente violentos y perturbadores.

The characters are well designed and the movement is pretty good. The backgrounds could've been more detailed, but it is fine.Sound:There are two versions of CCW on YouTube. One of them is the original with no sound, and the other is one with sound. The one without sound would be a 1 because there is no sound, but I am rating the one with sound. During the entire duration of the video there is what I presume to be the audience chanting ""CCW"" over and over with a reaction to what is happening here and there. The CCW chanting can get a bit irritating. When the clay characters are attacking each other there is a mix of mouth sounds, punch sounds, and 8-bit style sounds. Overall, the sound is okay.Characters:The characters are bad nor good. You never hear them talk but they fight and have their own moves.Overall:I enjoyed CCW for what it is.

1;Gondora;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;1;"It's rated under five for a good reason. It's all style, no substance, and the style isn't even very good. Furthermore, the sounds and music are annoying, and the runtime is only about a minute, so you can't expect any depth. As a fan of both Katsuhiro Otomo and Studio 4C, there really isn't much here to see. For completionists only. The beginning zoom on the character shown on the title art is quite psychedelic. He's shown from a few different angles, and is composited over some live action footage, as if simulating the man moving through a crowd. Another man with a tea kettle on his head walks into the room, confronting the first character. They both make strange sounds at each other. The end! What?Eh, just a random experimental animation short done on a shoestring budget. Don't be mistaken by anyone who tries to apply meaning to this and also suggests it's actually GOOD solely because it is obtuse and leaves us to grasp at some potential meaning. I'm sure Otomo had some concept in mind, and you can decide it's about whatever, but even if we arrive to a concrete conclusion as to the meaning, this is very shallow art. It has very little to say; it is not thought provoking; it does not entertain; it's not even particularly interesting from a design standpoint.This is barely above abstract expressionist art in terms of its primitivity. The short just depicts an abstract concept in an emotional manner--seemingly little more than glorifying the headspace of two odd individuals, and since I suppose that's an American bomber on the man's head, then this might also have something to say about the continued occupation and shame of being a puppet state of the U.S. empire; the kettle is the building pressure of the Japanese people--except it seems to be more of a release valve, as the once prideful Japanese have become meek and will continue to do the bidding of their overlord. Yeah, see, I can do the same thing, but I won't pretend that makes this more valuable as art than a banana taped to a wall. Who cares? This production is trash.";Not Recommended

If you're enjoying the Star Twinkle series I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy this movie. The fight scenes are really well animated relative to the series and you get some good character interactions out of it.

0;Wan Jie Du Zun;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;Ten Thousand Worlds is a cultivation donghua where the Main character Lin Feng awakens a powerful emperor level 7 sword spirit only to get betrayed by his fiance. He is stabbed in the back by his fiance and she absorbs his emperor level 7 sword spirit attacking the Lin family elders and crippling Lin Feng. In his near death experience, Lin Feng awakens inside a mysterious pendant that holds the graveyard of the gods and his goal is to consume all the gods within 20 years or he will perish and set them free in the process. His ability allows him to refine the gods powers and cultivate hundreds of times faster than normal cultivators. Lin Feng's path of revenge starts with awakening the double martial soul spirits Pheonix bloodline and sword spirit - it's impossible for a cultivator to have double martial soul spirits in the land of Ten Thousand Worlds.Story: 4/10The story seems promising with this betrayal style introduction. However, it follows many other donghua's weaknesses in that literally the entire series Lin Feng fights small fry opponents from his family and other families and he is so merciful that it repetitively bites him in the back. He also repeatedly hides behind his grandfather, the head of the Lin Family in his city. This style of fighting small fry opponents and hiding gets recycled throughout the series making it very uninteresting. There is a lot of filler events in the series that by the time the story really takes place, it's already episode 42.Art & Sound: 5/10Nothing really interesting in terms of acknowledgeable achievement for art or sound. There was a sense of suspenseful music in the fight against the Luo family elder at the Lin family tower around episode 39 but apart from that nothing much. The art is ok for a 3D CGI donghua it's not choreography-wise significant but it is more appetizing than Spirit Sword Sovereign S1 and S2.Character: 4/10Ten Thousand Worlds doesn't value character development. The characters are empty, only serving the purpose to either fight against Lin Feng or join his side inevitably running away or being forgotten. The Luo family attacked Lin Feng in the mountains and Lin Feng somehow defeated them with his overpowered sword spirit but they literally were fine after a few scenes. That makes no sense, he squashed 8 cultivators and he mercifully lets them go after he runs into lava - Only for them to visit the Lin family in the future to fight and lost AGAIN. After the first time, surely Lin Feng would kill them to prevent retaliation but instead he just seals them inside his pendant and their grudge just gets worse. This style of back and forth fighting is a wasteful to develop characters especially with a short series like this it would have been better to stick to a smaller scale of world building and character establishment.Overall: 4/10Ten Thousand Worlds had an appealing beginning but it wasted the potential by wasting screen time on useless characters. The revenge on Lin Feng's fiance is literally pushed to the side despite being the entire series existence. I expect this to have follow up seasons so it makes sense that Ten Thousand Worlds would have a wide story and characters but it doesn't manage it well in 5 hours worth of screen time.;Not Recommended
0;Ogenki Clinic;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;2;"This terribly drawn hentai from 1991 still doesn't have a MAL review?! (Laughs in Hero) ""Never Fear! Because I am here!""Ogenki clinic is an early 90s hentai by AC Create. They're a studio that created this, a dumpster fire called ""My My Mai"" and then immediately went out of business. Apparently they had some kind of working relationship with JC Staff but were liquidated for their incompetence.The director of this bizarre hentai is Takashi Watanabe, whose work I've covered quite a few times. He's made some utter trash, but he's always entertaining. He's the man who directed all the Slayers series, Black Lion, Ikki Tousen, Freezing, and of course the original adaptation of Boogiepop Phantom that I reviewed back in January! He's also no stranger to hentai since he had previously worked on ""Weather Report Girl"" about an evil weather girl that rapes her co-workers.So what is Ogenki Clinic about? Well...have you seen Kuchuu Buranko? It's the tale of a highly eccentric doctor and his sexy nurse that uses unconventional methods to treat unusual medical cases. Now imagine Kuchuu Buranko was a poorly written hentai with the worst drawn breasts in the world! Seriously, I think Satoshi Urushihara saw these tits and wept inconsolably for 3 days.Each episode features several patients, who often get referred to Dr. Ogenki by Tokyo's top prostitute. Basically, if she can't make them cum or they have some kind of weird fetish that's an inconvenience to them, she refers them to the Ogenki Sex Clinic to get cured. The first case is a man who has never been able to ejaculate in his entire life. Dr. Ogenki's nurse uses her brilliant detective skills to discern the man is transgender and identifies as a woman. She then dresses him up as a woman and fucks him up the ass with a strap-on, which causes him to cum immediately. Now he is cured and can begin his new life as a transgender woman. This hentai is surprisingly progressive for 1991 Japan! That also epitomises Takashi Watanabe. You think you know exactly where he's going and then he just nails you with an out of nowhere CROSS COUNTER!The second sketch features a man who is extremely good looking, but feels remorse that his sexual performance doesn't live up to his good looks and leads to women being disappointed. Now he can only have sex dressed as Batman. Yeah...I'm lost too. She cures him by showing him the importance of looking into your lover's face and seeing their expressions of pleasure. He vows to never have sex in a mask again...then proceeds to fuck the nurse doggie style and thus completly undermine that entire speech. God damn it Watanabe! You're a MAD MAN!Overall:I can safely say you won't be fapping to this one. The art here is BAAD and the only reason to watch is for the god awful dub. Fortunately, you can watch this entire masterpiece on Pornhub, which still has less viruses and pop-ups than Kissanime or Animefreak. Another bonus is that the at least ostensibly sexy nurse is played by Tiffany Vollmer, who played Bulma in Funimation's first dub of Dragonball and DBZ before being replaced by Monica Rial for Kai. If you're looking for some cheap laughs, this is worth watching at least 1 episode.";Not Recommended

Sure, it is silly, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense, though I must say how this is less thought-provoking, in a literal sense, than meets the eye. However, something about this title shoots out to you, not like anything I have seen before.What is beauty?To me or any sane person, this work doesn't look really beautiful at all, everything here is a juxtaposition. It has vibrant colours sure, but it has deformed characters who've seen the aftermath of radiation turning their face into molten. It is an ugly thing. I am not entirely sure as to what it is Tanaami is getting at with ""beauty"". But this presentation is really a matter to go on and discuss on. It isn't the kind of anime to be devoid of message nor a clear message. It's one that needs elaborating on, be it by yourself or between multiple parties.Maybe I am thinking about it too much, but my reaction to this was just amazing as well. Kinda makes your head spin a little, maybe nauseous if you are unfortunate enough.

1;Adventures in Beauty Wonderland;aintnotamomi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/aintnotamomi;5;"I was originally convinced that this film was some sort of abstract meditation on beauty in relation to sameness and identity or something like that, until I saw that it was commissioned by Sephora, which led me to believe that what this really was was just a very eye-catching rendition of Alice in Wonderland made to serve as proof that Sephora's brand could be outside of the box, which is definitely a bit disappointing.It's hard to rate this using the same metrics as you would any other anime, since it's not meant to be consumed as such. As another review pointed out, although this is classified as anime by the site, it really is more like a fine art project, with no concrete story or characters. However, I'll give it a go:Story: N/AI'm sure the story behind Keiichi Tanaami's quest to procure the psychedelics necessary to produce this work was fascinating, but unfortunately, that's not what we're here to discuss. As I hinted at before, whatever ""story"" you want to see here is completely your own interpretation, since there's no real plotline that can be discerned from any of this. Sources say that it's an adaptation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but I have a hunch that it might be missing a few key scenes here and there. Then again, maybe I'm just not artsy or cool enough to notice them.If I had to guess, I'd say that it's about Eye-lice (Get it? HA HA? RIGHT???) venturing into the underworld to get her some of that bangin' new Too Faced collection from Sephora because it sold out on the surface world, only to find that all of her clones went down there to get it too, and now they're stuck there forever left to gaze upon reflections of their own pride and greed. Either that or the weirdest house party ever got flooded. You decide.Art: 5As much as I can appreciate what's been done here, it's hard to deny that it's a bit of an eyesore. The film is like an atom in that it never stops moving, not even for a second. Different parts move at different speeds and there are a million different parts for you to semi-focus on, though everything is so painfully vibrant that it feels like there is no real focus. It's not quite unbearable to the point of creating sensory overload, but it's difficult to digest since it's clearly meant to be as trippy as possible. I might have stronger opinions if I was under the influence, but, alas, I lack the proper facilities. However unpleasant it may be to look at at times, though, Tanaami's style is so distinct and yet so varied that it's hard not to at least be enthralled by the imagery. Yet knowing that this is all for some makeup megacorporation kind of frames whatever I thought it was in a different light.Sound: 5?Yup, there was definitely sound! No doubt about that!I just loved it how whenever one of the surely hundreds of eyeballs in this blinked, you couldn't miss it because it played something that sounded like the mating call of one of those sea creatures you find at the bottom of the ocean. It really helped me in understanding what the underlying themes of this film were: friendship and finding your way back home.Just kidding. The noise was f--king annoying.Like the artwork, the soundtrack here was ceaselessly busy, just noise after noise after noise, but I suppose the two went hand in hand, since the music was such a huge component of what created the sometimes uneasy atmosphere in this piece. There were definitely some...interesting...choices, like the brief inclusion of some slowed down moans from someone who was orgasming, giving birth, getting tortured, or all of the above, but that's for Keiichi Tanaami to understand and for the rest of us plebes to sit back and admire. So I guess it gets a 5, since I can't really think of anything else to give it.Character: N/AAre there characters? Is ""Alice"" a single character, several characters, the personification of some abstract concept, or merely a figment of our imaginations? Is the eyeball a motif or do each of the individual eyes count as characters, or are they all perhaps one character showing up in different forms? Do all of the figures floating down the river have backstories or do they start and end when we see them? Do I know? Do I care? As a matter of fact, no. No, I don't. Moving on!Overall: 5I can't believe I just wrote a review this long for something that is less than 5 minutes and doesn't even have an actual narrative, but that's art for ya, folks!Anyway, might watch whatever the hell this is if I ever decide to drop acid.";Mixed Feelings

I had a very much hard time knowing what the hell it was about (which really is a big con for me), it is inspired by alice in wonderland and I can see some connections but I can´t find any meaning in it, if you can, i would like to know :3but compared to Keiich´s other works, this one is totally different. Yes it is a mindfuck but it isn´t as perverted as many of his works is and it was kindda beautiful art and somewhat very fluent animation (he tends to use very flashy shifting frames which would trigger all epileptic people)so yeah this is not your average anime :3 But try it anyway, sometimes we need a dose of mindfuck :P";Not Recommended
0;Idol Bouei-tai Hummingbird;Rahkshilord;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rahkshilord;7;Sick of all those modern anime that try and shoehorn in idol singers into genres that have nothing to do with them, I decided to go back to the good old days of anime to watch this show about a group of fighter pilots that are also… idols.Oh.This ova is strange, a group of idol singers who are also also sisters and an elite fighter squadron defending Japan from… someone. Seriously, I don’t actually know who they’re fighting against, especially in episode 1 where a dogfight breaks out and we never learn who the other side is at all.Also, why Japan decided that idols were a good replacement for a military in this alternate future is beyond me, but this is also a show where the main idols base has a secret runway that raises out of the ocean… for their VTOL capable fighters. (for those who don’t know, that means they can take off straight up like a helicopter so they don’t need uh… a runway…)most of the show is a slice of life affair about these girls worrying about their idol careers and taking being Japan’s defensive line very casually, the tone is similar to other works around this time, like Aozora Shoujo Tai, except that was about stunt show pilots not actual military units fighting in battles.there’s various stories such as playing vollyball in some sort of idol contest, to defusing bombs using the powers of an Ouija board.Visually, it’s pretty standard for a 90s OVA series, both in animation quality and artstyle. Which isn’t to say that it’s bad, it holds up quite well in my opinion. The action scenes while not plentiful were nicely directed, and the animation was very smooth, especially when their idol rival duo show off their impressive ‘volume.’Voice acting is as expected of an early 90s series, background music is largely non existent in favor of a quieter tone, but what’s there is fine I guess I didn’t really notice it. The idol singing, obviously 90s jpop rather than modern styled jpop is far more to my liking, and you don’t get that much of it even in the 90s really.Now I get real annoyed that other reviews never mention sound design outside of music and voice acting, so I’ll do so right now! The plane sounds, while unremarkable, sound quite clear and realistic next to some other plane sounds in older anime, and are leaps above the likes of sci fi series macross’ and it’s weird sounding planes. The rest is as expected really.Overall, it’s a weird little show. Very under the radar despite not really having any noticeable problems besides being old and obscure. Which is, of course, a massive problem on MAL, where old shows basically don’t exist and nobody watches them but weirdos like me.B+/10;Recommended
0;Sakigake!! Otokojuku Movie;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;7;"A short film on a underrated manly battle shonen, Sakigake Otokojuku The Movie serves as an introduction to the series.The film's plot is straight to the point as we have our leading characters embark on a journey to America to participate in the tournament known as Great Battle August. Half the film is an outrageous road trip while the 2nd half are 4 rounds of 1 on 1 fighting.Not much can be learned from the characters by the movie alone aside from expressing manliness & the friendship they all shared on this short adventure. The only flaws to this film are the anti-climatic final fight & the lack of other main characters such as Date Omito & The Three Fists. (Same goes for Akashi Gouji who only gets a brief scene in the movie).But like the Otokojuku series, expect some last second rescues as characters miraculously survived their deadly encounters. Overall the film is great especially with its soundtrack that yells ""awesome 80's!!"" Like most shonen films, it merely has the beat up the bad guy scenario, but has its own flair as we follow the students of Otokojuku taking on various over the top challenges & will stop at nothing to succeed as they follow the spirit of Otokojuku.

1;Sakigake!! Otokojuku Movie;Hanma_Orochi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hanma_Orochi;7;HELLOO EVERYBOODY ! Let's start that review, this movie is a sequel to the Sakigake anime, so it would be nice if you did watch the anime first, or at least know a little about the series, even without that you are probably going to have fun too, cause the movie is quite simples. The plot consists in a deadly competition between the toughest students in USA vs the toughest students in JAPAN, just like it also happens in the anime, but with new characters and a new motivation for the US men, and of course, the first years of otokokuju have to prove themselves once more. The artstyle if craziely good, manly as fuck(I love that kind of draw style), but the animation lacks a little, just like in the regular anime the fight choreography looks very off, and not cause of its time, but due to bad animation. The movie is really fun and will entertain any Sakigake fan and also any battle shounen fan, and probably even get the rest of the audience due to its over the top humour.

0;Tokio Kidou Police;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;5;"I will begin with an one sentence summary: A poor man's Patlabor with tits and lesbian sex instead of good character dynamics.For those of you who don't know what Patlabor is, here is a fuller review.I will swear in this review because face it, anyone reading a review on this hentai should be an adult.Just as Patlabor seems to have taken one cue too many from Shirow's Dominion Tank Police to be considered mere coincidence, Tokio Private Police seems to have taken one cue too many from Patlabor.How about a dedicated redheaded cop with high mecha affinity and not much of an appetite for anything other than the hardware she pilots?Though I have not seen much hentai as of now, I am well aware of the trope that hentai is a lustful thing that uses all the laziest and crappiest plot devices in the book (especially rape) to set up sex scenes as quickly and clumsily as possible. This hentai isn't one of those, it actually makes moderate sense for the most part (not to mention all the main relationships aren't rapey), instantly putting it several levels above the majority of hentai. However, in the end, it is still a retro hentai and we all know just how shittier retro hentai is.Many characters in this ova are already in relationships, thus dodging the awkward bullet of needing to justify how they got together in the first place. It does mostly revolve around taking advantage of our heroine's inexperience and letting her experience some action ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). I have to admit, our heroine's character development is even a tad bit romantic! Apart from the sex scenes which are mostly vanilla and include hetero, lesbian and gang(rape) pairings, there are some mecha (or more like wheeled quad tank mech) combat scenes. Obviously I enjoyed the latter more. If you get off to retro hentai sex when far superior modern hentai exists, you're an idiot.One last note, apparently the jurisdiction of the private police is restricted by law to the point where they cannot stop a gang rape happening right in front of them when off duty. Could have potentially been an interesting dystopian plot theme if the anime was developed further? Well since no more of this hentai was made; its pretty stupid as it currently stands.Now Patlabor was one of the best looking TV shows of its time, the sheer fluidity of movement and consistency of the technical details in its art is one of the many subtle things that makes the show godtier.Tokio Private Police has none of that, its art and animation is above average for a hentai; which means it's still on the low end of 90s Ova visual quality.Also on the low end of 90s Ova is the soundtrack. Smooth jazz plays during the sex scenes; enough said.If this anime wasn't a hentai, that would not have changed my rating for this anime. The characters all follow your 90s police/ military slice of life stereotypes, the humour isn't that funny and the art design and action scenes are mediocre at best. All of this makes for an extremely meh ova. At the very least, the sex doesn't detract from the anime but it certainly isn't good by any means.In the end, I don't see any reason you should watch this anime unless you're obsessed with police animes (like I am). I'm just glad the main character of a hentai doesn't get raped for once.";Mixed Feelings
0;Chou Seimeitai Transformers Beast Wars Neo;Timz0r;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Timz0r;7;"Karyuudo Fansubs delivered us in may 2019 something that all Transformer: Beast Wars fans around the world would appreciate; mainly the final chapter of the Japanese spin-off of the Transformers Beast Era: Beast Wars Neo series that aired in Japan. Now this is a sequal of the anime series Beast Wars II, so if you haven't seen that one, chances are you're better of watch that one first before you start this one just in case to prevent confusion. Sure, we all know the Transformers franchise only exists for purely one thing; 'to sell toys', but that doesn't really bother me. I still have my very own Beast Wars toys from when I was a kid if I may be honest. You can say all what you want, but I still do like the Beast Wars franchise - even though it's sadly discontineud.Story: 7/10 (Good)After the events of Beast Wars II with the dissapearance of the troops of Lio Convoy, many eons(?) later, Big Convoy gets assigned new crew members as Maximals (Cybertrons) to collect the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universe. This won't be an easy tast, since Magmatron's troops that are the new Predacons (Destrons) have their own purposes in collecting the Angelmois energy capsules.Caution: This anime relies a bit more on it's parent story named ""Tatakae! Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers"" then the previous season Beast Wars II. But I assume if you're a Beast Wars fan, you would probbably already know that the Beast Era story line is just a side story from the original Transformers line.Art: 7/10 (Good)For a show that aired in 1999 the art is pretty decent to say the least. You could say nowadays it's a bit outdated, but for a 1999 show I think it still passes. Compaired with the previous season Beast Wars II and the spin-off movie, I can say animation wise it's a much better improvement for sure. Transformation scenes aren't that re-used anymore compaired with previous installments and you will see some alternatieve transformation footage through the series which is a huge step-up compaired with Beast Wars II. Really, I don't have much complaints at all.Sound: 6/10 (Fine)Sound wise not much is improved compaired with the previous season and side story movie, but it still get's the job done. It's just a bit of a shame the intro song and the ending song doesn't get changed over the 35 episodes (32 episodes and 3 clip-shows) for this series.Character: 6/10 (Fine)Compaired with the previous season, I personally find it a slighty downgrade compaired with Beast Wars II. Let me hear me out. I liked the charathers in Beast Wars II slighty better than the charathers in this anime. For example: I find the Maximals Stampy and Break personallity wise they are almost equal with each other and I'm not a big fan of Heinrad iether. From all the charathers; I find the Predacons has the most interessing charathers for sure. I do like the Predacons named Dead End and Sling the most. Oh and our cute tsundere D-Navi that aids the Predacons.Here's a small summery of the main charathers in the show:Maximals:* Big Convoy: The leader of the Maximals. Can transform into a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius)* Longrack: The most serious one of the bunch. Can transform into a giraffe.* Colada: Rather wants to work alone. Prefers hot envoirements. Can transform into a cobra.* Stampy: A bit of coward compaired with other Maximals. Can transform into a rabbit.* Break: Looses it's patience very fast. Prefers cold envoirements. Can transform into an emperor pinguin.* Heinrad: He's the mellow one of the group and the most Japanese cultured of the group. Can transform into a tanuki (Japanese folklore creature).* Navi-chan: a talking computer that aids the Maximals in finding the Angelmois energy capsules scattered around the universes.Predacons:* Magmatron: The leader of the Predacons. Is a combiner Transformer between three differnt Mesozoic reptiles.* Guiledart: The right hand of Magmatron. Can transform into a Triceratops.* Saberback: Often mocks Sling. Can transform into a Stegosaurus.* Sling: Often gets used for comedic purposes. Can transform into a Dimetrodon.* Dead End: Doesn't like team work. Can transform into an ammonite.* D-Navi: a talking computer similair like Navi-chan, but she's a bit of a cute tsundere and her design is differnt.Other charathers gets introduced trough the series aswell just like previous entries.Enjoyment 8/10Did I enjoy this anime afterall? Yes I did. I'm very glad I could finally completed the final missing piece of the Beast Era. I personally preffer this story line than the bullshit story we have gotten with Beast Machines here in the West. It just makes much more sense. Yes, I'd like to pretend Beast Machines never happend. Even today.Overall: 7/10 (Good)If you're a Beast Wars fan you would enjoy this piece of content for sure. Even with it's obvious flaws, I think it did a much better job than *shudders* the Beast Era ending we have gotten in the west with Beast Machines.";Recommended

0;Star☆Jewel Gaiden: Natsumi Oblivion;TorpedoTits;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TorpedoTits;5;After watching Star Jewel I was hoping this story would pick up where it left off, but this turned out to be a short and sweet side story. Where this has the same main character (Hatsumi), there are two major differences.This episode takes place pre-Star Jewel during Hatsumi's school days where she is just discovering her extra 'part'. I personally think that due to this time change Hatsumi's VA is more suiting, as it seemed a tad high pitched before given her womanly demeanor. But it also targets a different type of futanari audience, as it is more playful. After all, a young futa going through puberty certainly is alluring. Especially when the student council president (and Bayonetta-look-a-like) wants a piece of her!The other big change, which unfortunately has a bigger drawback, that is the animation. Shounen Maid Kuro-kun (same studio) has a side story or prologue which has little animation. The style can be best described as a living manga, but full color. But, the art itself remains high in quality. Though I'm not certain it was Yoshino's work, either way, very similar.Now that those two are out of the way, overall it was a very cute and sexy short. Certainly had it's moments, it keeps you entertained. My only peeve about it was the sound. This studio seems to be real fond of silly sound effects, as it seems they used a jar of mayonnaise for everything. The climaxing scenes sounded very sloppy at times, highly exaggerated to the point where you have to laugh.I don't give this low grade because of the animation, let me make that clear. It all boils down to my personal tastes and the fact that is was only a mere 20mins long. A cute bonus, but certainly not reigning over the original. Just average as far as side stories go.;Mixed Feelings
0;Jokutsuma;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;5;Humiliated Wives is pretty niche hentai with the focus being largely on gang-bangs, rape, NTR, and some torture/death. Genres on their own or paired with one other genre listed can still be enjoyed by a large audience the combination of these seems to narrow the target audience by quite a bit.The story isn't interesting and seems to jump in midway as the wife is already being blackmailed before we even know how she got in that situation. However, it is present enough between the rape scenes that you can follow what is going on and if blackmail rape is your thing you might find it mildly interesting.The art is okay and about the same quality as you would find from other hentai during this time, and with the uncensored version you can see the animation gets a bit rough and out of place at times. An example of what I mean by out of place would be a sex scene where the guy is suppose to be giving her anal but the position of his penis and sometimes angle are a bit off and looks like he's ramming it into her cheek instead.There isn't any depth to the characters, not that you should expect a lot from a series like this, and you leaves you to not really care what is occurring on screen. The main villain also is the most generic bad guy from a NTR hentai you can think of.Personally this hentai did nothing for me enjoyment wise as I don't care for the main genres in this, but I can see it being an okay hentai for others that do. Nothing I'd recommend to anyone, but its not one you need to avoid necessarily either.;Mixed Feelings
0;La Seine no Hoshi;Leonard_Euler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Leonard_Euler;8;"I watched this show the first time on French Television in 1999. I did like it because the story was exciting with sometimes Cliffangers (Like episodes 5 and 30). In France this Anime is called ""La Tulipe noire"".I rewatched the whole series in 2017 in french on Dailymotion.I liked to watch the historial facts of my country France. If you are indeed interested in french revolution, watch this anime. Also, I liked the romantic stories of the main characters Simone.This anime is also pleasant to watch.Set in Paris in 1786 at the beginning, Simone and her adoptive parents run a small flower shop in the city but she is also the young stepsister of the queen of France, which Simone doesn't know. But one day, her parents are murdered by corrupted nobles and Simone decides to become the masked heroe""Star of the Seine"" and to fight for the justice against the king Louis XVI of France.This anime is well-paced, interesting and full of action. Simone is a very sweet, nice, romantic, intelligent and skillfull girl. The swords fights are not really realistic, but it is not a big concern. Her boyfriend Robert is a nice guy, even if he is not very intelligent and he fights only for the love of Simone. The characters of Marie-Antoinette and Mirand have their flaws and thus are interesting.This anime has interesting episodes (Like episodes 4, 5, 6, 9, 19, 20, 24, 28, 29, 31.). However it has some filler episodes too (Like 18, 22 which I disliked).When it comes to the music, voices, everything is good. The animation is of course outdated, but it is not a big deal either.The tree main reasons I liked this anime are the following:(1) There is a lot of (not always realistic) action and you are rarely bored. Simone is a wise person and she is a very admirable person since she fights only for justice. I mean: She fights only to save her friends' lives or her own life.(2) You have many romantic stories in this show: Simone and Robert of course, but also Simone and de Montgolfier, Simone and the pianist, Simone and Mirand.(3) This Anime explains the context of the French revolution and you both have the point views of the people of Paris and of the Queen Marie-Antoinette. I mean: It is very rare for an historic anime to explain the point of views of all the enemy parties.";Recommended

0;Shin Grimm Meisaku Gekijou;morbid_jester;https://myanimelist.net/profile/morbid_jester;9;This is the first anime i ever watched. I was four years old and i could still see the difference between this and cartoons. I recently found my old dusty vhs of this and introduced my kids to it. These are some truly beautiful stories.Witches, princesses, knights, monsters, goofy animals, spells, and swords. A little bit of everything, and each episode is a completely different tale. All based on the works of the brothers Grimm. This is from the 80s so dont expect cutting edge animation, but for its time, it does have pretty visuals and decent music.Some of these stories are familiar. The ones that arent familiar, are so intriguing that it is surprising that movies havent been based on them. Yes these are fairy tales but they aren't as flowery as disney features. I do not exactly recommend that you buy this and watch it by yourself, but it is alot of fun for the family.;Recommended
0;Kiseichuu no Ichiya;ejala;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ejala;7;This short is weird, to put it simply. There isn't really a story or plot, this is just a ten minute view of a world. And what a world! A distopian landscape of dead trees and corpses inhabited by monstrous insects, flying leviathans and unfortunate people. The people are dismembered, used as hosts for insect larvae, and are frequently eaten and defecated. If you've ever seen the hell scenes by Hieronymus Bosch, particularly the Garden of Earthly Delights, there is great similarity. The work also echos the misfortune of Edward Gorey's cartoons and the absurdities of Monty Python. If you liked any of these, give it a try.;Recommended

Seems like nature is telling the guy ""watch out for parasites and shit"" great stuff if only more people would animate their nightmares. Btw for those who think that the animation is shit, note that it was all done by one man in the 70s who had limited equipment so appreciate his ability to tranlate his dream onto paper I doubt you could do the same.";Recommended
2;Kiseichuu no Ichiya;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;8;"The Midnight Parasites is probably the best Yoji Kuri short I've ever seen. His style is typical kind of crude, the equipment and resources available to him were limited, and he didn't have a staff to dictate. His style works best when he's trying to create a unique world with its own special atmosphere. This one resembles some kind of hell or nightmare and it draws heavily from medieval imagery of demons and painters like Hieronymus Bosch—even directly lifting a few figures from Garden of Earthly Delights. It's one of the more surreal shorts I've seen as of late.Adding to the roughness, the animated figures are all in color, while they inhabit a monochromatic world—a world that is not only very sparse, but arranged with pleasing composition and texture as the creatures roam the landscape. There is seemingly no sense of direction to this world and the actors all seem bestial and lacking any real sentience, though there does seem to be some kind of logic in operation here—a kind of inverted, hellish ecology; nature has taken its course, but it's far removed from what we know.There's no story or dialogue to speak of. We're permitted to explore the world through the eyes and whims of the various critters, and if you really paid close attention, you might notice some patterns, but this primarily appears to be a depiction of a disturbing dream. The electronic score is also very, very good and complements the film perfectly.";Recommended
3;Kiseichuu no Ichiya;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;8;"Kuri Yoji has caught my attention before. I have heard of a few of his titles. But didn't bother to watch any until recently. He is considered, ""one of, if not the most important figures in the history of Japanese independent animation"", which, I will admit, doesn't really strike as true when you first look into his works. To be fair, you need to understand that this is quite odd stuff, so the time in which you watch his works matters, that isn't to say it becomes impossible to enjoy them for what they should have been, you just need to know what they are about.One of his titles I found off of YouTube comments, it is named ""寄生虫の一夜"" (The Midnight Parasites), which I heard good things about is something I decided to take a look into. Let's have a look at what I got from it, and what you can get too.The story is odd, strange, weird. It doesn't make sense, or at least, it doesn't on the surface, but I found it to basically just be a theme, no real story, but just entities doing stuff. That stuff seemed to come under what would probably make sense to call the cycle of life. With these parasites, these unearthly creatures, basically just feeding off of things, then doing some nonsense, then dying off, creating something new to enjoy this odd world. It is casually dark, and casually disgusting, not really taking in any care as to what it is presenting, making for some pretty good natural scenes that went wherever it wanted to go. Some more deep thought is that this world seemingly has had this order for a long time, with there being leftovers visible as you look on the scenery, I find it hard to believe this may be a coincidence so it comes to question, and praise, of what is this world really. A surreal, though normal way for these people to live? Who knows?As for audiovisuals, the art is obviously old, I liked the animation though and the character design was cartoon-ish. For its time, it isn't really static or retro either, it does indeed feel like something ahead of its time, which I find a good achievement. The soundtrack was surreal, it has this way of playing that would make you feel as if you were watching a conspiracy theory about aliens or something along those lines, which of course is very fitting for something like this. Very good stuff.I enjoyed this, mostly because it was senseless, but hey I made something out of it, I may be wrong. I would imagine most people would probably not enjoy this, as maybe the themes may go over their heads because of how silly this can get, though, maybe you can find something out of it. Would recommend for those looking for something very random and extremely unique, outside of mainstream random unique. Or if you want ""so dumb it's clever"".Overall - 7.8 (8)(Click ""Overall Rating"" for score breakdown)";Recommended
0;Kiseichuu no Ichiya;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;2;Well, this actually ended up being one of Kuri Yoji's better works that I've seen thus far. Still that's not saying much.The art is a step above his other productions, but still doesn't look great. I thought the monster designs were interesting, but everything looks really rough, and things still don't move fluidly whatsoever.The story is basically nonexistant. In true Kuri Yoji fashion, weird things just happen one after the other. While you're watching it, you're not really sure what's going on. It's also one of his longest shorts, being 10 minutes long... and by the end, the whole thing has overstayed it's welcome, since nothing has really happened at all.The soundtrack isn't compelling, but it also isn't offensively bad, just really really bland. I'd say the sound effects are also kind of bland, but to take it a step further, the sound effects are pretty lacking.Overall, this is just a poorly made little short which has some interesting, strange, elements to it, but it fails to capitalize on these elements whatsoever.;Not Recommended

0;Marco: Haha wo Tazunete Sanzenri;vini64;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vini64;2;Marco: Haha wo Tazunete Sanzenri, also known as How to Butcher a 52-episode Epic Series is a movie that trims down 1196 minutes of character development, magnificent settings, drama, sentimental bursts, emotions and empathy into 90 minutes of nothingness. The original series is a work of art that makes you feel what the characters are feeling, that makes you care for them and create emotional bonds. This movie lacks every single kind of emotions that made the Isao Takahata's 1976 production a masterpiece. Every hardship Marco goes through in this movie seems completely artificial, different from the series where the hardships are felt by you as much as they are by Marco.Don't waste your time watching this.

0;Chokkyuu Hyoudai Robot Anime: Straight Title;Newmn84;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Newmn84;6;"So, let me get this out of the way first, Chokkyuu Hyoudai Robot Anime: Straight Title is absolutely NOT what it seems to be at first glance, and even MAL seems to have been mistaken. Straight Title is NOT an mecha action anime, it is a comedy anime through and through. Now that's out of the way, onto my review.When I first heard of this show, I immediately went “Cool! A mecha anime with lots of action using MMD? Sounds awesome!” However, after the action-packed opening sequence, I learned that I was sadly mistaken as the line immediately after the title stated “This anime is made for the viewer to enjoy the cuteness of robots, while enjoying a hardly noticeable, inoffensive investigation.” I just got trolled pretty hard by an anime... Did I rage? No. Did I immediately drop the anime because it wasn't what I expected? No. I simply took it in stride and, in the end, ended up enjoying what the show had to offer.The basic story of Straight Title (or as I like to call it MMD Robots) involves three robots in a world where humans have gone extinct. Mori, Katou, and Fujii are on a quest to end the ongoing robot war (shown in the opening) by finding out how to cause laughter. Sounds stupid, right? Well, it is. But, just throw that all out the window because no one really cares about the story in an anime made solely for the purpose of comedy anyway. Episodes are generally divided into three skits: 1) a skit where the robots introduce and attempt to imitate a style of Japanese comedy, 2) a skit where the robots make something random happen to the opening sequence, usually altering it in some comedic way, and 3) a locale-themed skit where the robots take items from an everyday locale such as a school or hospital, and try to imitate some sort of behavior using the items. The third part is my personal favorite because I honestly don't know if it's scripted at all, rather, it may be all improvisation and the seiyuu (voice actors/actresses) are all doing exactly what the characters on screen are doing. The seiyuu really seem to enjoy themselves and have fun while doing the third part, even going so far as to seemingly fall out of character and laugh, which the show plays it off saying “The noise that resembles human laughter is due to the robots receiving interference from the archives, and is temporarily affecting their external speakers.” While others may see it as being “unprofessional”, hearing the seiyuu and seeing the characters on-screen seem to have fun made me enjoy the show even more.I've heard complaints that the animation “sucks” in this show and my response to that is “It's MMD, what were you expecting?” For those of you who don't know, basically, MMD is short for MikuMikuDance and is a freeware program originally made by one guy so that he could make the Vocaloid character, Hatsune Miku, move and dance. Since then, it has receive numerous updates but is still notoriously hard to use properly, especially for the inexperienced. For MMD, the animation is pretty good, so much so that I think it could be submitted to an MMD competition if it was more than just robots head-bobbing most of the time. The character designs manage to avoid some of the bigger issues that plagues MMD and most parts are large and/or immobile on purpose.All in all, I thought the skits are fine and even somewhat educational, teaching me about different styles of Japanese comedy; though some of the skits managed to really cracked me up at times. The animation may seem bad but, if you really know about what was used to make it, I find it fairly impressive. Give it a shot. You'll probably never see anything like it again and you might even enjoy it, just don't expect much.6 out of 10";Mixed Feelings
1;Chokkyuu Hyoudai Robot Anime: Straight Title;Ghostfriendly;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ghostfriendly;6;"It seems that even a pure comedy series needs a premise with some weight, to anchor itself down; Robot Anime is much stronger in this sense than the similar GdGd Fairies. Put another way, stories need a reason for existing, in this case the quest of the three robots to discover laughter, providing a few laughs and a couple of very poignant moments along the way. The characters of the three robots are quite middle-of-the-road, but very well defined and distinct. Their humour (and most of the show is humour) might tickle a Japanese audience nearer the funny bone, but is still quite good. I doubt it would be laugh-out-loud anywhere, but the clever analysis of humour itself is something to be quietly appreciated in any country. The physical comedy of sequences where our heroines simulate cross-dressing robots, or a roller-skating headmaster, to end the war, loses nothing in translation. Perhaps this isn't the funniest show in the world, but it is unique, and certainly worth a look.";Mixed Feelings
0;Minky Momo in Yume ni Kakeru Hashi;Fall;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fall;10;"This is my favourite-ever standalone OVA, and nowhere near enough people have seen it. Bridge Over Dreams is quite close to my heart despite only having watched it fairly recently and not expecting much out of it. It's a quiet story that serves as the first part of a final goodbye to a series most people in the West will never get the chance to see. It's best, I feel, to go into this one with as little background knowledge as possible. As such, expect little more than a brief run down at what this work excels at and why I feel so strongly about it.Have you ever heard of ""Minky Momo"" before? I wasn't even familiar with the name until I came across this highly obscure gem by pure chance. As it turns out, ""Minky Momo"" was a really popular and influential magical girl anime that came out in the early '80s, and it's noteworthy for being the first magical girl anime not produced by Toei, who had previously 'owned' the genre since the late '60s. The series is also quite controversial -- at least in Japan -- for several spoilerific reasons (and scenes). There was an odd sense of 'maturity' to this series that hadn't been seen in any previous magical girl anime, and it was this 'maturity' that culminated in one of the most controversial scenes in magical girl history. Some might even say that particular parts of the franchise planted the seeds for Madoka Magica and following shows. Either way, I find it extremely odd that so many people in the West just don't know anything about this anime despite its popularity in Japan, because I strongly feel that it is unique and well-written, starting with this OVA.Bridge Over Dreams is the second-last part of the Minky Momo franchise to be released, and while this might take place after the first series, it isn't in any way necessary to know anything about the franchise to be emotionally in tune with this OVA. For sure, there are clear benefits with being familiar with Momo's personality and knowing what an impact losing her magic had on her beforehand - the drama gains a lot more context and weight, but I didn't learn any of this until after I had already finished it, and I can tell you that I felt the weight of Bridge Over Dreams' drama quite strongly. One thing that first-time viewers won't be able to appreciate is the distinct tone of the OVA in comparison to the original series. Aside from that, this OVA is effectively standalone.Bridge Over Dreams manages to craft a very distinctive atmosphere that really draws you in, early into the episode. Its prevailing sense of atmosphere meshes well with the themes it develops gradually throughout the episode. This OVA is rich in characterisation - not only Momo herself, but the other characters have plenty of personality. What I find particularly endearing about Bridge Over Dreams, however, is how it develops all of these characters primarily through its audiovisuals and implications rather than direct dialogue. These layers of subtlety add another dimension of depth to the OVA's more straightforward storytelling, which serves well to amplify the character's emotions and the overall authenticity and power of the atmosphere.Minky Momo's audiovisuals do a lot to help build a complex and engaging atmosphere. The soundwork, in particular, is particularly noteworthy. Not just the OST - though it is distinctive and engaging - but the OVA's focus on sound in general, be it a gust of wind, the crashing of waves, or merely someone biting into an apple, this work is lined with a wide range of sound effects. It's not something I've ever really paid attention to in other shows, but in this very quiet OVA, you can't help but notice them. It helps to craft an incredibly engrossing atmosphere. It also helps that the voice actors (with particular regard to the eponymous Momo) bring a lot of emotion and energy to their roles, adding yet another layer of authenticity to the work's overall composition.The character designs in Bridge Over Dreams are easily the weakest aspect of the OVA; the childish aesthetic seems to be a holdover from the kids-oriented TV series, though it is at least visually appealing and easy to adjust to within the first few minutes. On the flip side, I found the detailed backgrounds to be the most impressive facet of production Bridge Over Dreams has to offer, though the animation is also very smooth, with one of the best examples of its painstakingly hand-drawn animation showcased in the first two minutes. While its production values aren't so mesmersing two decades later, they hold up quite gracefully.All of this comes together to form one of the best atmospheres I've ever been drawn right into throughout all of the anime I have experienced. The way the episode builds all of these characters up and how the passage of time is portrayed is a direct extension of the power of its atmosphere. Bridge Over Dreams thrives on its atmosphere and characters right up until the climax, where its themes take center stage. Everything culminates in a scene that will remain in my memories, most likely, for as long as I live.Put aside 40 minutes of your time and be one of the few people to have seen this little gem. Perhaps you won't love it nearly as much as I do, or perhaps you'll feel that this slightly weird OVA simply wasn't for you, but I urge you to at least give it a shot. These 40 minutes are something I will remember fondly for a very long time, and I hope that you may feel even a semblance as strongly about Bridge Over Dreams as I do.";Recommended
1;Minky Momo in Yume ni Kakeru Hashi;asckj1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/asckj1;8;The story depicts the everyday encounters of people who walk past a certain old bridge everyday. Nicely woven into this scenario is a legend of the bridge which says that the people who meet for the first time on this bridge will meet again. The story starts off with Momo standing on this bridge waiting for someone because she too has heard of its legend. She meets a boy on the bridge who is skeptical about the bridge's legend. She however insists that it must be true and asks the boy to try to find out for themselves whether they will meet here again or not. Thus her wait starts to meet him again. She comes to the bridge everyday but the boy doesn't. Waiting on the bridge, she observes all kinds of people walking past her everyday. She has some conversations with some of the people and comes to know that the bridge is a special place for many people who have met here. This is the aspect shown in the OVA which gave a magical touch to the short story. Momo finally meets up with the boy she met a few days ago which proves the truth of the legend. Though sadly the bridge which has seen so many encounters till now would be demolished soon. Momo sees the bridge till the end only to start another wait on the new bridge which is built parallel to this older one.A short beautifully narrated OVA. Recommended to watch.;Recommended
2;Minky Momo in Yume ni Kakeru Hashi;EggheadLuna;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EggheadLuna;8;"MINKY MOMO IN The Bridge Over Dreams is a poignant gem. Both this OVA and its sister series, MINKY MOMO IN Tabidachi no Eki, take place after Momo has *lost her magical powers and are from the perspective of her life as a normal, prepubescent girl. While these stories are slightly more melancholy than the usual shenanigans of the serendipitous Minky Momo, it is a fitting—coming-of-age kind of sobriety; an inventive approach to a mahō shōjo’s graduation from childhood.*Explains the title change from ‘Mahō no Princess’ to ‘MINKY MOMO IN,’ because Momo is starring in these side stories as a main character but she no longer is the spectacle.This review of MINKY MOMO IN Yume ni Kakeru Hashi (1993) contains spoilers! You have been warned!—Story/CharactersThe story begins when Momo meets a boy on a bridge. The boy is waiting for someone but talks to Momo to pass time; she then walks over to a food vendor and buys them a couple of crêpes. After that, the vendor asks if her and the boy are friends or lovers, Momo fervently denies their relationship—explaining to him that they had just met. The vendor tells her that everyone who meets on the bridge, are destined to meet again.After Momo chats with the boy for a little bit, he promises to come see her the next day. But when the day comes, he never shows up. The rest of the story consists of Momo people-watching while she waits on the bridge, hoping to see the little boy again. There’s a large array of colorful characters—(1) the first is a hat model who gets fed up with her employers disregard for her well being and quits to go on a date with a miscellaneous man, who tries to catch her hat from flying away in the wind, (2) the second is a flower vendor who turns down a marriage proposal from a military pilot that is getting deployed the next day, she loudly exclaims to him that she refuses to be a widow, (3) a buxom beauty is seen on the bridge *with several different men, (4) there is an elderly man and woman who walk their dogs every day, but never seem to notice each other, (5) there’s a triathlon runner, (6) a blonde-haired girl, (7) the vendor, and (8) an elderly woman, resembling a Native American indian, who is always there.*There are light implications that the woman in question is a sex worker. There is an infamous scene, during a Tōrō nagashi (lantern floating) festival, where she is in a suggestive position against a statue and asks him to wait until the fireworks show is over. This could either mean one of two things—she either really wanted to watch the fireworks or she didn’t want to be seen doing something illicitly vulgar.Days and months pass, and Momo has yet to reunite with the boy that she’s smitten with. During those days and months, the model and her boyfriend break up and his glasses roughed up again—a call-back to their first meeting, when he accidentally crushes his own glasses when trying to catch her hat! With a critical mindset, the glasses could be emblematic of him losing sight of what he originally wanted. There’s an implication that he might have had an affair with the sex worker because during a segment, while it’s raining, she walks by him and he ogles the her in front of his girlfriend. The last scene that it shows of him, is the man dropping an engagement ring on the bridge, ultimately deciding to leave it on the ground, and walking home dejectedly. Momo picks up the ring and decides to hold onto it, so she can return it when he comes back.The flower vendor begins to yearn for the military officer once he’s gone and stands on top of the bridge—when he signifies his return, as the fighter jet flies over them. After these events have transpired, winter comes and Momo is still waiting for the boy, in the freezing cold. The buxom beauty then approaches her and advises Momo not to wait for the boy to return. She goes onto to explain that she has never reunited with her past lovers, because there are better left as memories and seeing them again would be too painful. The old woman on the bridge then interjects, stating, ‘If you don’t wait through the harsh winter, you realize when spring has come.’ After that, the sex worker gives Momo an *apple—telling her that the fruit can provide more warmth than another person.*Her visual motif is always carrying around an apple. My interpretation of the sinful woman carrying around fruit harkens back to the Garden of Eden in the Bible. She is trying to tempt Momo to stray away from her promise of meeting the boy again, in exchange for worldly wisdom.In the OVA’s finale, Momo discovers that the bridge is going to be torn down. That evening, the old woman stands up and reveals to Momo that she’s the human embodiment of the bridge and tells her that she can use magic to reunite everyone… one last time. The reoccurring characters get their swan song—(1) the man with the glasses *has contacts now and when Momo returns the ring, the model reveals that he had bought her another ring and proudly displays it on her finger, (2) the flower vendor and the military pilot are having their wedding ceremony, (3) the buxom beauty is surrounded by a crowd of her past lovers and she responds by taking a bite out of the apple, (4) the elderly dog-walkers gets tangled up in the leashes—similar to Disney’s ‘Hundred and One Dalmatians’—and they blush, while staring amorously at each other, (5) the triathlon runner bursts through the goal as people cheer around him, and (6) the blonde-haired girl is reunited with the boy.*Implying that he won’t ‘lose sight’ again! The apple, yet again, is a signifier of worldly desire.When Momo and the boy exchange glances again, a nurse is pushing him around in wheelchair. ‘That’s her,’ he says, while pointing in Momo’s direction. Momo soon realizes that he was pointing to the blonde-haired girl behind her and Momo’s enthusiasm is deflated. The boy then adds that he got hit by a truck on his way to come meet her the next day, smiles at Momo, and verbally recognizes that they had met before, too.Momo has the sudden epiphany that she’s surrounded by a lot of strangers that she had met on the bridge, that are also happy to see her again. The buxom beauty winks at her, gesturing a ‘I told you so!’ And Momo realizes that the point of her encounters on the bridge weren’t meant for one person, but for the many friends she made along the way. The journey is more important than the conquest after all. So, the bridge is torn down and a new one is built with a railroad track dividing the parallel sides. Momo concludes the story by reminding herself that even if a bridge is divided, people will somehow be able to find each other again.Before this OVA, I was unaware that such a harrowing tale could be told in thirty-eight minutes! The beats of the story are reminiscent of a Charles Dickens novel, in structure. This kind of moral catharsis is echoed through centuries of classic literature. A story that cannot be done justice with words alone.—TechnicalThe stylization of Yume ni Kakeru Hashi is similar to Ghibli’s productions during their *golden era. The scenery is draped beautifully around the meticulously designed characters. It is obvious that this OVA was created out of pure love for the Minky Momo franchise, or simply for the sake of art itself.*Every brilliant artist, or studio, typically has a ten-year period where they make their most prolific pieces and, after that bracket of time, an artist usually runs out of creative fuel. In Ghibli’s case, their golden era spanned from 1986–2001. A fifteen-year culmination of memorable stories is exceptional! Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata deserve all the praise they get!It’s strange because, other than Minky Momo’s *chief director, the main director credited to this project is Yoshitaka Fujimoto and, aside from Cyber Team in Akihabara, he has mostly directed smut. I can’t say whether his pornographic productions have been any good or not, because I don’t watch hentai, but they must be if Fujimoto can create such a heartrending Minky Momo OVA.*Kunihiko Yuyama has had a hand in directing every series, movie, and OVA—that is part of Minky Momo’s franchise. Other than that he has directed nearly every Pokémon TV series and movie to date, as well as other notable productions: Wedding Peach, Genmu Senki Leda, and Windaria.Other notable figures in the production of MINKY MOMO IN The Bridge of Dreams are animation director, Keiichi Satō: Tiger and Bunny, Gantz:0, Inuyashiki, Karas, Shingeki no Bahamut, and Asura; the character designer, Hiroshi Watanabe, also did designs for Yume de Aetera—a staple series in ‘90s otaku culture.There are a few famous seiyū in this OVA—first of all, in the ‘90s, Momo’s original seiyū (Mami Koyama) was succeeded by, none other than, Megumi Hayashibara: Faye Valentine (Cowboy Bebop), Rei Ayanami (Neon Genesis Evangelion), Musashi (Pokémon), Ranma Saotome (Ranma ½), Lina Inverse (Slayers), Ai Haibara (Detective Conan), and many other popular roles!Mika Doi was cast as The Beauty, this seiyū is known for her roles as Queen Serenity from Sailor Moon and Misa Hayase from Macross.Yūko Mizutani was cast as The Flower Girl, this seiyū is known for her roles as Pinoko from Black Jack, Sora Takenōchi from Digimon Adventure, Sara Zabiarov from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Minnie Mouse in Kingdom Hearts, and Mihoshi Kuramitsu from Tenchi Muyō! Unfortunately, Yūko Mizutani died from breast cancer on May 17th, 2016.Conclusively, MINKY MOMO IN The Bridge Over Dreams is a must-watch OVA! You don’t have watch the rest of the Minky Momo series to be able to enjoy this one! I rate MINKY MOMO IN Yume ni Kakeru Hashi a 8/10 and a hard recommendation to anyone willing to put aside thirty-eight minutes to see it!";Recommended

But then again, the minds behind it are the makers of classics like Pokemon, Maison Ikkoku and Windaria.This played with my emotions so gently, just like a child would play around and have fun with you. Minky Momo seems to be in a special category within the magical girl formula, I remember seeing some episodes of the TV series dubbed in Arabic as a kid, there's a certain maturity to it that's in harmony with its targeted audience, I like that sort of awareness.

0;Follow Me;pmunny619;https://myanimelist.net/profile/pmunny619;9;I found myself on a TEKKEN viewing spree after I fell in love with his work 'Furiko', which was simply a masterpiece. 'Follow Me' is yet another beautiful work from this extremely talented Director. So on with the review and my personal opinions.Story: 9A story of new life bringing together two broken lives. It was always going to be difficult to follow in the footsteps of Furiko (In terms of my viewing order) but 'Follow Me' provided a pretty fresh story. A story that wasn't as simple and beautifully clichéd as the masterpiece that is 'Furiko', but was just as brilliant and certainly a lot more creative. The story is pretty open to interpretation and doesn't treat you like an idiot, there is a lot of personal output to be had.Art/Animation: 8Although not the most aesthetically pleasing, the art is extremely creative and the simplicity works in favour of the story. There are some really powerful metaphors that are definitely more effective in this style. This and the fact that it was animated by one man alone is enough for this to merit an 8 from me.Sound: 10The music from Muse is ridiculously powerful and is a massive part of the emotional impact that this short brings. Truly beautiful.Character: 8It's always going to be difficult to create complex characters with no dialogue and in such a short time, and yet you still feel as if you understand their struggles, and you can connect with them. TEKKEN does a great job of portraying the characters' development and the struggles of their lives, though this goes back to his unique animation techniques such as using their heads as the frame for their backstory.Enjoyment: 9It was a nice watch. Relatively easy on the eye, short and with beautiful music. There wasn't much not to love. Plus it didn't destroy me quite as much as 'Furiko', though they are both particularly bittersweet. Mostly sweet.Overrall: 9'Follow Me' was just an extremely unique, simple story, delivered with style. The only thing stopping it from matching Furiko's 10 from me, is that it didn't completely blow me out of the water as Furiko did. Perhaps it would have received a 10, had I not already seen Furiko. Nonetheless, Follow Me was an emotional journey and threw tons of emotions at me in such a short period of time, and I loved every second. When the music properly kicks in, there isn't many an experience that can match the feeling it creates.Thanks to anybody who read this far. I felt as though this short deserved at least one review so I apologise for my relatively poor delivery.;Recommended

1;Cinnamon the Movie;vintagedoubt;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vintagedoubt;9;"This review contains some spoiler.Cinnamon the Movie a.k.a Cinamoroll is the cutest anime I've ever watch in my entire life. If you like the cute things or if you like topics like ""why friendship is important?"", ""why family is importan?"", you will be in love with this anime.Story: 8/10The story really looks like The Wizard of Oz and Alice In Neverlands. Beside of anime the movie looks like children's novel, or some kind of fable. There is something that I love in story is ""solving problems"". I would never forget to oven part. It was genius. So If you are going to watch this movie, probably you feel like you are reading old tales But there is something that's bothers me, which it's Cinnamo's story but... It feels like It's Chowder's movie. So that is really annoying.Art: 10/10I love the art style. Its screams that this movie is cute. And If you like cute little animals in cute lands. Probably you like this art style too! :3Sound: 5/10I love the Chowder's voice but... that's it. Especially Ms. Anna's voice is really annoying. There is lots of scream scenes bıt her voice actor's voice is so down. So except Milk and Chowder their voice is kinda sucks. But because of Chowder's voice It didn't bother me that much.Character: 10/10They all have got unique personalities which is awesome! They all different and they know them. I love the fact that no matter how different they are they're all friends.Enjoyment: 10/10I don't actually like this kind of movies because they are boring. But this movie is really really sweet and in the end I almost cried of it.Overall: 9/10I really enjoy this movie and I think everyone needs to see that. Actually in this bad times. They need to remind their childhood with this kind of sweet movies. It has got lots of facts that should be reminded.By the way, If you are feeling down now... why don't you watch this movie when you are eating cinnamon rolls?Ps: this is my first time writing review and English is not my first language so sorry about mistakes.Thank you for reading!

2;Cinnamon the Movie;BeesWaxx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BeesWaxx;10;such a great movie 10/10 it portrays our modern society and puts you into critical thinking about the meaning of life. I would prefer it id the evil dough turned into a handsome prince and had some romance between ms Anna and him. Whatever. it's a children's movie anyways. I totally recommend it if you want to change your perspective about life.The animation was very pretty and aesthetically pleasing and mesmerizing.The sound, well, i watched it on youtube i can't really comment anything on it.Acting was so so good i even got emotional towards the end so you better have some tissues nearby maybe you'll get emotional too just like me.

0;Cinnamon the Movie;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;6;"Show of hands, who here knows about Sanrio? Even if you don't know them by name, you've probably seen a character they made called Hello Kitty. She's pretty much everywhere if you know where to look. But Sanrio as a company has made many other cute, colorful characters since their inception, and continue to do so to this day. I first learned about Sanrio in elementary school, and one of the first Sanrio characters I really grew attached to was Cinnamon, the cute white puppy with long ears and a cinnamon roll shaped tail. I thought he was absolutely adorable, and still do! Yes, I know he's technically referred to as Cinnamoroll now, but I remember discovering him back when he was referred to as Baby Cinnamon, or just Cinnamon, so I'm going to keep calling him that. So years later, when I found out there was an anime movie about Cinnamon and his friends, kid me was ecstatic!...until I found out that nobody bothered to give it English subtitles. Fast forward over a decade, and somebody was kind enough to sub it via YouTube's closed captions system and posted it up there. I finally watched it, and...I love Cinnamon, but man, this has kids movie written all over it, and not in a good way.One day, a pup named Cinnamon falls from the sky, landing in a young girl's bike. Anna, the girl in question, takes Cinnamon to the cafe she works at. Cinnamon meets the other pups that live at the cafe and they all become friends. But a mischievous demon, Chowder, thinks Cinnamon is a threat to Anna, who he has a crush on, so he tries to mess things up by casting magic spells. However, one of them spirals out of control, to the point of kidnapping Anna and trapping her in a warped world of its own making, trapping everyone inside. Cinnamon and the other pups must work together to save Anna from the being that Chowder's spell made sentient.Not gonna lie, this is not one of the better children's movies. The whole thing just involves the pups going into this magic kingdom to save Anna from a monster, and they don't even really do anything on their own. The pups just scream a lot and the plot basically forces them to move from place to place just to get the story going, rather than actually having them do it themselves. None of the characters receive much in the way of development and are just a bunch of archetypes, and rarely do they do much of anything by themselves. It really says something when Mocha, the female fashionista puppy and a side character, winds up being much more proactive than the lead character, as not only does she frequently call out Chowder for what he did, she's often the first to take action. Plus, the movie doesn't really give the characters a chance to just sit, breathe, and show what they're like outside of the situation they find themselves in. Anna is just a damsel in distress who doesn't do anything but be saved by the pups, so she's flat-out useless.The story is pretty shallow and trite as well, as it's just a rehash of a ""save the female character"" premise that's been done in many other movies before, and this does nothing new with it. The main villain is barely given much development, and the themes that arise form said villain's existence don't get explored to their fullest potential. There's also the fact that the movie takes huge leaps in logic just to make the story progress. For example, a character flies to save Anna, but the thing is, the character is small enough that he should not be able to fly carrying the weight of one whole person on them, much less be able to maneuver around moving tentacles. Add in a random Deus Ex Machina that comes out of nowhere to save the day, and the problem is solved forever and ever. Yawn.It's easy to see that this movie was made solely for the purpose of just entertaining children and giving them something colorful to look at, without much in the way of actual substance and depth. Now, there's nothing wrong with kids wanting the occasional dumb entertainment for the sake of it, as kids can tire of stuff that's solely educational. I like my occasional dose of cheesy Lifetime melodrama movies whenever I'm in the mood for them. But don't go into this movie expecting it to be anything more than a 45-minute babysitter. I can at least say this though: At least it's not the travesties that are My Little Pony: Newborn Cuties and A Troll In Central Park.";Mixed Feelings
0;Cinnamon the Movie;crispiechick;https://myanimelist.net/profile/crispiechick;4;"Overall rating: 4 - Light watch and nothing memorable, but worth my while because I get some 40 minutes watching my favorite white Sanrio puppy being animated.Content may contain vague spoilers.I know I shouldn't expect much since it's targeted towards an audience with a simpler processing of storylines, but I still want to dissect it without bias since it genuinely could've been improved using the elements already present in the film. If they were worked on, it could've been more effective and engaging in its storytelling.For the world-building, it should've used more environmental metaphor. Essentially, the conflict in the film is significantly influenced by Chowder, hence it could make sense to anchor the world's visuals and characteristics after the character's patterns. I also partly hoped that the cloud land from where Cinnamoroll fell from had more context, or at least some visual storytelling so that he can be better introduced.In the rise to the climax, Anna strived but ended up being too helpless for the amount of effort she made. Chowder, on the other hand, could've been driven by more character (not necessarily him being painted as evil since I get that this is a kid's show, but better nuanced) so that the conflict will make so much more sense. The plot could've improved exponentially if it capitalized further on the concept of Chowder's ""inner feelings."" Also, the final ""boss battle"" felt quite lazy in execution.I also wished that Cinnamoroll's character was better established throughout instead of just keeping him muted then going all out with his character only by the end of the film. He also could've exhibited additional minor actions that would easily painted the kind of attitude he has. Rapport with Cinnamoroll being the newcomer was also barely achieved (except maybe for Milk).I understand that art back then was different though I wished the colors and illustrations were more vibrant (think animated Alice in Wonderland). Nonetheless, Cinnamoroll has a great character (albeit quite clueless in the beginning). His qualities could've been built up better throughout the movie though.";Not Recommended
0;Battle Spirits: Sword Eyes;Bidoof_PMD-EOS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bidoof_PMD-EOS;8;"I'll just start by saying: Please do not watch the opening of this show before the show itself, as it spoils the sword eyes. Given that the one place to watch the show is on youtube, and the uploader didn't put in the opening (due to copyright), that shouldn't be a big problem unless you search for it.This series is about battle spirits yet again, but this time, the spirits don't originate from Grand Rolo; it's not connected to Dan/Brave. The show is very plot focused, and has a lot of characters (the quote unquote 12 sword eyes, plus quite a few others).Story: 9. This is a two parter show, that got separated for... no real reason, I assume. I'd give the story of this part a 9; it establishes the world well, the plot, the conflict, the events.. Since I'm not going to write a review for the second part, let me say that it doesn't worsen, but since it focuses more on the conclusion of the story, there aren't many more interesting ideas or locations that are brought (8/10).Art: Good, 7/10.Sound: No clue. The OP isn't bad, I don't remember the ED, the ending of the show has no music (copyright), and I forgot about the normal soudtrack, so I assume it's okay.Character: I'd give an 8. There are too many characters for all of them to develop, but the show tries, and to me, succeeds. The MC, Yaiba (altough he doesn't develop as a character, he develops to the viewer), the purple sword eyes, the yellow sword eyes of darkness, the white and green sword eyes of light.. Most of those I listed are characters that I think are well executed.Enjoyment: There's one thing that really annoyed me from the show, and brings my enjoyment to a 9, and my total score to an 8 (as opposed to a 10 and 9 respectably). That's the stakes. In a card game anime, you need stakes for each card game, or else it all feels pointless. Here, (slight spoilers for one of the first 10 episodes), they sometimes establish the stake, but, for good reasons, make the protagonists lose. However, due to the stakes being too high, they just back out of it. The way it's executed isn't bad, but it's something that I really don't respect. This happens more than once.All in all, I'd give it a solid 8. I'd recommend to anyone who would like adventure and an intriguing story, and who likes card games.FYI, the card game aspect is explained at the beggining of the show, and you should be able to get the hang of it. In fact, it introduces the game better than it's predecessors (Toppa, Dan, Brave and Heroes).";Recommended

So the first prince of the kingdom Yaiba accuses her for it. Meanwhile she sends away her second son tsurugi with the help of an android striker who knows to play battle spirit game well. So this is the epilogue. This series is about playing battle spirits card game and the most powerful players are those with ""sword eyes"" . There are 6 sword eyes (white, red, purple, yellow, green and blue), those who have the sword symbol in right eye represent light and to have it in left eye meant to be of dark forces. Now the entire series progresses for the aim of attaining a sword which will appear when all the 12 (light side 6 + dark side 6).Art: Upto today's animation standards. Clear in outlines etc.Music : There is no opening song.Characters: Except Yaiba, that is first son of the queen none were strong characters. Yaiba shown to be strong while taking decisions for the kingdom. He was unshakable to the kingdom struggles but he always looked after his people safety. Whenever there is a disturbance in the environment, yaiba through public broadcasting assured people that there is nothing for them to be afraid of. He never shown to suppress his people.Drawbacks of the series:1. Characterization is poor.2. Battle Spirits game time depletes its effect on viewers when it is combined with the aftermath story.3. The three seers are just for comedy. They are not at all powerful.4. Sword eyes light side characters except haqua, all others get defeated easily.

0;Tezuka Osamu no Don Dracula;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;“Tezuka Osamu no Don Dracula” is somewhat of an anime oddity. It’s known as the anime series that got canceled with the least amount of episodes broadcast. They had scripts for 21 episodes already made, and may have intended to make even more, but since “Don Dracula”’s sponsoring company went bankrupt and an alternate sponsor couldn’t be found, they could no longer afford to pay the TV stations to air it. Thus, only the first four episodes were aired in Tokyo, and some of the regional stations managed to get to episode 8, which became the last episode.As its production history suggests, “Don Dracula” is a messy show. The plots are repetitive, sloppily put together, and full of both logical and tonal discrepancies. The show’s target demographics are unclear. It was aired in primetime, so you’d think it would be for families, and it has fun opening and ending themes that would appeal to kids. But it’s also got scantily-clad women, blatant nudity, gross-out humor, cute baby animals getting murdered, and a whole host of other potentially problematic issues. It’s all over the place.The characters don’t receive any development, and key background facts about some of them (most notably Chocola) are left out of the anime, resulting in the show making even less sense. Most of the characters are unlikable and difficult to sympathize with, perhaps with the exception of Igor. There’s a bat that appears in every episode who talks to the audience and essentially narrates what’s going on, and he’s particularly annoying.Each episode has a self-contained story (or two), and most feature Dracula ogling and chasing women and trying to suck their blood, but something usually goes wrong, and hijinks ensue. Sometimes Dracula tries to help his daughter with something, but inadvertently ends up causing trouble for everyone. Dracula is frequently stalked by Blonda, an obsessive woman who wants him to suck her blood, but he can’t stand the taste of it (probably because she’s fat and ugly). Chocola attends a night school, and she’s a member of the school’s sci-fi club, which includes her boyfriend, Nobuhiko (Nobuhiko has no idea that Chocola is a vampire, and says he doesn’t believe in vampires, by the way). Dracula, Chocula and their servant, Igor, live in their Transylvania mansion, which has been for some reason relocated to suburban Tokyo. They are often threatened by Hellsing, a vampire hunter from the Netherlands who has a hemorrhoid problem, and a trigger-happy policeman named Murai.The animation is passable, but it’s certainly not the best. Some of the frames look hastily drawn, and a lot of times the lip movements don't match the voices. The designs of the main characters, particularly Dracula and Chocola, are okay, but the other characters are rather bland, especially Hellsing, Murai and Nobuhiko. There are a couple of odd choices with regard to character design: Chocola’s hair is light blue-gray in the anime, even though it would make sense plot-wise for her hair to be reddish-brown, as it is in the manga. Also, Nobuhiko’s hair is reddish-brown in the opening and in the fourth episode, but in a later episode, it’s black.The voice acting is decent, but some of the dialogue is frustratingly corny and can be rather difficult to understand, with lots of unfunny puns and references to Japanese movies and other late ‘70s to early ‘80s pop culture.The opening and ending are really catchy, and probably the best part of this anime. The ending, in particular, with its “don dora don dora” chorus, is an earworm.There is quite a lot of explicit content in this anime, despite its kid-friendly appearance. There are two episodes with blatant nudity (one episode features naked blow-up dolls in a significant and surreal role), frequent gross humor with regard to Hellsing (he defecates uncontrollably due to his hemorrhoid problem, and also moons people to show the mole on his butt which proves his identity). There are a few instances of scantily-clad women, most notably in the opening. Chocola, who is supposed to be a middle schooler, is shown in her underwear in one episode, since her clothes got stripped off by an antagonist. As for violence, there’s an episode where two cute baby animals get shot to death, and there are a few other scenes of people getting killed. All of this is juxtaposed with goofy gag humor, which makes the series feel awkward.Overall, “Don Dracula” is a strange show which is thematically all over the place, and doesn’t have a clear target audience. It’s easy to see why this got canceled after airing only 8 episodes. Still, as an anime oddity, it’s an interesting show to watch, so I recommend it if you want to see something unusual (although not necessarily good).;Mixed Feelings
0;Hamelin no Violin Hiki: The Movie;helenstar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/helenstar;8;The Violinist of Hameln movie takes after the manga instead of the anime. Keeping its light hearted, slap-stick comedy that the tv series sorely lacked made it more enjoyable for a fan of the manga. The main tribute that the Hameln series has to offer is its great classic music scores, which the main character Hamel provides to suit his own needs (as per usual and as much to Flute's dismay).The art work it directly linked to that from the manga, and seems to flow better then it did in the tv series (meaning less still frames and more movement and action).Though a bit short, and really out of the way for the characters' journy, it made for a good light hearted anime to pass the time.;Recommended
0;Kijoku: Princess Double Kari;Desian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Desian;8;Since no one else has bothered to write a review, heres my contribution to the hentai community.Story: 8/10Kijoku -Princess Double Kari- ,more easily found, known, and remembered as Slutty Princess Diaries, is a revenge/heroic quest hentai. There are enough scenes involving soldiers, burning fortresses, and a command tent that it feels like watching a war themed anime...but with copious amounts of sex. You can get most of the story without it being spoilertastic from the synopsis but be warned that this hentai is a /VERY/ rape oriented hentai. It also contains a few other hentai subgenres....namely Milking, Tentacles, Gang Rape, Futanari, and Elves.Art: 6/10Firstly, let me say that overall this is a very well drawn hentai. It is not, however, a very well animated one. Animation at times seems to be choppy and looping is used somewhat frequently, resulting in robotlike movement in a couple scenes but not enough to render it not worth watching. Very colorful and pretty, character designs well done.Sound: 9/10Due to the mediocracy of the animation, naturally sound is sometimes out of synch so far as speech is concerned. The voices fit the roles to be played and it has a suprisingly good soundtrack. Sound effects are good as well.Character: 7/10As a hentai, you start watching this without expecting a whole lot of character development. You are right. The vast majority of character development (unsuprisingly)goes into Distol, the main character of the show, who also is in roughly 90% of the screen time. Distol makes a slow transition from the beginning of the show from being a good man to a vindictive, cruel warlord hell bent on conquering bartrage. Due to his obsession with rescuing her, his adoptive sister Quoona has a little character development as well.Enjoyment: 8/10Not a bad hentai. Definitely worth the watch despite its shortcomings. I believe it would still be fairly amusing even without the sex.Overall I enjoyed it. 8/10;Recommended
1;Kijoku: Princess Double Kari;eriksigal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eriksigal;8;"Sex-scenes are good, but better watch it without subs since plot and characters are stupid as piece of oak, really - as for sex scenes it has typical devices of hentai: rape, bondage(not too much), ganfrape, slavery, coercing, one futanary scene, brother-sister incest. Characters and graphics looks good, sex-scenes too - but like i already said, as for me - subs ruined impressions, since plot and characters are really stupid.First, it is typical ""he(bad guy) wronged me, so i get revenge by abusing his daughter, wife and daughter`s female servants"" i myself feel sick from such logic, it is remind me excussing of war rape( my history proffesor excussed war rape by saying about how poor and miserable soldiers are, while i mostly care about how miserable raped women are, not to mention i despise that pathetical pattern of mind: ""my house was burnt down/my family was killed - so, i would go to rape someone, desirable that someone would be woman, it is well known that woman has great influent, all wars happened because of them, it is well known that all woman have influent on government and military of their country - ye, they have no right to make abortion, or to sign papers without permission of father or husband, they have no right to choose husband, yet they have big influent on government"" oh shit, how i tired from such stupidity) well, some kind of witch - who is servant of demon whom threatened to conquier the world, and to prevent him from doing so there was decided to sacrificing his sister for that demon - appeared told him she would aid him in get down hostile king and to rescue his sister( his ""pat dog moments"" like that care about sister while he has no problem to rape and abuse other girls it only makes things even worse) well, he get down the king, became king himself, sold wife of king and pals of princcess - into sex-slavery, captured the princcess, kept her, rape her from time to time.His sister is also annoying - all so sickengly ""innocent"", all so goody two shoes - yet, has no problem to suck off her brother.What really made me feel sick and amusing at the same time is that - he, capturing princess, raping her - not only himself, but also with tentacles of some evil spirit he brought to her, also let Eleonore(evil witch) go futa on her - killed her father, sold girls who were close to her, into slavery, always talking crap about her - yet in the end he all the sudden take her on the ride with him and even advised her to hold to him tight, and - well it cann be pass through attention.But later - he told her not to stand at air in her light dress for she would catch the cold!))) it would be cute from him - if it wouldnt be for him commited cruel rape scene on her and sold other girl into slavery for they were close to her. Worse, she didnt admit weirdness of this, i understand that it is hentai, still oit was stupid - i mean, he raped her, treated her as a crap, did horrible things to her stepmother and to her pals and then: ""dont stand here - you might catch the cold"" WTF? Many people told ""bondage games"" were fucked up - but this title is more fucked up, treatment to girls is no lesser cruel than in ""bondage games"" but in bondage games tormenters weren`t trying to pose it as kind of love later, and girls didnt show they accept that treatment and having to their tormentors something aside from fear, and something aside from despair to their position - the most loyal slavegirl in the end was the one who killed the main slavekeeperI recommend that hentai for the good sex-scene, to the ones who can overlook horribly stupid plot.";Recommended

0;Wild 7;WinstonWingZhang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WinstonWingZhang;9;"In the ongoing search for those profanely violent early 90s animes (specifically the extreme justice police action drama subgenre), I stumbled upon this gem that few have ever heard of. Having watched the guilty pleasures that were Angel Cop, Mad Bull 34, and Cyber City Oedo, this seem to fit in with that era and criteria so I knew I had to give it a try.To my surprise, while I indulged in the aforementioned shows for their grindhouse-esque camp factor (loaded with grotesque outbursts of violence strung together by juvenile plot lines and bewildering dialogue), Wild 7 managed to transcended my low expectations and rise above its own limitations. Wild 7 doesn't have the striking visual imagery of Cyber City, the sheer brutality of Mad Bull, nor the constant unintentional hilarity of Angel Cop. But what it has makes it better than any of them: Wild 7 has actual focus, and a whole lot of heart.All the other shows payed tribute to western police procedurals and action films only at face value without really adhering to the heart of those kinds of stories or even what they themselves originally set out to be (becoming increasingly outlandish until the stories ceased to bear any relation to police work any longer). However, for Wild 7, it's themes are at its heart and soul, and worn on its sleeve. This is a tale about a special police unit who wrangle with their designation of being ""above the law"". Over and over they face the trial of duty vs kinship, of conscience vs conformity, of identity vs free will. With its colorful characters over a series of entangling situations, Wild 7 never strays from its theme, ending on an inevitable but nonetheless powerful conclusion.Being about cops, this anime takes elements from Dirty Harry, Robocop, and Hard Boiled and tosses them into a blender. While these films are known for their cool characters and blistering carnage, which this anime shares aplenty, they also chronicle the pressure faced by officers who have chosen to disrupt the binds of bureaucracy to get at the most evil injustice--the best thing Wild 7 could have borrowed. And admittedly while this is nothing we haven't seen before, Wild 7 paces through these kinds of intense conflicts briskly over the course of two hour long episodes. The story rarely sags and the action sequences never overstay their welcome; the relationships never devolve into unearned melodrama.If I had to guess, the name Wild 7 is probably the Wild Bunch and the Magnificent Seven (which in turn was a variant of Seven Samurai) mashed together. Fitting, because these films also dealt with the interaction and conflicts of an ensemble cast of vigilantes enforcers. Although characters are unavoidably shallow due to the format and genre, they serve their roles well and have noticeably distinct personality and an overall sense of camaraderie as well as convincing chemistry. Much of the development is centered on the ever daring young leader of the 7 and their iron-willed bespectacled superior. The bond and strife between these individuals and what they represent, combined with the constant external forces that threaten to break them apart, is masterfully maintained and what makes Wild 7 so surprisingly memorable, not unlike those inspirational sports films which detail the ups and downs of a team, its captain, and the coach.If there are any major flaws in Wild 7, they are despite all the big questions it raises, the 7 themselves don't seem to face enough consequence for all the collateral damage they cause. Yet this can be forgiven when considering Wild 7 to be action first, and drama second. A lot of minor issues regarding development are there of course if you look hard enough, but the fact that it is fairly consistent and persistent for its circumstances is already beyond reproach.It is a shame that Wild 7 was probably never that well known to begin with, and now whatever legacy it had is lost to time (and VHS tapes). This anime is criminally underrated by this community, but none can be blamed as it is such an obscure piece with no fanfare or notable documentation.

1;Wild 7;animegorey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animegorey;9;I just really like the gore and violence in these older animes. This one has all the profanity, graphic violence, gorey head bashing and generally over the top style that reminds me of MadBull 34. Both are very similiar and I wish both would have continued their series'. Eng dub isn't very good, but it adds to it's charm the same way the eng dub of Fist of the North Star does. Story isn't particularly engaging, but I didn't watch it for the story. It's good, but the violence and graphic adult nature of it is why I liked it. Not as funny as MadBull 34, but it had it's moments. It's more of a movie than 2 episodes. It's pretty wide open at the end, but I think it led into the 13 ep tv series that I cannot find on dvd. This was hard to find on dvd, but I managed and for only $10.00. It was well worth it and if you like these older, more violent animes you must check this one out.;Recommended
2;Wild 7;KousakaK;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KousakaK;7;"I'm going to keep this review short and to the point, just like the anime itself.Wild 7 is a very fun anime to watch, it's definitely not extraordinary, but what it does, it succeeds in pretty well.The story, albeit it seems rushed, was interesting enough to glue my eyes to the screen, to see how it would all turn out in the end, and oh boy was it worth it. All the main characters had a certain charm to them, that really made them entertaining, and seeing them interact with each other, and seeing the way they fought, were some of the highlights of this OVA.This anime is very gory and violent, almost absurdly violent at points, but that's exactly what makes it so much fun to watch. Classic violent ""gar"" anime that really needs some more attention, stuff like this can be rare to find in newer anime.I would personally recommend Wild 7 to anyone wanting to get more into the gory 80's and 90's OVA's, and people who just want to kill 2 hours fast.I feel like a good 7 describes my feelings about Wild 7 well. Not perfect or crazy good, but a good older anime nonetheless.";Recommended

0;Issunboushi (OVA);iamKetranLang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamKetranLang;8;The Erotic Adventures of Tom Thumb is a really interesting hentai! If you know about Tom Thumb, he's a guy that shrunk and became mini.The main character in this hentai is a boy in college called Issun that has life troubles. He got shrunk down by his magical ancestor who showed up to help him get going with his life. Fair enough, he was able to build a closer relationship with the girls in his life by being tiny. Issun got to have an erotic adventure with the girls while MINI that includes taking a ride on top of the girl's shoulder, playing with nipples during sex, receive the benefits of a full kiss, etc.The producer Y.O.U.C really did a good job with this hentai. The girls are really cute and likable. My favorite would be Liz, the blonde girl. I found her to be adorable and the fact she's an English girl and got freckles makes her even more unique. The hentai is UNCENSORED !!! All of the sex scenes are great! and I highly enjoyed it even if they repeated frames a little. There's no annoying moans and the characters don't over talk too much.

0;Issunboushi (OVA);Wicker_Senpai93;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wicker_Senpai93;6;"Issunboushi (also know as ""The Erotic Adventures of Tom Thumb"") is a two-part OVA series by Y.O.U.C. It's a rather unique hentai, and quite fun as well.Firstly, what about the story? Well, unlike a lot of hentai, this actually has a pretty fleshed out story. The story follows an impoverished college student named Issun. He falls asleep from hunger one night and meets his ancestor in his dream. His ancestor is naturally displeased at how much of a loser Issun is, and he doesn't want his bloodline to end. So he decides to ""help"" Issun by shrinking him down to a miniscule size.The shrinking person story has been done many times before, but I quite like the way it was handled in this OVA. Plenty of perverted jokes and situations, lol. Speaking of which, there's a lot of ""comedy"" in this hentai. I personally didn't find it very funny, but this hentai has a fairly lighthearted tone, so it's not really a problem.Issun's ancestor is particularly disturbed by that fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend, so there're naturally several female characters in the story as well. Thankfully, they're all pretty unique. There's Issun's childhood friend, who's kind of silly and a bit tsundere. His college professor, who's very sly and horny. And the best character, Issun's classmate Liz. She's a rich foreign girl, and she gets the most of the screen time. Almost more than the other two combined.And that's probably my biggest gripe with this OVA series. It really could've used another episode, because it comes off as rather rushed.Now, how's the art/animation? The animation is average, not good or bad, it just gets the job done. The art is more of a mixed bag. I generally really like it, however, the characters faces are drawn poorly in some scenes. This is mainly an issue in the first episode, and it seems to mostly resolve itself in the second episode.I watched the Japanese version, and the voice actors did a decent job. Nobody really stood out, but no one did a noticeably bad job either (barring one exception). Interestingly, since Liz is a foreigner (presumably American), we get treated to some classic Engrish.Overall, Issunboushi is a pretty good hentai OVA. It's not particularly great, but it does offer some nice lighthearted fun and a creative plot. It has plenty of well-designed characters, and some decent h-scenes as well. 6.5/10So, would I reccomend you watch this OVA series? If you like hentai, and don't mind watching older releases, then go for it! This series definitely needs more attention.";Mixed Feelings

We are doing it in some manner. But there are those that are not as fortunate that might as well be from the past. Struggling hard with the few amenities they have.

0;Minerva no Kenshi;Rahzek;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rahzek;10;"Fencer of Minerva is that one rare series we all wish there were more like it; a hentai with a captivating story that doesn't revolve around sex but instead uses it as a component to the larger story.(In case that isn't clear enough, no this isn't a fap-able title)The Art for its time was actually fairly well done, the style grows on you throughout the series with no characters looking misshaped.There is one minor misstep to consider before viewing this series -being that there are 2 versions. The Censored and Uncensored; most people would tend to go toward watching the Uncensored version however with this series that would be a mistake. The Censored version actually covers the same content scene for scene but features a higher resolution. The Uncensored versions are also hard-subbed meaning the resolution affects how well they show up as well. As for those of you hoping to purchase the DVD be aware that there are 2 parts to this series listed as ""The Tempest"" and ""The Emergence"" so you don't miss out on half the series.The Sound is the weakest point at least for the BGM from time to time, however there are no issues with the character voices which makes it easy to overlook.This series may be listed as a hentai and have some dark themes on the outside, but watch it to completion and you'll realize it did such a tribute to the adventure genre that it's a little ironic we haven't seen another series like it in the 20 years since its release.Story-10, Art-7, Sound-6, Characters-9, Enjoyment-10, Overall-10";Recommended

1;Inma Youjo;MiniMoose-kun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MiniMoose-kun;9;Imma Youjo is certainly more than meets the eye!As anime gets more criticism so does hentai, and when I say criticism I don't mean it as negative, far from it. It's a nuanced term, but I should say that it means that it's being taken more seriously and that's a good thing!But hentai.. . is the pink elephant in the room when it comes to serious discussions about anime. Mostly since pornography is not universally accepted as an artform, and animated pornography less to. That has to do with exposure and the content that's known, but that's a different discussion. Imma Youjo is one of the more controversial and interesting among a huge variety of shows. Moreso since Hentai has an interesting relationship with women.But i digress. Imma Youjo protagonist Maya is more a force of nature, she changes gender, role and positions within these five episodes which deals with a lot of different genres and plots. From cyberpunk, folklore, pre-world war 2 and the witch hunts in Europe - Romantic Thriller.This is a series that has a LOT to say and unpacking it would definitaly take a while, however as entertainment it's very enjoyable. From it's lush visuals, interesting villains and plotlines which stretches far and beyond.Viewers not interested in watching sexual violence should be informed, since it's a lot of it in these five episodes.

0;Chou Shounen Tanteidan Neo;Bagira20;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bagira20;7;"Since no one seems to have watched or cared about this anime, I felt I needed to step up for it and fight the score of 4.6 it has right now.First of: This anime will most likely not appeal to everyone. It's a short series withabout 3 minutes per episode loosely based on the famous detective books by Edogawa Rampo. It's a mixture of an over-the-top comedy and a parody of both thebooks and modern society. So if anime with very little room to catch a breath aren't your thing, this one might not be for you. For anyone else, I'd highly recommend giving it a try.Story:The overarching story of Chou Shounen Tanteidan NEO is pretty simple: The Young Boy's Detective Club tries to defeat the villain called The Fiend with Twenty Faces. However, the story isn't the main selling point of this show. It merely serves as a general premise so that either side (mostly Twenty Faces) can try to take out the other one with a new plan. The individual subplots are fun and creative, with sometwists thrown in for good measure. Just don't take it too seriously. For me, a 7/10Art:The art isn't the most impressive art out there and there isn't any sakuga or something like that, but it fits the mood of the show perfectly. It has thiscartoon-feeling to it, a bit like panty and stocking, but way bouncier and notas ""realistic"" as that show, if you get what I mean. To summarize, the art fits, but isn't impressive. 8/10Sound:Although most of the music didn't really catch my attention, the sound does it's job fine. The voice acting is perfect, changing from cool attitude to insane screams whenever is needed. And that god damn ending theme has been stuck in my head for weeks now! So yeah, not everything perfect, but what is good, is very good. 7/10Characters:The characters are what makes this show. No, they aren't complex or have a tragic backstory, but their interactions are hilarious. Special mention has to go to Twenty Faces. I love villains like him that are just having the time of their live being a villain. The main kids aren't anything special. They aren't real stereotypes, but they are not far off. Still, I think they work well enough. 6/10Enjoyment:I love this show. It has just the right length and the energy and speed to match that length. It's funny, over-the-top and insane all the time. While not everything may be perfect or satisfy everybody, I think it deserves way more attention than it gets right now.9/10Overall score: 7/10";Recommended
0;Shoujo Auction;Erodude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Erodude;8;"I've seen a fair amount of hentai, and, with a name like ""Shojo Auction,"" I thought I had a pretty good idea what I was in for. Namely, cute girls being sold into sexual slavery, which would basically play out as a rape-fest.Boy, was I wrong, and, boy, did that make for a pleasant surprise.Shojo Auction, instead, is kind of like a coming-of-age tale of three women, except it's still totally a hentai. We see three women, each with different reasons to sell their bodies, somehow triumph over some past wrong to which they were subjected. Granted, this isn't so much through any sort of character-centered intelligence or noteworthy scriptwriting; it just so happens that the shojo auction itself miraculously puts these girls in just the right positions to settle old scores and move on with their lives.Since no one can resist a good terrible pun, let's talk about the right positions. These girls get in all the right positions, if you know what I mean (you totally do). The sex, while not as drippingly explicit as some hentai made recently, is pretty good overall. There's a lot of looping in the sex itself, but there's a fair diversity in seximatography, as I now like to call it. This applies primarily to the type of sex (we've got footjobs, blowjobs, anal sex, vaginal sex, a bit of lesbian sex at the end, a tiny little bit of bondage (of the MALE, actually) at the beginning, and rape during a flashback). There are many changes between positions, but they sometimes occur a little too rapidly/frequently for my tastes, although the diversity is still welcome (positions include 69, doggie-style, missionary, and many other styles I don't know the semi-technical names of). Two of our heroines seem to have very similar physical characteristics, barring hair color (of course). The two main males are somewhat more diverse, for what it's worth (not a lot, really).Anyways, the sex is pretty hot and surprisingly happy, which is, in my opinion, perhaps the best part. The guys and girls are pretty darn willing right from the get-go, which is a refreshing change of pace from what I've seen a lot of recently. I may just not be looking in the right places, but, well, I've made my point.In terms of aesthetics, this hentai looks pretty good, although it definitely looks older than it is (by about 4-5 years, I'd say). Lines are bold, colors are pretty bright (but relatively realistic in hue). The girls are on the well-endowed side of normal, or, alternately, the slightly under-endowed side of the typical, non-lolicon hentai breast-size absurdity. Males are somewhat average-looking: neither extraordinarily hot nor ugly. Overall, I like the art, and find it fairly low key.Sound-wise, it's pretty typical for hentai. Good moaning, oohing, aahing, squelchy sounds of intercourse, etc. Voices are typical, and none are blatantly annoying. The script-writing is more believable than your average hentai, for what it's worth, which is, admittedly, not a lot. Strictly speaking, the BGM was forgettable. As in, I don't remember it; not really a bad thing, to be honest. More attention left to focus on the delicious sex.Speaking of sex and really substandard transition sentences, people (and animals) have sex (okay, one could argue that some plants have sex, but let's not go there now). The people having sex in Shojo Auction are a bit different from the usual suspects, in that the females are surprisingly empowered, and the men are just fine with it. I think this is good. In fact, the sexual empowerment endears the characters to me somewhat more than usual. I'll outline the main ones here.Rongai is the main male protagonist. He's a bit of a pushover, but seems to be a cool, calm, and collected character. I don't dislike the guy, which, sadly, is a marked improvement over many hentai.Shirohebi is the main female protagonist and totally the star of the show. She will find a way to get her way, no matter what, but she isn't totally ruthless about it (just kinda overbearing). She also has altruistic tendencies, and is intent on helping her clients see the silver lining in their situations. She's also rather kinky and something of a nymphomaniac. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.Then we have each of the three girls to be auctioned. Each has a bit of a different personality, and each has a problem that, by the end of the series, will be solved in some way or another. I find Umi to be the most fascinating of them, in the way she reacts to realizing that she's been given the opportunity to gain control of her life. Unless you like yandere gaijin or broken birds, in which case you may like the other two better. I just found Umi's story to be uplifting, which says a lot since it's coming from a hentai.These stories of personal triumph make for a surprisingly good story, fairly saturated with pretty hot, normal, happy sex. As such, I actually enjoyed this hentai quite a bit. Take it out for a spin if you're in the mood for something uplifting in your daily dose of hot, animated sex.";Recommended

0;Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei;theGreenDeath;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theGreenDeath;9;Yes it's a wartime propaganda film, but one that spends as much time with cute animal soldiers packing and eating their bento lunches as it does with any fighting. It's only in the last fifteen minutes of runtime that there's any War at all. There are also extended scenes of singing alphabet songs, hanging laundry and feeding birds.The animation is amazing, of course continuity is a little jumpy which considering the conditions of it being made make sense, so a lot of the scenes have little jumps and skips in the motion. Still the movement is remarkably three dimensional, and the characters have very expressive facial expressions.When compared to the Disney wartime movies, these one lacks the coherent plots and punchy action and quick gags.

So, for this anime, I'm not going to give it one of those complicated reviews, since it wouldn't be fair when I'm comparing it to anime in this decade.It doesn't have good animation style, yet what do you expect.

0;Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;2;"Overview:I have a new laptop and now I'm back to befoul MAL with more silly reviews of bad, obscure anime that nobody asked to be reviewed. Let the universe howl in despair for I have returned! Time to review Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors!Background:The year is 1945 and Japan is very rapidly losing the war in the Pacific. The Japanese navy has been utterly decimated and is simply unable to keep up with America's manufacturing strength and output. Japan's resources are running bone dry and most of the Japanese merchant fleet has been sunk by American submarines. All of Japan's best pilots were trained in Germany and now virtually all are dead. Germany has been knocked out of the war, so no new quality pilots can be trained. The Soviet Red Army is now steamrolling Japan's Army in China and Korea. By the summer of 1945, all Japan can do is try make the predicted American invasion as slow and painful as possible. Hopefully, the Americans will accept something slightly less than absolute surrender so Japan can lose the war with some honor intact.With all this going on, a branch of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to force a Japanese Communist to make a propaganda cartoon against his will in which a bunch of furries conquer America! This...is that story.Plot:Hey kids! Did you know the Imperial Japanese Navy is awesome? It's true! They are all very handsome and dashing and have HUGE cocks. My big brother is in the navy and he says they have the best ships EVER! Seriously, the first 30 minutes of this film are a bunch of woodland creatures endlessly praising the navy. We're off to a great start when I'm immediately reminded of Brazil's Ratatooing, where the CGI abominations won't stop praising the food. I love that at no point in the movie does it say anything positive about the Japanese Army. Fuck those guys! They can make their own stinking movie!Part 2 of the film is where the little animals decide to sing the Hirigana alphabet...for 10 minutes. This segment is the direct Japanese equivalent of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz6OGVCdov8Now we enter the final act and it's FINALLY time to wipe out the American Navy located at the ""Devil Islands"". The Japanese forces are all drawn as furry animals besides the folktale character of Momotaro, who is leading the Japanese forces for some reason. The American troops are all portrayed as humans and have no folktale characters like Paul Bunyan fighting for them, so they have no chance! The Japanese Furry forces slowly parachute down onto American ships, which don't fire at them for...reasons. The Americans at Devil Island surrender immediately without a fight and this causes the entire country of America to surrender right away. Some animal school children play games and the movie ends.Art:This was filmed in black and white despite most animated feature films being in color by 1945. I'll give this movie a LOT of slack though because Japan couldn't afford to waste a lot of money on this film. It's a miracle that it turned out looking as good as it did. I can only imagine the horrible working hours and conditions that went into the making of this film. What's interesting is that it doesn't look anything like American cartoon films of the 40s like Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Song of the South, etc. Instead it resembles Max Fleischer cartoons from the 1920s. In case you don't know your animation history, that's the guy who inspired all the art from Cuphead.Sound:Screaming children and one of the most annoying songs I've heard in a children's movie. One thing I will say is that the English used by the Americans is shockingly some of the best English I've heard in an anime! That's because they used Japanese ambassdors that actually spoke English instead of professional voice actors who are sounding out their lines phonetically. Amusingly, most seemed to have learned English with a British accent. So you have American characters voiced by Japanese who sound like Brits.Overall:I'm not just giving this a low score because it's Axis propaganda. I'm giving it a low score because this is one of slowest, most joyless children's films I've ever sat through. When I found out the director really didnt want to make this film and was forced, it made perfect sense. That's exactly what it feels like. The best part of this film is seeing the ending credits roll. At least Japan can rest easy that their Axis partners Italy and Germany have both made even worse cartoons. Italy made all the animated Titanic films, while Germany has Dingo Pictures. That's one of the nicest things I can say about Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors. At least it isn't a Dingo cartoon. Although now I really want to see an edit where the Japanese Furry Force is visited by their ally Obersturmbannführer Wabuu!";Not Recommended
1;Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei;Jaguar-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jaguar-chan;3;"MID 2 to LIGHT 5. I found some aspects okay but dislike others.Well, that was something. I've never watched feature-length propaganda, nor have I watched much pre-60s animation. This was a new experience for me, and, in both the propaganda and animation aspects, the movie was morbidly interesting.As a Pinoy, well... I think it should be obvious how I feel about the propaganda. Although, I want to note a caveat in my take.The way they depict themselves liberating the natives from those nasty whites sounds similar to nationalist propaganda in my home country. The somewhat messy relationship between the natives and the white men is a relationship heavily played upon in politics and rhetoric here, and I believe most Filipinos agree that being free from the Americans was approximately a good thing. *cue that famous Manuel Quezon quote*Of course, Japan being the one to bring that liberation? Not at all true or justified. In many ways, the Japanese were worse occupiers than the Americans. (Not that America did nothing wrong, but Japan was brutal, to put it mildly). And we WERE getting independence soon anyway, so Japan's ""well-intentioned intervention"" was not needed at all. (I am being a bit overly specific here because the rhetoric also includes other Southeast Asian colonies that weren't due for independence).Also, uh... ""Devil's Island""? Really?That said, watching propaganda is a very intriguing experience. The way they glorified industrialization and deforestation... The way they censor the violence in trying to make war appealing to children... The way the English/American officers spoke during the surrender negotiations about how ""the war is on their side already"" as if Japan was self-aware that she was losing... I feel like I have a more nuanced view on WWII Japanese ideology after watching this movie.Not that I'll raise the score for this. None of this historical and academic value arises from the film's quality itself.The production itself is amateurish but interestingly so. It looks like they were still trying to figure out how this ""animation"" thing is supposed to be done. Most of the movement is slow and takes far too many frames. Its sound design is messy. (I'm not talking about the static caused by old microphones. I'm talking about how the sounds don't consistently change with the cut, how the camera should've changed position but the ambiance sounds unchanged). The child actors suck (but in a kinda adorable way). Animation errors and missing frames aplenty. The facial animation is... morbidly fascinating (a.k.a. creepy AF).However, I did unironically enjoy a few things about the flick. Here and there, there were a few hints of that early cartoon charm with all the singing and dancing. I liked how the film's overall premise is just a bunch of animals dancing and having fun with their *wartime* routines (until they go and stab some white men). It reminds of animation shorts I used to watch when I was younger which were pretty much just a bunch of fun kids and animals dancing and playing. The film accomplishes this appeal somewhat well, and while it's not the best at it, it achieves a state of fun bliss in a few scenes. Enough to make me rate some moments a light 5.Animation-wise, the background art looks fine, some of the larger crowd shots have some dynamic compositions and animation, and the music shared the orchestral energy of all those old cartoons. Despite most of the movie feeling like the animators were still learning how to do everything, they got some things right.The movie surprised me when they managed to get actual English voice actors to star. I don't know why they'd agree to such a role depicting them as horribly cowardly. Either that or they got REALLY talented Japanese voice actors, but I find that hard to imagine. Maybe I just don't watch that much propaganda. This might be a common occurrence if the pay was hefty enough to justify this humiliation.To conclude, it's still propaganda, as you'd expect. However, you might learn some things on how the WWII Japanese viewed themselves, others, and their place in the world. As an animation though, it does have some charm to its aesthetic, despite the animators obviously still learning the craft.";Not Recommended
2;Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;2;This is the first ever feature length animated movie to come out of Japan - and it is an overt propaganda film sanctioned by the Imperial Navy during the peak of the Pacific theatre of the second World War.Imperial Japan was being embargoed by most of the world's manufacturers at the time - primarily the US, UK and their colonies and resources in the Island Nation were difficult to come across. This was increasingly so in the case of precious goods like celluloid or chemical dyes used for feature length animated films. It was one of the primary reasons why most of the works of this period in Japan, both before and after the war were relatively short in length ( budgetary imitations were another constraint).Post War analysts have consistently portrayed the Imperial expansionists as delusional and optimistic about a war they were inevitably bound to lose and boosting morale had become a primary thrust to sustain the war effort. Animations were seen as the perfect tool to sustain this level of fervent propaganda, and as such the Imperial Navy provided (for those times) a carte blanche in terms of budget.Yet, the Momotarou films both turn out incredibly insipid in their contrivances and their motivations. The military thought it was a good idea to coerce an open communist sympathizer who they had forcibly arrested and tortured earlier and drafted into a war effort he did not personally agree with, into the making of a propaganda film serving to justify it.Even for its time, these propaganda films seemed like poor works of arts compared to some of the experimental stuff Japanese animators were doing privately on their own. A look at the facial expressions of the anthropomorphic characters shows how effort to detail was minimized and a working copy could be produced. The irony of the entire work is that it released when the Naval Flagship was dramatically downed by the American Navy and a death blow to the Japanese War effort.The movie has some good background art, but character designs and plot details are pretty lackluster. The aforementioned lack of celluloid ensured that such a length movie could not possibly have a single theme for the entire runtime, and thus we end up seeing an anthology of disparate ideas and stories strung together to provide the complete propaganda buffet to the audience.This film is constantly cited as a huge influence for Osamu Tezuka, which I personally find hard to understand - especially given how the creator of this work disowned it himself as an exercise in bonded labor. There are several other works both before and after this one that accomplish much more with much less on hand.;Not Recommended
3;Momotarou: Umi no Shinpei;The_Namer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/The_Namer;3;Oh jeez, where do I even start with a film that has such a difficult history? While not technically the first anime, this was the first feature-length anime film. And it's WWII propaganda. There are two ways to approach a film like this: as a piece of entertainment or a historical artefact. Depending on which you opt for, you'll have two very different experiences.Viewed in isolation, purely on its own narrative merits as a piece of entertainment, Momotaro doesn't hold up. That's not necessarily a failure on its part because its primary aim is to indoctrinate as much as entertain, but there's not much left for an audience where the propaganda aspect is anachronistic. Also, the expectations for an animated film have changed so much in the decades since. The Disney influence on this film is obvious, and that extends beyond the animation style. When you think of early US animation, the likes of Snow White or Bambi are the ones that come to mind, but between Warner's Merrie Melodies and the likes of Saludos Amigos it was just as common for them to just be a string of song-and-dance routines. Momotaro sits somewhere in the middle. Very little happens narratively for the first hour of this 75-minute movie, with the emphasis being more on songs until the assault on the subtly named Devil's Island begins. The strong nationalistic angle of these songs makes for uncomfortable viewing, especially the one where the army teach the alphabet to a village of 'savages', which was clearly intended to have children singing along.If you view Momotaro as an artistic work, however, there's more to appreciate. This was decades before Tezuka defined the signature look of anime, and it offers a glimpse into a different evolutionary path that could have been. As Japan's first animated feature, it's not only surprisingly accomplished, it uses advanced techniques that would all but disappear until long after. Most striking are the depth-of-field effects, which must have required a multi-layered rostrum. There's also complex parallax scrolling, characters moving in and out of shadow, and one stunning shot at a waterfall where it transitions from one painted background, through a fully animated camera angle shift, to a different painted background. The overall atmosphere of the visuals also changes drastically in the final 15 minutes, taking on more realistic lighting while the paratroopers wait inside the plane.The overall feel of motion is completely different from the stylised look of later anime. There's a realistic sense of weight to much of it, undermined only by the languid smoothness of having such a high sheet count throughout. Particularly impressive is the attention paid to air flow on fabric, with the collars of sailor suits catching the wind, and parachutes filling and collapsing in a convincing manner.This is a hard one to give a score out of ten. If you watch it for entertainment, it's a 3/10. If you watch it with an academic eye, it's a 7/10.;Not Recommended

0;Yakusai Kochou;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;6;Demon Fighter Kocho can best be described as a parody of echii action shows. It features over the top and gratuitous nudity and it pokes fun at both itself and the entire genre. Despite its short length it manages to be mildly amusing.In a show of just barely thirty minutes, you can’t expect much in terms of epic storytelling and that’s the case with Demon Fighter Kocho. However it does some things right, foremost being to keep both the plot and the cast simple. The basic premise is laid out in the first few minutes along with an amusing narration by the main character Urano introducing the principle characters. Nothing in the story is taken seriously. The characters often talk to the audience which makes the absurdities of the plot much more humorous than they would be if played straight. The main focus of the plot seems to be to get Kocho out of her clothes, which she does...often. This would normally come across as extremely tacky and not all that funny, but for some reason it just works. Though there are quite a few laughs it is not uproariously funny either.The characters are simple but sufficient for the stories needs. We are introduced to the cast right up front and it becomes obvious what their archetypes are seconds after first seeing them. The title character Kocho is your standard tsundere who despite being perpetually naked seems to be eternally embarrassed each time she exposes herself. Urano is your typical nose bleeding perverted male lead. Throw in the sexy younger sister Koran who is always clinging to Urano (much to Kocho's chagrin) and the perverted middle age teacher always dreaming up elaborate ways to get Kocho naked. Taken by themselves or out of context they aren’t that interesting but much like the echiiness in the story they just seem to work.Art and animation is pretty good. The action is nicely done and interesting and the character models are good for this time period. Since Kocho spends so much time completely naked, I suppose I should comment that at least her figure is drawn well and has a realistically proportioned body type. The EN song is decent but that the only real music in the show. Voice cast does a nice job of portraying their characters personalities but it’s nothing that really stands out.Overall Demon Fighter Kocho has some hilarious moments, but it’s just an average show that doesn’t do anything exceptionally well. Fans of echii comedy who want to see something amusing that wouldn’t take up too much of their time should give this short OVA a look.;Mixed Feelings

The camera seemed to be moving in an abnormal, even nauseating way. It's hard to truly describe what I mean, but if you watch that particular upload, you'll understand.

But no... it's just another awful, lazy hentai trying to make a quick buck on a custom fetish.Art & Animations: As I said before, lazy. There is no effort in either elements when visuals are a key factor in hentai.

The female's bodies aren't flattering in the uniforms they're meant to wear (defeating the purpose.) The males aren't anything to look at when you have to look at them quite a bit. The guy in the beginning of the 1st episode should be enough to make you turn around.Voices & Sound: They're soooo off man. The flow of sex and sound aren't in syn. Lips are moving with no sound, people are talking when no one on screen is talking; it's a mess. I feel they made the animation first, then did the voice acting in one go.Overall: tragic really.

This is a hit and miss love affair that stumbles along due to a series of misunderstandings. romantic detours and distance between the lovers. This is a great hentai title for those who want more to go with their hentai content. This is a straight romance hentai with no odd fetishes or uncomfortable moments due to forced sex or bizarre tentacle monsters. This is the kind of series you happily watch with someone you love.This hentai series was released in 1999 and the graphical style is very representative of that era. The animation is pretty good and has some wonderfully naughty character designs to serve as eye candy. The story does a great job of keeping you interested all the way to the end and the characters are well developed. It is available fully uncensored and has an English dub available, although I did not care for the English voice cast at all.Conclusion: this one is worth watching for the story and some decent action. If you are just looking for straight hentai material, look elsewhere, but if you want some substance with your fap material I am sure you will like this!;Recommended
0;Kiss yori...;JPBear;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JPBear;4;It's always a plus point when the sex is actually consensual, however the sex in question is quite bland and does not look very sexy (the animation didn't age well and you actually don't see much), very tame if you're used to actually seeing details. Story wise I'd say at least say they tried. But it's generally a harem anime that contains mild sex. The characters aren't unique or interesting in the least and the voice acting isn't the best either. It has your standard relationship misunderstandings so you won't be surprised either.

0;Xingchen Bian: Xingchen Yao Hai;math20082;https://myanimelist.net/profile/math20082;10;Welcome to Xingchen Bian season 3 ! If you painfully survived season 2 and you're wondering if you should continue then congrats because it gets better.This season and the next one are a lot more packed with action than the previous one. A lot of antagonist are introduced, many of them with little importance which can be a problem for some. But what I really like about this season is that you truly start to realize how big the world is and how minor the last season was.The fighting itself is pretty good, a lot better than last season.I won't go into too much details cuz that would be spoilers but one minor warning: Some people felt that the power-ups of Qin Yu seemed more forced than in the 1st season and didn't feel like it rewarded hard work. You may feel the same thing in this season, but there are 2 reasons for that. The first is that Qin Yu has been following an already existing technique while he had to do it by himself in season 1. Plus the start of cultivation is a lot harder when you come from a mortal kingdom with zero knowledge. Qin yu has been eating jin dan of beats he killed which helps a lot.The second reason in this season specifically is time skip. It might be hard to follow if you're unfamiliar with cultivation stories but the lifespan of cultivators is a lot. I think Qin Yu is Late Yuanying at the start of the season (Mortal->Xiantian->Jindan->Yuanying) which means his lifespan is in the thousand years. 5s in the anime might be equivalent to several years.TLDR ~ It gets a lot better, you should give it a try.

0;Zephyr;RisingSun5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RisingSun5;7;I have found when watching anime that sometimes the most unassuming titles end up being the most impressive. Last fall I loved Ore Twintails despite the fact that no one expected anything from it. Of course, most people don’t like it as much as I do, but maybe I’m just weird. But even more obscure than Twintains, last fall there was a little known one episode OVA by the name of Zephyr.The thing that makes Zephyr interesting is how difficult it is to find online. Apparently it was a special made for some type of special event, and even months after it came out on dvd, there was nowhere online to stream it. I only recently found it online, but it wasn’t in English sub. Of course, after finding some version of it after so long, I didn’t care about the lack of subs, so I decided to watch it anyway!So yes, I’m reviewing an anime where I didn’t know what the characters were saying 90% of the time. Well, as Kamina always said, sometimes you just have to throw logic out the window and do the impossible.So, what is the story here? Well, I’m not entirely sure myself.It’s a music anime, focusing on these 4 band members. However, there was a great war, that caused a lot of damage, and the band stopped playing music. We see the back stories of some of the characters and what they lost, but then see them come back together and play a song at the end. While it’s hard for me to judge the story beyond just the premise, what I saw here I liked. The anime seems to be less about music itself, and more about the band members and what they have gone through, with the music just being a link that ties them together. I really think a story like this could do well as a full series, really fleshing out the characters and what they went through in this war, and perhaps using the music to show how they cope, and maybe even the power of their music to influence others. So yeah, the story is certainly much more than just cute boys doing cute music things, and that I appreciate.Animation wise the show did look really good most of the time. I even went to get a screen shot from the one part to use as a wallpaper for my computer. Although for some reason they switched to 3d for the song which just seemed odd. The background music was good, able to accent the moods the show wanted to convey, especially with the buildup to the band playing together again, and the song at the end was cool. The voice acting also seemed to be very good, able to convey the emotions, and what the characters meant, even if I didn’t know the exact words.And well, I guess that’s about it. I’d like to say more about this show, but there isn’t much I can say. Still, it was an interesting experience trying to follow along with the story, and when it does get subbed, I’ll watch it again, and if they end up making a full series out of the story, I’d gladly watch it. So I give Zephyr a temporary score of 6.75/10, and a rating of Worth Checking Out. The score is based only on the animation and sound, so will likely change if I ever get to see the show subbed.As for recommendations, let’s go with Number 6. It’s a dystopia story with some shonen ai through in because why not. It’s not the greatest, but if you got excited about watching Zephyr, I get the feeling you may like Number 6 as well. If you want something more music oriented…I can’t think of much. K-On is boring, Bakamatsu Rock tires to be fun by being complete over the top, but I lost interest in it. There is Show By Rock which also takes the music genre in an interesting direction with lots of pretty colors, so yeah, go with that.;Recommended

He was originally chosen as the representative to go to the Heavenly Star Academy in order to further improve his cultivation instead of his supposed cousin. At the academy, Ye Xinghe demonstrates extraordinary potential and is taken in by Vice Principal Xu. During a training exercise in the forest, Ye Xinghe and his group are attacked. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, Ye Xinghe is expelled from the academy and he returns to his village.He is berated by his clan, but Ye Xinghe changes their minds by healing and protecting them from the Dark Moon Family. He is eventually joined by Xia Yuning, and the couple embark on numerous adventures. During his adventures, Ye Xinghe meets a mysterious lady named Shang'Guan Xuan, and under her guidance, he is able to achieve a very high cultivation level.(source: smgt fandom)Story: 5/10Star Martial God Technique adaptation is hard to follow and very vague. The series skips a lot of details that were in the novel and manhua such as subcategories of Star Martial power - Ye Xinghe's Star power is healing but there is also haste and many others but the series skips these particular details probably for story consistency. This makes the story bland and dissimilar to other cultivation series - it lacks motivation since we are just listening about the world from random side characters.Art & Sound: 4/10 & 5/10The CGI art and character design of this series is basically just replication of Ruo Hong Culture's other projects. We see that Ye Xinhe's cousin Ye Xingyun is surprisingly a replication of the MC in Wonderland of Ten Thousands with different hairs and clothing. Furthermore, the background/setting when Xia Yuning is sleeping on the rock when getting chased by assassins with Ye Xinghe - is the reused waterfall background from Wonderland of Ten Thousands where Ye Xingyun cultivates with the brother of Ye Xueyan. I've come to a realization that these are where studios cut costs to compromise for low budget adaptations.The VA / BGM sound was fairly decent, nothing out of the ordinary.Character: 4/10Since the series rushes through the worldbuilding and character establishment by skimping on details we are left with characters that are empty - a very common prospect among low budget cultivation series made by Ruo Hong Culture. I personally enjoyed the manhua because you could visibly feel exhaustion in the characters facial expression (in the camping arc) The students and teachers weren't excessively arrogant like in the donghua where they intentionally judged the situation of Ye Xinghe being the killer after seeing bodies. I guess they just set this up so it makes sense to kick Ye Xinghe out of the Star Academy but it's cheap character progression.Enjoyment / Overall: 5/10If you want senseless zero to hero overpowered main character beating his opponents, this is a donghua to watch but if you want a meaningful zero to hero overpowered main character story Soul Land or Mortal's Journey is better. For what it's worth, Star Martial God Technique was entertaining for the latter half of the series.;Mixed Feelings
0;Xing Wushen Jue;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;4;"Xing Wu Shen Jue (Star Godly Martial Arts Technique) started out with an interesting power system of multiple parallel cultivation methods of which the rarest one, the star method, has affinity with the protagonist. At first, Ye Xinghe appears to be a humble protagonist with an altruistic goal, having chosen to sacrifice his own dignity for the well being of his family in an opening scene. He realizes that a wealthier clan could easily cause trouble for his family business even if he beats up a fellow student in the short run. That kind of foresight is delightful in a protagonist. Unfortunately, that was bait and switch marketing material, since some time half-way into the show, he flips. The original protagonist being withdrawn and careful turns into an edgy asshole that openly invites conflict and humiliates the enemy, and insults his friends with his awkward communication skills. Nothing causes this change. It just happens. And it calls into question the very premise of the show.Of course, that doesn't stop his harem from carrying on as if it's business as usual, with girls lining up, begging to be with him, and him brushing them off without even a conversation. But he has no trouble playing up ecchi tropes, where Ye Xinghe ""accidentally"" touches these female characters, or trips and falls on them, or is put into contrived situations where he must give them mouth to mouth CPR to ""save"" them, etc. And predictably, these damsels in distress gets mad, slaps him, and then want to marry him.Each character, villain and protagonist alike, seem immature and lack the confidence to properly communicate. And what's more insulting is that some of these characters are supposedly adults, while others are supposedly multiple levels above a protagonist that doesn't even know how to fight 5 episodes ago, and now he's sweeping women off their feet. It seems in bad anime that no matter how strong a woman is, even if she could do back flips and dispatch enemies like nothing, she still has to trip and fall into the arms of a man. It's like fanservice to incel fantasy.To be clear, nearly every cultivation power fantasy or isekai has a protagonist that gains levels at incredible speed. But usually, they remain relatively stable in character, whether they start out as arrogant assholes, or they remain committed to their values. In Xing Wu Shen Jue, Ye Xinghe isn't some master transported to an isekai; in fact, just episodes earlier he is confused as to why his cultivation improves on a much faster pace, and why he has more energy than others. There is no scene where he realizes his power in order to propel a change in character. He just suddenly gains confidence, like his character changes to fit the role the author expects to push the plot forward. The change feels so dissonant and inauthentic.Moreover, plot developments are less than exciting, with each potential thread fraying before any result. It feels like Ye Xinghe and company are just strung along to where they need to be, and perhaps that's why the forced character change was necessary. At one point, there's a fellow student that is murdered on a camping trip, and it becomes an intriguing murder mystery. How is the thoughtful and timid Ye Xinghe going to solve it? By randomly overpowering everyone and defeating his teachers in battle of course. It's just so ridiculous that nothing after that had credibility.If you are to start watching the show at around episode 25, the show would probably be average. It would have all the same cliches as all the other shows: an unlikely bet to save the family clan, and a tournament arc. Except the protagonist seems like an 8th grade syndrome asshole with eyeliner given the powers to meet his perversity. He still mistreats women all the time. Even if it gets alright in a second season, you should probably still figure when push comes to shove, the author wouldn't be able to hold his own weight.";Not Recommended

In the same time, a band of silly villains plan to destroy the time machine and get the professor for themselves, so they can be the only time travelers left and spread evil deeds throughout history. On every episode, the team searches a different time period (prehistoric age, wild west, etc.) and fights the villains and/or local bad guys of that time.

All the guys were SO Hot like i watched this super bad quality and I still could see all their sexy faces. Only thing that made me nervous was the amazing ost like whenever you were in the last 20 seconds it would start before the actual piano piece honestly terrifying since I loved the show and it ending broke my heart.;Recommended

0;Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai Kanzenban;jonunderw00d;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jonunderw00d;4;"I really don't see the point of watching this ""Kanzenban"" edition of The Magnificent Kotobuki other than the additional background info given in the beginning of the movie. It's neither kan (complete) nor zen (whole).Really, the only reason you want to watch this movie is just for the first 10 minutes of the movie which provides new background content that helps set the plot of the anime series. Beyond that, the movie is a just a horrible compilation of the series with emphasis on the action and aerial dogfighting. Cutting a nearly-four-hour series and trimming it into half the runtime is not exactly the best move if the aim is to create a compilation.If your aim is to get into the series for the first time, just watch the first 10 minutes of the Kanzenban movie and then proceed directly to the first episode of the TV series.";Not Recommended
0;Musashi no Ken;EternityOfPain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EternityOfPain;10;"*Review 2.0 on this series, my first review was rushed*Musashi no ken, I remember when I first wanted to watch this series back in 2007. At the time there were two options available. Either A) buy the R2 (for a grand total of over $600 USD) or B) get the RAW&rsquo;s from some online torrent (which I might add didn&rsquo;t exist) and wing it. Well Option A was out of the question (way to poor as your run of the mill college student to pay for that, let alone DVDs without subs.. ) Well, Fast-forward to November 2008 when I happened to locate a greatly priced box set of the series, with.. you guessed it.. subs! Couldn&rsquo;t pass it up and glad I didn&rsquo;t. This is what I have to report:I managed to finish this series in 4 days (would have been 3 but life gets in the way) it&rsquo;s been a long time since I have marathoned a series, so when it happens, I know I really enjoyed. This series has it all: action, suspense, drama, but most importantly it has substance. When you finish a series of this caliber you know you have just finished something great, something you know you will definitely re-watch down the road.The plot is intriguing and through the massive 72 episode series I can&rsquo;t recall a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; or lack substance episode, everything was concrete and rock solid. The art is fantastic considering an early 80s series, the sound is amazing (I have lost count as to how many times I have listened to the OP and ED of this series). The real enjoyment offered by musashi no ken is definitely the characters. No character is simply placed in the series without a purpose. Each one is defined, and not forgotten throughout the series. The series combines the badass of Hajime no ippo and the amazing aspects of Major (being able to see the main character grow from a young age to an adult gradually throughout the series).This series rejuvenated my passion for Kendo that I had sadly stopped two years ago (now going 2 weeks strong back into practice). This series can be enjoyed by everyone, kendo enthusiast, anime sports fans, and general anime fans looking for a superb series that offers a great storyline and an outstanding cast. If this sounds like your cup of tea, look no further. Find Musashi no ken, and watch it. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.";Recommended

The art and animation was sufficient and they used one of the best songs on the anime's OST. It's just out of place by itself-- wish they would've fit this into the final episode and then featured that as an alternate last episode. This way, viewers who hadn't watched Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn in a while (like myself) could understand this in context of the story. The alternate ending is enjoyable, and anyone who has watched Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn will appreciate extra content, but again it would be much more compelling if inserted into the episode.;Recommended
0;Akiba-chan;lithiumflower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lithiumflower;7;"""She's magical, oh, she's magical... Akiba-chan! One more time!""Akiba-chan is an odd series, to put it mildly. After all, it's not often you come across a series acted out entirely with dolls and a little CG magic. Luckily in the case of Akiba-chan it works quite nicely, albeit while lacking the depth and staying power of many series utilizing more classic tried-and-true techniques.Rather than having an ongoing plot carry over from episode to episode, Akiba-chan has episodic storylines arranged in five-minute vignettes. Each episode has a cute but somewhat shallow story; one episode has Akiba-chan and Milk-chan making chocolate, another has Akiba-chan trying to lose some weight. Rather than developing any kind of depth, the stories are driven by the personalities of the characters, most commonly Akiba-chan and her dojikko nature. Really, in place of a story they've substituted cute characters being cute.And combined with Akiba-chan's aesthetic, it actually works nicely. The dolls take a little getting used to, but the CG that smoothes out their movement is nearly seamless and speeds up the 'getting used to it' process. In keeping with the characters' dollish appearances, the colours are bright and vibrant; as the title suggests they look like items any otaku could proudly display on their shelves. Of course while the style has its high points it also has its limitations; the characters' movements are often jerky and awkward, and they don't emote very well.Perhaps attempting to compensate for this, the voice cast puts around twice the amount of inflection and emotion into the characters' voices that they might normally. The result is a perpetual boucy, cutesy, overacted banter that would kill all realism... had it not gone out the window the second the sugary earworm opening theme kicked off the first episode. Because of the over-the-top cutesy nature of the show itself, the over-the-top cutesy nature of the voicework is actually a perfect fit. The fact that the leading ladies keep to relatively realistic tones instead of heading straight for the old 'gratingly squeaky-cute' standby really doesn't hurt things either.Of course the problem with an episode series built on cute and little more is that, 3D though the characters may be, they still come across as totally flat. Akiba-chan is a dojikko, Riki-chan is a tomboy, and so on... but they don't get any development at all beyond the sparse cover provided by their generic labels. Granted the short episodes don't give time for character development any more than it gives time for deep, thought-provoking storylines, but after a few episodes 'Akiba-chan does something silly and it's cute' gets kind of old.Overall, Akiba-chan is like a sugary desert: it's good while it lasts, but once you've finished you really don't want even a little more. Akiba-chan's ten episode course is the perfect duration. It goes until its shtick gets stale and then stops; even one episode more could very well be too much. I feel that if it was a series of the usual 23-minute installments that lasted a full season I would probably want to pitch my laptop out the window by the end of the first episode, but for what it was it was just right, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.";Recommended

I've read the manhua and it is much more entertaining and tolerable than the adapted Donghua, Spirit Sword Sovereign 2nd season is garbage it's no wonder why it's hard to find online.StoryIn the second season, the tournament arc that displays ones martial strength and ability to join one of the 4/5 major Martial halls. Chu Xing Yun shows exceptional talent by winning this tournament and joining Yu Yun's masters Martial Hall as an inner disciple in order to learn about methods to save his beloved from her life threatening ice-blood condition.This donghua has been very vague in the details since the beginning, the pacing is very fast which leads to a lossy way of plot development and as a result many plot holes.CharactersI get the feeling the characters exist in this Donghua to serve as a stepping stone for Chu Xing Yun because in the Manhua, he treats everyone with respect if they treat him with resect like Poisonous Yan. When Poisonous Yan agrees to follow Chu Xing Yun as a slave, he gets better treatment but throughout this season I haven't seen this treatment and Poisonous Yan's following is one sided. Furthermore,Chu Xing Yun is such a tryhard in the Donghua, he is arrogant and can't back it up with his reincarnated powers. He has the wind attribute which allows him to seemingly teleport but for some reason in his battles this season he decides it's a good idea to use his sword to outwit his opponent head-on which is stupid. Then at the end he magically uses the spirit power absorption and never uses it again it feels like his powers are just used once and never mentioned but replaced with new techniques. He literally owns martial arts techniques and he has trouble fighting people at the same age as him that didn't reincarnate, that's just embarrassing.Art & SoundBad art and bad sound. I could barely find this series online and it had terrible subtitle translations. If it wasn't for the Manhua, I wouldn't be persisting but this is a hit or miss watch.;Not Recommended
0;Wonder (Movie);waifu2000;https://myanimelist.net/profile/waifu2000;8;I opened an account to write this review, and to be honest I find it laughable that people who consider themselves visual or unable to properly decipher abstract art feel the need to write on what they do not know. I think a persons inability to stay entertained during Wonder is directly related to the overstimulation that most anime provides. Obviously ignoring that this is not like other anime, the main indication is that it is done completely by hand, no CGI or cutting edge tech production to engage your overly stimulated brain.The only think that can be seen in its merits, which lie in the attention to detail. Drawn by hand every aspect of the short film is patiently actualized in a lucid manor. Over time a story forms, its nothing with a plot but a story of pictures that have the potential to convey multiple topics, whichever your mind finds.The forms themselves aren't particularly original I'll admit however, it is the gestures and movements that make it so incredible for me. I've seen this film a few times now, forgetting then rediscovering it, each time I walk away with something new, be it new details I didn't realize or a new feeling if attached to the story. And in my option... that is no small feat for any media.Highly underrated as it may be, do I think it is a masterpiece? No. But really, what do you have to lose?;Recommended
1;Wonder (Movie);Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;9;"Mizue Mirai’s animations are noteworthy for creating the sensation of a digital-esque cleanliness, despite being hand drawn. Most of Mirai's works feel like they're proof of concepts, but Wonder feels complete and in my mind is his magnum opus. This film came together when somewhere in 2012 Mirai decided to start drawing one second of a short film every day for a year, with evey day continuing from the last day. Though some parts of the film feel much simpler, as if Mirai was too busy that day to create anything impressive, the vast majoritiy of this film is wonderfully animated, with an enormous amount of different ways Mirai finds to animate different coloured shapes bending, fusing, splitting, appearing and disappearing. Sometimes, when I watch this film, I notice a moment where there is such a wealth of stuff happening at once, that I sit there in wonder: how could Mirai possibly keep track of all this stuff?When I first watched Wonder I didn’t really get it. I saw a few simple animations and I thought the style was interesting, but I didn’t get what the point was. The music that was playing was abstract and could barely be described as music. This could be said for most of Mirai’s works, except for his music videos. I was starting to get a little bored and as I was debating whether I would be able to sit through all of this, suddenly this goofy ass song started playing and it immediately put a huge smile on my face. It turns out that this anime short film about abstract animation is mostly kept strung together by one of the most fun and wholesome songs I’ve ever heard in my life, and I love it.Now that I was hearing this lovely song I was instantly hooked and the animations suddenly made a lot more sense to me. Before there had been a few bits of sound that seemed to be timed to work with the animation, but other than that these two elements seemed divorced from each other. Now I was watching a music video, where the music informs the emotions that the visuals portray or enhance. Not only that: there was now a theme. This goofy ass song now conveyed an air of goofy fun; and with that I was hooked on getting to know what out there visuals Mirai could create and let a dense atmosphere of fun wash over me.When you’re looking at abstract animations like this one, what’s most interesting about them isn’t how different it is from everything else, but what things from real life it decides to keep. Wonder portrays a few things you might recognise: vaguely animal or human like shapes, waves and flowing liquid and most strangely, puking. But the most noteworthy aspect of his style is his constant use of cells. Even if it’s just a strangely shaped splatter of paint, many of Mirai’s creations will have a coloured circle inside a different coloured circle inside of it. Most of these creations are coloured dots with tails that often swim around, so it’s clear they’re meant to look like cells; but he also sometimes uses what somewhat looks like naturalistic pencil drawings of plant cells.One of my favourite moments in the film is when a couple of green dots bounce around on a black mass of sorts and it both looks like they’re bouncing around on a piece of some elastic material and like they’re sinking into the black mass like your fingers would into a mass of watery foam. How exactly he manages to uphold both these feelings at the same time is still a mystery to me, but perplexing details, that you might not catch on your first watch, are what to me makes Mirai’s style irreplacable.Later in the film there is a moment where the music changes. Suddenly there is a spooky air to the film and the visuals change to match. Despite me saying that the music is what strings the animation together, the music hasn’t done that great of a job untill this point of matching big changes of what’s happening on screen. It doesn’t quite feel like it was handcrafted to match Mirai’s work. But this change in the music is different and properly signifies a change in theme that the animation was going through.I call it spooky, but if it’s that, it would be some of the most wholesome and goofy spooky music I’ve ever heard. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else would raise his eyebrows when I referred to it as spooky and would use a completely different word. That said, the visuals from this point on are definitely a bit more disturbing. There is a larger focus on human like shapes and there’s even some puking. One moment involves a cell swimming down a tight corridor and finding at the end of it a bigger cell without a tail, resembling insemination. Where as in earlier segments of the film there could be tons of colours on the screen at once, this part consistently limits itself to smaller colour palettes. This is also the part of the film where you might notice that the colouring job Mirai is doing is getting rougher and rougher and you can clearly see he’s using paint.After this section there is one more short, fun bit like the rest of the film, before there is another shift is music and visuals. The music is now accompanied by vocals. All they sing is: Wawwa, Wawwa. It’s very goofy. But whereas the music is being added to, the animation is devolving. Shapes are getting rougher and rougher and the transitions get less smooth and animated and random images start flashing across the screen. This is ususally the part of the film where I wake and realise what a deep trance I have been in. I let a slight sigh and as I slowly leave the trance, I feel as if I’m under the shower and the water is slowly getting colder. I decide to enjoy the last moments of the film as it quickly devolves into random splatters of paint and ends. I will also give an epilepsy warning for this final part of the film.Wonder is one of those anime I can frequently watch and once I’ve finished it, automatically sigh: “God I love this anime.” It’s not a perfect anime, but it also never gets old. It’s not an anime you think deeply about afterwards, but it’s one you will occasionally crave for that in-the-moment experience. Mirai’s craftsmanship is unique and I’m very happy it exists.If you want to get into Mirai’s other works, there’s a few recommendations I have. ‘Playground’ feels like it’s an earlier rendition of Wonder, made by a less experienced and established Mirai. ‘And And’ and ‘Poker’ are both music video’s like wonder, though I personally don’t like them quite as much. More famous earlier works of Mirai like ‘a log day of timbre’ and ‘Jam’ don’t give anything that Wonder can’t give you; that’s why I referred to them as ‘Proof of concept,’ but they’re not awful. I rated ‘The baby birds of Norman McLaren’ a 7 on mal, but I don’t remember why. A less worked out short that’s completely different from Wonder is ‘Modern,’ which has a very different, more geometrical, animation style. Lastly there is ‘Futsuu tte Nandarou?’ Which is a collection of 5 short stories, by random people, with accompanying animation from 5 different animators. Though I couldn’t find a translated version last I checked. None of these hold up, however, to Wonder. I love this movie and with this review I hoped to properly convey what I love about it so much, as I can’t find anyone else who has done so yet. And maybe if you didn’t get it and you read my review out of confusion, you might now be able to return to it and appreaciate it’s brilliance. Though probably not.";Recommended

Any ""meaning"" I could write about would really only be my interpretation, and to be honest I'm not really one of those guys who spends hours of time poring over and interpreting the abstract. If you are that kind of person then feel free to give it a shot, there's certainly a lot of possible meanings one could take from this.It's a lot harder to recommend to someone if you're not that kind of person. Not so much because it's bad, but rather because it just kind of is. The animation is certainly smooth and the art style is pleasant, but it's not something your average person would be willing to write home about.The music is in a rather similar boat. It's a nice inoffensive companion to the animation, but overall isn't actually anything special. I certainly couldn't see myself listening to it on its own, as it just doesn't really have enough substance to hold itself up.Overall what I'd say is this: It's worth giving a shot if you've got nothing better to do and ten minutes to kill, but don't feel the need to go especially out of your way to see it.";Mixed Feelings
0;Wonder (Movie);Shimbels;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shimbels;4;(4/10 is a good score for me, see my profile)Wonder isn't particularly visually mind bending, in fact I imagine anyone watching this has seen similar blobby animated doodles in the past, either as little animated gifs or as more properly realised flash animations on Newgrounds or someplace like that. It isn't boring, but since I am such a visually minded person when it comes to film criticism I was naturally drawn to the mechanical process of the movement, and in that respect the film doesn't blow me away. It's merely quite pretty.What distinguishes this one is that it's hand drawn and that it was made over the course of a year, with 24 frames being drawn in one day as a strict timetable. That it was hand drawn does not interest me in the slightest, but the strict structuring of development is actually quite interesting to me as it brings out the devices of improvisation and the process of shifting interests.Essentially the film is a fascinating visual diagram of animator Mizue's trains of thought, in that his imagination is captured for a few days or a week maybe on one specific idea before moving on to another. One idea is a series of colourful amorphous blobs drifting without purpose until they are dissected by a rigid spike running around in a circle, but then a second later it all dissolves and a new idea emerges. Perhaps not all the ideas are visually captivating, but some of them are and anyway the cycle of their inception and then retirement is more than enough to make this short worth watching regardless.The ending segment makes me want to see Mizue tackle paint-on-film animation, as it reminded me of The Dante Quartet by Stan Brakhage.;Not Recommended
0;Nendo no Tatakai 2;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;5;Esta review también está en español.Battle of Clay 2 is the second short film made by Nagao Takena, that picturesque dude who likes to make clay as violent as possible.The only sentence in the synopsis sums pretty well what happens: two dummies (actually, half of them, since they don't have legs) play rock paper scissors (or Jan ken po, if you prefer), and the looser have to wear a pot in his head, and get hammered (literally) by the winner. The animation is quite poor (similar to Speed Racer, but with clay xD), the characters are grotesque, no landscapes at all (really, we only see black), and the sound is very bad.That being said, most of you are probably wondering why I give this a 5 and no less. Well there are two reasons: first, it last less than 2 minutes so, no matter how bad you might think it is, it ends quickly. Second, the end was ingenious. If something so short have a nice ending, then it isn't a waste of time.This is one of Takena's weakest works (only better than the first Battle of Clay, in my opinion), it's obvious that he was just beginning with this claymation thing.I recommend this only to fans of his work... and to people who have two minutes to kill without remorse.Also, unlike his future works, this is not particularly violent (I mean no dismemberment or blood pools).--------Battle of Clay 2 es el segundo cortometraje de Nagao Takena, ese pintoresco señor al que le gusta hacer que la plastilina sea violenta.La única oración que hay en la sinopsis resume bastante bien este corte: son dos monigotes (en realidad, solo la mitad, dado que no tienen piernas) que juegan al piedra papel o tijera (o jan-ken-po), en el que el perdedor debe ponerse una cacerola en la cabeza y recibir un leve martillazo por parte del ganador. La animación es bastante precaria (similar a la de meteoro, pero con plastilina xD), los personajes grotescos, el paisaje inexistente, y el sonido es muy, muy malo.Dicho todo esto, probablemente se pregunten por qué lo califique con un 5 y no menos. Bueno, hay dos razones: la primera, dura menos de dos minutos, por lo que sin importar lo malo que puedan pensar que sea, pasa rápido. Segundo, el final es ingenioso. Si en algo de tan poca duración el final vale la pena, entonces no es una pérdida de tiempo.Este es uno de los trabajos más flojos de Takena (de hecho, a mis ojos, solo supera al primer Battle of Clay), se nota que recién estaba empezando. Lo recomiendo para los fans de su trabajo, o para los que tengan un par de minutos que no teman perder. También, a diferencia de sus futuros trabajos, este no es particularmente violento (léase: no hay desmembramiento o fuentes de sangre).;Mixed Feelings

The hammer guy will then try to smash the hammer into the head of the loser before he manages to put the helmet on. The game goes on until one guy gets killed in the process. Just brilliantThe animation is even worse because the damn claymen barely even move. They just sit there shaking their fists for the majority of the videoWhat really kills this one however is the audio. Again, there are two versions following the same pattern as the first video; one is silent and one is not. The version with audio sounds HORRENDOUS.

For a series based around Dark Side Cat's dastardly exploits, there simply aren't that many action shots of him doing anything cool or unexpected with the exception of the first and last episodes. (Which are, not surprisingly, the best ones)Instead, we get a lot of very generic, uninspired action shots. In fact, this often mirrors the story, too; Dark Side Cat's ""sad"" backstory is pretty much as wafer-thin and predictable as that of a JRPG protagonist, as are the personalities of the characters.And frankly, one of the episodes, featuring the little boy, is downright bad and logically poor.That being said, 5 out of the 6 episodes have genuine moments of laughter and excitement throughout, making this one of the better ONAs I've watched.With regards to the art, it uses a very two-dimensional, cardboard cut-out style, similar to what one sees on ""South Park"". Clearly, budget was a factor, but it doesn't end up harming the series much.The music consists solely of Dark Side Cat's theme, a catchy dance pop beat without any lyrics. It's nothing special, but helps set the mood for the action.Overall, clocking in at a total of 36 minutes, Dark Side Cat is certainly worth watching for a viewer with any appreciation for action or humor, but it's nothing extraordinary, either.";Mixed Feelings
1;Ankoku Cat;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;6;Darkside cat is a strange, interesting show. It’s pretty much about a rebel humanoid cat that gets in trouble a lot with the law. In the course of one evening, chasing after a mouse, he breaks a fire hydrant, creates a traffic jam, and runs from the police. Now this show doesn’t really follow Dark Side cat but really what happens because of his interactions with the people of the city.He himself is always silent with the same ‘bad boy’ look in his eyes and yet there are times that he actually does seem nice, mostly to the cats around the area. Each story can mostly stand alone, having only Dark Cat to link them together except for 5 and 6 where they pretty much have to be seen together. It’s more talking about the people that he touches and not really about him. One thing I do wish is that we could get more info on Dark Side Cat instead of only hearing very little about his past in Episode 5.The animation looks like it was created with flash, and its actually really well done as well in that nothing really seems out of place. They have really nice shadows and make them look perfect the dark night that is pretty much the base of the shows. My only problem is that in the animation, there is a character that seems like she would be a man character in the stories but she barely shows up. Action scenes contain a lot of speed lines and still images that seem like Speed Racer at times.There is barely any talking and more sounds and music which are actually pretty cute. It works well.

Not only that but provided some good moral feedback to life.Overall: Why should this show be watched? Sure, it is slightly lacking in sexual allurance, as well as action unlike cat-woman(from batman). However, the story remains true to the characters involved. A cat can't talk in reality so, which should it talk in a cartoon? Well... mostly it stayed true aside from the domestication society had on the cat with his need to walk/run and cloth himself.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ankoku Cat;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;Ankoku Cat is a six episode ONA from Fanworks, a studio I've never reviewed or seen anything from before. Mainly because they haven't done that much. I only found about ten anime listed as having had them work on them, most of which are series with really short run times. So, let's take a look at Ankoku Cat and try to get some idea of what they're about.Story:It's not a complicated story. A city is taking measures to deal with the stray cat problem. A problem which has escalated recently because of the titular Ankoku Cat, who has been causing problems for people with his pranks and who humans assume to be the boss of all the other stray cats. Yeah, it's a simple story which is all you can really expect from a six episode series. Is it well done?There are certainly issues with the execution in this. For such a short series they waste a lot of time. Each episode has a run-time of just over six minutes and a full minute of that is spent on the opening theme. And that's not the only way they waste time either. There are multiple episodes that barely connect to the main story. Look, I'm not against trying to have some minimal story in a really short series, but if you're going to do it you need to keep it tightly focused and not spend half your time on things that don't really have anything to do with it. On the other hand, having a short series without a story where the focus is on a cat playing pranks on people and causing trouble is also fine, but if you're going to do that don't bother trying to include a story. Just let it be about the shenanigans. Then we've got an episode that doesn't deal with either the plot or with shenanigans, focusing instead on a child learning to deal with death and the Ankoku Cat barely appears in it. Lovely. There's also the story itself. It doesn't really have any impact since the Ankoku Cat just gets through the obstacles it puts in his path really easily. I will say, to the series' credit, that it does have some funny scenes when it isn't trying to shove in plot. There are a few comedic moments that fall short, but most of them work pretty well.Characters:There isn't much to say about the characters. They put in some back story for our “hero”, but it doesn't do much aside from giving him some token motivation for not liking humans. Aside from that the characters we see are just one-dimensional. I can't fault the series for that too much, though, since it is so short and couldn't really develop them well in the time frame it has unless it focused entirely on that.Art:The art is actually pretty bad in this one. The art looks blocky and the animation looks stilted and unnatural. It looks like it uses flash animation and I know that flash animation can look a lot better than this, I've seen things that used it and looked fabulous. But this looks like it was done by a single, relatively inexperienced person putting, maybe a half hour of work into each episode. I will say that I like Ankoku Cat's outfit. It is epically ridiculous. It looks like he's trying to be the front man of a Glam Rock band, or possibly like he's entering a figure skating competition. The only problem with it is that he's a cat and yet he stands like a human and his outfit is clearly designed so that it wouldn't actually fit a cat but since this is a short comedic series I'll let that pass.Sound:Ankoku Cat is one of those series where nothing stands out about the acting. It's neither good nor bad. It's serviceable. The music can be pretty good. At least the music they play when the Ankoku Cat goes into action is good. The rest of it isn't bad but it is bland.Ho-yay:There isn't any in this series.Final Thoughts:Ankoku Cat's biggest weakness is its lack of focus. If this had been a series purely about the comedic shenanigans of a cat in an absurd costume then it probably would have been pretty good, but then they throw in episodes about a child learning to deal with death or dealing with an underlying plot that no one cares about because it's so ill developed. It's still not a bad series but it can certainly be really boring at times. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. If the premise sounds appealing, feel free to give it a try. The plot is going to interrupt things before they get to be much fun but you still might have a bit of fun. Next week I'll look at Explorer Woman Ray.;Not Recommended

The vibe in the theater was so comforting and soothing. The movie was so simple, cute and entertaining it made me feel very relaxed and amazed at the museum. I will definitely visit Japan again and I will definitely visit the Ghibli museum again.Entering a long review is exhausting so here's some copy paste. ne can see the effects of curved space by comparing a tennis court and the Earth. Start at the lower right corner of the tennis court, with a racket held out towards north. Then while walking around the outline of the court, at each step make sure the tennis racket is maintained in the same orientation, parallel to its previous positions. Once the loop is complete the tennis racket will be parallel to its initial starting position. This is because tennis courts are built so the surface is flat. On the other hand, the surface of the Earth is curved: we can complete a loop on the surface of the Earth. Starting at the equator, point a tennis racket north along the surface of the Earth. Once again the tennis racket should always remain parallel to its previous position, using the local plane of the horizon as a reference. For this path, first walk to the north pole, then turn 90 degrees and walk down to the equator, and finally turn 90 degrees and walk back to the start. However now the tennis racket will be pointing backwards (towards the east). This process is akin to parallel transporting a vector along the path and the difference identifies how lines which appear ""straight"" are only ""straight"" locally. Each time a loop is completed the tennis racket will be deflected further from its initial position by an amount depending on the distance and the curvature of the surface. It is possible to identify paths along a curved surface where parallel transport works as it does on flat space. These are the geodesic of the space, for example any segment of a great circle of a sphere.";Recommended

0;Oz no Mahoutsukai (TV);Pitrocks14;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pitrocks14;10;This little anime series/cartoon comes on THIS network and when I saw it was on my Comcast channel in the early morning, I thought it was the filming of the original Black&White Wizard of Oz. But when I saw it was an animated series based on the books, I definitely decided to go watch it. I always be sad every time I miss it from going to sleep or doing something different so I try to keep in time and set the alarm clock to when the Wizard of Oz comes on and then i go to the channel and watch it. This series was really impressive. The voices sound like the original 1939 one, even though they sound a little higher, the characters were from the book except some of them like Princess Lulu or any of the strange guys. And I was addicted! This cartoon is astonishing! Only 52 episodes and from start to finish it was amazing. I had to buy the DVD off of Amazon but don't buy the Complete Set DVD. When I bought it, I was disappointed that most of the episodes were missing scenes. It really had better quality than THIS Network, but the most disappointing fact is that the series is trying to come together by cutting off scenes and make it incomprehensible. So I'd like to watch it on T.V. now. Watch it on television instead. You'll be impressed by this little adaptation.;Recommended
1;Oz no Mahoutsukai (TV);-paradigm-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-paradigm-;8;"I was 6 when I first saw this version of The Wizard of Oz in the 1980s, and at the time I hadn't seen any of the other versions nor even knew it was actually based on a book. Only afterward did I get to find out it was based on a book series0 (which I have never read) and see the Judy Garland version plus the 'Return to Oz' movie released by Disney in the 1980s.Needless to say my memory is a bit sketchy, however I can remember enjoying this one immensely (my local TV station ran it twice - restarting it as soon as its first run finished). One thing 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' has over some of the other versions is its length - it was able to be spread out over many episodes and not have to be crammed into a 2hr movie or something similar.From my own experience I considered the story as being divided into 3 parts (I've since found out that it was officially considered 4 parts). The first part concerned to most memorable part of the Oz saga - Dorothy getting sucked up by the tornado only to land in Oz, where she meets up with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion. They all join together in a variety of adventures as she attempts to get to the Emerald City to meet the famous Wizard who supposedly has the power to return her home. The Wizard instead sends them off to kill the Wicked Witch of the West (which they do) but upon returning it is discovered the Wizard is in fact just a normal man who arrived in Oz via a balloon. When Dorothy misses out on returning home with the Wizard she and her friends end up going to meet Glinda the Good Witch of the South (not the North interestingly) where Dorothy learns that she only needs to click her magic slippers to return home.The second part involved characters such as the witch Mombi, the usurper-of-the-throne Queen Jinjur (the throne had previously been held by Scarecrow after the leaving of the Wizard) as well as the memorable Jack Pumpkinhead and his master/guardian Tip. This part ended with true heir to the throne, Princess Ozma, being revealed and taking her place on the throne of Oz. I have to admit I'm a little hazy on what happened during this part with the exception of Jinjur making herself Queen after Dorothy and co escape on a wooden horse (brought to life by Tip with the same magic powder that created Jack Pumpkinhead) as well as the end where Ozma is revealed and crowned.The third part struck me as the strangest (and somewhat boring) part involving Dorothy visiting the land of Ev and meeting characters such as Tick Tock and the Nome King. This part ended with Dorothy ending up back in Oz and the Nome King launching an invasion of the Emerald City. One of the most memorable parts from this one was the ornament room where the correct ornament had to be chosen lest the person themselves be turned into an ornament ('Return to Oz' used this part too). At the time this part of the story struck me as the weirdest as I never really understood how Ev existed alongside Oz (I've since learnt that it was a neighbouring nation-state). I was also bored by it a bit as most of the storyline took place in Ev (which is more or less a desert). Fortunately the later sequences in Oz were more enjoyable, especially with the constant girl-fighting between Dorothy and Ozma (who had turned into a bit of a spoiled brat between this part and the last part).(as mentioned previously, officially the series is divided into 4 parts - the final 2 sections (Part 3 in the land of Ev, Part 4 back in Oz with the Nome King invading) making up what I considered the third part above. Despite this knowledge I prefer to count it as one single entity as that was how I saw it as a kid)All up it was an enjoyable series for me and I have plenty of fond memories of it. At the time I didn't know how close it resembled the original novels (from what I've heard the first part is fairly close; the second part is close as well but the novel didn't feature Dorothy; the third and fourth parts deviate the most by taking a number of liberties with the storyline from the books) but compared to some of the other attempts at bringing the Oz story to the screen (big and small) this one is good for taking the time to develop a nice, long story with characters who flesh out and grow as the series moves along.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys the Oz universe.";Recommended

I didn't really understand the reason for nudity here, but it's not offensive or gross. There is some Dalinian look in the surrealist transformation of the scenes which I think is the only attractive aspect of the arts here.Sound: No dialogue, monologue, or any form of speach in any ind language. The visuals are accompanied by very awkward (and sometimes erotic) sighs made by a woman.Story: don't ask me. It's as surreal as the art. The only comment I'd like to say is that it's a lill' protracted and the creators could make it shorter by some minutes by not repeating the same picture over and over again.Over all, it's not repulsive to watch, so if you have 10 minutes to spare, go for it =);Mixed Feelings

0;Ijoku;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;5;"Ijoku aka Medical Humiliation is the generic prescription of nursed themed hentais. Nurses abuse or get abused in a mundane attempt at pyschodrama. It involves BDSM, yuri, piss, some femdom, and rape (the type of rape where the victim starts to enjoy later on). If that sort of thing rocks your boat, then you may want to consider giving it a try. Otherwise, don't even bother.Like most hentai series out there, Ijoku has a very weak storyline. It makes as much sense as a 3 year old trying to tell you a story: ""Once upon a time a man appeared in a hospital who he lost his memory. All the nurses liked him and decide to make him the janitor. He became really angry and hurt all the nurses to solve a mystery. Then there was a head nurse who liked hurting other nurses, so the janitor had to regulate. After he became the regulator, everyone lived happily ever after. The end."" Which is to say it didn't make much sense at all. It was more of an attempt to glue together the ample amounts of ecchi scenes that makes up the bulk of the hentai.I would say the only thing good about Ijoku is the character design. It does seem a bit simplistic, but looks good with pretty eyes and well proportioned bodies. The voicing was well done as well. The moaning and whining that goes on was rather erotic and pleasing to the ears. However, all this doesn't make up for the blandness of character. With a big cast of characters (seven nurses and one dude) in the span of a short 2-part series, none of the characters really develop any depth to empathize with. They just sort of appear, get abused, then disappear. Although there were some genuine attempts at some disturbing scenes, with no connection towards any of the characters, it made for an apathetic viewing experience, which defeats the purpose of rape and BDSM themes.The animation was cheaply done. A slow pan of repetitive frames is about all you get in all the ecchi scenes. Seemingly about 90% of the hentai is ecchi scenes, the bulk of Ijoku is just about that: A slow pan of repetitive frames. Okay, I guess that's good for a wrist work out video. Being uncensored is also a bonus.The Verdict:After the famed series ""Night Shift Nurses"" came out, a lot of hentai producers decided to cash in on the nurse theme. In this case, the creator of Ijoku completely missed out on what made ""Night Shift Nurses"" so... well, infamous. It was character development and empathy along with well choreographed sex scenes. Ijoku had none of that, which makes for a very bland hentai.";Mixed Feelings
0;Sei Dorei Gakuen 2;stickyrod;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stickyrod;10;There's only two words that can describe sex scenes that have been directed by the great Teruaki Murakami: Filthy and Violent.There no love or kindness, just pure, primal carnal desire in animated form. If you're a hopeful, starry-eyed vanilla fan, then there's absolutely nothing for you to see here. But for everyone else who are really into women guzzling cum, being forced to orgasm, and getting fucked in every available holes of their bodies all at the same time... then this is a series for you.Story isn't exactly a strong suit for this kind of smut, all you need to know is that it is very well animated and has a lot of energy, which I think is something crucial that most animated hentai always lack. Decently voice acted as well, considering the frantic energy of the material that they have to work with. I personally wish the male characters talked a little less, lol. It also has juuust the right amount of filth -- there's a lot of bodily fluids flying around, including pee, but it doesn't go as far as showing scat or blood.Overall, I highly recommend this.Obviously not going to be a series for a lot of people due to the genre, but... this ain't for them.

Taken in by the cover and synopsis, I decided to give it a go. And oh bØy, what a wild ride.Hareluya is the heir of the almighty God. But he has a hedonistic life style and despise human beings. To teach him humility, He sends His son to Japan as a teenage human deprived of most powers. Now Hareluya tries to live his days as a high school delinquent.If you want to explore deep philosophical themes through the religious symbolism of this series, you’ll end up disappointed. Episodes revolve around the cast facing their daily challenges, and they are usually self-contained stories. While recurring characters all have their personal drama, the main focus is on the comedic interactions of Hareluya and his mates.Like other anime and manga from the 90s and early 00s depicting delinquents, many episodes involve the crew picking fights against hoodlums or saving others from bullies. The comedy of Hareluya II Boy is absurd: they face aliens, a cinema club obssessed with zombie films, ghosts, and other oddities. The recurring characters are charismatic, and their chemistry is enjoyable to watch.Check this anime:- If you liked 90s/00s delinquent anime, such as GTO; Kyou kara Ore wa; Gokusen; Angel Densetsu;- If you liked The Devil is a Part-Timer for the supernatural entities trying their luck in our world;- If you liked Lucifer (TV series or comics);- If you want to see God’s son pacifying the streets of Toyko with a frying pan.“Sorry, it’s time for Mass.

Now imagine if this titan of power and fame gets absolutely demolished.The forces of the General of Darkness destroying the cities that Kouji worked so hard to protect sets up well just how helpless the Mazinger will be in this fight. It's honestly disheartening seeing its wide arsenal be useless against the villains: his rocket punches being deflected, his breast beam barely scratching, his missiles almost ineffective, his breath rendered null. seeing the damaged robot head into battle only to have his wings melted and limbs torn during the fight feels like watching a legacy come to an end. In this moment of total despair comes in the one who will take over the title of the demon that fights to protect the world: Tsurugi and the Great Mazinger.Demonstrating how the new unit is an objectively better version of the old one in all regards is a great way to convince the viewer that the Great Mazinger is fit to replace the current protector of the world, and having him work alongside the beat-up Z is a touching method of show that it has good intentions. Great's upgraded weaponry decimating the foes is an incredibly reassuring scene, considering just how hopeless most of the movie was, not only did it convey how Kouji would be ok leaving Tsurugi with his role, but it works well convincing the viewer that the new protagonist is someone they want to watch.If anything, this movie's a fun watch to see something that anime doesn't do as much anymore: an anime icon passing the baton to a new generation.;Mixed Feelings

It doesn't feel too rushed, thankfully, as it still tells a complete story. The anime is an adaptation of a Visual Novel that came out a year prior, so it's not a surprise that there's inevitably going to be some story cuts to condense it into a 3 episode OVA series.The art is classic late 90s - early 2000s style. If you have a soft spot for that older look, you'll definitely enjoy it. I did not notice any art inconsistencies when I watched it.Sound is easily the biggest highlight of this series. If you've ever watched the Clannad series, you'll know exactly what kind of soundtrack you're in for. It's very calm, emotional, which ramps up a little during dramatic moments. It's almost worth watching it for the soundtrack alone!The characters, while are the main focus of the series, are also a bit on the weaker side. This is mostly attributed to the short length of the series, the characters aren't quite as fleshed out as you'd like, especially when the big focus of the series is their emotional struggles. Side characters don't add much to the main story, outside of one character's actions, but I suppose they play larger roles in the VN (This is designed to get you to pick up the VN, after all).I ended up really enjoying this short series. I was a little worried because of the low score, but it really doesn't deserve that in my opinion. It's an enjoyable hour long emotional healing series that doesn't try to play off the emotional moments with corny jokes. However, keep in mind it does have ecchi scenes.Overall though, it's a very enjoyable series that is worth picking up if you want a bit of an emotional story.

While it wasn't anything fantastic, the music was probably the only thing that helped the series not such as much as it did, since it fit the mood quite well. Voice acting was fine. The two main characters both are depressed and have had people die in the past, period.

Ryo wants to take revenge and searches for the guy, soon after the murder one get to know that the guy who murdered Ryo's father is called Lan Di, in the whole town.In the game there are endless possibilities and the town, Yokosuka, seems like an open world.

I won't go much in detail, but there are many fights and there's also romance because of a school friend of Ryo - Nozomi Harasaki. Ryo's investigation leads him to the Harbor where he has to apply to a job.During his investigation Ryo meets many different kinds of people and follows many different leads.Character design is, thinking of the year it was published, amazing. The characters don't show their emotions as real people normally do, but the publishers tried to balance it with the very impressive music. The Soundtrack of Shenmue: The Movie (and both games) is one of the best soundtracks I've listened to so far and underlines the amazing story and their habitants very well.Shenmue: The Movie will give beginners of the game a good overview and they would manage to start right after watching it with Shenmue 2 (which is a game, not a movie). For people who've already played the first game Shenmue: The Movie is a repetition of happenings out of the game without playing it.

If you like HK flicks like ""Return of the Sentimental Swordsman"" with assassins, intrigue and power rankings, or the smooth animation of Chinese Martial Arts like in the King's Avatar (Quánzhí Gāoshǒu).Watching this donghua reminds me a bit of Founder of diabolism (Mo Dao Zu Shi) with it's charming but clumsy or foolish MC. As well as popular movies like ""Flirting Scholar"" (1993) in terms of verbal tenacity as well as martial skills. Maybe even resembling the hidden powers within him like Stephen Chow's ""Kung Fu Hustle"". With it nonstop ""Nichijou"" or ""Gintama"" like humor.I really enjoy this as it really paints the world of Jianghu as a bunch exaggerations and rumor-mill gossip. Even adding a few episode arc of real life ""social media"" humor in there as well as a few western idioms. This show really exposes the funny and chivalric antics of other wuxia as well as the ""ugly"" side of social psychology and Chinese ethics.

0;Akai Ito;IWannaDeleteThis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IWannaDeleteThis;10;"According to Eastern legend, destined lovers are bound by a red string of fate -- ""Akai Ito"" in Japanese. In this animated short, director Kazuhiko Okushita cleverly uses a single red string to illustrate the life of a man and the woman to whom his string leads him.MAL's rubric, split into categories like ""Story"" and ""Character,"" is useless for an animation like this. It's four minutes long, with no named characters, no voice acting, and exactly one color: red. Two, if you count the white background. This minimalism is the anime's greatest strength, for it allows no distractions from the message: that life is beautiful. Unpredictably, painfully, miraculously beautiful.Flawless in its simplicity and a genuine pleasure to watch, Okushita's ""Akai Ito"" is a work of art I cannot recommend highly enough to anyone with a human soul.";Recommended

This film places a creative spin on that proverb, using a single red thread to animate a love story.In just four minutes Akai Ito manages to work through the romantic ups and downs of a couple. There is a confession, dating, separation and finally a resolution. There are no words or color variety, just an unbreakable string with a life of its own telling the story of the people it connects together.This is minimalism art at its finest telling a full story with few resources, and it deserves to be viewed by more people for it's beautiful simplicity.;Recommended
0;Akai Ito;OnlyFestive;https://myanimelist.net/profile/OnlyFestive;6;"As other people say, this isn't some random string used for the animation. The red string was picked specifically because, based on Eastern culture, a red string is tied around the two people that are destined to meet. It originated from Chinese culture where it is said that Yuè Xià Lǎorén, the lunar god of marriages, ties a string of destiny around two people that are considered soulmates. Akai Ito should be praised for bringing attention to a cultural belief that I think is incredibly fascinating and romantic.Though, however strong Akai Ito is in that respect, this anime was bound to have its inevitable pitfalls. See, this anime paints you a picture with only a white backdrop and a single red string. Which can be quite impressive when you see the sheer detail put into this project, but with this amount of detail, you'll find that some images don't exactly sync in your mind. I had to re-watch a couple of times because my eyes were not telling me what was on screen. This was no fault to Akai Ito, given the inherent design of the project itself, but it was a bit confusing when I first watched.It also shows a story that has no characters, but only silhouettes that give the animation an almost lacking personality. I'll always think back to this as, ""The anime with the red string,"" but I couldn't give much more of a description for it, given that there really isn't anything else to grab onto character-wise. In other words, you'll come for the art and not the story that's given to you through the anime itself.All-in-all, it was fair. Like I said, without any characters or tangible story, Akai Ito can be easily forgotten. However, this is something that comes naturally to the anime given that there's only so much you can do with a single string. In that respect, it's very impressive. In any other department, it's something to be watched once, enjoyed, then left for someone else.";Mixed Feelings
0;Gensou Jotan Ellcia;RobdeFR;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RobdeFR;7;"This one belongs to my VHS anime old days . I don't know if I still have the VHS somewhere, but I certainly know that I don't have my VCR, so, upon seeing the OVA upped in the net, I went ahead and downloaded it for a nice rewatch and of course, for the sake of nostalgia.Ellcia, is a fantasy anime of the beginning of the nineties, so you can more or less know what to expect if you are familiar with sci-fi fantasy anime from that late eghties/early nineties. The tale is set in a very far future where civilization ended how we know it and started again from point 0. Some ""ancient"" technology has been rediscovered but things stayed with that distinct and usually ""Japanese"" balance between technology and medieval culture (in this case since it portrays a more occidental people.).Story;Our hero Eira is the leader of a small boat of unusual pirates on a land conquered with blood by the greatest nation of earth, Megaronia. Somehow Eira and her pirates find themselves involved in trouble with the Megaronia army. Megaronia princess is in search for a mythic great God ship that according to the legend will bring destruction upon Megaronia if it ever falls in the hands of the ""chosen one of royal blood"" of that particular conquered country. It happens that the king and queen were killed while Megaronia was conquering the country and the prince, the supposed sole heir, was imprisoned ever since. What they didn't know was that the queen was pregnant of a child during that rampage and that she gave birth to a princess.You can guess what will happen next, as this fantasy tale, though entertaining, it has no particular clever plot nor does it have great twists. But still is a nice viewing. What impressed me more, was the good animation it had, the character design was kind of different too than the usual and very pleasant, the animation was top notch, I wonder if they used computer and in which scenes. I would like to compare the use of computer in some scenes and todays scenes.All in all a good and entertaining watch. Recommended for a good dose of 90's fantasy.Rate: 7.3/10";Recommended

And honestly i was a bit suprised when i had my first view about it years ago ,i had no idea it was soo funny ( the trailer only showed the bloody action scenes and scary monsters). And as a kid i got WAY more than i bargained for (saw it in 1996) especially with the violence and dark twists in the overall storyline, that around that time fantasy action genre's like this one popped up out of animestudio's like there was no freakin tomorrow! aside that i really had a big laugh seeing the 1st episode, maybe the animationstyle is not the best made, with some bad habits from 1980's animation but u can look past that, Charachters overall have an funny or serious look on them, about the minor and greater heroe's ofc there are a bunch of kids that make u laugh throughout the show the way i sadly miss these days. background, model and shipdesigns i had no problems with cus it was handdrawn that give's a almost oldskool flow to feel i are in the story, but differs for fans that are known with this.

2;Gensou Jotan Ellcia;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;7;"Schizo tech is not a stranger to fantasy anime of the 90s, Windaria conjures iconic imagery of crossbowmen fending off assaults from trapezoid Stug-esque assault cannons; and its enthralling. In contrast, Ellcia's unashamedly gratuitous schizo tech sticks out in the most jarring way. This might have something to with the similarly jarring tone, which alternates like prog rock time signatures between slapstick deformation, bog standard high stakes epic fantasy to defeat a great evil and child friendly adventure tale moments.The problem with this is that immersion immediately goes bust; and the whole thing isn't quite stupid or parodical enough to laugh off like many other forgotten 90s fantasy ovas.Without immersion, Ellcia can't be anything more than utterly mediocre. Only its art direction and some surprisingly well directed and energetic swordfights are its saving graceThough by art direction, I don't mean art in the sense of things such as Angel's egg, Rintaro's substance riddled visual trips or Nausicca's pastoral beauty. By art, I mean that the battleships in this anime look Gurren Lagann esque and have Lego Bionicles for a face. They then go on to absolutely nuke a diesel punk city with glowy orb things. I'm admittedly part of that tiny niche who would watch stuff like this. You can now join this niche too with just a few hours of time and a tolerance for very very forgotten old ovas.";Recommended
0;Gensou Jotan Ellcia;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;6;"As far as early 1990 anime OVAs go, Ellcia is exceptionally well-rounded and entertaining. This is a simple fantasy story, and there's never anything unexpected thrown your way: you know, plenty of rambles about a chosen one with a hidden past, ties to royalty, a creation myth, four gods the heroes have to seek out to unlock powers, good versus evil, and the fate of the planet hanging in the balance. The big bad evil poopy-head empire unearthed ancient sci-fi gadgets, granting them supremacy over the rest of the country bumpkins—all of that, of course, suggesting a civilizational cycle and collapse, and it provides a cool archeo-futuristic atmosphere, mixing high and low tech weapons and settings, along with magic and a non-human race, the Selkies (surprisingly, there's little fetish content to be found, considering Yasuomi ""Panty-Chaser"" Uemetsu is involved as the character designer).Even with 40-minute episodes, this is paced pretty quickly. Eira and Elluri barely spend any time together, the characters don't have enough time to be fleshed out and there are so many of them, and the ending's attempt at an emotional climax falls flat. This is one of those shows where the main character is not really Eira, but it's the whole pirate gang, as they engage in a kind of homogenized blob of slapstick and banter, carried along by nice character design and pretty consistent character animation. For what it's worth, I never felt they needed much more depth than was presented as far as a solid action fantasy OVA goes, but it would help to polish the series.Character writing is fine as far as a cliche adventure work goes, and I've seen much worse. The dialogue never weighs down the pacing, and many of the characters have fairly clear motivations and small snippets of backstory, along with some very basic themes. This is not going to be the main reason anyone would ever want to watch this, but it's not a huge detractor, either.The character design, backgrounds, and animation are the main attraction. Uemetsu's art tends to stand out amongst anime, and... yeah, the characters look a bit like a gaudy theater troupe or clowns before they put on the makeup and rubber noses, but they have a lot of personality. The character designs look a bit dissimilar from other works Uemetsu is more well-known for, though Sara of course looks very much like the girl from Kite, and Eira and some of the other characters are familiar looking as well. The show has a very distinct look, and I can easily recognize it amongst a sea of generic OVAs. Of note are the designs of Phelkis' ship, and the ancient ship Ellcia. Bizarre designs, and they make for nice set pieces. The city of Megaronia also has many striking design choices.Admittedly, I sought this out for the animation, and it delivers quite solidly. According to MAL, Shinji Hashimoto, Hideki Hamasu, and Satoru Utsunomiya provided key animation, among many others—including Koichi Arai and Yasuomi Uemetsu. Like most OVAs, this series will minimize the amount of animation required by careful direction and editing, and time-saving techniques, but these are kept to a minimum. The animation is typically consistent, but you'll see it spike during sword fights or other action sequences involving explosion effects, gliders, etc. Anytime the animation isn't doing the heavy punching, the art more than makes up for it.A few of the sword fights have incredible choreography and fluid animation, and I'd love to know who was responsible. The most obvious animation comes from Utsunomiya's segments with free-flowing spirits, which look like swirling fire. There are a few moments like this throughout, involving the Selkies, Maeyard, and... the bad guy that looks like a giant seal demon...Once we get to the ending, I definitely know of one scene Uemetsu animated. There's an unnecessary panty shot. Uemetsu would go on to direct hentai scenes to fund Kite and Mezzo Forte, and he acts like he didn't really want to do this, but he obviously loves showing panties and breasts, which are in everything he directs. I can imagine the director being busy one day, and Uemetsu is hovering over him, and he can hear the heavy panting, feel the hot, sticky breath against his neck.Uemetsu: P-p-please, just o-one p-p-p-panty shot. Just one!Director: Uemetsu... didn't we already agree to only use the slutty top on the one female character? Isn't that enough?Uemetsu: *His eyes bug out.* MY PRECIOUS! PRECIOUS! YES, MY PRECIOUS!Director: Okay, okay, just a quick panty shot at the end. Keep it brief. But you'd better not add the pointless rape scene of the main character (that wasn't anywhere in the script in the first place) that you pitched to me, only to reveal it was a dream all along, so none of it ever mattered!Anyway, despite the cliche story, it's a lot of fun, well-paced, has solid art, animation, and action, and the fantasy world is relatively interesting, with what little of it we get to see. It's of special interest for fans of the key animators on the staff, as well as early 1990s high fantasy OVAs, of which not very many are good. Utsunomiya went on to do similar work on the Crystania movie and OVA, and the Hakkenden OVA, but from what I've seen he hasn't had many outlets for this specific kind of animation.";Mixed Feelings
0;Jigoku Sensei Nube: Kyoufu no Natsuyasumi!! Ayashi no Umi no Densetsu!;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;6;"Being the third & final Hell Teacher Nube film, it's an okay feature but manages to conclude on a good note.The plot for this film resembles more that of a typical ongoing shonen where our characters are on vacation & danger occurs. In this case, Nube take his student to an island for summer vacation where they encounter a girl named Nagisa who invites them to the sea. Soon afterwards Nube hears of a legend about an aquatic spider residing on the island who feasts on human sacrifices.Comparing the movies, Legend of the Sea seems a bit odd as it takes place in a more rural location & the battle against sea creatures instead of the typical yokai or ghosts. Furthermore, it doesn't really take advantage of its sea setting as not many underwater creatures are featured. It's not a bad film, but doesn't offer much other than the typical comedy found in the series yet doesn't really have that ""horror vibe"" displayed in the two previous movies. The highlight of this feature is the ending as it portrays Nube once again resorting to a tough life changing decision which adds to his responsibility as an adult & mentor.Not much action, not much horror, nor that much comedy making this film very optional to watch with its only solace being a few pieces of visuals such as the higher quality opening & the conclusion of the film which delivers those ""heart warming moments"" found in the anime series.";Mixed Feelings

Have no fear, because I am here!!!2019 is almost over and yet another anime studio is apparently closing its doors forever. After a 5 year hiatus, Studio ARMS returned this year to deliver one last load of burning garbage. However, that title was another Ikki Tousen series and I already reviewed that shitty franchise. Instead, I'm bidding farewell to the Troma of anime studios by looking at their final hentai from 2005. This is Gauss!Plot:Firstly, this anime has absolutely nothing to do with the German mathematician/physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss. Instead, this is basically a hentai version of Garzey's Wing. Oh HELL YES!Some stupid asshole is making out with his girlfriend and is suddenly dragged into the sky by his dick! This mysterious force drags him back in time and forces him to save a feudal princess against dark forces. DAMN YOU YAMATO TAKERU NO MIKOTO!!!We are also treated to an absolutely stellar fight scene between 2 female ninjas and some random goons. One of the gals has an attack where she squirts milk out of her breasts with such high PSI that it forms a jet cutter stream and cuts a man's head off! You read that last sentence correctly. That actually happens. The ninja girls are defeated, but when one dude tries to anally rape Jet Cutter, she clenches her asshole so tight it bites his dick off! This hentai is a masterpiece! After the ninja fight, our modern day hero is brought to a whore house and the hentai just suddenly ends in mid-coitus. It pulls a ""Monster a Go-Go"" and just fucking stops abruptly. Apparently it was going to continue the action directly with another episode, but this hentai bombed and the sequel episodes were scrapped. Bravo Studio Arms! You magnificent bastards!Music:I can't possibly skip this part! With any Jidaigeki anime you expect basically the same soundtrack Kaoru Wada composed for Inuyasha or Ninja Scroll. You need a shamisen. You need a shakuhachi. A koto is of course mandatory. This hentai has none of that shit! You wanna know what instrument Gauss has? Banjos. FUCKING. Banjos.Art:This actually looks really good by hentai standards. It's produced at the same quality level of Arms' regular anime, which certainly isn't Ghibli tier but I've seen hentai with zero animation. As in they didn't use in-between frames.So who made this MASTERPIECE! It turns out that this was the first and last anime to be written and directed by Rin Shin. Who is Rin Shin you might ask? Rin is the mysterious, shadowy leader of Studio ARMS and was key animator on all of their projects after Yasuomi Umetsu's reign. There is no existing picture of Rin. There is no interview. It is unknown if Rin is male, female, or identifies as a 3rd gender. Rin Shin is a fucking ghost. I hope now that ARMS is shuttered, Rin Shin will finally reveal themselves. Sadly, that is unlikely to be the case. Even if he/she never works again, we will always have this crown jewel of terrible hentai!";Not Recommended

Someone get me out of that room). Other than that, it is a very concise summary of Season one. Do note that this by itself won't serve a full introduction to the series, so you probably will have to endure the original season one regardless or look up a few facts if you get confused in future season.There is an ending sequence in the last episode that you probably shouldn't skip if you are one of those people who likes to skip all OP/ED. I usually skip every one of these OP/ED, but the ED of episode 3 is somewhat important if you are transitioning straight into season 2.Overall, very enjoyable.PS: I am upset that my 雅妃姐姐 didn't get an introduction like she did in the original.

0;Shusaku Replay;cthulhuplush;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cthulhuplush;1;Shuusaku may be bad, but it's nothing compared to the absolute atrocity that is it's sequel Shuusaku replay. This is one of the most poorly made and stupid things I have ever seen. It's story is one of the most mind bogglingly retarded things I have ever encountered and it still enrages me whenever I think about it. Its put together so poorly that I'm certain half the staff just didn't bother showing up. And with all that even though it came out in 2000, after hentai started to actually look decent, it still isn't good as porn.So my biggest complain is how it was put together. I swear to god, this series didn't have a writer or editor. The director probably just shat out enough story boards to make about half of an anime, and then just decided to go with it. And considering that Shuusaku doesn't start talking until halfway though the third episode for no discernible reason, I find the staff no showing up to be a perfectly valid explanation. Nothing in this series makes sense, and it's mostly because of the editing. Every transition between scenes is jarring. There isn't any sense of flow, things just occur without explanation or context. Plot points are introduced, forgotten about, remembered again and then never brought up again. Every problem is epitomized in a series of scenes in the beginning. After they retcon the first OVA as having maybe not happened or something, the tan character and the rich girl sneak into the kind of main character's room, breaking curfew. The teacher then comes in. The tan girl then is no longer wearing a skirt and instead has a towel around her waist, no explanation. She then asks main character girl to borrow a pair of her bloomers so she can go back to her room wearing something. Why doesn't she just wear her skirt? What happened to it? Tan girl is then in a shed with Shuusaku, and the teacher who is naked and has rope marks from bondage, giving Shuusaku the main character girl's bloomers that she was able to borrow. Wait how did she get there? When did she get there? Wasn't she in the other room... with the teacher? What's going on? Back to the room the teacher is there, fully clothed, tan girl is wearing the bloomers... and I'm left confused. A hentai who's plot is literally a gray guy rapes random girls shouldn't be this hard to follow.As with the last one with porn in uninteresting. It's a bit more graphic, but truthfully the first one had better porn. This does make the effort to make it hardcore, but it still ends up being boring. The first one at least had some dialogue during sex, this had nothing, making the sex scenes boring and repetitive, with the actual sex not being enough to carry them.And then there is the ending... oh the ending. This is truly the stupidest thing I have ever seen. So after continued stupidity we finally get to the end where we get to the final reveal. The characters in the anime are actually characters in an h-game being played by someone outside the forth wall, and by giving him love they can make things right. God I hate this piece of crap.Oddly enough despite this being in my top 25 worst things I have ever seen and having a definite rating of a 1, I still suggest this anime. For masochists who like seeing bad things it's worth watching. Almost every moment has something done so wrong you can't help but laugh. It's completely stupid, and one of the most ineptly made things out there. If you want to see what something made by people who are completely incompetent is like, watch this.

0;Shounen Kenya;BlokeTokes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlokeTokes;5;"Shounen Kenya, or ""Kenya Boy"", is certainly different when placed alongside other things anime. However, one thing should be made clear before going in to view this. Kenya Boy is not a culturally-accurate representation of the country Kenya, and the story doesn't really revolve around surviving in the country. What the story really is, is actually a bit similar to anime with a unique coat of paint. It's a fantasy, action adventure while also not only a shounen by its title, but also by the story. It was a bit of a shame that the story elements made the experience feel less genuine and more like a mess, but the experience Kenya Boy gave was still interesting and worth the watch.When it starts, Kenya Boy seems like it's a movie that would've been more effective if it was live-action. However, the art is what's getting Kenya Boy attention for a reason. The art direction is quite impressive in that it will take on unpredictable styles at will. One thing it will commonly do is merge colored animation into line-art sketch-work. It would also, at times, build up scenery or randomly play around with the scenery. This kind of creativity makes the fact Kenya Boy is an anime, at the start, feel more justified. The design-work is also fairly good in making the elements that could potentially be in Kenya a bit believable. The art isn't perfect though. As it starts with this sensation that the scenery could fluctuate at any time, there are some instances that feel a bit unjustified in the lacking details present and more that they're in place to save on the budget. There is also a good deal of animation present here, but a good deal of it feels a bit unstable, and there is also a fair amount of reused frames. The art style will also likely be loved and hated by many. I found the art style for the characters to be alright, but there were many times where the movement or stances they made felt robotic or a tad lifeless. This does seem to be a televised movie, however, from the random gaps that exist throughout. There's some pretty good animation in here, but the majority is moderately less than those smaller parts.The sound has some orchestrations that do a fair job and sound like something one might hear in a family, adventure film from older Hollywood. As the movie is two hours long, however, repetition deters the soundtracks charm, and makes it not too enjoyable when mixed with the lacking audio quality. The voices are fine, and this would be the first Japanese dub I've listened to that had some British (sounding at least) voice-actors that spoke english. The sound design isn't too impressive as it treats the movie too much like a typical anime at the time with somewhat generic sound-effects. The atmosphere never really felt properly treated, but the sound worked good enough with the music to not bother me too much.The story is the disappointing part as it could've been something far more impressive than it is. The movie starts in a relatively similar way that live-action, family, adventure movies would start, and the characters feel as though they have some potential to have good interaction later on. After going to Kenya, survival comes into play after a while. The creative visuals in this part work greatly to make the landscape feel deadly and other-worldly. However, soon after the tone spins around rapidly, and it becomes a light-comedic shounen. There isn't really any comedy and I never laughed, but sometimes characters would act a bit too cartooney for the setting. That isn't too much of an issue though, in this case, as the setting is demolished by the first third's completion. This isn't about culture, understanding, or survival, but action and adventure with a manly child leading the way. There is also some interesting treatment to the Japanese in this vision of Kenya that acts as if all of Kenya treats their race with the highest respect. It didn't bother me, but I found that interesting considering how unlikely it would be for that to ever occur. That was another issue I had for a while in that there was so many unrealistic situations and ways in which the characters would get through them. That became less of an issue when it became clear what direction this film wished to go in though.It was hard to enjoy the generic twist this movie decided to take, and the characters also became less interesting in the process. The characters all had virtually no personality, their actions being driven by not wanting to be alone or by what's required to reach their goal. The dialogue wasn't particularly interesting, and much of the side characters were either clones in a mob or generic and childish villains. Things improved at the last fifth of the movie, however, as more mature characters came to light with villains that felt more justified and reasonable. It still wasn't too enthralling of a story, but it was a relief to have something sensible for a short while.Kenya Boy is a bit of a mess when considering all of it's elements. It's art direction had potential and works very well at the start, but it becomes less relevant shortly after when the setting and story loses all forms of consistency and rationality. In a way, Kenya Boy reminded me of those old, green-screen, television series. Everything about Kenya Boy felt like an extended version of those types of live-action programs. Kenya Boy isn't smart, and it isn't too creative or original beyond its setting, but there is some worth in its art direction. The ending really knocked things around and it even reminded me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in one scene. Overall, though, Kenya Boy is lost potential, but serves as a nice peculiar experience that's siting in wait for anyone with a bit of tolerance for what's to come. I should also mention that the Bluefixer subs for this are spectacular in replicating the Japanese font hard-coded in the video. The best subbing job I've seen visually in terms of honoring the source material.";Mixed Feelings
0;Shounen Kenya;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;3;"Overview:Kenya Boy, along with being one of the more polite things Trump calls Obama, is also the name of a 1984 kids movie considered ""one of the worst ever"" by older otaku. The founder of animenewsnetwork listed it among his anime Hall of Shame and that guy has seen about 5,000 anime!Background:Kenya Boy was based on a 1950s manga that never really gained fame or popularity outside Japan. The manga is basically a Japanese Tarzan ripoff that hasn't aged particularly well. The movie tries to adapt the entire manga and crams WAY too much plot into a 100 minute run time, making the last 30 minutes an absolute blitz of insanity.Plot:The plot is basically what you get when you mix Tarzan with a cocaine induced fever dream. Our hero Wataru is a young Japanese boy whose father is a merchant in 1941 Kenya. Since Kenya was a British colony and Japan declared war on Great Britain, Wataru's father decides to give his son a last tour of the country before fleeing back to Japan. Unfortunately, a rhino attacks and Wataru becomes separated from his father. The next day, Wataru finds a sick man named Zega who is actually the chief of the Masai tribe. Wataru offers to retrieve a rare healing herb to cure Zega, because he is Japanese and the Japanese are a brave and noble people. Seriously, this manga's patriotism is off the charts. Every other line is ""I am not afraid for I am Japanese!"" ""Wow! You're Japanese! You must be very strong!"".Wataru manages to escape a monster frog the size of an elephant and retrieve the herb. In exchange, Zega leaves his son in charge of the tribe and travels with Wataru to help him find his father. 3 years later, Wataru has become a spear wielding, elephant riding badass that can summon a Godzilla sized purple snake...because Zega is appararently the African Orochimaru. Wataru and Zega soon come across a young blonde girl who is being manipulated by an evil shaman. The shaman claims the blonde girl is a goddess and the entire village believes him, for some reason. Wataru and Zega manage to defeat the evil shaman and free the girl, whose name is Kate. We get a quick scene of Wataru and Kate bonding and becoming friends, but then she is immediately kidnapped by the lizard people! They are a subterranean tribe with idiotic Barney the Dinosaur costumes who worship a giant lizard. Fortunately, they flee in terror if you damage their costumes. Why? Who knows! With Kate rescued, we enter the final act and HOLY SHIT is it ridiculous!A full 3/4 through the movie we are introduced to the villain...some Nazi with a monocle! This guy named ""Von Goering"" has found Wataru's father and convinced him that he is a nice guy. In reality, Goering wants Wataru's father to convince a German scientist to complete Nazi Germany's secret atom bomb. The scientist, who I guess is supposed to be Heisenberg, refuses on moral grounds to allow the Nazis to have the bomb. However, Goering captures Wataru, Kate, and Zega. He then threatens to kill them if Heisenberg doesn't create the bomb. Heisenberg demands the hostages are released first, then detonates the bomb inside the testing faciliy sacrificing himself to destroy the Nazis and the research notes. Fortunately for our heroes, the bomb tears open a portal to Mesozoic Era. Yes...this fucking happens. Our heroes are attacked by a T-Rex, but the giant purple snake also traveled back in time! The snake kills the T-Rex which causes it and all other dinosaurs to immediately turn into skeletons. Why? Who the fuck knows! Our heroes then ride the snake back to the present and into safety. Wataru bids farewell to Zega and rides a train with his father and Kate because the war has apparently just ended.Art:The art during the beginning is actually quite good. This film actually had a decent budget for a 1984 anime. Then the art gets...weird. If this weren't such a crappy movie it could get away with claiming ""Avant Garde"" but instead it just feels like it wasn't finished. Sometimes it randomly cuts to black and white. Sometimes the lines aren't drawn in. Sometimes the bottom half of the screen becomes pixelated or looks like 8-bit graphics. Sometimes characters change skin color for absolutely no reason and then turn back again in the same scene. I have no idea why any of this is happening!Music:The music is a full orchestral soundtrack that is FAR better than this clusterfuck of a movie deserves.Audio:Many veterans of old school anime are in this, but Wataru is played by a child actor who never voiced anything again. Even non-Japanese speakers can pick up on how flat and emotionless his performance is. This kid is the Japanese Jake Lloyd!Overall:Kenya Boy is a VERY flawed film with a plot that's total nonsense and art that is inconsistent at best. However, it is quite entertaining and definitely worth a watch! You will never see another anime quite like this one!";Not Recommended
1;Shounen Kenya;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;4;"An odd film based on a manga by Yamakawa Souji, Shonen Kenya (or, ""Kenya Boy""), tells the story of 11-year old Wataru Murakami, who gets separated from his father as they are travelling through Kenya. He must then survive the perils that he encounters, with the help of a few allies he meets along the way.The story is pretty standard when it comes to adventure films, and it seems to have taken much inspiration from classic black & white jungle adventure films of the 30s and 40s such as King Kong, Gunga Din, or the many others that were released during that era. However, the plot here doesn't have much of a structure to it, jumping from one scene to the next without much of any reason or purpose other than to showcase some action or animation. Much of the middle of the film is spent in action scenes that exist for little to no reason, where many of the characters' goals and motivations aren't resolved or moved forward in any way. This tends to make things drag quite a bit. There's also a plothole here and there that will introduce questions that never get resolved, and were seemingly overlooked by the directors. I will say, however, that that main story at both the beginning and the end of the film are well executed, but still aren't anything other than average in terms of content.The characters tend to be somewhat enjoyable, but also aren't anything special, and the biggest problem I have is with the lead character, Wataru, who tends to change his tone and behavior from scene to scene. In the beginning he starts off as timid and shy, then once he's separated from his father he runs for his life. After a day or two has passed, he suddenly becomes able to do acrobatics and fight off animals as though he's lived in the wilderness all his life. He also occasionally has outbursts of cockiness that seem entirely out of character for him, then he goes back to being kind-hearted. It seems like the writers just didn't really know what to do with him and so they just wrote his character as what it needed to be for the scene without giving things much thought. The odd part is that many of the supporting cast don't suffer from this kind of multiple-personality writing, only the lead.The animation is a mixed bag. The film opens with some experimental animation using flat colors without any lines, and then switches to a two-tone black & white animation style for the opening credits. After the credits are over, we then switch to the main look of the film, which is fairly standard looking 1980s CEL animation that tends to look only marginally better than TV animation of the era, not being able to stand up to other animated films from that time period in terms of quality.However, the experimental animation doesn't take a backseat for long, and aside from the other two styles I mentioned, we get a bunch more. For instance, there was a scene where the animation consisted entirely of blue linework on a black background, and you could see the film reel around the edges of the screen. There was another scene where one native tribesman was completely uncolored so you could see the background through him. You might assume this was simply in error, but all of the other tribesmen around him were colored in, and he was uncolored for TWO consecutive shots, which made it seem bizarrely intentional. These different animation styles tend to range from ""unique"" and ""interesting"" to ""baffling"" and ""bizarre"", but no matter how they come across they really don't tend to add much of anything to the film's overall style, leaving it feeling like the art director just slapped these elements together for no reason at all.The soundtrack is executed well enough, and sets the tone well. The main theme also sets a nice tone, and was pretty catchy, but nothing that's going to get stuck in my head for hours. The voice actors all played their roles well, and had good delivery on their lines, but there wasn't any breakout performances that would be super memorable. Overall, the audio side of things is well executed, above average, but nothing remarkable.Overall, Shonen Kenya is an odd film, which seems to try to do too much and, as a result, this ends up being it's downside. There's a decent story buried in here, but all of the stuff around it feels like it was just jumbled together without much thought or care going into any of it, leaving us with a slapdash film that feels bizarre in it's execution and confusing in it's presentation. The main story isn't interesting enough on it's own to warrant such a complicated production, and these bizarre elements only bring it down further and make the bland story more difficult to enjoy... so I'd really only recommend it to people who are simply curious about seeing the bizarre side of the film, anybody else could easily just skip this one.";Not Recommended
2;Shounen Kenya;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;"There's this concept of a show that is ""So Bad It's Good"" - as in, it is recognized to be a terrible movie/show, but its terrible-ness is so over the top that it is actually entertaining to watch. In fact, MST3K was founded on this principle.Kenya Boy is definitely one of those ""So Bad It's Good"" movies.As it started, I thought I was in for a standard Coming Of Age story, as a young boy is separated from his father in the heart of Africa at the start of war, and has to fend for himself. Well, okay, I can go along with that.And then, it starts to go off the rails. Just a little bit at first, with things like giant animals and such. But then it just goes absolutely nuts.I won't go into all details because spoilers, but soon he (along with his father-mentor-figure) are fighting off literally hundreds of swarming tribesmen with nothing but a single spear. Giant frog! Giant snake! Which they ride! Giant lizard! The Lizard King! Blond jungle woman!By the end of the movie it gets so crazy they add in actual Nazis,fighting dinosaurs and an atomic explosion.Don't you dare go into this, expecting to take any of this seriously.

0;The Samurai;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;5;As I was watching this, I could have sworn on a stack of pancakes that this was a story by Rumiko Takahashi. The character designs, the slapstick action and improbable set-up, the thematic elements and pacing all scream Takahashi.But after finishing and digging around online, I was gobsmacked - I can't find her name anywhere on this OVA. It was so obvious to me, I couldn't believe it.And yet, here we are. Everything about this is basically recycled Ranma 1/2. Swap out the characters from one to the other, change the setting just slightly, and you could run this thing almost entirely as nothing more than one better-than-average Ranma 1/2 two-parter. It's downright uncanny.The artwork is decent, as is the animation. The story is over-the-top ridiculous, but that's part of the whole premise in the first place. But really if you want to short-hand this, all I can say is that if you like Takahashi's stuff, this will also be right up your alley.;Mixed Feelings
1;The Samurai;jyagan0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jyagan0;6;Very good little, short anime. It is a must see just for the comedy and story line. Despite the title.. the picture and the description don't let it fool you. It's set in the modern era.. for some reason the kid carries around a real sword to school and no one cares. Lots of nudity and a Swiss cheese plot what make up this movie. Add in a horrible translation and dub, i highly suggest least doing subtitles. Despite all this though it turns out amazingly funny. So stupid at parts you have to laugh, reminds me a lot of Ranma 1/2 or DNA^2 type jokes. Seems more like a series.. and leaves you with a crummy ending but still funny.;Mixed Feelings
2;The Samurai;Basicpleb420;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Basicpleb420;6;Before I start this review, I must say the title to this anime is a bit misleading. I wouldn't say it's about THE Samurai, but it's definitely about A Samurai. It's not the samurai story to end all samurai stories.In spite of that, this is still quite the fun little OVA. It's stupid, but it has that goofy charm that's hard to say no to.Story: 3/10The story is first and foremost the weakest part of this OVA, so let's get that out of the way. Yes, the story is stupid, but obviously this wasn't intended to be treated as high art or thought-provoking stuff. That said, are we all going to overlook the fact that Takeshi stabs somebody in the beginning?Characters: 7/10Luckily, the quirky characters make up for the lackluster story. Whether it's the modern day samurai lead, the polar opposite twins, the sexually repressed teacher or the pretty boy frenemy who's just as lustful and insane as our lead, there's someone in this cliché stew you're bound to like.Art: 6/10As for the art, it's pretty decent for an older anime. Obviously, if you expect the animation to be Ghibli-level good, you'll be disappointed, but there's nothing downright hideous in this anime's world.As a plus, I will say that I love all the blink-and-you'll-miss-it sight gags the animators put in.And since this an 80s OVA, of course there's bare breasts. I'll let you rate the design of the boobs on your own.Music: 6/10I don't have much to say for the music, since most of it isn't that memorable. However, the opening theme is quite the toe-tapper. Don't be surprised if you find yourself humming it afterwards.Enjoyment: 8/10Far and away, the enjoyment factor was what gave this anime a surprisingly high score.This little one punches above its weight. There wasn't a single moment I can really criticize too much. It's consistently entertaining and there are many moments that are funny as hell (Takeshi's training sequence, the field trip, the brief interaction Takeshi has with Kagiri and Akari's parents). It's farcical and it's stupid enough that it works.All in all, I give this anime 6 heirloom swords out of 10.;Mixed Feelings

0;Glass no Kamen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Shoujo;StarMasayume;https://myanimelist.net/profile/StarMasayume;10;This is not so much a sequel as an OVA covering the very beginning of the story of Glass Mask. It begins with Maya, the girl who is not good at anything... aside from her fascination with all that is movies and dramas. Even her own mother believes her a useless girl. If a tv is on, she won't hear a word you say, if you send her out to deliver Ramen she may come back hours later, she can't remember a single formula for school... but she can recite any play she's watched once by heart. As a habit, she acts out her favorite dramas in the park to some kids where she is spotted by an mysterious old woman. You will see Maya's growing devotion as she finds the one thing she may be good at and the trials as she first establishes this dream.This series of Glass Mask is good for two instances. One: A taste to see if this is a series you would like to watch in full or to have someone else watch to get them hooked. Or if you're already hooked on Glass Mask and simply want more and a different perspective on the beginning.The Girl of a Thousand Masks follows closer to the original manga in story as well as character design. I find it a treat to watch merely because it captures the original character designs with quality animation (unlike the old and flat looking first anime series). As much as I enjoy the 2005 anime, it's nice to see this.You can read a more thorough review on Glass Mask, 2005 version.;Recommended
1;Glass no Kamen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Shoujo;rrrrr-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rrrrr-;9;"Anyone who is remotely familiar with this series is most likely aware of its two adapatations which are both TV shows that aired in 1984 and 2005 respectively. However, this little OVA here is easily missable despite it actually being TMS' first adaptation of the series before they made the aforementioned one in 2005. Personally, it genuinely surprised me because I was expecting a very forgettable experience initially but was proved wrong just a few minutes in the first episode. So, let me make this clear right in the beginning; Whether you watched any of the TV shows or are looking for a way to try out this series - This will make a perfect watch in any case.As the synopsis already states the OVA covers the earlier events of the series but I'll assure you it completely excels at it in most aspects. The very first minutes of the first episode greet you with the heartbreaking past of Tsukikage-sensei only to cheer you up again and pull you right into the story with one of the loveliest openings in any anime I've seen. The song itself starts with a shoegaze-esque intro and complements the gorgeous sceneries and shots of Maya Kitajima as she rides her bike or shots of individual objects like some pair of Chucks lying in an empty practice hall. Each shot is beautifully composed that I couldn't help but take screencaps at every opportunity. Storywise there isn't anything to write home about as it only covers the very start of the manga but visually it's very clear Tsuneo Kobayashi, a name which I also only discovered after watching this, went overboard with his creativity.Now, Glass Mask is a Shoujo series that is relatively rich in drama, which as a sidenote happens to be a common thing among Shoujo series in the 70s. Evoking and creating tension as well as maintaining it throughout in certain scenes is not only crucial but not the easiest thing to do either. Tsuneo Kobayashi however, makes full use of his Cinematography knowledge and achieves crafting said scenes exceptionally well. For instance, when Maya first encounters Tsukikage she first reacts sceptically and finally runs away crying after seeing her scarred face. As suggested before Kobayashi makes heavy use of efficient Cinematography so you'll see particularly well-utilized dutch angles and close-up shots very very often, which are of course present in this scene and thankfully in other scenes like this one. The animation quality typical for an OVA only adds to the visual eye candy. This way the tension never fades away and keeps you engaged with the anime throughout its entire runtime. It also results in this adaptation being perhaps the most dramatic one among the series. And it's rather unfortunate to see this not even going beyond the first few stage plays of Maya. However, the amount of adapted material or the character development ""lacking"" compared to the TV shows shouldn't be a dealbreaker since all of the characters are unique and fleshed out from the get-go. Ayumi is the polar opposite of Maya yet complements her in a way - both ambitioussly strive to become the flawless actress, Masumi takes a liking to Maya quite early on but has to restrict himself to not act stupidly or out of character, Sakurakouji sides with Maya whenever she is being treated unfairly, etc etc and all of that is very well conveyed in this OVA despite its short length.The VAs also quite deliver and voice their characters pretty well. However, the most exciting part is probably hearing Megumi Ogata as the little and fragile but fierce Chibi-chan I mean Maya Kitajima. Her woMANLY voice doesn't shine through one bit. On the contrary, it fits Maya surprisingly well - be it scenes of Maya raising her voice out of anger, sobbing like a child or simply leisurely conversing with her classmate.TL;DR unexpectedly well storyboarding and directing nails almost every scene and reinforces the characters' unique traits and personalities which makes this OVA the most worthwile experience for (the beginning of) the series. VAs fit their roles and don't disappoint either.";Recommended

0;Glass no Kamen: Sen no Kamen wo Motsu Shoujo;CataOrShane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CataOrShane;4;I'll be comparing this to the OG Glass no Kamen from 1984.Visuals:1) A lot darker, creepier and sometimes outright scary!2) the animation is noticeably recycled and thus breaks immersion easily3) Bad syncing of voice acting and animation4) The characters have gone through a massive redesign. The original version from 1984 is visually very faithful to the manga but these OVA characters look nothing like what they should look likeSound:1) I didn't find the soundtrack memorable2) perfect english on 3rd episode3) I'm not a fan of recasting unless in scenarios of death, illness or retirement. Having said that, Maya's seiyuu sounds more childish than the OG but it also gave the character a lot more vocal range, which I thought would be a smart choice considering that Maya could use that for the roles she lands throughout the story. Unfortunately these OVAs cover so little of the story that this vocal range never came into play. Ayumi's voice actress also changed but the tone of voice and vibe have remained the same, despite being a noticeable change. Rei's OG voice actress has returned but she voices Tsukikage, which makes her sound so much more warm and lovable than the OG character. Hayami's voice doesn't fit him at all in my opinion, which was a waste of a legendary seiyuu.4) The majority of seiyuus would become actual legends in the voice acting industry and by the time this project cast them, the majority of them had already worked together in previous projects and that chemistry was noticeable.Story and characters:1) As someone who watched the OG series immediately before this, my memory was very fresh on the plot and characters. I think I would enjoy this a lot more if I had given time to myself to sort of forget the OG series. This is the main reason why I can't just recommend this to every single person. If you enjoyed the OG, then give this a watch but after some time.2) I prefer this Tsukikage to the OG Tsukikage, as she's not as ruthless and abusive3) The pedo/grooming vibe from Hayami has also been tone down4) expect to see more of Maya and her mother's relationship and a bit more of Maya's background before meeting Tsukikage.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ai no Gakkou Cuore Monogatari;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;8;"Has anyone ever heard of Ai no Gakkou Cuore Monogatari before this? Yeah, me either. I didn't learn about this anime until earlier this year, when a fansub group I follow decided to sub it, as it had never gotten translated in any format before this. But I immediately decided to watch it as soon as I read the news because it's an anime based on a Western novel and reminiscent of the World Masterpiece Theater despite not being part of that staple. How could I not want to watch it? And as you can tell by the rating, I'm glad I did, because Ai no Gakkou Cuore Monogatari is actually a pretty sweet anime that's also criminally underrated. Based on the 1886 novel by Edmondo de Amicis, Cuore, Libro per i Ragazzi (translation being Heart: an Italian Schoolboy's Journal), the story centers on Enrico Bottini, a schoolboy living in Turin, Italy late in the 19th century and his experiences going to school, enduring hardships alongside his friends, and learning life lessons from his new teacher, Mr. Perboni. That's really it as far as the story goes. There isn't much in terms of an overarching plot, and the series is pretty episodic.But before I talk more about Cuore, I want to talk about something that actually spawned from it. For all you WMT fans out there, you may be familiar with an anime called 3000 Leagues In Search of Mother, which aired in Japan in 1976. The interesting thing about 3000 Leagues is that it's not based on a whole novel, but rather, a tiny excerpt from a single chapter of Cuore itself. In Cuore, there are segments where Mr. Perboni tells moral tales to his students in order to teach them life lessons. One of those stories happened to be a story of a boy named Marco going from Genoa, Italy all the way to Argentina to find his mother. I don't know who did this, but somebody looked at that part of the novel and said ""Hey! Why don't we make a whole series out of this one segment?"" Basically, the producers for that anime took the very basic idea and timeline and built a whole story out of it from the ground up. Ironically enough, Cuore itself wouldn't get an anime adaptation until five years later in 1981, and it wasn't included in the World Masterpiece Theater.Moving on to Cuore itself, the animation is...alright. Pretty limited, which is understandable considering when it was first made, but what it lacks in actual motion, it makes up for with non-standard but charming, distinct character designs, nicely painted backgrounds, and its attention to detail in regards to the setting. Though Cuore does have a pretty glaring issue which, unfortunately, has been common with series like it: the series can never seem to get its characters' names consistent in terms of spelling. At one point, Enrico's friend Crossi's name is spelled Crosi in one scene, but then it's spelled Crossi in another scene. In a later episode, Father Fernando's name is spelled as Felnando, with the L being capitalized in the middle for some reason. The hell? Have the staff never bothered to hire proofreaders or something? I don't have as much to say about the soundtrack. It's dated, but still pretty nice, all things considered, using plenty of woodwinds and accordions, though some of the higher pitched background music can get a little grating on one's ears. Both the opening and ending themes are very nicely sung, though.Now, I know I said Cuore as a series is fairly episodic, not following a linear narrative, just showing Enrico's school and family life, but that doesn't mean there isn't any character development. Similarly to the shows in the WMT, all the characters are shown growing up and maturing, for better and for worse, are forced to come to terms with their flaws, and really change throughout the series. Cuore isn't the most original story out there that explored this concept, but it's main charm is about highlighting the every day struggles of boyhood. Enrico and his family are all charming, likeable characters with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and the series really goes out of its way to give the same treatment to Enrico's classmates. Seriously, Cuore does a stupendous job of really giving a lot of time and depth to Enrico's friends and classmates, even those outside his social circle, whereas most series wouldn't give a damn about any character that isn't relevant to the main story. Every one of Enrico's friends, from the large, dependable Garrone, to the overweight, quiet yet mischievous bookworm Stardi (Who's my favorite, BTW), have different sides to them that give them more color and dimension than most series care to give, and I'm so happy Cuore cared enough about its ensemble cast to flesh them out and make them feel like people...most of the time. I did feel one character's turnaround at the very end came out of nowhere, but it didn't negatively affect my enjoyment of the series. One thing I can absolutely say in Cuore's favor is that I feel Mr. Perboni is one of the most well-written teachers I've seen depicted in an anime. He's strict, but not overly so to the point of being sadistic or heartless. He's depicted as a reasonable man who can be stern when he feels it to be necessary, but actually takes the time to listen to and reach out to his students when they have problems, never resorting to doling out punishments just for kicks and giggles.Cuore, as a series, is fairly wholesome and optimistic, rarely ever resorting to cliches and actually making an effort to treat serious subject matter with respect, but like the WMT, it isn't afraid to show bad things happening to children. Granted, a lot of that is limited to the stories Mr. Perboni tells to his class to teach them moral lessons, like a story about a boy offering to be a lookout for an army, only to get shot and killed in the process of doing so, or a story Mr. Perboni tells about a kid getting stabbed to death because he got into one fight too many, leaving his elderly grandmother all alone. The series tackles issues such as bullying, poverty, the importance of an education, and something I don't see get tackled in a lot of anime: Adult illiteracy. Cuore treats its subject matter fairly well...except for one: Child abuse. Without spoiling anything, two episodes focus on two characters being abused by their parental figures, showing how their abuse affects them and whatnot, which is fairly good at first...but the resolutions to the episodes come off as way too optimistic and treacly for my liking, and winding up coming with their own sets of issues, with one episode straight out ending with the abusive parent magically learning the error of their ways and instantly changing for the better right then and there...which absolutely does not happen in real life. That one in particular really broke my suspension of disbelief, especially since I've seen other shows, even WMT shows, that tackled the subject with far more nuance and sensitivity. Also, this is more of a personal nitpick, but some of the characters' voices can border on being really high pitched and grating for those who have sound sensitivity like I do.As far as accuracy to the book goes, I can't say, as I haven't read the original novel. I did find out there's an English translation out, so I might check it out when I'm able. In conclusion, Ai no Gakkou Cuore Monogatari is a fairly sweet, wholesome show that does make some missteps, but still manages to be charming and fun all around. People might not like the series' episodic format, the limited animation, or the non-standard character designs, but fans of the World Masterpiece Theater, me included, will definitely get their fix with this series. Plus, I'm super glad that fansub group decided to take a chance on it, as I never would have seen it if they hadn't, and I highly recommend it for people who are looking for an old-school slice-of-life series that's full of heart.";Recommended
0;Sengoku Kitan Youtouden;Luquillo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Luquillo;5;Age hasn't effected Wrath of the Ninja in a negative way all that much. For an anime feature made through 1987-1988, visually it's good and doesn't feel too dated. Some people like to point out the similarities to Ninja Scroll and there's a few, but Wrath of the Ninja quickly becomes its own entity and the truth is that it does pre-date Ninja Scroll by 5 years anyway.Where Ninja Scroll boasts fantastic visuals and over the top excessive violence, with intentions to cover its weak story and lack of character development. Wrath of the Ninja is more story driven but lacks the excessive violence. However, don't take this statement the wrong way because the OVA is no slouch in the violence department.The anime moves at a good pace with some good action scenes. The scenes could have been a lot better had some of them not been reused, which brings me to the animation. There's quite a bit of reused cels, stills during battle, and sword swipes simulating action. This type of combat has grown to annoy me over time, but I tend to give a small break to very early titles. In other cases, the action scenes can be pretty brutal with some vicious and disturbing killings. Some may have a problem with a few of the battles consisting of magic attacks that puts on a light show. I don't have much of a problem with it, but I would have preferred only weapon to weapon ninja combat.The artwork is good with some decent character designs which have a small bit of variety. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed with pretty mountain designs. The soundtrack is good at times with additional songs being added as the series continues, and most of them fit with the style and setting of the OVA. One song does come off very annoying to me, and just really didn't seem to fit with the action at all. Thankfully, this lousy instrumental is actually used sparingly. I also did enjoy the use of the sound effects in the very beginning, because it helped develop the first action scene. The OVA is only in Japanese, which is a plus because the English voice acting for the movie is terrible.Character development has its moments here, and the main cast for the most part are well developed. The villains are interesting skill wise. However, their personalities are too much alike, and the lead villain didn't feel like too much of a threat to me. I also didn't like the use of any of the secondary characters. They weren't really developed and I didn't find much of a reason to care for these people. As a result, the overly dramatic death scenes for them had absolutely no effect on me. Although very straightforward, the story at times does feel hard to follow later on, due to many characters being introduced. If one isn't paying close attention to clans uniforms at the very least, then it's difficult to tell who's who.I also liked the setting, which was combined with historical events, people, and the combination of fantasy and horror. There's a good deal of monsters and demons that are used in some freakish scenes. The fan service is kept relatively low, and there's no form of hentai to be found.There are some good and unexpected plot twist. Plus, the ending was good with loose ends tied up. This is a very good title to pick up if you love older anime. Also, the two disk set is the one to get. It contains two versions of the same movie, but there is a world of difference. Yotoden: Chronicles of the Warlord Period is the OVA set, which is broken into three chapters with a 138 minute run time and is unedited. Wrath of the Ninja is the heavily edited and shorter version with an 87 minute run time. The story can still be understood but there are key points omitted.There's also a good amount of extras consisting of historical & cultural notes, art gallery, and previews. The total run time for both film and OVA is 225 minutes.Highs: Nice Japanese cast, good action, OVA is the bestLows: Sometimes hard to follow, animation issues, secondary characters;Mixed Feelings
0;Mozu no Nie;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;5;"Tags: Domination, Group, Orgy, Incest, Brother x Sister, Daughter x Mother, Maids, MILF, Old Men, RapeCensorship: NoneMozu no Nie (House of 100 Tongues) is a single episode hentai ova that tells the story of the downfall of the Takashiro family. The family business is in a downward spiral and is only being held aloft through the efforts of the families adopted son Yushiro. Someone in the house is trying to cause the family business to fail and finds that the quickest way is to remove Yushiro from the picture. Nanako, the daughter of the family, is very ill and spends most of her time in bed; she is in love with Yushiro. Through a series of events we witness the total collapse of the family and see both mother and daughter forced into a life of sexual servitude.So, this is just a single 30 minute episode and there are a lot of characters thrown around. The show is narrated by an unknown member of the household who is working behind the scenes to cause the family to fail. Overall the story is fairly good even though it is short. Most of the characters are just there as furniture to fill in the story and thus do little more than appear on screen; the maid and butler for example, even though they are introduced by name, never say a single line of dialogue. It should be noted that the very last thing shown is a notice of a sequel, but the story was probably not good enough and a second episode was never produced.As far as the artwork and animation go, they are fairly well done and appealing. The hentai scenes are well done, but fairly short, and they had quite a few still shots thrown in. This hentai comes fully uncensored and with an English dub available. Sadly the dub is not great and the voice acting of Nanako is just annoying. Other than a bit of rough sex and a gang bang there is no overly objectionable material in this fairly vanilla hentai.In conclusion, this is a very middle of the road hentai title, neither particularly good nor horribly bad. In all honesty there was a bit too much story for a single episode hentai and it felt that the hentai content was just thrown in on a whim rather than a central element. You can easily skip this title and not feel you have missed anything.";Mixed Feelings
0;Feng Yun Jue;IsekaiNekko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IsekaiNekko;7;I'm going to keep this review short and simple to give the reader insight about the anime .General overview :This anime ( movie ) is based on Manhua that goes by the name Feng Yun . Story is held in ancient China and is all about kung fu . So if someone is into watching kung fu or some good Majestic Martial arts , this is the anime . By Majestic martial art , i mean martial arts that involve super natural abilities and Ki ( Qui ) energy .Story : 7Story development is just fine . It is good enough to make the non busy viewer stick to seat and complete the movie . It have some very good fight scenes and little bit of romance .Art : 9Art is just great .You can observe the movement of clothes due to wind , light effects during fight ( fights are flashy ) . Scenic beauty is amazing.Everything is detailed .Sound : 7Language of the original movie is not Japanese ( I'm not sure if it's Korean or Chinese ) , so otaku's might find it difficult to watch it . Sound effects are good . It have great sound for everything it shows , example movement of water , air , Kung fu background music . What it lacks is music that feels and touches the heart !!!Character : 8Main characters are very cool looking . Characters have sense of honor and are little series type .Overall : 7I would actually give it 7.5 rating .Movie is enjoyable if you are looking for Adventure , Martial arts , expect anything else , it will be in your dropped list .;Recommended
1;Feng Yun Jue;Isopods;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Isopods;8;This movie is like a moving painting depicting Chinese martial arts in a fantastical way.It has some of the most beautifully choreographed fight scenes I have ever seen, and investing about 99 minutes to get to see them is well woth it, in my opinion.The story is mainly there to let you enjoy the visuals, and it can seem stressed at times, as if they didn´t have time to tell it properly because of all the awesomeness they crammed into those circa 99 minutes, and that may not be to your liking.Still, if you give it a chance, I would not be surprised if you in ten years time still can visualize two men fighting with fishing rods, and wonder how one of them went from handling his rod to playing Erhu music in an instant, and I bet it will be a fond memory.;Recommended
0;Feng Yun Jue;Baby-Bunuelo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Baby-Bunuelo;6;"I've never watched a Chinese Anime, but it is definitely what I expected it to beThe movie can be a stand-alone. Nevertheless, it does feel a little confusing; watching the movie, I couldn't help but feel something more complicated was happening in the story, and sure enough, there was. The movie is based on a manhua, yet from what I've read so far, it seems to be a watered-down retelling of the story, not that I minded with the liberties it took; This version was fine for what it had. It's a simple retelling.animation= 6/10. For the characters, sometimes the body, especially facial designs, are inconsistent. Many male characters, main and random, seem to suffer from same-face syndrome; for example, in the beginning, I confused Jue as an older cloud. Without the hairstyles, you really wouldn't be able to tell the main male characters apart though it still was a bit of a problem for me in the beginning because Due Long and Wind looked similar. Ying's(Cloud's love interest) design can sometimes look wonky, and in one scene, when she is talking to Cloud on the bridge, her mouth doesn't move when she is speaking. Some of the backgrounds are done well and most detailed, with some impressive scenery shots.Nevertheless, the combination of 3D and 2D animation can be distracting and clash with one another, especially when it's not done properly. The angles of some of the camera shots, along with the fade-in close-ups of characters, especially Jue, can look unintentionally silly when it's trying to be cool. The fight scenes, while sometimes quite impressive and entertaining in a couple of scenes, come off like Reggie VS Iwata with the colored wind effects and fast motions.The story = 6/10 without context; the beginning feels disoriented and confusing, especially for those unfamiliar with the manhua, and gets off to a rough start that smoothes as the story goes along. The movie has several stories interwoven in one big climax with not one but two or three battle scenes. When you think the ending is in sight, you have another fight. I didn't intend that to rhyme, but it seems they tried to compact a lot of significant plots from the original manhua while trying to make it short enough as a movie. Because of that, many details about the characters' context and motives get left on the back burner. For example, there is this one character that Jue confronts in the beginning and later reappears at the climax. He seems important, yet there isn't much we know.The little romance the movie has isn't that strong or developed, especially with Wind and a bit of a Cloud; nevertheless, he does have more chemistry with Ying than Wind does with Dream. There is a field scene between Wind and Dream where they profess their love for each other out of nowhere, even though they really haven't had meaningful interactions. The scene was a bit laughable, with the tinker bell jingles and twirling jump by Wind being so weird and random, just like the scene itself.Sound= 6/10 The dub was ok, and I'm not even a picky person when it comes to dubbing, but some of the characters, such as the death caller and the little girl (I don't know her name), voices don't seem to match the characters too well. The voice actors overall weren't bad. In the beginning, the voice acting for some characters like Jue seemed a bit clunky, but by the end, the voice acting was pretty solid; I can't speak for the Chinese version, though.Overall I would give the movie 6/10. It's not bad and manages to tie most of the loose strings together in the ending, though it is a bit confusing concerning Wind's fate.[spoiler=Winds fate]he stays in his demon form forever Apparently, [/spoiler].It won't hurt to watch the movie if you want to; I won't watch this movie again.

0;Ie Naki Ko Remy Specials;CinaGinger;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CinaGinger;7;This is my review as a whole from episode 1 to 26. These really aren't specials, it just that they couldn't air all the episodes at the time and added them later, fortunately, so we could watch the end of the story. By the way, this is a reboot from the male version 'Ie Naki Ko'.Let's see... As it starts it looks like it could be a sob story, and it is. There is life and drama in a little 10-year-old girl that knows how to sing. She goes on an adventure unwillingly because of her personal situation but she somehow will learn to be free and more independent without having to listen to adults all the time as not everyone is as nice as her mum and her old neighbours.I loved quite a lot the music from the OP/ED and the animation was fine, it was like the others such as Heidi and Marco as they come from the same studios, Nippon Animation. So if you already liked others from the same studio, you should add this to the collection.However, it isn't exactly a masterpiece from start to finish and it's a little predictable so it's beautiful but not extraordinary. How it's called...? A comfort series? It could be well like that, although it's kind of melodramatic and couldn't stop tearing up.So overall, I'd recommend it if you don't have anything else to watch and want to complete watching all the classics because at least it isn't awful and gives another perspective to our lives.;Recommended

0;Ninpou Midare Karakuri;ravenrage;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ravenrage;8;"May not be suitable for minors (This is hentai after all. Adult stuff, not for minors!)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karakuri Ninja Girl is one of those hentai series that don't really have a plot(which hentai does anyway?). But focuses on comedy instead. And that is what this show basicly is: A funny lighthearted erotic comedy about a couple who enjoys sex indoor and outdoor, being watched and just wanting to live their happy dream in the city.""La Blue Girl"" comes into mind, as it also has ninjas and sex in it. but don't worry. Karakuri Ninja Girl is not hardcore and does not feature tentacles or rape or anything of that type. Karakuri Ninja Girl features boy on girl action and a bit of threesome and girl on girl action. The sex is creative, as the main characters are all ninjas, and have the ability cast various spells that enhances their actions. All from summoning a dildo to increases penetration speed and even turning a girl on. Breasts are shown in it's glory. But genitals are censored, or shown in unnatural forms as for example all shiny, black cloud or even a giant mushroom. There is no focus on the action ""down there"". But rather on the surface which helps with the comedy involved in the sex scenes.As for visuals, it's early 90's quality. Kinda like Trigun. But the 90's animation quality is awesome for facial expressions which can be mad funny. And overall the art is good for it's time. Breasts and faces are nice to look at. Most hentai series don't have a high budget so quality tend to be low but for Karakuri Ninja Girl it is good. Bright colors provide a relaxed atmosphere and fits with the comedy focus of the series.As for the sound and music. It's nothing special. You have the classical kunai throw, jump, slash, run, detection sound effects and the music in the background is oriental japanese inspired like those you would find in most ninja related stuff. The voice actors do their roles very well. Mika Kanai does a really good job as the voice for Suzuka(never thought she had voiced in a hentai, but it was great).The characters are easy to recognise and unique for example Suzuka is blonde and Sagiri is red haired. Suzuka is a cute and childish character and Sagiri is more mature and adult, but still is a but childish. Tsukikage is your average simple minded hentai protagonist who enjoys girls and sex and overreacts to situations. The characters are simple but enjoyable to watch as they engange in various actions. Nothing deep or serious is involved with the characters.All in all. Karakuri Ninja Girl is a funny, sexy vanilla hentai that makes fun of Sailor moon and focuses on comedy and sexyness rather than pleasure. Which means it does not focus on a certain fetish/fetishes. There is no tentacles, rape, torture etc. Breats are shown but genitals are censored. It's an erotic comedy with bright colors and characters which gives you a relaxed feeling with no worries about what may happen next. It's a good watch but with its shortness of 2 episodes only do not expect a great story plot with amazing twists. This is hentai. And a funny one it is! This is a great watch which will make you laugh, if not, giggle at least!";Recommended
0;Elf 17;Seabury;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Seabury;6;Since nobody has said anything, I'm going to post a really brief review here. This is mainly to give you an idea of what the heck you're looking at, rather than eloquently express my opinion. Consider it a placeholder until someone comes along and writes a real review.So, Elf 17 is an 80's OVA that is rather goofy and doesn't even try to make sense. The point to watching it is nothing more than enjoyment. If you want to relax to something lighthearted and fun, this might be for you. If you're seeking depth or originality, then stay away from this title at all costs.Plot-wise, it involves a few characters who travel to another planet and cause trouble by stealing their holy wine. The protagonist is apparently an elf who can fly, the male foil is some guy in a mech suit (he even sleeps in the suit!), there is a prince who's apparently just here to enjoy the spectacle, and a traitor taxi driver. It's nothing more than a mish-mash of cliches, without even the slightest attempt to explain it.The art is surprisingly good considering how obscure this title is. You won't be let down on that point. The music is mostly notable for the awesome ED.And.. that's it! Not much more to talk about really, considering its short length and subject matter.;Mixed Feelings
1;Elf 17;jadedXotaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jadedXotaku;6;"After crashing a ridiculous intergalactic martial arts tournament being held by the eccentric prince Masukata Taira (or Muscat Tyler as I've seen throughout the internet), the sometimes winged superhuman protagonist Ruu battles the perpetually mech suit wearing K.K. for the prize of touring the galaxy with the aforementioned prince. Ultimately both Ruu and K.K. accompany Taira, and hilarity ensues as they get into hijinks on a planet that's vaguely Middle Eastern.This 1987 OVA is predictably light on plot, with most things occurring for no other reason than for the sake of goofy humor. The art and animation is serviceable though, and Elf 17 is rather cute and fun in its own way. The elf Ruu is positively '80s, and the fact K.K. never gets out of his mech suit is amusing. He freakin sleeps in the thing. And keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss cameos from the likes of Chewbacca, Jabba the Hut, and Lum from Urusei Yatsura in the crowd of the opening tournament scene. Which isn't to say this thing is some kind of laugh riot, because it's not. It's pure '80s silliness that is rather hit and miss on the jokes.I guess one could file this under ""useless anime"" if they were so inclined. But let's be perfectly honest here, this is an OVA that's a few seconds shy of 30 minutes, expecting a well crafted story and deep character development from it is like expecting a coherent plot from an Italian horror movie. You're just not gonna get that. Which isn't to excuse its shortcomings, but understanding that goes a long way to being able to just sit back and be entertained by the lunacy that you're about to behold. There's certainly worst ways to kill time after all.";Mixed Feelings

I know it's like from 1995 but still that can be a deal breaker for some so be warned. when I was watching this anime I was thinking that I hope it doesn't go like all romance anime in the sense that there is no happy ending or a the MC won't just admit his feeling and that he's in love with main heroine. But in the second episode you can see they have a nice ""happy ending"", well sort off. I will say this much tho, if you can overlook the bad art and try and focus on the story you can maybe find something that is worth your time. Also since this is only a 2 episode long it won't take too much of your time. Overall I would recommend this for the people who want something that have romance and a little bit of echi.

0;Tanin no Kankei;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;6;English is not my language.Tanin no Kankei is cool!The anime is funny, and the ecchi is good (surprisingly).The ecchi, for the most part is used for Miyako tormenting her teacher, Tokiro.After sleeping with a guy (who is probably her lover), she goes to school and bumps into her teacher and some condoms fall out of her purse. Miyako bullies her teacher not to tell anyone at school (she bullies him to the point that she gets naked for him at school and says that she will scream if he doesn't accept what she says).After that, she creates some unusual situations, for example: she shows her breasts to the teacher while he is teaching. This I found funny.I liked the ecchi parts, because it is well used. And well... Miyako is wonderful.Tokiro's relationship with Miyako is good, although abusive on his part (although it is used for comedy).As expected in a romantic anime, they start to like each other.I like Miyako. She has her dramas and her reason for being the way she is. Tokiro, on the other hand, is just your typical silly anime character , which leads to funny situations.The anime has its serious moments and not just ecchi with comedy. And in this anime, the ecchi is not as gratuitous as in most anime.The animation is ok. A pity that there is no RAW with a good picture quality, just a file taken from some VHS.This OVA, even with only 2 45 minute episodes, has a good story. It was worth watching.;Mixed Feelings
0;Spectral Force;Luquillo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Luquillo;1;"In the world of Neverland; Demons, Gods, and Humans once lived together in peace. Later, they began to war with each other and the demons won gaining complete control. For centuries they ruled, and now a hero has discovered a sword that could kill their master, and give the humans an edge in the war. -summaryNeverland... heh, lol. Wow......Anyway, I still can't believe ADV films would actually allow their name to be mentioned on the same cover art as this monstrosity, not to mention even green lighting this thing at all. Make no mistake, Spectral Force is nothing short of a disaster that goes completely wrong in every category you can think of. I still hold Art of Fighting as the absolute worst anime I have ever seen, and its held that title on lock for about well over a decade. At this point, I kind of think it's never going to be dethroned; but Spectral Force is one of those anime titles that introduces whole new levels of suck in its own way, and it's pretty damn close to giving the aforementioned title a run for the championship. In any case, it's definitely in my top 3 of worst anime I have ever seen and this is no exaggeration.Spectral Force is a fantasy anime based on a video game (well imagine that!) that suffers from a very poor sense of direction. The anime has enough plot twist and characters to fit a 26 episode series format, which is beyond bad since the thing clocks in at 50 minutes. Many situations occur, many characters attempt to do different things, many battles take place, and almost nothing is properly fleshed out or concluded all that well.Let's see, I'll begin with the characters. Well for one thing, there are just way too many of them, and none of them are interesting in the least. They're just all around terrible and only one is somewhat developed. I already forgot the name of the main character, and I can't quite recall if all of the others were even named at all. The anime attempts to accomplish so many things, but turns out rushing and cramming everything in by the end, which results in a truncated opened ending.For a fantasy anime, there is just no creativity or imagination at all. The broken and busted plot limps into one segment after the other, and the horrendous character interactions have absolutely no energy; this is mainly due to yeah, the horrible characters of course, but it's also because of the atrocious dialouge and voice acting. The writing is just awful; characters who appear to play in the major story, soon fall into bit roles after playing in a major sequence, and it's also unclear on who is the real threat. Supposedly, the humans are the worst of the three evils, while the demons are the worlds best hope. If this is the case; then why is the human who discovers the sword considered a hero? Could this thing be playing off the adage; one person's patriot is another ones terrorist? I doubt this completely since the entire work has been mapped out so poorly.Visually, it's just as horrible as everything else. For a 2003 anime OVA, there is just no excuse for visuals like this. The animation does not blend well with the CG, in fact, I don't think they tried to blend it at all. The backgrounds are CG and the character designs are just there, it's hard to explain just how bad this looks at times. Forget about decent action scenes, a lot of it is poorly choreographed, while the rest is unseen with stills on static backgrounds, and if that isn't bad enough, there's even one scene where a still character is slowly moving in the background to its desired point. Can you believe something like this? Outside of the wretched ending theme, I didn't even notice the BGM.It's said to understand Spectral Force one must be familiar with the game. This is never a good approach. Video games to movies really should have content that appeals to both parties; fans and non fans. If developers are only going to bother with fans of the game, then perhaps they should start bundling these movies with their video game counter-part, to spare the non fans unnecessary suffering; but seriously speaking, even if this wasn't based on a video game it really wouldn't be any better.After watching more than 400 anime titles, I can say Spectral Force is too close to the very bottom of the barrel. Honestly, the only reason why I consider Art of Fighting worse is because I would have to watch it again to be completely sure, and I have no desire to do that. All jokes aside, you can walk into any anime section and pick up something better than this blindfolded. Avoid.Highs: Makes you appreciate better animeLows: It actually exist";Not Recommended
1;Spectral Force;Plk_Lesiak;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Plk_Lesiak;3;"I'm going through all the Idea Factory OVAs (all more or less promotional pieces for their visual novels and RPGs) and trying to make sense of them, without much success. What doesn't help, is that while the stories are generally meh, they also sometimes fall straight into incomprehensible – the first episode of Spectral Force is a great example. We start by seeing an angel(demon?) lady being fuckin' crucified and bleeding a lot of vividly pink raspberry sauce. Wow, edgy! Early Idea Factory generally seemed pretty fond of inserting random christian symbolism and over-the-top violence to this ""Neverland"" setting. How it ties into the story proper? Weeeeell... It doesn't, really.Then we are treated to absolute visual clusterf***, with awful CGI, incomprehensible cuts and the anime generally ignoring its tiny runtime and taking its sweet time before getting to the point. The second episode finally focuses properly on the demon princess and her quest to defend what's left of her domain, but I can't say it made me super-interested in how the story continues in the RPGs. It's just all bland, disjoined and generic, with whatever nice stylistic choices that could've been ruined by hideous CGI environments and incredibly cheap 2D animation.The first episode is actually pretty funny with how poorly constructed and cheesy it is, although the second one is mostly just boring. It's a decent ""so bad it's good"" kind of watch, but nothing more than that – if you're sober and respect your time, you should probably avoid it.";Not Recommended

Hiro.Story/Character: Spectral Force hints at large world building of a generic fantasy multi racial war. Watch Nanatsu no Taizai for proper art & story, or Shingeki no Bahamut for epic multi racial battles. But this story isn't as terrible as the synopsis. Here demons aren't typical villains. Demon lord Janus wanted to sacrifice himself by sealing some op excalibur (called ""this"" by the purple hero) with his body. By removing the op sword he hoped the world becomes peaceful.Hiro is the half daughter who hates humans but somehow has human mercenaries serving her. She's left with her father's mess. Somehow both demons & humans like to attack her.Shirou/Harry Potter, a tiny mercenary becomes important to the plot. Everyone has natural or funny dubs, but his is the most hilarious. [spoiler] He later becomes a manslave for a noble cause.Besides the dry war conflicts. Dialogue among mercenaries, Hiro & other races can be funny. And the strained family relations is somewhat interesting among Hiro, her oneesan, Janus, brother who was banished by Janus, which includes power struggle for the demon clan heir after Janus.Art: ok. There's a few short combat shots with smooth animation.Sound: ED & osts are fine, maybe the best part of this (dub the 2nd best). There's even some epic pipe organ.You can watch Spectral Force Chronicle Divergence for more about the world with better art, but less animation. It seems a remake with similar scenes, but more boring plot cards, dry with no osts & no English subs now. If you'd like something blander, then Chronicle Divergence is the answer.";Not Recommended
3;Spectral Force;Coolest_Girl;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Coolest_Girl;2;Story 3/10So, from what I saw, the story seems to be that humans and demons are at war. It is now up to Hiro, a half-demon, half-human princess to put an end to the war.Now, when you read the synopsis looks like a cool story right? Except that it is just poorly executed. I'm like ok so you got that story except that now you're confusing your audience 'cause you're putting these events that have close to nothing to do with the story.Overall, it seemed like a great story and I was intrigued by it. I thought it was a cool concept, just really poorly executed.Art 1/10This has to be one of the worst animations I've ever seen, along with Superkids. In the second OVA, some scenes were improved, but it's still bad.Character 3/10There were some characters that seemed to be good, but like the story, I think the character development was poorly executed.Enjoyment 2/10It's just bad. I didn't enjoy the anime, but I was intrigued by the story that I kept going and it was not worth it.Overall 2/10Yeah, not worth your time. The animation is just awful. The story and characters were poorly executed. It's a shame 'cause the anime had potential, but everything is just really poorly executed. I would not recommend this.Thanks for reading.

0;Kaitouranma The Animation;irish5ive;https://myanimelist.net/profile/irish5ive;7;"Hunt For The Sword Samurai was a blind buy for me and though very little impressed me or could be considered exciting, it was certainly not a waste of time.The plot has been regurgitated from dozens of other anime series. A thieving samurai faction has discovered where a magically endowed sword hilt is located and is determinted to make this dojo their next hit. If it was that easy though, they would have been able to overthrow the reigning government officials without competition. However, a young samurai named Shinjuro, a recently promoted headmaster to his samurai dojo, will not idly sit by and let the evil doings of his rival samurai go without opposition.The dojo which Shinjuro, our local hero, heads, is composed of his elder sister, a childhood friend, and a mysterious girl from China, who claims she is the daughter a friend of Shinjuro's father. None of these samurai girls have anything more then a familiarity with the sword and are certainly no threat to a skilled weilder. The enemy faction, is composed of a former student of Shinjuro's father, and a rouge martial arts expert, who is deadset on overthrowing the head of state.Of all the characters, Shinjuro and Mahoro (the rogue) seem to be the most skilled. But the balance is swayed with the addition of Shinjuro's fathers former student, whose name eludes me right now. Two against one. So what do you think happens. Shinjuro's father miraculously shows up to even the teams. Didn't see that one coming. However, now that our hero won't be pitted against two equally strong foe, he can focus completely on annihilating the ultimate threat, Mahoro.The convenient plot seems almost hastily put together to ensure everything works out for ""the good guys"". And because it lacks anything even close to an orignal idea, don't expect to be dazzled with plot twists or suspenseful moments. On the bright side though, for a two-part OVA, the story is never rushed. It takes its time to quickly introduce characters, further the story, and ends on a high note. Very few series as short as this can say that.As for characters, Shinjuro, is a believable lead. He is the only son to a skilled samuari, a student in his father's dojo, and was given the title of headmaster upon his father departure. With a few well timed fight scenes prior to his final match with Mahoro, we the audience, were able to witness his superior skills as a samurai. Thus, when he was forced to battle a more experianced warrior, we knew he was not completely outmatched. He is obviously a man of honor, and will help those that he deems to be weaker then himself, without a second thought for his own well-being. But though he is grown with skills of an adult when it comes to the sword, he is still just an adolesent boy when it comes to being around pretty girls.Mahoro, the enemy samurai, was never given enough time to develop as a reasonable ""bad guy"". Why is it that he wants to overthrow the govenment? What has the government done that has tipped this man over to ""the darkside?"" I think there may have been a quick explaination near the end of the series about a rivilary, but if so, if was not noteworthy of rememberence. I don't remeber discovering how he became an expert swordman, or who he trained under either. Regardless his story, he suited the ""bad guy"" role fine and was certainly deadset in his goal.I was very impressed with the quality of the art throughout the series. The characters themselves all looked great, though completely unoriginal. The girl were very cute; their outfits appropriate yet tantilizing. The male cast also looked very good, especially Shinjuro's father. He had a extreamly unique style to him and wore a messy beard that I was very fond of. Plenty of attention to detail was evident regarding the background cel animation, especially during more intense moments. These usually took place at either dusk or dawn and the vibrant use of reds, oranges, and yellows captured the true beauty of the time period.The best part of the series however, in my opinion, was not the cute girls, or the final fight scene, or the samurai beards finesse. No, it was the boob humour! I'm have always been quite fond of the childish antics that revolve around situational foolery. Shinjuro accidently grabs a girls breast while fighting, tells the wrong person about it, and never lives it down. He becomes the butt of a very impressive and long running joke for the duration of the series. It's been done before, many a time over. I laughed the first time I saw it, I laughed the 10th time I saw it, and I'll laugh the 100th time I see it. Boob joke are dynamite.As for the recommendation potential of the show. If you like samurai series, this will not be a complete waste of time. It has a great structure, decent fight scenes, and somewhat believable characters. The art is mangaed nicely, the music suits the mood well, and the humour is low-brow, yet very enjoyable. If however, you like to be blown away with an epic series, given vast amounts of character development, and enjoy meaningful dialogue, you might want to skip over this series.";Recommended
0;Kaitouranma The Animation;Colonelfancy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Colonelfancy;6;"Samurai: Hunt for the Sword feels like what would happen if you wrote an anime using cliff notes. It's not bad, but it's far from unwatchable. I would go as far to say that this might just be the most safely mediocore titles I've ever seen.[STORY 5] Remember back when every seventeenth century feudal Japan-based anime opened with ninjas raiding a shrine and slicing down lots of useless guards? I might be a sucker for those cold openings, but I can't help it, it's so cool in classic, B movie fashion.Door breaks downGuard A: ""Whose there!?""Ninjas rush in and cut down 57 soldiers in a poorly-lit shrineRandom ninja picks up cursed/sacred item: ""We have it, master!Bad guy with funny hair cut and scar arrives and takes thing: ""Now nobody can stop me! Bwahahahaha!""-TITLE SCREEN-Anyway, the core plot is simple, but incredibly faint. It does succeed in setting up tension for the final battle between the two swords, which in a way makes this like Ayane's High Kick or something.[ART 6] Character designs are cute at the most, but I got tired of this art style quite a while ago after Saber Marionette. Like the gals in SM, these girls are kind of pretty, but not the sexy I think they were going for. They pass as eye candy, because the male lead has such an undistinguishing look, he may as well be dry wall. Outside of that, the world is decently drawn, but not particularly immersing. Environments are reduced to generic rooms, another generic room, and several scenes in a town square. Decent, but lifeless at best for this universe, although animation for the final battle (while too short) was pretty sweet, and I'm sure Bleach ripped off a few of these moves for their stupid-looking bankai battles.[SOUND 6] Pretty okay english dub. It's sometimes pretty cheesy, especially during a scene where the Shinjuro is complimenting Busty Lady on her massive breasts and Koharu takes offense. It's funny just how bad the english dub actors try to make these lines comical. If you pick up the DVD, you'll get a kick out of the outtakes.[CHARACTER 6] As paper thin and cliched as this cast is, I only thought one person was really useless, and it's the silver-haired ninja lady (I forgot her name shortly after finishing the show, but she's the one who instigates the boob argument). Besides her, I enjoyed everybody else. Sure, they have no other traits that may redeem them as actual characters, but the girls are all pretty likeable and fun. I wish more was done with them backstory wise. The villians' motives seemed a tad bit unclear to me and I was trying to decide if there was an actual villian at all. They wanted this sword, bit then Shinjuro catches the silver-haired guy's eye and he wants to fight him, but on even ground. Huh, okay, so he's the fair, evil guy.[ENJOYMENT 6] Rewatch value maybe kind of low, but there's nothing really terrible about it (except the ninja lady). The humor isn't laugh out loud funny, but it's cute for what it's worth. If you like to watch cute ladies (and who doesn't?) kick around a bunch of ninjas (and who doesn't?), this is worth a look, but it lacks at holding interest in a story.[OVERALL 6] If this were a linear series, it may have been kinda bad, but for an OVA it has a cheesy charm about it. If there were anything else I could nitpick about is that it just kind of stops as opposed to having an ending. That annoyed me a bit, but I'll take this over Kaidomaru any day.PROS: Campy, light-hearted characters, cool final battle, DVD outtakesCONS: Kind of uninteresting, too much 'tell' and not enough 'show'";Mixed Feelings

0;Monster Sonic! D'Artagnan no Idol Sengen;LadySama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LadySama;7;"I happened to find this while browsing 9Anime, and it turned out to be a good, light, cutesy anime.Suggested age group: 8-12; or anyone who wants a short & cute anime.Personally, I'm not sure why this has such a low review. I don't think MAL-users put much thought into an anime when they try it out. I do my best to be objective.With that said, I'd say this is a cute little anime perfect for children. Each episode is half the length of a regular anime show. There's only 5 total episodes. The recap itself takes up some time also.The general premise is this: a teenage catgirl goes to Tokyo and is inspired by a chance encounter of a mysterious girl with the voice of a songbird (literally, the girl has wings). After a catching a glowing feather, the melody and moment have become something she is so inspired by, that she can't stop humming the tune. Her best friend encourages her to become a pop idol, and seems to have her mom's support as well.The rest of the story shows how she meets other very unique and sometimes eccentric personalities during her journey. Her roommate is a natural talent, who inspires her much like the mysterious girl she calls her idol.As I've said just earlier: ignore the low rating. Just like every book is heavy or light reading, this is on the ""light watching"" side of anime. I think this is a great little anime that would inspire children to pursue their dreams and work hard to reach their goals. As an adult, I think it's encouraging to see that there's still some positive anime that continue to inspire children. And sometimes I like to watch things like this to appeal to that inner child.It's not always about how ""good"" we think something is. I'm just not into that shiny, unrealistically ""over-developed"" female anime. I look at what an anime accomplishes, and what scenario it would fit in. For the genre and purpose, I would suggest this to people who want something short, sweet, and heartwarming, or to parents who realize their kids like anime.[Edit] I should also point out that this may be a not-so-subtle advertisement for XFlag's event, XFlag Park 2017, a live entertainment show that was held in early July, 2017. Crunchyroll had an article about it, for those who want to know more and wish to look it up.";Recommended

0;Kataku;Kuzan48010;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kuzan48010;6;Many users review series and animated movies following MAL guidelines and categorizing their rating. Sometimes they fail, because not everything is supposed to be treated as a part of the anime industry: there are also independent works, whose story is not always important, because they last a bunch of minutes, whose art is not always captivating, since they were made back in the 60s or 70s and try to be expressive more than realistic. The same goes for western movies: you can't rate sound, for example, if you're watching a silent film or dislike a black and white movie only because colors are not there.Kataku is a short independent, stop motion animated movie from 1979. It's a completely different experience from a yesterday-made series with bursting colors and flashing animation. A great experience I'd say.The masterful animation makes the story seem real and the plot, adapted from a play, is short but meaningful. You can feel the touch of the director in every frame. Kataku is something you must interpret with your heart and brain combined, considering the director was not supported by a studio, stop motion is a complex technique and many years have passed since 1979. The story is also from a traditional play, so strictly linked with Japanese culture and sensibility.I give it a 6, probably the best score a 19 minutes movie can achieve. I strongly recommend it to anyone, especially those who usually don't care about old works and independent artists. Just watch it and look how animation can also be something more than flat entertainment.;Mixed Feelings

0;Angel;Angel-With-Gunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angel-With-Gunz;4;I saw nobody had reviewed this yet so I thought I would give it my best shot.=Story Summary=Angel is a 1990 released single episode OVA school based hentai, it is focused around a brave and strong headed student called Shizuka who has returned to her home town after many years apart on the hunt for her long lost friend Kosuke, whom she has dreamed and fantasised about for many years.Unfortunately the school she commences is run by two perverted members of staff, one of whom an overweight middle-aged character called Arihashi is the main antagonist of the story, who gropes female students and abuses several others in exchange for better grades.To add to Shizuka's problems, her dream boy is not the brave masculine hero she had imagined, but a immature self-centered, idiotic pervert who is not very likable and fails to improve his behaviour for the duration of the film.The only other character of note is Madonna, a female teacher in the school who seems to be added in just to make sure at least one of the female characters has large breasts.In the end the students create a plot in order to catch the the perverted teacher which relies on Kosuke taking photos of Arihashi in the act of abusing a student. However he becomes distracted when he finds Madonna secretly masturbating and wastes all the film of his camera on her.In the end Airhashi is only stopped by another more masculine male student while Kosuke again fails to be of any help at all.=Art style=The art style is pretty much typical of the era it was released, with it being set in a school most the female characters are students and despite not being childish they do not have overly sexualised bodies either. I must say the censorship is very extreme and is the blurriest i have ever seen.=Recommendation=I cannot recommend this anime, it is fairly dated and possibly a little too old to hold the charm of other 90s anime. However if you are interested in abusive teacher stories and 'sex in a tree' scenes, then this may be worth a watch for you.;Not Recommended
0;Jue Shi Wu Hun;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;5;"Peerless Martial Spirit ReviewPeerless Martial Spirit is an objectively bad martial arts cultivation donghua. The synopsis doesn't cover the series at all so I will leave my own experience about the story and characters of Peerless Martial Spirit.Overview - Beginning Synopsis.Our Main character Chen Feng is a young disciple of popular elder Yan Qinyu, however his meridians are sealed and his cultivation advances slower than everyone his age. Naturally, at the age in Episode 1 disciples are expected to reach Rank 1 - stage 6 yet Chen Feng's cultivation halts around Rank 1 - Stage 3.Chen Feng's teacher Yan Qinyu was a highly respected inner sect elder of the Qian Yuan Sect and was affectionate with another female elder within the outer sect. Due to his righteous personality, past grudges have come to collect their debts with Chen Feng's teacher as Ci She - a heavenly gate 5th stage (Rank 2 Stage 5) cultivator (most likely hired by the Yan family) breaks his cultivation and Yan Qinyu becomes more or less crippled. The young junior elder that had affections with Yan Qinyu left him for dead by replacing his spot in the inner sect and forcing Yan Qinyu and his disciple Chen Feng to the Qian Yuan sect's outskirts. The grudges don't end there, Ci She comes to collect more debt by crippling Chen Feng's dantian being unable to progress from Rank 1 Stage 3. Many more people have grudges that they decide to pay back to Yan Qinyu which lead him to pass away from heavy injuries; despite that he manages to collect a treasure that is sealed inside him capable of curing Chen Feng's cultivation and increasing the rate of cultivation several times the normal rate. Chen Feng takes advantage of this godsend from his late teacher to get revenge on everyone that hurts him and his senior sister Han.Story: 4/10There are many plot holes in this Donghua, characters are born into existence when a random extra mentions the power of the newly existing character or where they hail from. Examples can include the skull sect that everyone fears, the Mayor's alchemy student who flaunts left and right or the never ending disciples of Qian Yuan Sect somehow coming under Elder Su's power. Everyone wants a piece of Chen Feng yet every time he defeats an opponent either an elder or guard steps in to protect the characters from getting killed by Chen Feng and stopping progression.Every time Chen Feng gets stronger he is still treated like trash even when he becomes the Sect patriarch's rising inner disciple. Literally everyone in this series is courting death.Art & Sound: 6/10The donghua is a typical 3D CGI animation with low budget character rigging and low quality polygons. FIght scenes are repetitive and character design for Chen Feng is very poor. His blue robe doesn't suit the story he looks more of a futuristic character from a Sci-Fi series than a cultivation setting.Sound is also average low quality sound effects and character grunting/breathing. The background music and series soundtracks are subpar and not iconic.Character: 4/10Chen Feng is an arrogant overpowered main character that boasts and attracts the wrong crow ds. The romance between him and senior Han is superficial, all of a sudden they become a couple after she wakes up from being clapped in the life or death arena. The character development makes zero sense between them every episode it's either Chen Feng fighting a new person or he finds someone that needs to be saved by him. You can skip 10-20 episodes and still meet back to the original character storyline.In the beginning when Chen Feng collects the Iron blood wolf pups (can't remember the exact naming), they mutate into an egg thanks to the dragon blood but only one egg hatches a mutated beast: Xue Feng. And in episodes 80 to 100, there were no mention of Xue Feng's existence or the other 2 wolf pups. Chen Feng visits the outer sect for supervision in episode 90+ so there would have been an opportunity to see those wolf pups hatched and mature within the time frame he was away in sect tournaments or inner disciple tournament. Instead, the direction of characters becomes more sacrificial, as we are introduced to the Yang family, Su family and Yan family feuds which are more chaotic and don't advance character development in the slightest.Also, when Chen Feng wears a mask to hide that he is buying the breakthrough pills at Xie family auction he wears literally the same clothes he usually does. His iconic blue, black and white clothing is a dead giveaway to others and having his face change from face masks is a lazy character design method of concealment.Enjoyment: 6/10Everyone loves an OPMC series where the main character is underestimated or hides their true powers. This in the sense, is its only appealing characteristic - everything else is a rollercoaster of garbage. If you truly want OPMC series with good story and character Douluo Dalu is much better designed overall (even though its probably the most popular right now)";Mixed Feelings
0;Youkai Watch Movie 2: Enma Daiou to Itsutsu no Monogatari da Nyan!;JoHou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JoHou;9;Preface: It is Youkai Watch! What else do you need to know? If you are reading this you probably have either an interest in the movie or the series so I will keep this short.Story 8/10:Compared to the first movie, I felt like this one had a more engaging story/stories. The movie has four separate stories that ultimately lead to the fifth story which is the climax of the movie. Each story is about the length of a normal episode and has more or less the level of depth you are used to in the series. Though for long time fans it tugs a bit more on the heart strings with the inclusion of a certain lady tied to Jibanyan's past. Everything is what you would expect from a kids movie and has a cute little message of Yokai and Humans coming together to prove that they can exist together.Art 7/10: Nothing spectacular here, but the animation is noticeably better in certain places then you would get in your typical episode, especially during the action oriented scenes. I was not a big fan of the use of 3D in this movie but it is pretty negligible and easy to overlook but it does stand out a lot more than it probably should.Sound 8/10: Same old soundtrack, same old pleasant little songs. The movie ending theme is a nice little song and it reuses the at the time current ending theme of the anime for the proper ending credit scene. If you like the upbeat and plucky tunes of the series you will feel right at home here.Character 9/10: The strongest point of the series and the big favorites are here: Jibanyan, USApyon, Komasan, Fuyunyan and Whisper with Keita and Inaho to round out the cast. They act like their predictable selves but that isn't a bad thing at this point is it? We finally get to Komasan's larger than life mother and to be honest it was well worth the wait even if she is only in the film briefly. Lord Enma plays the role of cool new character and demonstrates his role as the current leader of the Youkai Watch with Nurarihyon playing the villain steeped in his old ways of doing things. Enma and Nurarihyon don't get much development but they are nice addition to overall cast of characters the series brings.Enjoyment 9/10: While your mileage may vary on how much you may like this movie but I found it fun for the time being. You can definitely go without seeing it but with how much advertising the show did for this movie, you would really be doing yourself a disservice not to give about 90 minutes of your time for this film. It won't change your life or make you rethink anything but I can say it will brighten up your day, even if just for a tiny second.Overall 9/10: Give it a shot you might just enjoy it. Certainly not the best film out there but certainly not the worst film either. Everyone can benefit from a little cuteness that Youkai bring into this world.;Recommended
0;Kindan no Mokushiroku: Crystal Triangle;IDieScreaming;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IDieScreaming;6;I'm on a quest to watch the shittiest anime known to man -- that's how I stumbled across this peculiar little OVA. Low ratings? Action anime? I was preparing myself for a hyper-violent cheesefest akin to M.D. Geist, but it seems I got something different instead.This is not a great anime. But what separates this from the bad? This anime has effort and passion behind it.Story & Characters:The story and characters are this anime's weakest link. Imagine the over-the-top and convoluted sci-fi/political thriller of Metal Gear Solid crossed with the stock characters of an Indiana Jones film minus the originality. That's basically all this anime is. The characters are extremely underwritten and are only there to serve the plot.The plot, on the other hand, is an extremely convoluted and ridiculous plot involving the Soviet Union, the US military, a shadowy cabal that controls the Japanese government, and a conspiracy by an ancient alien race disguised as Buddhist monks.So what's good and bad about the plot? Well, everything is bad about the plot. But the best thing is how much the show believes in its own plot and takes itself seriously.Art & sound:Maybe it's because I've been looking at too much shit anime, but Crystal Triangle is a feast for my eyes. The animation has plenty of effort put into it -- the bouncy animation of the jeep in the opening, the detailed interior of the BMW that the secret agent drives, and the stunning colors of the life-support chamber that looks ripped right out of Evangelion (Anno worked on animation in this show) -- there are details to be found in plenty of places here.Sound is alright. Serviceable. Of special note is that they actually got Russian and English VAs in the Japanese original -- accented, but still, the effort is admirable.Enjoyment:Anime is an audiovisual storytelling medium. The story of Crystal Triangle creaks under its own weight, but man, is there passion in the visuals and even the story itself. The story is the best kind of bad story -- the kind that takes itself seriously, and the visuals do their best to make that bad story seem as cool as possible. The visual details, the effort put into the voice acting and the grandiose story add up to a very enjoyable effort (at least in my opinion).In conclusion:Some bad anime are charming because of how bad they feel.Crystal Triangle is charming because it does its level best to make itself good -- and it almost succeeds.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kindan no Mokushiroku: Crystal Triangle;Fel_Temp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fel_Temp;3;When it comes to terrible anime, it's really hard to find ones that are bad in an enjoyable way, like The Room or Troll 2. With anime from this era, the bad stuff is usually just boring or frustratingly stupid. So imagine my delight when I finally stumbled upon this anti-masterpiece. It has a plot that moves like a mad lib, continuously getting more and more insane. Seriously, it starts as an Indiana Jones style story, but then all of the sudden the protagonist has super powers and is fighting aliens, then the movie immediately forgets about his powers again. He'll get into a seemingly inescapable situation, then it'll cut to him being fine, with only a brief mention that he has no idea how he got out of that. All this builds up to an amazingly nonsensical ending that had me grinning the whole time.This isn't a good anime. It's in fact very bad. But it's one of my favorites, and in the right mindset, it could be one of yours as well.;Not Recommended

2;Kindan no Mokushiroku: Crystal Triangle;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;"At first, as the smarmy, hunky archeology professor and his blonde ingenue sidekick start smashing massive, ancient ruins in the desert, fighting the bad guys and escaping in a plane, I was like, cool, this is going to be a bit of a rip-off of Indiana Jones. I'm down with that. (Or maybe a closer analogy might be the Brendan Fraser The Mummy, in terms of over-the-top style action. Also good.)But that only lasts for the first act. Pretty soon it starts delving pretty deeply into some really weird mysticism and ancient-alien-level weirdness, extra-sensory powers...and it never looks back. And the plot is none the wiser as well, as any semblance of rationality is thrown out the window.Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but there's so much nonsense it's hard to follow, and eventually I stopped trying to figure out who was what, and where this whole mess was going. This movie is definitely one of those eighties shows that has the philosophy of ""throw everything into the pot, stir it up and see what works"". The problem is, an ""everything"" show usually ends up just a jumbled mess.Some have pointed to Crystal Triangle as one of those ""so bad it's good"" shows, where you sort of bask in the terribleness of it all. But really, there's so much of it that you're exhausted trying to do that halfway through. Like drinking from the firehose of awfulness.";Not Recommended

The first 15-20 minutes are somewhat acceptable because it may look as an interesting adventure/mystery story with mystical elements, but then the remaining 70 minutes of nonsense come in like a train.Visuals are nothing special, with mediocre sketches and character design and below average animation.Oh, and God is depicted as a weird caterpillar who floats in the air inside a giant spaceship, talks like Alvin and the Chipmunks, and dies miserably just like a bug when he gets slammed against the walls of the ship during a battle fought between Soviet and American jet fighters in the skies above it.I strongly suggest you avoiding this anime unless you want to watch it to laugh at it with friends, just as I did. In that case it provides a good amount of fun.;Not Recommended
0;Bari Bari Densetsu (1987);Boltz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Boltz;9;What Initial D is to car fans, Bari Bari is to motorbike fans. And that's the greatest compliment a racing series can get. Hell, the manga was supposedly so good that people started to join the Bōsōzoku (Japanese motorbike gangs) in droves! Strange?Not really, since the same guy, Shuichi Shigeno, created Bari Bari Densetsu and Initial D - two holy grails of the petrol-heads. He also had assistance, in the form of his prominent student Jyoji Morikawa - the guy behind Hajime no Ippo.You know a racing movie is good when it starts with a shot of an idyllic road. The morning sun is gently fondling the scenery and the birds are chirping. Suddenly the comforting scene is ripped apart by a raging motorbike noise. Two riders blast into the scene, taking the corners at a mind-blowing pace. They turn, they twist, they lean almost vertically as they literally eat the road.The camera zooms in, shifting gears, the parts move, the engine shakes, and the bikes roar like furious wild beasts. The riders become one with the road, the lines they take paint a work of art and the sound from the bikes, revving up insatiably, creates a symphony of destruction.When a movie conveys all this feelings, you know it's made by a driver, for the drivers. And Shuichi Shigeno is one of the rare people with a godly talent to make this right. The detail put in his work is insane, right down to the point, where you can hear the air getting furiously sucked into the intake.And not just the bikes, great care was also put into making detailed surroundings. You will actually recognize segments of racing tracks like Tsukuba and Suzuka, if you're familiar with them.Now this being a racing movie, you shouldn't expect a great story. And it really isn't, but by no means is it bad or boring. It's a tale that never gets old. About a young, fast but reckless, prodigy that wants to push his limits, and a rival, who challenges his skills and helps him transcend to the next level. There is also a girl, of course, who likes to stick around the fast boys.It's a very down to earth, relate able story and you'll be rooting for everyone involved by the end. It all builds up to one of the greatest races ever, with intensity hotter than any fire.This is all wrapped in a distinct 80's production, with the catchy music of the time. Fear not, there are plenty of moments where you'll be listening to just pure sounds of motorbikes being pushed to the limit. Also, this being partly a motorbike gang movie you'll get to see some action moments too. The most glorious one has to be where the main protagonist punches someone trough a closed car door (it's as awesome as it sounds).Speaking of motorbike anime, it's strange that so few were made, since the Bōsōzoku were quite a popular theme in the 80's Japan. Sure, biking is present in many of the classics of the time, like Akira, Megazone 23, etc., but only Bari Bari Densetsu seems to be fully devoted to it, besides Bobby's In Deep, which is a bit short and experimental, but also a great biking movie.Just like with Initial D, I can only end this review with the following words. If you're a racing fan, you'll scream with enjoyment while watching this. If you're not, you will become one.;Recommended
1;Bari Bari Densetsu (1987);BobSamurai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BobSamurai;8;"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*Bari Bari Densetsu comes to us from the original creator of Initial D. The story follows illegal street racers on their path to professional races. Like Initial D, these teens ride on Japanese mountains swooping around corners at breakneck speeds. Additionally, if you loved the dynamic camera angles featured in Initial D, they're even better here because it's 100% hand-drawn and painted.Although Bari Bari lacks the uniformity of CG art, it depicts each race from numerous camera angles. Whether it's looking straight ahead, checking the speedometer, engine shots, or close-ups as riders lean around corners with their knee an inch away from the pavement; you're bound to be impressed by its creators' artistic vision. However, my favorite mid-race animation is how the camera rotates around riders causing the scenery to shift. I'll admit, it's not perfect, but creating the appearance of a 3D space using only hand-painted sheets of plastic is worthy of praise. Furthermore, these complex camera angles occasionally extend to non-racing scenes and create a beautiful cinematic experience throughout the entire film.The story primarily follows Hideyoshi and Gun, two rival teens who will stop at nothing to one-up each other. They come from vastly contrasting backgrounds. My favorite is Hideyoshi due to his tragic background. Despite being in his teens, he lives alone with his sister since their parents' death in a car accident. He sees racing as his means for providing for himself and his sister. On the other hand, Gun receives the most screen time but is characterized as an antagonist. It's very easy to dislike him, considering how he's played out as a disheveled jerk who constantly antagonizes Hideyoshi for no apparent reason.Supposedly, Gun comes from a wealthy family, but they didn't explain that well aside from the fact that he's got an expensive bike. Maybe the 38 volume manga goes further in-depth on that. In fact, there are many characters and plot points introduced that the movie doesn't have enough time to flesh out fully.It feels like there should be two romance arcs, a love triangle, more in-depth characterizations for its side characters, and some backstory for how Gun and Hideyoshi met, but the movie is only 85 minutes. As you would expect of a racing movie, the plot builds up to a major race in its final chapter, and I think it's a high point for the film. Not only does this race test the rider's skills, but also their endurance considering it's a long race on a sweltering day.This immense challenge brings out the best in our characters as they push their limits as far as they can, some even crash and continue the race. In addition to the physical feats presented during this event, the struggle causes our characters to develop, leading to a fulfilling and emotional conclusion....which I absolutely hate...Seriously, this might be one of my most hated anime endings. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. I just strongly disagree with what happens and how that makes me feel.Overall, I give Bari Bari an 8/10. While this movie only covers a fraction of the manga, I think the directors and planners did a great job of spacing everything out as not to feel too rushed, though it's obvious this should have been at least a 24 episode series. I also didn't like how Gun was given the superhuman strength to kick a guardrail with enough force to cancel his momentum and crumple the steel-like aluminum foil.story 7art 9sound 7character 7.5enjoyment 8overall 8";Recommended
0;Bari Bari Densetsu (1987);lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;6;"VROOM, MOTHERFUCKER. VROOOOOOOOOOOM!!!Motorcycles are so fucking cool, dude. Seeing these ones animated so well when they might be obnoxious CG blobs today makes me happy.The story was pretty basic, and interesting to think about in connection to the mangaka's later work, Initial D. I think Initial D First Stage is damn near perfectly paced with great stakes because it all comes down to Takumi's relationships with the 86 and his rivalry with well-defined opponents. Bari Bari Densetsu doesn't exactly have that. It feels a lot slower when they're not racing and the original author's portrayal of women he was clearly not too interested in writing is even thinner here than in Initial D. The movie stops dead for weird fan service scenes featuring the pink-haired girl (pretty cute design within this style, but it's not my favorite style), and one of those scenes is an attempted rape at knife-point. Where the rapist is even—I shudder to write this—attempted to be redeemed as a person immediately afterward. That doesn't work.But, even then, the fact that the racing is mostly semi-pro here takes a bit away from the Initial D formula, because there's no defined antagonistic opposition. The dynamic is that the two main rival characters have a love-hate relationship and they work together to win a qualifying race. That means there's no inter-race commentary or ""I have to beat him"" or psychoanalyzing the action. The race starts, it looks good, and it's over without you getting really invested in it. Of course, I think they realized this when it was initially being written because they added some crashes to make things more interesting.I understand there's probably more street racing in the manga, and I understand this is actually a summary of a 2-episode OVA, so there's more for people who want more. But I enjoyed the art a bunch and was otherwise left a bit wanting by it.";Mixed Feelings
0;3-Nen D-Gumi Glass no Kamen;tzippurah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tzippurah;8;Look, I don't know what to tell you. This is a parody of a manga that has been running for more than forty years. If you have seen Glass Mask or read the manga, then you will laugh at this send up. If you have no familiarity with either, go forth and watch and read, because they are perfect encapsulations of classic shoujo.There are send ups of almost every repeated character tick in the show- the white eyes when someone realizes something, Tsukikage-sensei's shocked cane drop, Maya literally eating something to learn how to act like it, etc etc.Be prepared for some bait and switch humor too- the show will pretend to be an episode about say, studying for exams and then it will show how characters from the 70s react to the concept of a all-you-can-drink restaurant. Once you realize that nothing serious will ever get addressed, you'll be happier.For the people complaining, it's like you pointed to something on the menu you didn't read with a cow next to it and you are mad it turned out to be a milkshake instead of steak.;Recommended
1;3-Nen D-Gumi Glass no Kamen;heartattacks;https://myanimelist.net/profile/heartattacks;8;"DISCLAIMER: If you somehow didn't read the description on this very page, this is a PARODY of famous shoujo manga Glass Mask. If you haven't seen it, you won't get the jokes. If you HAVE seen it, it's kinda funny.ACTUAL REVIEW AND CONTEXT:What it says on the tin.It's a low-budget gag anime that pokes fun at recurring events from the manga. Without that context I can see why someone would find this ""bad"", but why would you watch it without knowing what it's parodying? It would be like watching DD Hokuto no Ken without knowing even the ""You're already dead"" line.For example, Maya will often ""become"" things in order to ""understand"" the role she's supposed to play when acting, such as ""acting like the wind"" to understand how to perform as ""someone feeling the wind blowing on their face"". This is one of the most important parts of the manga and what sets her apart from the other actresses she performs with.So as a gag, one of the episodes here has her act as a cellphone in order to ""understand how to deliver a text message"".Is it funny on its own? Not really. It's funny because you know what it's referring to, and because that's something you could actually see her doing. And that's the structure for most of the jokes here.THE JOKES""What if [event from the manga] happened in modern society as opposed to 1980?""""How would these 1980 characters deal with these modern problems?""""The overly sentimental character would probably have an emo blog nowadays""""What if they made the 80s shoujo reaction face to everything?"" (admittedly the funniest episode for me)Do all the jokes land? Not really, some are very dull. But most are definitely entertaining, provided you know what they're referencing. I might've not bust a gut laughing, but I definitely had a dumb grin on my face throughout the whole thing, especially with the more absurd episodes.THE ARTNot much to say. They're low budget 3D chibis that move (more like wiggle) like bowling screen/karaoke avatars. They're pretty cute, mostly because of how cheap it is.OVERALLIf you've read Glass no Kamen or even watched the show, you'll get the jokes and have a good time with how absurd this is. If you haven't, you won't. That's not hard to understand.That said, I wish they'd have used other characters from the manga as well, especially during the episodes where they simply didn't have a joke and just spammed one-liners. Including the theater troupe, the directors, even Masumi's secretary or hell, Masumi himself who barely appears in the actual episodes, would've made it better. It's still pretty funny though, and since the episodes are only 4min, one of them not landing doesn't waste your time that much.";Recommended

That night I had watched Anitore EX! and thought to myself ""Wow, maybe there are some anime short series that I can watch,"" So I opened up my KissAnime app and made the biggest mistake of my otaku life: watching this show.This show is genuinely the worst anime I have ever watched. Aside from the show being animated poorly, with really cruddy CG, the characters and their designs just make no sense to me. The designs are oddly proportioned even for chibi standards and I can't even remember the character traits of any characters. Seriously, what was the main girl like again? Nice? Annoying? I don't know, either my memory's terrible or this show just bored me to sleep. Though, those are things that usually earn a number 3 or 2 score from me. But, what gets a show a 1 from me is if it insults me. Ba La La got a one for insulting my love of the magical girl genre, Iken Sengoku insulted my intelligence, 3-Nen 4-Whatever Glass no Crap goes for three by insulting my intelligence, my love of the school life genre, and my favorite play The Miracle Worker with a horrible scene that has scarred me for life. Never watch this show! Don't watch it! Even if you think it might be funny, just don't!

1;3-Nen D-Gumi Glass no Kamen;frodododobert;https://myanimelist.net/profile/frodododobert;2;Overall, this anime does some things right for a specific audience, but a general audience will likely not find enjoyment in this anime. It is a short, slice of life anime so nearly all the problems are 'solved' (that is if they ever do get solved) almost as soon as they are written. This s personally not to my taste, especially as most of the problems are frivolous.The overarching plot comes out of nowhere, has no buildup and is solved as fast as any other problem after being introduced and felt extremely forced just in order to have something that they can call a finale. Its comedy doesn't have much going for it (not a great selling point for a comedy anime) and there aren't any jokes I found that made me really think. I didn't find any of the jokes funny and I feel that any audience above 15 would be able to laugh at any of them. The art uses a 3D style to no avail. The art is similar to Berserk 2016 in a few ways, just replacing the dark color palette with a color palette extracted straight from a rainbow and the edgy, sharp style with more smooth, curvy design. Overall, it doesn't work for me and I feel the 3D style was just used to save time and money. . The music isn't offensive, but mediocre. Still, that seemed like the best thing from the anime. Overall, I think the comedy is to childish for a teen or above audience and the themes are too teen centered for anyone under that age to really understand, but a very specific group may find this enjoyable.;Not Recommended
0;Houma Hunter Lime;SgtSalamander;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SgtSalamander;7;Before I begin, I must say that this was an unexpected little gem that I just stumbled across via the recommendation of a small YouTuber, Voice Overwolrd (and yes, that is the correct spelling). This is the second time I found myself with the honor of being the first to review an anime on MAL, and as such I want to do it justice and be thorough in the attempt. Without further ado, I hope this review is helpful to whoever stumbles across it next.Jewel BEM Hunter Lime is a charming little 3-episode game adaptation from the late 90s which really captures the essential character of anime in that age. It is campy, flashy, and unrestrained in all the ways the medium was back then, while also rising above the baseline with excellent comedic timing, fun visual language, and a story structure which could have remained interesting for 10 more episodes at least if given the chance. However, there are of course some flaws, which may have contributed to its ultimate fate. Beginning with the story, it sets itself up with a simple yet compelling tale of a magic world beyond the human one, with the moon as a monthly portal between them, and these six power gems which fall to earth during a struggle between our main trio and a demon from the magical world. These power gems can absorb the negative energy that humans can passively give off, becoming cute yet often nefarious versions of nearby inanimate objects. This makes for a simple yet consistently entertaining monster-of-the-week format, and while the dialogue can sometimes be a little stiff, it is more often naturalistic, funny, and well-timed. While not every one landed, most of the jokes had me rolling, and reminded me a lot of Golden Boy in their execution. The ones that failed, however, failed hard, and just felt pretty jarring for a show with a typically great sense of humor. The art is characteristically 90s, maintaining that quintessential look all the way from the often slender and stylish character designs, to the bright color palate, and even the wonderfully emotive faces, evocative of other titles from this era like Sailor Moon. Overall, even for a smaller project like this one, the effort and talent of the people behind the art really shined through from beginning to end. The sound is adequate, with a catchy OP and ED as well as playful synth-heavy music throughout. The voice acting for the dub is fun and energetic, though sometimes pretty clunky and amateurish, which still adds its own kind of charm. The characters are perfect for their setting, even if they're not breaking any records for unique execution. I especially thought that Bass was kind of one-note, which is a shame as he's a pretty funny major character. Hard to say who my favorites are here since there's really only two characters that get any amount of significant attention, and that is Lime and Bass, though Lime wins out as the strongest character here. Of course, I also quite enjoyed their third member, the silent and bizarre Morph Master Poogie, though he feels like more of a weird pet than anything. Overall, while there's not much substance to this anime, it's still a really fun way to spend an hour and change, and I feel it deserves more attention than it has received in the ensuing decades since its release. An easy, fun, watch that most will enjoy, and fans of 90s anime might even love.;Recommended
0;Joou-sama wa M Dorei;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;7;"Can you remember a life-changing moment when you knew that things will never be the same? More likely it is a memory that will never be forgotten. Queen and Slave is a story of such a moment for two people. It follows a tale of sex and debauchery hidden behind veils of innocence. A psychological drama of love and betrayal in the most unexpected ways, Queen and Slave manages to give the audience an emotional ride through BDSM. If like your hentai with a bit of drama and character development with underpinning themes of S&M, rape, gang-bang, and perhaps some NTR then Queen and Slave is for you.STORY 8What I really like about classic hentais is that they usually some thought about the story and plot which is all too often left out in hentais today. Queen and Slave manages to deliver a short tale of two individuals drawn together by a seemly innocent exchange which leads them down a series of life altering choices and situations with a thought provoking conclusion in the end.Set in a typical urban city somewhere in Japan, salary men work by day and seek prostitutes in sex clubs at night. Behind closed doors their wildest fantasies are fulfilled by a whip touting leather clad sadist queen known only to her customers as ""Yumi"". By day she is Terada Yoshimi, a gentle and caring nurse at a local hospital. Her secret double life, however, is accidentally discovered by a young hospital patient, Andou Hiroyuki, who fell in love with her loving gentle kindness. He secretly follows her and finds out the dark side to her. What ensues is an emotional roller coaster of unrequited love, hate, humiliation, and self-realization.CHARACTER 8Terada Yoshimi, as I have mentioned before, is a nurse by day and a S&M prostitute by night. She is, considered by many, a sadist queen who loves to punish men. We find that she is a bit of a man hater, perhaps due to circumstances when growing up. However, during her day time occupation, not a shred of her sadist tendencies show up. On the contrary, she is a gentle and kind nurse. The sort of gentle kindness that shy young male college students like Andou Hiroyuki would fall for. And it is indeed Andou that brings about the catalysis of change for the two.An innocent, shy, and perhaps insecure college student, Andou is emitted to the hospital for a broken leg where he meets the beautiful Terada and falls madly in love with her. Though it was a short exchange, Andou could not forget about that beautiful nurse, to the point where he began stalking her to the discovery of her night time profession as a prostitute. With mixed emotions, he decides to buy a night with her. Unintentionally, he discovers his dark side. You can say Andou is the tragic hero in the story. He really can't seem to do things right and, in the end, hurts the ones he loves, realizes too late, and cannot come to grips with it thus transforming him forever more.In a sense, Tereda Yoshimi and Andou Hiroyuki are both protagonists and antagonists in a somewhat disturbing drama of love and hate. It is rare in hentai that we get to see character development and yet Queen and Slave manages just that in a single 30 min episode. But I think the biggest plus for Q&S is that you empathize with the characters and because of that you have an emotional bondage to what happens to each character.ART & ANIMATION 5Art and animation is of of Queen and Slave's short comings. For a title released in 2002, I would of expected something a bit better. Probably due to production costs I would imagine. However it does have that nice classic feel and I give them kudos for coming up with some innovative split screens and pans. It isn't often you get to see a close up shot of the penetration with a panning of the action superimposed. It was quite ingenious to make of for the lack of animation. Another plus is that this title can be found uncensored and I was surprised to find a high level of detail that went into the private areas, and by that I mean sucking pussy lips and swinging scrotums. Although, I do think there were excessive wrinkles in the details, but what ever, it certainly beats the usual plain red hot dogs.Character design wise, Q&S is not bad. Terada Yoshimi looks good. A quintessential black haired beauty with full breasts. No, not the blond you see on the misleading cover. There are odd angles in some of the sex scenes where movements and drawings seem, well, odd. But none the less, the copious amount of sex, the gratuitous scenes, and the details all point to good fapping material.SOUND 7I have no problems with the sound. The voice acting was good and fit their characters respectively. The electric guitar in the back ground gave an air of tragic rebellious melancholy. The SFX were all on que and all the squishy sopping noises you would expect from hentai of today. The OP and ED is all instrumental. A mix between jazz and techno, it is rather catchy.OVERALL 7.5Queen and Slave brings an air of nostalgia, back to the days of hentai classics. Sure it is lacking the the art and animation department, but makes up with story, character, and innovative imagery. You can say it is a template for hentais of the BDSM/NTR genre we have today.";Recommended

0;Samurai Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaden;nikolas_dmx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nikolas_dmx;7;The second anime attempt over SNK’s extremely popular Samurai Shodown fighting game franchise is without a doubt, a big step forward in every direction. The quality of story, graphics and fights has been greatly improved, compared to its predecessor Samurai Shodown The Motion Picture, and as much as some people were disappointed of Samurai Spirits 2, I find the product being quite good and enjoyable. Surely, it’s not the best out there, but it is still very decent.(Story and Plot) Probably the first thing that we should mention about the story is the fact that it is finally following the game’s original plot. Something that for what so ever reason, has been skipped in The Motion Picture. Still, what the show really caught me with, were not the action, or the hope for a minor explanation over a piece of the enormous franchise. It was the good mix of seriousness and tender humor. Focusing on inner conflicts incidental to every human being, the story concerns the difference between what is good and what bad, what you want to do and what you are obliged to, between easy and right, and the value and weight of your own choices. All of that has been shown trough Nakoruru and Rera, who are the two sides of one coin. The comic moments between Rimururu and Haomaru were another classy stroke that I will be remembering for a long time. Of course, the story has its amount of unclearness and plot holes, but they are not as visible, as they usually are in productions of that kind. Samurai Spirits 2’s biggest disadvantage of is that it has not been made for people who are unfamiliar with the games and lack some decent knowledge on the characters. Someone not familiar with the franchise will probably have a hard time understanding the value of this show.(Art and Music) Art and music are probably bringing the biggest improvement to Samurai Spirits 2, compared to its prequel. Drawn in that typical style of the 90’s, with perfectly designed, detailed characters and marvelous landscapes, it really manages to get you in the samurai world. The fight scenes were pretty good, with nice choreography and also drawn with details.The music was awesome, perfectly completing the theme and mood of the show. I rarely comment the voice acting, but I must say that the performance of those who voiced Haomaru and Rimururu was a class.(Charachters) A good thing about the characters is that only few of them are under the spotlights in these OVA episodes. This allows us to focus on their development, their personality, their problems and we can actually see someone behind our favorites. The anime mainly focuses on the four - Nakoruru, Rera, Rimururu and, Haomaru, leaving the others like Shiki, Garfold and the bad guy, with little time on screen and literally useless background role .(Overall) Samurai Spirits 2 is a definite must see for all the fans of the series, for it gives a view over the personality of some of our favorite characters. It made quite positive impression on me, as I believe it would make to anyone who looks a little bit under the floor. So, I will not tell anyone, who never played the games to stay away from it, after all it’s not a bad piece of drawing.~Read More at: http://animedeed.blogspot.com;Recommended
0;Samurai Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaden;manjifrankie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/manjifrankie;4;I had high expectations for Samurai Spirits 2 aka Samurai Shodown 2 being a super fan of the arcade games. Well, it just shows that a great story (as far as fighting video games is concerned) in the hands of the wrong people just turns into a pile of rubbish. I was not expecting Street Fighter quality, but something at least as Fatal Fury. It is equal or worse than Art of Fighting anime... I won't waste time describing what went wrong about this anime, because EVERYTHING is wrong. Avoid at all costs.;Not Recommended
0;Shin Kyouhaku 2 The Animation: Kizu ni Saku Hana Senketsu no Kurenai;iamKetranLang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamKetranLang;10;"Time for a hentai review. This hentai is Shin Kyouhaku 2, blackmail at its best and a fantastic hentai! I just wanna say I fapped hard. Saki was an awesome girl. She's really pretty, blonde, a good girl, and as her captors sexually called her, a ""strong-willed cunt""To put the story shortly, Saki is in love with her teacher. The teacher likes Saki too, but won't enter a lover relationship with her cause of their teacher-student relationship. Trouble comes when Saki is tricked into a love hotel by a person that looks like her teacher. Saki gets raped by him on film and is blackmailed to follow his demands or he would frame the teacher and ruin him. Turns out the blackmailer was actually the teacher's brother out for revenge! Pretty real and solid blackmail scenario if you ask me.The scene at end of episode 1 where her captors gangbang her in the hotel was extremely hot. So the brother first raped Saki and then he let her shower! When Saki came out of the shower, she saw two other captors setting up filming. She got forcefully tied by the two other captors and fucked. Those blowjobs were so hot! Saki's mouth was being fucked by the big dick, and the motion was a real forced mean blowjob all over. The captors gave Saki a lot of gangbang cum shots in the mouth, pussy, and anus. And the blackmail phone call was made as she was forced to talk to her teacher while being fucked. The music playing at that moment was pretty nice.In episode 2, her captors continues to embarrass and toy with Saki as they make her go to school with a big vibrator in her pussy, locked by a chastity belt. Humiliation and torment as the vibrator turns on Saki, but Saki can't cum cause of the belt and semen leaks. After school, there are more hot Saki scenes. One is when the captors force Saki to cum hard by teasing and stuffing her pussy with lots of egg vibrators. Then they do a nice boobjob scene with Saki lying on the bed and one of the captor on top using her boobs to his pleasure while the other captor fucks Saki in the pussy. After that there's a hot double penetration scene with big hard thrusts, Saki moans, and double cum shot! Near the end, you will witness something spectacular. The captors captures everyone! Saki, who was blackmailed to show up, Saki's sister and female friend who were worried for her and followed, and the teacher who the captors called in. They hit the teacher and forced him to watch Saki in a wedding dress and the two other girls get fucked as well. Heavy NTR vibes, but at least the brother let the teacher fuck Saki with him cause you know...they're brothers! One in the pussy, one in the ass XD The ending made me want to know what happened, but I suppose it was a fitting conclusion.I wish there is more of this hentai! This was adapted from a VN of the same name, and Pink Pineapple made it so much more pretty and hot! 10/10";Recommended
0;Shin Kyouhaku 2 The Animation: Kizu ni Saku Hana Senketsu no Kurenai;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;5;"Although the title is a little confusing, Shin Kyouhaku 2 is the supposed prequel of Kyouhaku Second. But really, you don’t need to watch it in any order because, surprise, there’s not much of a story. For those of you who like blackmail, coerced sex, bondage, gangbang, NTR, and rape. Congratulations, you’ve just landed you self a cheap cocktail of generic genres that’s been increasingly popular these days. It’ll give you that initial buzz you've been looking for, but leave you with a hangover which you'll regret later.STORY 6Story wise, Shin Kyouhaku is as generic as it comes. A blond ojousama has a secret relationship with her teacher. Then gets tricked, raped, and blackmailed into various humiliating sexual acts. Hooray~. Although there are some psychological mysterious aspects to unfold, there is not much of a plot. There are some novel dildo plays and proper bondage gangbang scenes if you’re into that, but most of the time one ends up thinking “God! Why is she so stupid?!” Well, I guess if there were no dumb blonds, there wouldn’t be any blackmail sexual scenarios.CHARACTER 5The bulk of the hentai revolves around Akehime, the blond hoity type. She’s confident, proud, and takes the initiative, at the beginning at least. Then she falls down a slippery slop of sexual victimization, almost too quickly. Like a sad little puppy, she conforms to what ever her blackmailer commands. Although, character design wise, she looks good, I find her character to be quite annoying, inconsistent, and not well thought out at all. There’s no development of her transforming at all. One moment she’s proud and arrogant, the next she’s a sex slave, which leaves for a very bland generic character. I guess my complaint is that you don’t really connect with the character enough to feel bad for her, there by lacking that disturbing arousal feeling you're suppose to feel with these hentai genres.ART/ANIMATION 6Art is pretty standard for hentai where as animation is average at best. Like I said, character design looks good. Proportions are a little big, but not overly done like some other titles (Rensa Byoutou). There are a lot of repeating frames that are cheaply done. It’s pretty substandard for a 2006 animation.SOUND 4The voice acting is good, however the sound FX are a bit off. Not that the timing is off, but rather the sounds that they choose didn’t really match. The watery sounds of the penis thrusting in and out of the womb sounded, well, too watery. It should be a little squishy and sticky sounding, not like a swimming pool. BG music fails to emphasize the scenes. I found the techno music is unsuitable.OVERALL ""Meh.""Think of Shin Kyouhaku as the cheap hooker that’s been around the block a bit too many times. If you’re new to the hentai scene, give it a try. It’ll give you a cheap thrill at the risk of contracting some STD’s, but you’ll probably never go back to it again.";Mixed Feelings
0;Doubutsu Takarajima;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;8;In 1958 Toei Animation came out with their first feature length film, Hakujaden. This film was such a big success that throughout the 60s and 70s they kept making a film like it every year. Generally these films tended to be high in production quality and in particular 1968’s Horus, Prince of the Sun wouldn’t be outshone as a sakuga showcase untill well into the 80s. Horus was a commercial failure, however, and Toei decided to change their business model and started making two films a year: one expensive and the other cheap. This change, together with the fact that a lot of talent working at Toei left around this time, led to the slow decline in quality of these films.Now, I'm telling all of this because I want to paint a picture of the anime industry in the 60s and 70s when Toei animation was still the big powerhouse of the industry. Anime hadn’t really become its own thing yet and when it wasn’t copying what foreign animation studio’s like Disney were doing, which is exactly what these Toei films generally try to do, then it could often be plainly amateurish. A lot of tv anime were cheap panel for panel recreations of the manga and besides summary movies that just used footage from the tv show, these yearly Toei films were basically all there was. Sometimes, however, something interesting popped up, that is worth remembering. I certainly don’t wish to push forth the idea that 60s and 70s anime isn’t worth your time, or that there weren’t tons of interesting creative figures in the anime industry who wanted to do cool stuff. What I do want to say is that anime around this time was on a leach. The people at Toei animation, in particular Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki felt strangled by this leach. Isao Takahata’s ‘Horus, Prince of the Sun’ was his attempt to get rid of that leach but it failed and just a few years later he and Miyazaki left for greener pastures. Just before Miyazaki left Toei completely, however, he created the manga, as well as the concept and a lot of the most impressive animation of the film Doubutsu Takarajima. This film is different from all the other Toei films, in that it is for a large part a passion project like Horus, but it is also extremely well suited for a large casual audience, like the dryer and more commercial Puss and Boots(1969) or most of the other Toei films. This is generally how Miyazaki’s entire career can be described.The start of the film introduces you to Jim and his friend who is a mouse with glasses (I wonder if Ganba no Bouken was influenced by this film) and a baby. Where Jim’s parents are I don’t know, but if something like that had bothered me I wouldn’t be recommending this film. A mysterious man enters the inn, that Jim is working at and not long after a bunch of pig guys storm the place and try to go after him, whilst Jim climbs onto the roof with the map that the mysterious man left him. These first moments of the film are immediately pretty striking. The first shot in the film is of the town they’re in and the background art for this is really stylish and beautiful. The scene in the inn, though it takes a minute to get going, gets pretty exciting and fun, whilst also creating a decent amount of suspense. Generally the entire anime consists of lots of fun action moments like that, mostly taking place on the pirate ship and it culminates in this awesome 20 minute climax.On his journey to get to treasure island Jim gets captured by pirates, meets a girl named Kathy and together with her fights these pirates, whilst also using them and their ship to get to treasure island. A lot of the film takes place on the ship and a lot of fun things happen when the pirates and Jim interact. The pirates try tons of things to try and get the map away from Jim and Kathy and Jim and his mouse friend pay them back with tons of hijinx of their own. The last 25 minutes or so of the film take place on treasure island and is almost completely full of action. It’s an epic back and forth between the captain and Jim and Kathy with tons of awesome animation by Hayao Miyazaki.The art in the film is pretty striking. Lots of the backgrounds look great, with the only exception being the backgrounds in the jungle on treasure island, that just don’t do it for me. The character designs are simple but decently memorable. Because of their simplicity they can be animated in lots of ways and you’ll constantly be seeing them doing fun and wacky stuff. There’s also lots of visual comedy, which is often done in the middle of action scenes and lives on the general fast pace of all the action in this film. There’s also some great animation in this film, with lots of great shots of fearsome waves, a few really cool action bits with tons of stuff happening on screen at once and of course lots of great action bits during the climax with great rock slides and destruction.If I haven’t conveyed it enough during my review I’ll just spell it out for you: this film is super fun and silly. There are parts where the film gets a little slow, but for the most part it’s constantly throwing fast action bits and silly comedy scenes your way and these always have a tendency of getting a little unrealistic. I think the best example of this is the sword fighting, which is never very well choreographed, but is lovably silly. The characters are basically just waving their swords around. There is even a moment in the film where Jim is fighting off several pig pirates and he has to hurry up to go and help Kathy, and so he decides to just start swinging his sword even faster. It didn’t work.The music is pretty fun and there are a few tracks that really added to the scene they were in. There are a few sing-songs, but luckily, unlike the singing in Puss and Boots, they didn’t get in the way of the film, even if they didn’t add anything to the narrative.Ultimately I think this film is a good watch for everyone who likes films that are just fun and not much else. It’s not always that: the first half is a bit slower than the second, but for the most part it’s a fun ride with lots of great action, animation and visual comedy and I’d recommend it to anyone who’s into that. Otherwise I can point you to the anime ‘Horus, prince of the Sun’, the other classic must watch Toei animation film, directed by Isao Takahata.;Recommended
1;Doubutsu Takarajima;Gundroog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gundroog;7;Animal Treasure Island turned out to be quite a nice little adventure, and for something made in 1971, it holds up really well.The story follows the rough outline of the original novel it's based on with obvious liberties taken around every corner. I haven't read the actual book but I've seen 3 or 4 different adaptations by now and it's been fun to spot the similarities along the way. The only major departure seems to be a boy meets girl element when Jim meets Kathy. Can't really complain about it cause it's added in quite naturally and their relationship is rather cute. This kind of stuff is also pretty common in anime when dealing with this type of story.The presentation is where this adaptation really shines though cause its relatively short runtime for a movie is chock full of various visual gags and action scenes. It's all not only creative, funny, and well-choreographed, the animation is excellent as well. There's really a lot of expression in how characters move and act, I think any animation fan would enjoy this for the craft alone.There's also some decent musical numbers peppered in throughout but I didn't find them quite as good as other parts of the movie. The only standout is a sequence where Jim and Kathy discuss what they'd do with a treasure and it culminates in a musical scene with pretty dreamy visuals where their imaginary ship floats through abstract backgrounds and places where they'd want to go.Overall it's a pretty easy recommendation for anyone who liked adventure stories, old anime, or animation. It's a great example of a movie that's obviously intended for a younger audience but can still be entertaining well outside that age group.;Recommended
0;Doubutsu Takarajima;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;6;Based on the popular classic young boys novel by Robert Stevenson, only with animals added! All of the characters (save two) are anthropomorphized, although it really doesn't mean anything with respect to the story itself (as in, the animal characteristics do not really play a role in how the characters act). It's really just to make the story a little more palatable to a wider (and a bit younger) audience.The story is pretty straight-forward. Young Jim Hawkins gets his hands on a treasure map, and heads out to sea in search of his fortune. He ends up on a pirate ship, where the captain tries to take the map and find the treasure himself. Along the way they run across Kathy, the granddaughter of the map's original creator. And the keep fighting as they make their way towards Treasure Island.Lots of swashbuckling fight scenes, but since this is aimed at a younger (pre-teen) audience there's no blood and many of the scenes are over-exaggerated for cartoony effect. Furthermore, the action/adventure fight scenes are then interspersed with more slapstick humor -- in fact, there's a bit too much of the slapstick overbalancing the action.The animation is very crisp and clean and well done, as Toei was really starting to come into its own at this time. They were still very much heavily under the shadow of Disney (as the storytelling and character designs reveal), but the more non-Disney anime elements were just starting to work their way in.Partly due to the influence of Hayao Miyazaki as key animator, it is very easy to spot his influences throughout. Not only in some of the character designs, but in some of the very well choreographed action scenes.Animal Treasure Island is a worthwhile watch, as long as you keep in mind that it's generally aimed at the 8-10 year old viewer. Also, as an English dub, it can be enjoyed by the young non-anime fan as well -- it still holds up almost half a century after it was created, worthy to be held up in comparison with any Disney movie of the era.;Mixed Feelings
0;Crazy for It;zLeSshuhn;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zLeSshuhn;8;"So here we are again with another review of Kubo Yuutarou's works..I am a fan of his works of art andThis is the time for ""Crazy for it""So I rewatched this a couple of times and I think I got the meaning behind it..unlike 00:08 this was a bit harder to findbut In the end I give it an 8 and now you're going to find why:Story and Art(Because like his other works the ""story"" is told with art,images and forms...or I must say in Yuutarou's case with over the limits and with extreme liberty of expression) I have to judge story and art together and in this case I give those an 8.5This is a short of 4 minutes telling the story of a man waking up every day and as he goes brushing his teeth we are suddenly transported in a very colored world with a very energetic music that follow our rideThe man every day as he wakes up he think about his limit in terms of creativity and he wants to pass then..he wants to fully express his art...he don't want any restriction in his daily routineYuutarou's works are all about creativity and themes surrounding itand In this case it is stronger than ever..I must say that if in 00:08 we have a soft but yet progressive creativity till becoming insane and disturbing creativity that is troubling and ""eating"" the man every day bringing it to madness because he has to constantly put out ideas..fresh and great ideas because he has restricted times..here we have a different approach..we have our protagonist thinking about his creativity in a ""light hearted way"" and he wants to improve what he's drawing..what he's animating everyday and to test different methods of art..to be sperimental..why? Because he wants the best out of his art..and every day he pushes is to the limits..Infactwe see a man running and constantly changing forms and colors..we have an interesting use of patterns and painting too..as we change background the techniques for drawing the running ""stickman"" are changing..and so does the camera shots.. those rotate everytime and the director tries to give us views from different places with different techniquesIn a general way though the short like his other works are done with these characteristics: Rough drawings and style that wants to put out a lot of things..speedy and dynamic camera that expand and give views from different places..In this case we have even changing backgrounds and a large use of colors..a wide amount of them..I just love those..we have like drawings done with blu pen or other pens..and that style it is awesomeWhat I love about this short is also the beginning with columns growing out of the ground..and Kubo's style in general to transform little things in bigger thingsBy little things you can reach bigger goals infactThe palette of colors is just so wide that I can't love this manPlus Animations and Art + Music/Sound: I give it a 8/9 the music is energetic and it fits perfectly what this short tries to convey to the viewer..as the man is every day putting out new and creative ideas..what I love about mixing the music and art in his style is that the art follows perfectly the rhythm and it deforms.One thing to say about the art is the amount of things Yuutarou put in different frames..like the end part...he puts a big amount of different things..like planets..the moon...toys....and they alternate perfectly, they replace the original forms that delineate the drawing of the man(this happens even in 00:08)It is a very energetic rock musicSPOILER AND INTERPRETING/+ SUMMARYSo our man everyday is constantly putting out new and fresh ideas and he pushes them to its limits..thinking about improving everyday..till he becomes crazy about his passion and keeps sperimenting..in his daily routineIt all started a day when suddenly an impulse appeared and you start to make your creativity explodeThe man that pushes to the limit can be interpreted in this way because he's not running in a normal way..his legs are pushed a lot forwardIn a certain point we have a use of patterns inside the stickman that he's running and not a normal stickman anymore because compared to the beginning of the short he isn't that thin..this represent the fact that he's improving and constantly trying to that..The only part that isn't convincing me for now is the one with the drawings of the girl..but anyway..everything is deforming a lot and I love itEnjoyment: I'm a huge fan of his works..and If you read all of this you probably already watched the short..but I should say that I enjoyed a lot this short..I give a 8/9 for thatBe sure to check out his other works..in particular 00:08Overall: I give it an 8 maybe 8.5...I love this approach to creativity..but I think I prefer the one in 00:08 because he has a bit more to offerSo if you want a very energetic short with pumped up music go for this and if you're willing to interprete it..go for it you want regret itThanks all of you that you are still reading this review..and please bear with me my inaccurate english..See you next review";Recommended
1;Crazy for It;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;8;Just like many of his very vague looking works, but with really deep meanings to them, this is yet another short by Yutaro Kubo, under the title of “Crazy for it”, just the name of the creator should be enough to build up an image on the visuals you're going to be getting, this is a special kind of shorts, where the viewer's attention is highly required, the art can serve as both eye candy, very entertaining and very relaxing to look at, but also is a dangerous distraction, you can't tell if it's done by purpos or not, but the catch and the moral of the story ought to be hidden and/or at least not easily caught on, that way, the viewer is rewarded for understanding the signs that not a lot of the viewers even noticed at the end of the short.- Story (7/10):This a story about redemption, about knowing what's like to fail but never giving in to failure, a story about hardships and overcoming them. It all starts when a male figure stars directing at you, knowing that the only thing that visually separates the both of you is a screen, which could also refer to as a mirror, in order words, you're looking at yourself, the author wants you to think of that person as yourself, he wants you to experience something relatable, something we all at some point or another went/will go through, the figure starts off by washing their face, indicating that they just woke up, then immediately gets ready to brush their teeth, as soon as they toothpast makes contact with their teeth, the visuals change completely, showing some abstracts of someone running towards something, the author wants you to think of it as you following a dream, running down the path of life so intensly acomanied by a heavy color swapping, which could indicate immotions, the figure would struggle time to time, collapsing and then standing back again to complete its run with nothing stopping it, filled with a lot of energy and compassion.At some point, tall structures begin to grow, with the figure voices them back and forth, those are the struggles that would stop one's dreams and pull them into depression, we see the figure's hand open up to the horizon, that could symbolize hope, and the nearby reward for a great effort, the figure continues running until we're back to the same guy brushing his teeth like nothing happened, now, was that all his imagination? Was he day-dreaming? Was he thinking about the distant goal? Maybe it was all about the journey of the toothpaste being rubbed on his teeth, no matter it was, our character has a life to live, he has dreams, he has things to look forward too, after all, we all do.- Art (9/10):The short consisted of multiple sketches, abstractly colored, there was often a change of the style in both the animation and art, the use of colors was very strong in some parts, but completely absent in others, they emphasized certain emotions perfectly, it was so amazing how a sudden change of style can really make something stand up from the others, like the human anatomy figures used in complicated dance poses.- Sound (7.5/10):Very fast paced, was suitable to the animation, it blended well with the motion and backgrounds, nothing major remarkable, it was amazing to see how multiple instruments were used to achieve a certain “hype” for few moments, like how the track started very simple, to only get complicated as the short progressed to only fade out at the end.- Character (8/10):The main protagonist, who feels like a teenage adult that gives you that relatable vibe about him, you can see how calm he is, casually doing is morning routine, till we enter his mind, where we see how he wildly thinks, and he pictures aspects of life, and how compassionate he is.- Enjoyment (8.5/10):What really brought me here is another of Yutaro Kubo works, “00:08”, another fantastic piece of art, my main satisfaction was with the relaxing feel of the visuals and music, the catch behind the short wasn't half bad either.- Overall (8/10):Yes, it is another of those “not-for-everyone” movies, I would recommend this to the more mature type of viewers, the ones that are looking for something realistic and relatable.;Recommended

3;Crazy for It;iridi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iridi;8;"To be clear, I don't quite know if this film is supposed to be telling a story or not; however, the amount of effort put into this is evident and the visuals are fantastic. They don't follow the music but they're fast paced, ebbing and flowing, covering a range of mediums including ink, pencil, pastel, and watercolor (plus possibly more that I couldn't differentiate). Everything is drawn by hand, frame by frame, in both black & white and in color. It's kind of amazing how well animated it is considering there are a lot of traditional animations out there that end up really disjointed looking even without switching between tons of different tools. I'm probably biased because I used to animate when I was a kid and have a soft spot for work-heavy pieces like this.The music was fine. Nothing special. It's the kind of vocal-less track you find in art films that doesn't stand out but isn't bad. It complimented the art in its own way.I don't know how much enjoyment someone could get out of this if they don't care much about animation/art and are just looking for a story (or music) so maybe skip it if you're not interested in the tools/mediums themselves.";Recommended

0;Xiang Ling Ji;Ayaa144;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ayaa144;8;One word to describe this whole show or that involves this whole show is revenge. No wait, who are you to judge others. That's what the whole show is about. I'm not the best at writing reviews, but will try with show in a few sentences. At first, thought this show was going to be a bit of a let down. Wasn't expecting too much. It was funny and a bit annoying in some episodes due to how the characters interacted with each other. Where you just wished the girl would learn her life lesson, the second, third, time etc. Anyway, first couple of episodes either you will love it or hate it, all of them involving exorcisms and death. It's no joke, that in almost every episode someone dies. However if you enjoy the first few 6 episodes, then you will definitely enjoy the rest. Love all the main characters, especially when we find out somewhat of their backstory, how they help or take revenge. Some of the characters stories are so tragic!!! Ending though was so unexpected, which I loved!!! (Though many would think differently) Overall, art, music, etc was okay. If you need a show to pass the time, with mini adventure and death, with an unexpected ending this is your show.;Recommended

Yes, I like to talk a lot and say my opinion in detail, hope you enjoy XD.[ENJOYMENT 7/10]This is the perfect show if you want to chill out a little bit. I watched it during my lunch breaks when writing my final dissertation and I felt both entertained and relaxed. It is a series that doesn't ask too much focus or thinking from its spectators.[TECHNICAL SIDE: SOUND AND ART]6/10 + 7/10: ENOUGH TO BE ENJOYABLE AND CHILLING, BUT NOT EXCEPTIONALThe opening and ending song are both absolutely enjoyable, though not memorable. I think the op gives a really chilling vibe that mirrors that average-but-pleasant work that this shows wants to be. The absence of a real soundtrack throughout the episodes makes me choose 6/10 as a mark for the sound design.From the artistic point of view, we have -again- an average result which can't be classified as beautiful or peculiar. Even if this is not high budget animation and special effects are minimal in respect to this kind of story, the fight scenes are enjoyable and the overall quality of the artwork is good, with detailed characters (in 70% of the scenes). Therefore, I give 7/10 to Art[CHARACTERS]6/10: COULD BE MORE INTERESTING; EVEN WHEN THE POTENTIAL IS PRESENT IT IS NOT DEVELOPED. SUPPORTING CH. ARE FUNNY AND FAIR, BUT NO DEPTH.The character design is quite simple, both on a physical and psychological level. Nevertheless, I loved the design of the main character and I think that men's cloths really suit her. Hua Jiu and Mu Chunyang are interesting as main character and main villain: they are nothing new, but still easy to sympathize with. On the other hand, I think it's a shame that other characters like the perv, dog/cat like -blondie Daoist, have little space and no background story. Qi Ye's story is shortly explained, but a one episode-tragedy and a heartbreaking death is not enough to make the public feel fond of the male co-star. For these reasons my vote is 6/10.[STORY]6/10: THE PLOT IS SIMILAR TO OTHER STORIES, BUT WITH A FEMALE LEAD THAT MAKES IT A BIT DIFFERENT AND WORTH WATCHING. THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CH. ARE FINE, SOMETIMES FUNNY. THE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS ARE: LACK OF EXPLANATIONS ABOUT THE POWERS OF THE CH. AND THEIR BACKGROUND STORIES; A REALLY UNEXPECTED BUT ALSO HORRIBLY-MANAGED FINALE.The show is about a female warrior, that wears men's cloths and travels around the world selling her abilities as an exorcist in exchange for money. In the first ep she encounters the spirit Qi Ye and forces him to be her servant. The 15 episodes have a fast pacing (sometimes too fast) and show their adventures killing bad spirits. In the 6th episode we also see the development of the real plot with the main villain, that will have its 'conclusion' in the finale. But here we need to use the brackets, because the real problem of this donghua is that is doesn't have a proper conclusion. Everything ends up in a cliffhanger that leaves you waiting for a never-coming season two. Years have passed and people still lament it. But, in my opinion the problem is not the cliffhanger itself: if you have seen Hannibal season 4, you know that a cliffhanger-finale can also be considered art and an ultimate expression of creativity that doesn't require anything else. Cliffhangers can have value when there is the need for a 'silent' ending that leaves space to the imagination of the public because everything that had to be said has been said already. This is not the case. Too many things have not been said. Too many things have not been shown and there is no foreshadowing that can set the right mood to lead to this conclusion.[SPOILER AHEAD]I am no writer or producer, but what I'm trying to say is this: cliffhangers are a powerful weapon, especially if you use them as a series finale. But you need to prepare everything in order to reach that moment. You have to make the public feel the tragedy coming. You can't show the mc dead for seven seconds and then an unexplained change of color in the hair of the male partner. That is no tragedy and no ending: the pace is completely wrong and it would be wrong even if there was a season two scheduled for the following year. That can work at least as the ending of a standard episode (and even in this case the pace of the scene is completely wrong). I think there could be little changes here and there that could prepare the audience to this final moment and make it a worthy ending to watch. For example, what is the reason behind the change of hair color? If someone had explained that it was a consequence of a state of absolute despair, linked to the acceptance of a demon to pursue vengeance renouncing to the chance of rebirth, then we could have interpreted the ending as the male lead becoming exactly what Mu Chunyang is. This would have led to the beginning of a new cycle of revenge, which would be perfect with the main message of the plot that you ""are no Law no God to decide who lives and who dies, who is right and who is wrong""-to quote Hua Jiu. It would have been a cliffhanger, yes, but the audience would have had the tools to reflect on it and think that the 'good guy' was about to become like the 'bad guy' and the entire process of murder-revenge would start again with an action always having consequences on others.[END OF SPOILER SECTION]Of course I made up my previous explanation of the finale, just to explain my position about this cliffhanger-conclusion.BUT if you really want to know how the story goes on, you can check the manhua fom here (chapter 47): https://ac.qq.com/ComicView/index/id/525535/cid/108?fromPrev=1 . It is in Chinese, but you can guess what happens. You can also see some of the amazing characters that appear later in the story and that the donghua has done major changes in the storyline. Unfortunately, the mannhua has also been interrupted in 2019 and I heard someone was doing a petition for season two (closing in August 2021) but they only had 400 participants/10, 000,000, so I don't think that's happening.[OVERALL: 6]To make it short: should you watch it? If you are stressed and want to relax with something you don't have to concentrate on, please go on. Except for the delusion of the finale, the show is pleasant and enjoyable, definitely a nice distraction.";Mixed Feelings

First you are lied to by the to be continued remark.As for character background it is done but is so bland/unspecific that it is a joke. Character's actions taken are not scary they are funny for they that predictable and fake looking.Sound is just as bad. The voice over which i think to have been done by the director himself is mediocre at best. Yes, you can follow along to what he is saying to some regard but it sounds like he is saying random non English words. The words you can make out are either doing an unneeded report or telling you confusing information. Not very helpful.

0;Umacha;Lolsebca;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lolsebca;8;Overall: 8Simplicity in the making, sure. It lasted a breeze, that's true. But even with its childish lightness, this animated entry manages to be exemplary. It's like the peak of frolic advertisement, and the eye candy is so all over the place, and the sounds altogether all so tuneful, you can't even want to zap.Story: 7In such a short time, it's difficult to tell much. The right choice, as Umacha shows us, is to cover lively snippets of the likely and believable. As the situations pictured focus on adulthood, it is clear who this advertisement is meant to cater to, and how the product sold may change one's life for the better, even for a bit.Art: 8Studio Ghibli's distinctive palette really shines, with its ethereal lightness, and simplistic characters. What the visual delicacy accomplishes, too, is conveying the flavor and mood of ice tea consumption. The second part's animation, accompanying a man's pace frame at a frame, doesn't offend. In fact, it carries the charm of the artificial that respects itself, not needlessly searching to hide the untruthful and the lying.Sound: 8Tuneful, as previously mentioned. Whether it describes the chirping one-liner, voiced by a young female, with all the significance it will bring to it, or the dubbed characters, hardly bold, or the man of the second part as he leaves a company meeting, where his voice actor gave him walking noises. The latter part felt charming, because of the lusting aspect it gave to the character, and what is weak is cute.Character: 7Your everyday people, a surrogate to its audience. This advertisement decided to keep things sturdy and there's not much to tell. Or perhaps not totally. If one gives it a thought, Japan has been a patriarchal country since a long while. So for the first woman to be shown in equality with her male fellow, able to possess a GPS, means this animated piece is aware of modernism and societal trends, which may or may not deserve commendation, but certainly brings credit and relatability to its characters.Enjoyment: 7In a flash, it was over. Nothing bold, nothing challenging the norms. And that's fine. Melodious, fast, intriguing, simple. It had clear goals, and the forwardness of their resolutions is worth its acknowledgement.To the average viewer, it may permit a glimpse as to what was two decades ago considered normal for the Japanese working class. But it's not all the entry may tell us. For someone specialized, it may very well become a textbook example of the economic activities of a Japanese animation studio. For example, they may be commissioned to advertise ice tea.;Recommended

0;Ni Tian Zhizun;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;7;"Against the Sky Supreme S1 Recap (Spoilers)Tan Yun was a god (they are called sky supreme in this series) that protected the inner universe from demons with his comrades. Unfortunately, few of his comrades betrayed him and colluded with the demons by setting them free in the inner universe and killing Tan Yun forcing him to reincarnate into his past self to exact revenge. Tang Yun has long been regarded as a trash or useless person in the Tan family which supposedly led to his family's downfall. However, with the knowledge of his past, Tan Yun prevents an assassination attempt on his parents with poison wine, cultivates and then slaughters the Wang and Liu families when they return a month later after Tan Yun's protection time is over. (the Liu and Wang family are two of the major families in Wangyue City) After this, Tan Yun decides to go to the Sacred Sect - an ancient sect with powerful backing - to gather information from his Wang and Liu family disciples. On the way, Tan casually slaughters the Mayor of Wangyue city's son and is crushed by a rock from his senior disciple, cultivates to Stage 1 level 9 and slaughters literally all the enemies chasing him, and has an affair with his wife-to-be.Story: 7/10Against the Sky Supreme is an ambitious cultivation donghua that ticks a lot of boxes that many other series are missing. It's been a long time since I've seen a competent, logical main character that doesn't leave traces behind. Throughout the story, Tan Yun is tempted to forgive his pursuers and time again we see him mercilessly kill them for revenge. In the first 7 episodes alone, he manages to kill two major family patriarchs and their families without a second thought and instead of waiting in Wangyue City for the powerful disciples to fight him, he goes into the Sect and cleans them up. The story is straight to the point and rational as expected of the decisions of a fallen god.Art & Sound: 6/10The art style and animation quality is pretty similar to your average donghua released in 2020/2021. They lack crowd control abilities and tend to use wide shots in fight scenes which show a lot of empty space or 4-5 characters in a single scene. I look forward to when crowd control animation isn't a problem so we can see crowd density which is lacking in many other Chinese CGI donghua.Sound is pretty average.Character: 6/10Tan Yun is too overpowered and it makes sense. As a fallen god, this series doesn't hide his abilities or boast it either; He reserves it for when he needs to fight against pursuers or people in his way of revenge. The character love interest is very controversial, Tan Yun went from wanting to politically marry into the Liu family to wanting to marry his mother's adopted daughter and finally wanting to marry his senior disciple. It makes sense since his memory from the event was wiped out but still highly controversial which other Chinese series don't really explore.The cultivation levels are unorthodox, it might just be translation but the cultivation level starts at Fetus spirit Level 1 - 9, then Fetus Soul Level 1 - 9. The spirit beasts also follow a similar cultivation level and Tan Yun's mount has an even more unorthodox ""2nd stage adult phase"" cultivation level system. It expects us to understand the hierarchy of cultivation levels from episode 1.Overall: 7/10I've got to keep an eye on this, not much plot has been revealed to us yet. I presume the series has 3 main arcs in the 60 episodes: The Liu & Wang Family destruction, The Sacred Sect Entry Exam & Life in the Sacred Sect and the Meteor Valley arc. If you haven't seen this, it definitely deserves a watch since MC doesn't dwell on small fry characters.";Recommended

0;Zero no Mono;the_seventh_l;https://myanimelist.net/profile/the_seventh_l;5;"Story:Basically, a guy with no name who attends college is obsessed with sex -- mainly, sex with women. He bumps into a preppy girl on the way home and winds up inside her apartment, when -- what else? -- sexy times commences. Only it's more kinky sexy times than anything else. And did I mention his snazzy pick up line? Throwing a jar full of semen at her. Nice. Between that and the ending which is all kinds of messed up, it warrants a 6/10. Story brings nothing original to the table, but it's not completely devoid of ideas.Art:Art is possibly the worst thing when it comes to Zero no Mono -- and for a hentai anime, poor art is a killer. The character designs are boring, the girls' bodies look rather the same with the exception that part of preppy girl's body has bandages on it. The guy looks like a filler-drawn version of Rex from Yu-Gi-Oh!, which detracts from any fapping experience you could have with this piece. Not to mention during some of the sex scenes, it becomes blindingly obvious the animators got lazy and just looped small parts of animation to make it look like they did more work that they did. Art gets a 4/10 -- at least they kept it consistently mediocre, right?Sound:Sound is pretty good. The voices for the characters, especially the main male's VA, sound rather fitting for their roles. The standard moans &amp; groans during sexy times are all right, nothing special. Background music is classic hentai soundtrack, complete with wailing sax and low-key piano. 7/10 is the sound, making it probably the highlight of the anime, technical-wise.Character:Everyone is rather cookie-cutter in terms of characters: there's the bored sex fiend, the preppy girl looking for kinky sex, the nonunderstanding teacher, the nameless couple having sex in a deserted area. Even the supposed plot twist of the true nature behind the preppy girl isn't very shocking seeing as she had acted that way since her first scene, but meh. At the very end, the main character seems to have a temporary change of heart -- is living only for sex a way to live? -- but savor it while you can, for it leaves as soon as it arrives. 5/10 for character.Enjoyment:I enjoyed myself watching this as much as anyone would, I suppose, except I couldn't stop thinking things like &quot;how can he stick his hand up that far without breaking something?&quot; -- in other words, there wasn't a proper suspension of belief to truly enjoy this anime. Not to say I hated it, it just seemed like I took more pauses than usual due to the plodding nature of the piece's pacing. 6/10 for enjoyment.Overall: It's a short OVA piece that isn't a total waste of space but has too many detractions to make it a quality piece of hentai -- namely, the animation and the characters. But the techniques executed during the sex scenes, not to mention the Jar O' Semen and the twist at the end, might be enough to warrant a watch purely for the lulz. In overall, I'd give it a 5/10, and suggest it only to those bored and looking for a truly mindless hentai or just oddly curious at the basic idea behind Zero no Mono.Also, throwing your own semen at a random girl on the street = worse way to pick up chicks ever.";Mixed Feelings
0;Zero no Mono;Etoile_sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Etoile_sama;3;"I watched this hentai awhile back, but I can always remember it as being the worst one I've ever watched.Put shortly, it sucked.Sitting there watching it, I could not even believe that something could suck so much. You'd think they'd make up for the crappy story by AT LEAST having nice art and graphics, but there really aren't any redeeming qualities about it. Actually, it could have been a vice-versa, they could have made the story better if they knew the art wasn't going to be the best, but if they did, I would not be insulting it in this way.The characters are just plain idiotic. Nothing about them made them the slightlest bit likeable. In a sense, they were just outright deranged. The main character was a piece of shit pervert wannabe rapist (no surprise there) and he runs across an equally perverted sadistic girl who actually tries to make herself seem like a masochist, when in fact she's just a conniving bitch who tricks the main character. In a sense, it's like a just deserts for the main character, since he is in fact a major douche, but seriously, that ""major"" twist at the end wasn't even enough to make up for the terrible plot.I was really waiting for the moment that it would maybe get better. Admittedly, I went in knowing it wouldn't be the best, but I did not think my expectations would be disappointed so terribly. The description here actually gives it hope for being somewhat interesting, and I will give it that the whole idea of throwing cum at a girl and having it work out in your favor was an odd, but interesting component, but it really wasn't enough to pull it out of the steaming pile of shit it had landed on.Really, watch this if you want a few laughs, 'cause I can admit to chuckling a bit at how outrageously terrible it was.

I only knew this production was based on a manga, that there is another version of the series that has never been translated into English, and that this OVA was cut for a western release. I must say it does end quite abruptly and absurdly.The plot progresses quite smoothly and quickly, but not too hastily. Details concerning warfare, politics and technical details seemed accurate enough. However, when it is time to contemplate the essence of war, Silent Service fails to deliver. Character development is nonexistent. A lot of things are conveniently explained through the Japanese culture's traditional, ingrained views on honour. It also wants to criticize the USA for acting as a ""world police"", but doesn't really offer much insight into why this is a good or a bad thing, other than countries and cultures having the right to arm themselves in return. Sometimes the role and motives of Japan and USA start to shift, merge or switch places, but whether or not this was intentional in the narrative, I couldn't tell.The duration of this OVA was approximately 90 minutes, and it was a reasonably interesting glimpse into 90's animation as well as the attitudes towards nuclear technology and world politics in the 1980s.";Mixed Feelings

When she gets into the elevator, the woman presses for floor nine. It is only one floor away from the maximum amount of floors this elevator can carry her. This is outrageously inconsiderate of her sense she doesn't say a word and acts as if it is normal for the elevator to do a human's bidding.The elevator doors are closing... but abnormity strikes as Chicken Papa (a human sized chicken) walks into the elevator and politely says he gets off on floor ten. The woman presses the button, of course, but immediately looks away from Chicken Papa. She doesn't want to admit to her sins of pushing around technology. The scene also foreshadows a later part of this masterpiece.Chicken Papa comments on the fact that she probably ate garlic chicken the other day. The woman immediately tries to act as if she never heard what he said by saying ""pardon"", but Chicken Papa knows she heard. She then apologizes quickly to him and looks back into the corner of the elevator as before. She is ashamed of herself, for she has been confronted by the very thing she thought was supposed to be doing as she would like. There is a moments silence...Chicken Papa begins to cluck rapidly and the screen fades to white. This part is up for interpretation.

Despite talking to a being who is Chicken Papa's de facto mortal enemy, Chicken Papa remains calm and his manners don't budge an inch during the conversation. Chicken Papa is a being so noble, so righteous, and so virtuous, one could only compare him to God himself. A character with depth that exceeds anything you will ever find in the world of anime.

0;Watanuki-san Chi no;cuteisanarchy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cuteisanarchy;7;"Watanuki-san chi no is the second major TV debut for VTubers, the first being the variety show Virtual-san wa Miteiru by the short lived Studio Lide. Virtual-san was a good first try which faced criticism for its animation, meta humor and uneven comedy, but how does this second attempt fair?One major difference that will likely spare Watanuki-san some of the trials of its predecessor is the fact that it hasn't been labeled as an anime. While the difference is somewhat trivial and has more to do with marketing than anything else, Watanuki-san is a true sitcom with more in common with its live-action cohorts than its predecessor (laugh track included). Its stars are VTubers, but they're acting the roles of characters, and the show lacks the meta-humor and inside jokes that led people to throw at Virtual-san the dread accusation of pandering. The animation has also taken a step up, with its warm tones and relatively fluid motions a far cry from the rather sterile environments of Virtual-san.In other words, it couldn't get any further from Virtual-san - it even has a segment at the end of the first episode explaining who VTubers are and stating their intent of reaching a wider audience. And while this show indeed expands upon the breadth of what VTubers are showing themselves to be capable of, how enjoyable that actually is will depend on how much you a) enjoy mundane subject matter and/or b) enjoy the VTubers acting in the show outside of their normal environments.With regards to the subject matter, Watanuki-san is a ""slice of life"" show with the qualification that this carries none of the usual connotations that term carries in the anime community. The visual cues, jokes, and banter could just as easily have taken place in a live-action sitcom. Episodes are alternately comedic and touching and often both as the show follows the lives of three sisters in the wake of their father's death as one prepares to move out after marriage. Its strength is in portraying these intimate moments, hinting at the depth of the characters and their relationships. How funny you find it will of course depend, but I'd say the writing is more hit than miss though the limited cast and setting - the entire show consists of three on-stage characters in a single (rather large) room - may feel a bit claustrophobic at times.As for enjoying the cast, the show requires no familiarity to enjoy them, but fans should enjoy seeing VTubers building their acting muscles with something more serious than usual fare. Tokino Sora deserves special recognition here for her performance as the eldest sister, and it's great to see her star continue to rise. Any shakiness in their performances can be attributed to lack of experience that fans will find all the more endearing. The after recording interviews with the cast following the episodes are also a treat as you get their reactions and banter with the writers.Also to be enjoyed is the animation quality, which is some of the best I've seen involving VTubers. The soft lighting especially gives a feeling of warmth and intimacy that enhances the already pleasant nature of the sketches. This of course has its flaws - the sometimes awkward motions of actors due to motion tracking issues as well as some of the details on their bodies (for example, hair highlights indicating lighting that don't shift when they move) can be distracting, but these are minor issues which stand out mostly because of the already high quality of everything else.As a drama and as another feature starring VTubers I'd call Watanuki-san a success. Though this isn't what I usually come to VTubers for and wouldn't be particularly excited for the future of VTubers to be sitcoms, it's decently entertaining and gives us another venue in which to enjoy them.";Recommended
1;Watanuki-san Chi no;fieldsgrow2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fieldsgrow2;8;Recommended for slice of life fans looking for something different.Essentially this show is a fairly low budget/uneven quality sitcom presented with 3D anime vtubers instead of real life people. The whole show takes place in one room and the 3D has some issues. Character's mouths move out of sync with what they're saying (minor), hair sometimes clips in and out of clothes (minor), character models sometimes move in ways real people shouldn't (minor), camera work is amateur (moderate), and the aliasing on Futaba's horribly chosen black and white striped shirt looks awful every time she moves (major). I feel the frame rate could have been higher too but it's hard to say whether that would have made an improvement or not. A lot of this stuff could have been fixed if they did some post processing over to top to correct it but I understand they were likely limited on budget and time. It's definitely better than the 3D we've seen from vtubers before and it's far from unwatchable, but as a professional show it feels like watching a low budget version of the future. Credit is due for the soft lighting, it makes the show feel warm and plays an extremely important role in stopping the visuals from looking sterile and soulless as common of CGI. The 3D modelling of the set is crisp and overall well done. The problem is the whole show happens in one room and feels a bit cramped especially towards the end.But the main reason why I think this show is worth a watch is because it has something that I think has been lacking in a lot of slice of life anime recently. Something like SOUL or CHARM. The whole show is filled with it and you can feel the fun the actresses are having on set through their amateur acting and slightly off 3D models. This is the first time any of them had done any acting, it shows, but it feels like they fully embraced the opportunity as a welcome change from sitting on the computer streaming video games. The 3D graphic flaws and warm lighting help with the charm on the visual side too and it's really refreshing watching a slice of life with visuals like this as a change from normal anime.It has very cliched sitcom writing with a mixture of comedic and touching moments similar to countless sitcoms that have come before it. The touching moments do well in bringing out the charm and chemistry of the three sisters but the comedic moments are hit or miss with the two stand-up episodes being the worst in the show. There's a distinct Japanese flavour to the writing too that's somewhat different to other anime. There's references to Japanese authors, bands, celebrities etc, but also to social customs, current affairs, language nuances, and all sorts of other minor stuff that might add a very specific sort of appeal for some people. Maybe it would be tiring for regular viewers of Japanese live action but it does stand out a bit from both slice of life anime and American sitcoms.Sound wise the show is fine except for a bad laugh track. Fortunately they seem to have removed it for the second season and Futaba's awful black and white shirt has been changed too. There's also more characters and scenes set outside the Watanuki sisters' one room.Sadly it doesn't look like this will get English subs anytime soon so it's limited to people with an understanding of Japanese. If you are one of these people and like slice of life, you may be in for a nice surprise and a welcome change of pace. I don't see myself becoming a devoted fan of these shows if they become more common in the future but this one is a nice novelty and it's a novelty done well enough for me to watch season two. Realistically it probably deserves a lower score but overall my enjoyment of it is around 7.5. It grew on me a lot after being relatively underwhelmed by the first episode and I think it deserves points for feeling new.;Recommended

Cause as average anime watchers, we can't be expected to have the intelligence to remember what happened in the past few episodes. I'm glad that this studio understands how stupid I am and took the time to make an episode reminding me.On a serious note, I will never understand the need for recaps on a series that has only 12 episodes. This anime isn't complicated and the plot is pretty simple.

0;Future War 198X-nen;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;9;"I will be reviewing the Australian release of this obscure as heck anime.Story: This is one of the most unique anime ever made. Few, in fact, practically no other anime can claim to depict conventional modern warfare as faithfully as this anime has. No aliens, no overpowered mecha suits, no ancient interdimensional vampires etc. Just war! One side of its story is a geopolitical thriller about WW3 and the escalation of nuclear warfare. It captures the general essence of anti war cold war era movies like Strangelove, Fail Safe, Wargames etc. which in itself is an admirable feat for an anime. Equally unique IS the dub; it features solely one person as the narrator, giving the film a docudrama feel that works well with the main, geopolitical storyline. The other storyline is a romance focusing on a scientist (Japanese in the original version, white in the dubbed one) who works on the SDI inspired missile defence system and one of his coworkers. Obviously, the narrator only approach means no dialogue, totally destroying the immersion or meaning of these scenes though I doubt the original romance plot was good either! 8 for the unique anime depiction of nuclear warfare.Art: Artstyle is appropiately realistic and more western looking. Research was done well and period accurate military vehicles are depicted faithfully.The animation itself is horribly subpar for an anime film, even for the early 80s. The anime tends to be too dark, meaning things become a horrible blur. The poor video quality this anime was released in doesn't help either. 5 its pretty bad.Edit: anime looks much better if you can find a higher quality version. The more realistic artstyle really shines. 8/10.Sound: The original version had a standard orchestral film score. But as for the musical choices in the dubbed version? Period accurate rock music featuring Asia's Sole Survivor, Wildest Dreams, Only Time Will Telland Rush's Witch Hunt! (in shitty quality but...) NICE! Tangerine Dream is also used as background music. 10 I've never heard rock music of this calibre being used for an anime.Character: The narrator only approach screws up any characterisation that the original may have had. However, the reactions of the various military personnel to the war such as the warmongering Soviet secretary of defences villainous coup of the Soviet government, the American President's decision to not launch a retaliatory strike and the Soviet sub commanders deliberation on whether to launch nuclear missiles or not are very powerful scenes based on the sheer gravity of the situation. 6 Their actions manage to speak for themselves and give some semblance of characterisation.Enjoyment/overall: This is actually one of the HANDFUL of anime about WW3/ conventional, modern warfare that doesnt feature any far fetched sci fi or fantasy elements. If you are in this niche audience like I am this anime will be worth a watch and rather entertaining despite the crazy limitations of having one voice actor and the horrible animation. For those war nerds out there; there are some military hardware featured in this anime that you just wont seen in any other anime; what other anime could possibly feature Panavia Tornados or Gepard Flakpanzers?";Recommended
1;Future War 198X-nen;Arboria;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arboria;7;"Politics and warfare from multiple perspectives is already somewhat uncommon in anime. Just that set in the real world is even less common, and adds an interesting layer of entertainment especially if you have an interest in history and geopolitics. This film delivers well for people that enjoy war and politics. Cold war, explosions, nukes, space lasers. Also if you're someone that's interested in military craft this series definitely looks like it was given a lot of care from people who are very enthusiastic about historical aircraft and ships and things of that nature. You could almost say it has ""fan service"" for fighter jets.The romantic subplot stole from the movie in my opinion, it wasn't really necessary and didn't make it any more entertaining. I also couldn't find a quality copy of it, the copy I watched was downright dreadful in clarity. Could barely see what was going on in some action scenes. Suppose it's better than being ""lost"" material like the Xevious film. I also have some qualms with its morals though my opinions here are probably unpopular. Definitely worth a watch though, more-so than most anime films I've seen.";Recommended
0;Future War 198X-nen;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;6;"If I watched this at the time it came out (1982), it would have scared the crap out of me, and I would have been obsessed with it for weeks after.Many people today may not really understand what this movie means, but for anyone who lived during the height of the Cold War, this really rings true. The level or fear and anxiety was palpable, and omnipresent -- it's not so much a question of ""if"" WW3 breaks out and the world is thrown into nuclear winter, it was really a question of ""when"". We all watched the clock clicking a few minutes to midnight, and the media was sprinkled with gloom and doom scenarios just like this.The ""X"" in the title indicates this war takes place in the near future of the late 1980's, and imagines if the technology of ""Star Wars"" laser intercept systems envisioned by Ronny Raygun became a reality. The names of people are fictional, but everything else is very real - the places, the positions, the military equipment, the procedures. They really did their homework.There are no character voice-actors in this movie, it's all presented with a background orchestral soundtrack (and occasional rock ballad), sound effects, and a voice-over narration of the main character, explaining everything in deadpan delivery. The first part of the movie puts all the chess pieces into play, giving a detailed breakdown on where all the characters in this drama are, what they are doing, and what is happening.Then, small events turn into larger events. Misunderstandings lead to bigger misunderstandings. Mistakes lead to death, jealousy and hatred turn to more death, powerful men back-stab into even more death. World events spin out of control, and soon the entire world is thrown into war.And what is scary, is that it paints a VERY PLAUSIBLE scenario. The paranoia and distrust you see between the Soviets and the Americans was very real; the political in-fighting inside the Kremlin was also very real. Even if the authors could not predict the fall of the Soviet Union and West/East Germany, replace those players in this 'game' with other players, and it could have played out just as easily. As the movie progressed to the halfway point, I started to get chills and a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach as the worst-case scenario was playing out, and no one could stop it.Well. Almost.I won't spoil it, but about three-quarters of the way through, there's a shift in the movie, and suddenly there's that ""one chance"" of a Jack Ryan-type character saving the world, and it becomes less of a docu-drama and turns into a cinematic-action-thriller. The movie sort of goes off the rails of realism at that point (otherwise I would have given it a higher rating).Artwork and animation are perfunctory and unimpressive, with the notable exception that they made sure they got all the military hardware correct. But the point of this chilling movie is not about the artwork, it's about the scenario it paints. And for people of a certain age (like me) who lived through the latter part of the Cold War, it really hits home.And it can also serve as a warning for today. The world is a different place than it was half a lifetime ago, and some of the players are different. But history has a nasty habit of foretelling the future, and we aren't too far off from a possible hell scenario like this today.";Mixed Feelings
1;Future War 198X-nen;Findog;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Findog;7;I couldn't believe my eyes when I found out that Toei Animation has made an anime about WW3! But yeah, it was true. And if you think this movie shows that war is cool, you're totally wrong. This is one of the most unique and realistic anime I've ever seen!In the beginning, we see the happy life of normal people for a while, until it finally turns into a nightmare when a global war breaks out. And since this is a realistic anime, there are no superheroes or other such characters to save the day. So all the suffering and despair feels very real and the viewer can relate to it. This movie was made during the Cold War, so it must have seemed even more real back then, that's why they tried to refuse to make it. But even now this felt frighteningly real. There was a bit of romance, but that part felt pretty unnecessary and didn't improve the depressing atmosphere at all. I won't mention how this movie ends, but at least I felt a little empty after seeing many people died. You can decide for yourself whether it's happy or not.Tomoharu Katsumata was one of the directors (who has directed Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin for example) and musics were made by Seiji Yokoyama, which is very well known from the musics of Saint Seiya, Captain Harlock and that infamous Toei's Dracula movie, so soundtrack is very good! The movie's not very-anime drawing style also suited it very well.Overall I give 7 for this movie because it was really impressive and the animation and music worked well. Otherwise, this felt a bit too realistic and political for me and gave unpleasant feeling which I don't usually expect from the anime I watch...;Mixed Feelings
0;Takane no Jitensha;Archaeon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Archaeon;6;"It sometimes surprises me just how much anime as a medium affects Japanese society, in particular in areas of creative development. There was a time, both in Japan and the West, when working on anime/cartoons and manga/comics wasn't classed as real ""work"". Oh, how times have changed, and part of the reason for that change is the fact that both anime and manga have a great degree of industry recognition. Granted this recognition is specific to Japan for the moment, however both mediums are steadily increasing their presence overseas, Spirited Away winning an Oscar being symptomatic of this change.One of the awards given in Japan has only been around since 2002. Being a fairly recent addition, one would think that such an award would hold little meaning for established mangaka, scriptwriters, animators, etc, however this is an incorrect assumption. The award in question is given as part of the Animax Taisho, a scriptwriting competition organised and run by the satellite TV network Animax. The competition is open to all comers, however the sixth year it ran it changed, opening itself not only to Japanese viewers, but to audiences worldwide through Animax's broadcast networks. The winners of the award will see their script/screenplay turned into an anime by an established producer (think Sunrise, Toei, Production I.G., etc).Why am I boring you with this information you may ask? Well, it has a point as the winner of the sixth Animax Taisho award was a screenplay written by Takamaga Hayato, who until then was completely unknown in either anime or manga. His screenplay, entitled ""Takane no Jitensha"", told the story of 11 year old Takamusi Takane, a boy whose mother has promised him a new bycicle provided he can rank in the top 100 on his school tests. Unfortunately, Takane places 112th, so he tears up the results and lies to his mother. It's then that his little sister becomes involved in proceedings, and Takane must decide which is more important, his new bike or his sister.At first glance the story is intruiging, especially as it injects some supernatural elements which the main character is unable to deal with. Like most things though, Takane no Jitensha is much better on paper...Given that this is essentially a leg up for an unknown, A-1 Pictures have actually done a decent job with the animation and design. Like any studio though, animating the winning screenplay from the Animax Taisho plays second fiddle to their own projects, and it shows. There are definite areas where the animation isn't quite up to scratch, and although this doesn't really affect the overall enjoyment of the OVA, it is somewhat distracting. The design is pretty standard fare on the whole, with nothing new or groundbreaking displayed in the backgrounds, settings or characters. Everything looks pretty normal, which is how it's supposed to ironically enough. By not putting in 100%, A-1 Pictures have given the show a feeling of normality that is more than a little surprising.Unfortunately, the anime is let down somewhat in the sound department, especially the music which sometimes feels ""out of sync"" with the animation. The effects also suffer from this problem, however it is more noticeable with the music. The other problem with the music is that it often doesn't quite reflect the mood of the scene, but aside from these problems there isn't really much to complain about.The voice acting is a big plus for the anime though, as the role of Takane was given over to Sakamoto Maaya, a name that fans of Escaflowne, Kara no Kyoukai and Diebuster should be familiar with. Her experience in the lead role is telling, as it gives the character of Takane far more personality than the story initially allows for. The other seiyuu are pretty good for the most part, however Sakamoto pretty much steals the show.Takane no Jitensha, like almost every other single episode OVA in existence, has a big problem in terms of characters, in particular characterisation and development. Like all the others, this OVA has made exactly the same mistake in that a weak character is expected to develop over the course of one episode due to some major event in his/her life. The few that actually manage to achieve this feat have all done so by providing an extremely strong characterisation, or an almost complete character, right from the start. In Takane no Jitensha however, the lead is an 11 year old boy, and while it is true that presenting a complete character may be unbelievable in this case, providing a strong characterisation is always possible no matter the age.I was actually surprised to find that I did actually enjoy this to a degree. The story reminded me somewhat of Mokke in it's approach to spirits and otherwordly beings and their relationship with humans. Whilst it lacks Mokke's charm, it does make up for it a little by being original in it's plot. After all, how many of us wanted a bike more than we wanted our younger siblings, especially when we were 11. Whilst the supernatural element adds an unbelievability to the story, the core of the plot, a boy wanting a bike and seeing his little sister as an annoyance, is more than probable.On the whole, this is worth watching if you like supernatural anime, or you like to keep an eye out for potential new talent in anime.I watched this for the former reason, however I'll be checking out the other Animax Taisho winners as whilst Takane no Jitensha does have it's problems, it also has potential.Hopefully the other titles will showcase the same creativity as this.";Mixed Feelings

Nanika Okashii!... or as majority of the ero-anime community refers to it as ""Blizzard Entertainment: The Animation"" is not that good, here's why!The story:Kono Kaisha is an anime about women that work in an office building getting sexually harassed by their male co-workers. The premise is extremely simple and all of the sexual encounters happen while the girls are working on typical mundane office chores like fixing the lights or typing an email on a PC. They attempt to make some of the characters in the show interesting by making one of the girls an erotic cosplayer and another one enjoy watching the sexual harassment but it just doesn't work.The art/animation:The art in this is some of the best art in modern hentai as it doesn't have the same ""smudging"" problems that a lot of modern hentai fall victim to. The animation is alright, some of it is just characters sliding but most of it is pretty decent and isn't really anything to complain about.Sound:The voice actors and actresses did their jobs and it sounds good, the sound effects are pretty nice and even the soundtrack is good, I don't really have much of a problem with the audio.Overall:Kono Kaisha is BOMB! CUTE! BOMB! (previously known as Selfish)'s newest production and it follows a typical trend with a lot of their productions, great animation but pretty poor storylines. I would usually give more info on who directed it and who did the character designs but sadly none of that info is on English speaking sites and I wasn't able to find any of that info on their Twitter (as a side note: they also don't have credits at the end of the episode). While I don't think this show is brilliant, or for that matter even good, I still enjoy BOMB! CUTE! BOMB!'s productions and I am excited to see what they put out next.

0;Fairy Forest Remi-chan;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;3;This is one of those hentai that just feels old and has dated really badly over the years.The story is really bland, the main character got dumped by his girlfriend and went on a hike afterwards. While on the hike he runs into a trapped girl on a tree, which he then proceeds to rape and abuse for the majority of the episode. One positive note about the story is at least the guy gets whats coming to him at the end.Outside the slightly below average art on the main characters, the art is awful. The background is just painted still with obvious overlays of anything that moves or is acted upon (think old scooby doo where you could tell which book was going to be grabbed, but worse). There are even scenes where the background is just a color shade or pattern and comes off as just lazy.The sound is also really bad has the audio had multiple clipping issues and just bad quality from the recording. Even for people that usually don't care much if the sound is mediocre or high quality will instantly notice the white noise constantly in the background and other audio issues.Their is only two characters worth mentioning, the main girl/rape victim and the main guy. The girl is okay, but a little on the annoying side with her constant whining(that starts even before the rape) in her high pitch voice. The main guy becomes a real sleazebag real quick and makes the hentai so much worse and ruins any kind of enjoyment you could get out of it.I found this really hard to enjoy because its basically one long rape session that does somethings that instantly ruin the enjoyment I could possibly scrape from this. One scene in particular where he is making the girl masturbate with a branch the was found on the ground (ouch, serious splinter pain) and then proceeds to punt the branch up her vagina. If it was even somewhat realistic the girl would have probably bleed to death right there, and I don't understand how anyone could get off to that.Overall, this hentai is a hard pass on any kind of recommendation.

You cannot have some drawn out character development or amazing world building. So why not just have some fun and go for the easy wins. Go cute girls with ecchi moments, guns, and simple humor. And tada, you have Katsugeki Shoujo Tanteidan.This is a mid show that is very light. Play it for some background noise while you do dishes or something. Good for a few cheap laughs and ecchi moments.;Mixed Feelings
0;Katsugeki Shoujo Tanteidan;Thedude3445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thedude3445;4;Horrible title. There is almost no detectiving going on here, and they are hardly a club. They are girls, though.This OVA sucks, kind of like a store brand version of Project A-ko, complete with an obsessive lesbian (literally attaching herself to the main girl at nearly all times) and overly goofy action.Really, it's got its moments, but the animation is terrible, and it's simultaneously too long for how thin the story and characters are, and too short for how its silly mystery action plot needed to be. Kind of the case for a lot of these 80s/90s anime OVAs.;Not Recommended
1;Katsugeki Shoujo Tanteidan;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;3;"Esta review también está en español.Katsugeki Shoujo Tanteidan (KST from now on) is a veeeeery long 30 min OVA, created in the mid eighties by TMS. In this OVA they didn't aim for greatness, that's for sure. Just to begin with, KST can be translated as ""Girl Detective Club""... and I can think of two things wrong with that title: there is no club, nor detectives. But don't worry, there are girls...The... hmmm... story, I suppose, shows us Yuriko, Midori and Shizuka, three friends that study (and live) in Katrina, one of those typical ginormous and rich academies... But the wealth wasn't enough for the chairman, so he sends three members of the student council (all female, by the way, since this is a girls only school... see? the title was very precise in that regard) to kidnap Midori! What is the dark secret behind this exaggerated crime? That's what Yuriko and Shizuka have to find out.So, there is some kind of mystery, right? Balls, no. Maybe since her surname was Edogawa, Yuriko though she was Conan... Anyways, the battle between these girls has almost nothing intellectual and lots of awful action. The fights between the school staff and the duo include various types of conventional firearms, tactic gear in the same line of SWAT, and advanced war vehicles (well, advanced for 1986). All of this would augur a confrontation that will made Battle Royal looks like Heidi, but sadly, the result is the same as those in old American shows: lots of shots, explosion and destruction, but not a single casualty...... and that's because this is a comedy. That would change everything, if only remotely funny. But no. The characters try to be cute and happy go lucky, but they're closer from stupidity than being comic. Everything in this OVA is stupid, insufferable and boring. But who needs something as argument, humor or grace when you have one yuri scene? *facepalm*The animation is mediocre at best. A bit primitive, and the character designs is pretty standard... but its bearable in general. The sound is not bad, even if the dialogues are bland, the intonation is good. There are three main seiyus, being Yuriko Yamamoto Yuriko (also, Yuria in Hokuto no Ken and Marin in Saint Seiya), Isono Tarako is Midori (Senritsu in the original Hunter x Hunter) and Masako Miura is Shizuka (no relevant roles besides this one... and that's kind of sad). The three girls sing the opening song, and even if it's extremely corny, cheesy and everything, is pretty... ok.So, summing up: project with no ambition or originality, stupid characters, shoddy action, zero humor, poor fan service and visually mediocre. I can't think of any redeemable thing of this project, is just one of those terrible OVA lost in the past. I'm not saying that this is the worst thing ever, but at least Mars of Destruction was amusing (for all the wrong reasons, but amusing). I can only recommend this to... I don't know, curious people? Oh, and also for those who like to see short OVAS to verify if they are as bad as people says (you know who you are).--------Katsugeki Shoujo Tanteidan (KST) es una OVA de extensos 30 minutos, creada a mediados de los 80 por TMS. En este OVA no se apunto a la grandeza, y eso se nota a kilómetros. De movida, KST se puede traducir como “Club de chicas detectives”… y, por lo menos, hay dos grandes mentiras en ese título (cortesía de Nelson): no hay ni club, ni detectives. Pero no se preocupen, hay chicas…La… “historia” seria decir mucho… la puesta de escena de esta cosa nos muestra a Yuriko, Midori y a Shizuka, tres amigas que estudian (y viven) juntas en la academia Katrina, una de esas típicas secundarias monstruosamente gigantes y ricas… Pero como parece que no tenía suficiente, el director de la escuela envía a tres miembros del consejo estudiantil (todas chicas, porque, después de todo, es una secundaria femenina… bueno, en esto el titulo es exacto) a que secuestre a Midori! Cuál es el oscuro secreto que esconde este exagerado delito? Es lo que Shizuka y Yuri deberán averiguar.Muy bien, pero entonces sí que hay algo así como un misterio, verdad? Por Dios, no. Capaz que como su apellido es Edogawa, Yuriko se pensaba que era Conan… Como sea, la batalla entre estas chicas tiene poco de intelectual y mucho de acción de pésima calidad. Los enfrentamientos entre personal escolar y el dúo de protagonistas incluyen varios tipos de armas de fuego convencionales, equipo táctico onda SWAT y vehículos de guerra avanzadísimos (al menos, para 1986). Todo esto auguraría un enfrentamiento que haría a Battle Royal parecer Heidi, pero tristemente, el resultado es el mismo que el de las sitcoms americanas de los años 80: un montón de tiros, explosiones y destrucción, pero ni un herido…… y eso es porque estos es una comedia. Eso lo cambiaria todo, si al menos causara un mínimo de gracia. Pero no. Los personajes le meten onda, pero en el espectro de la estupidez, están más del lado molesto que el de afables. Absolutamente todo en esta OVA es estúpido, insufrible, aburrido. Pero quien necesita algo como argumento o gracia cuando tenemos una escena yuri, verdad? *facepalm*El apartado técnico es mediocre en el mejor de los casos. La animación es un poco primitiva, y el diseño de personajes es bastante estándar, pero no son terribles (creo que es el más grande halago que escribí e esta review). El sonido no está mal, aunque los diálogos son sosos, están bien entonados. Las tres seiyus principales son Yuriko Yamamoto, como Yuriko (también Yuria en Hokuno no Ken y Marin en Saint Seiya), Isono Tarako es Midori (Senritsu en Hunter x Hunter) y Masako Miura es Shizuka (ningún otro rol que merezca la pena mencionar…). Las tres protagonistas cantan el opening, que si bien es inimaginablemente cursi, esta... correcto.Entonces, resumiendo: proyecto sin ninguna ambición aparente, personajes estúpidos, acción de pésima calidad, cero humor, fan-service deficiente, técnicamente mediocre. No se me ocurre nada redimible de este proyecto… haber, esto no es el peor anime que hay dando vueltas… Pero al menos Mars of Destruction era divertido por lo malo que era. Acá ni siquiera eso. Solo recomendable para curiosos, y gente a la que le gusta ver OVAS a las que califican con notas bajas (vamos, sé que hay mucha gente así).";Not Recommended

Not even ""so bad it's good"", but rather ""so bad it really is bad"" bad.Not sure where to start with this one. First of all, the title has nothing to do with the story (well, it does have girls in it...that's about it). But then again, I'm not even sure there's a ""story"" here - three girls at a private school, one goes missing, and the other two head out to rescue her.Massive, massive plot holes, completely irrelevant plot devices, actually forget the whole ""plot"" bit. Thoroughly unlikable characters, including one clueless brat that is even more annoying than C-ko. Rapidly increasing levels of violence, as we go from machine-guns to tanks to a high-tech flying fortress that is able to level several urban city blocks, cause a few billion dollars in damage and probably kill hundreds of people in the process. But it's all for laugh...right?Really sub-standard artwork throughout to boot. There were a ton of OVAs produced in the eighties of varying quality, but few of them were as gut-wrenchingly awful as this one. Don't even check it out as a ""challenge"".";Not Recommended
0;Jintian Kaishi Zuo Mingxing;UDKDV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/UDKDV;8;Love the story. For me personally it was quite good. The character developments are a bit rushed, but still made me feel attached to them.At first I stayed for the comedy, but as the story progressed, I started to watch to see the main character's growth.I'm not really good at reviewing. All I can say is although the ending is kinda rushed if you like rom-coms with a bit of drama and slice of life, give this anime a chance. The music also sounds nice, although I don't speak Putonghua, the melody and lyrics were really soothing. Fair warning the voicings are a little but missed matched in the last few videos. The art isn't cg.This anime made me laugh a lot. Hope it does with you too.;Recommended
1;Jintian Kaishi Zuo Mingxing;_Sirius_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_Sirius_;8;"This was the first Chinese anime I ever watched til the end. I initially dropped it after the first 2 episodes but seeing how the corona virus has caused a lot of delays in other animes, I decided to pick it up again because I was looking for something to watch and I remembered that it was quite funny.But as the anime progressed, the story started to get more interesting. The villainess started to get increasingly sly with her plans to drag Qin Ya down, to the point where I honestly hated her guts (a sign of a villainess done well). It was enjoyable to see the characters grow, especially Qin Ze, although the romance seemed a little rushed.Like the previous review mentioned, the ending did seem rushed but overall I did enjoy the story. Even though its far-fetched for opposite sex twins to switch places unnoticed (especially when one of them is an idol), the plot still seemed quite realistic with all the ploys happening within the entertainment industry; which I found is what made the anime interesting.And last but certainly not least, the songs were incredible! The anime portrayed Qin Ze as having a strong passion for music, and I think the singer was able to deliver that perfectly with his stunning vocals.Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a music/idol anime with a touch of reality and romance in it, then this anime might just be your thing :)";Recommended
2;Jintian Kaishi Zuo Mingxing;Confucius;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Confucius;7;"This anime was quite a fresh breathe of air. If you are into gender bender this show is just for you. There is no magic or anything. What we have here are fraternal twins swapping lives and each trying to solve each other's weaknesses. I love the relationship between the brother and sister. Also for once, the sister is the older one, unlike the usually ""onii-chan"" cliches.The other thing the show deals is the reality of the entertainment industry. Lots of bribing, scheming, and bullshit are portrayed well in this show. There is also even a romantic subplot for you too root for.The animation wasn't very good, but Chinese anime are improving. The visuals are sparkling. The songs are okay, take it as you will. Finally, there is even hint of a season 2 in the ending too.";Recommended
0;Shuudan Chikan Densha;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;7;Let me say that in general, I do not care for hentai titles in the train molester genre… but you know what, this one I really liked. I guess the reason I enjoyed it so much is that i had a bit of comedy to it and you never felt like anyone was actually getting raped, but rather enjoyed the situations they were in.The story revolves around Yuji who is a young guy who is falsely accused of molesting a woman on a train and is sent to prison for six months. When he finally gets out he is met by a man named Kazuo who is the reigning god of perversion. Together they work to find out who framed him, who is framing other men for the same crime, and why they are doing it. What makes this title different from so many other train pervert hentai is the existence of an evil organization that our two heroes are fighting against, and they use their perversion for good rather than simply self-satisfaction at the hands of others.This is a 2005 release and has been licensed outside of Japan, thus it comes free of censorship and has an English dub for those who do not like reading. The dub quality is average at best, with a bit of bad prom-star acting. The overall quality of the animation is solid, has nice bright colors and is enjoyable to watch. Aside from the fact that it has sexual content, there is no overly-objective content and no bizarre fetishes other than public sex.This is a good, middle of the road hentai animation and well worth your time should you decide to watch it. It has a lot of enjoyable moments and a decent story to keep things moving along.;Recommended
0;Yuuwaku Countdown: Akira;BBHood22;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BBHood22;8;"I'm surprised to see that there are no reviews for this anime. I might as well be the first (and maybe the only one) to write one.Main Characters: Amemiya Akira and KanameStory: 8 - the story revolves around Akira - a beautiful, self-centered boy who thinks and acts like he is God's gift to women. He goes around screwing girls and he does not even care or show any emotions. In the series, it is said that Akira goes both ways, though we only see him having sex with girls - and maybe 1 guy at the beginning but this was not shown. He has this ""sister complex"" and he constantly says that he will only love 1 woman.Art: 9 - the art was beautiful. When they said that Akira was beautiful - they meant it. Kaname was very pretty too as well as the other cast. This anime was made in the 90's and the way they depicted the scenes was very different, it was refreshing. The H-scenes were tastefully done and were artistic (for me). Scenes were not vulgar or explicit at all, not like the new hentai.Sound/Character: 8 - sound was just right and the female voices were not annoying. The ending song had a sweet sound to it and complimented the scene very well. Character development was there and I did not see any loopholes or anything. I think the creators were able to do each one of them some justice.Enjoyment: 8 - I think this is the best hentai series I've seen so far - when it comes to story. I know that a lot of people might hate Akira for being an a-hole but I actually pitied the poor guy. I cannot even blame him for being how he is. He has a lot of issues and having a past like that can really mess up your head. He might be acting all high and mighty but deep down he is just someone looking for love, fulfillment and maybe acceptance. I also liked the ending since I think everyone got what they wanted and deserved (kinda).Very highly recommended if you like beautifully drawn anime, soft-core hentai, a little love story and an intriguing storyline.";Recommended
1;Yuuwaku Countdown: Akira;moviefan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/moviefan;9;"This series is absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, it has been mislabeled as a hentai, and bundled with other anime porn. However, it is NOT a hentai. It's an erotic-psychological-drama-romance. There's a big difference between an erotic movie and a hentai/porno. Yes, it does have graphic sex scenes in it, but you don't even see anything other than some breasts. I have seen standard ecchi anime that have been far more graphic. If it hadn't been part of the Countdown series, which WERE hentai, it may not have gotten labeled as one.The story really draws you in. The plot is very deep and moving. The characters are complex and feel real, it contained a lot of psychological elements, and it has a great deal of romance. And the voice actor for the female lead does a stupendous job. You can really hear the emotion in her voice that makes her character feel very realistic. The art is really good, and the director uses it to express beauty, storytelling, and emotion. The only drawback is that half of it is slide-show, but there's a reason for that too, which comes into play at the very end of the last episode, and it is also used to signify important and emotional scenes. Sadly, due to it incorrect hentai label, many people pass over this rare gem, thinking it's just standard anime smut when it's not. It's really worth a watch.The ending was beautiful too, as Akira was finally able to accept the truth about his sister and escape her abuse, and he finally accepts Kaname's love. Even though he was obsessed with his sister, you could see his developing feelings for Kaname when they were together despite his cold front, because she showed him what real love was, as opposed to his sister, who only loved herself and what she saw of herself in Akira, which was why she forced him to dress as a girl. Akira realized this at the end, and confesses that he viewed his sister as the perfect person, hence why he loved her so much, but finally realized she was a selfish and ugly person, and how horrible he himself had been to people. She really was a terrible person, and physically and mentally abused Akira; it's no wonder he ended up the way he did, but Kaname changed him by showing him real love. I really liked that line he delivered when he realized how horrible his sister was and then thought of Kaname, ""She's more beautiful than anything"". It was a great revelation for how he saw her as a person and his own feelings for her.Another reviewer stated that Kaname was the only one he ever kissed out of all his sex partners. I noticed this too. There are a lot of people that find sex to be just a physical act, but feel that kissing is much more intimate and meaningful. This seemed to be the case with Akira. He even claims that when it comes to sex that it doesn't matter if it's man or woman, because ""A hole is just a hole"". At first when he was having sex with Kaname, he wouldn't kiss her even when she asked, but when they finally got together at the end, he did, and he gave her permission to use his name, which before he only allowed his sister to do, saying it belonged to her. Also, his request to her when he asked her to call him by his first name ""Look only at me"" was very touching too, as it greatly contrasted what his sister did, seeing and loving only the bits of herself she saw in him. Kaname was able to see through and accept all his flaws, and love him for who he was, even after all the horrible things he did. And that very last scene at the end, when he was looking out the window at the snow, that was pretty symbolic. I saw something similar on another anime where it was stated that when two people were saying goodbye and it was snowing, it meant that God was paying attention. This scene shows how he was finally able to say goodbye to his sister and his feelings for her and move on with Kaname.Overall, it was a really beautiful and touching series in several ways. It really didn't get the recognition it deserved due to that unfortunate hentai label and the fact that it contained a lot of sex scenes.";Recommended

The sex scenes are really erotic although they didn't show genitals directly, the details of sex and the flow will make your mind go blank.Here are two ratings if you gonna watch as hentai it's 6/10. it's mainly because of the dark story although the ending was good I was in no mood for hentai.If you are going to watch as anime, not as hentai ( I just mean you aren't horny and just exploring hentai) it's 8/10";Mixed Feelings
0;Kusoge tte Iuna! Animation;RPWPA;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RPWPA;6;This is a very short anime so I'll keep my review short as well.The anime is about characters in a bad game trying to make it good by addlibbing the whole thing. Sometimes it goes their way and sometimes it doesn't but it was still kinda enjoyable. The anime doesn't try to go and do stuff way out of its league instead, it knows its limits and tries to make the best out of it. A decent anime and the fact it was 3 minutes per ep made it better.Overall, I would give it a 6/10.Not something I would go around recommending but something worth watching specially as it isn't long at all. Around 30 minutes total not including the ending song.;Mixed Feelings

The premise was interesting enough and of course the animation is 8-bit game like.It takes an non-original, but still interesting idea and runs with it without running it into the ground. Anyone who ever played some generic rpg games will probably find this amusing to watch.At 3 minutes an episode there's obviously not a lot here to review, but at 1/2 an hour for the total watch, less if you skip credits, it may be worth your time.

0;Canary;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;3;Canary tells a pretty simple slice-of-life story about a band trying to get back together and make it to the upcoming festival concert. It's not a very complex tale, but despite that, it's a bit hard to follow at points. However, some of the scenes are presented pretty decently, and it has some alright moments here and there.The real problem I have with it are the characters, though... as they're just entirely bland and uninteresting. It makes it difficult to care about the story at all, especially one as simple as we have here.The animation is passable, but it's bogged down by the crummy artstyle, which is detailed, but has some pretty terrible moe character designs.As for audio, I liked the soundtrack, which is to be expected in an anime about a band. However, I watched it in Japanese, and the voice actors were not great. They weren't terrible, but a lot of the voices were pretty standard, annoying-sounding high-pitched girls.Overall, there really isn't much of any merit here, but it's also not incredibly bad.

1;Canary;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;4;"This will be a quick review.To sum up Canary in a few words, it is like if Beck and K-on combined themselves and took the best parts out of them and crumbled the best they could with those parts into a 26 minute OVA. But the fun part is that Canary is older than those 2.This is another promotional OVA for a Visual Novel nobody has heard ever in their life and it's boring, but not horrible.One of their best and only good points it's the music, it ok to listen and it is really catchy. It has some pop rock tunes that are quite good. But then everything else is just a big meh.First of all the story doesn't make cohesive sense. The only thing that you get is a vague explanation that the leader of this school band leaves but their members agree to make a really outrageous and crazy plan to bring him back. They sort some traps and hypnotism and all of this because some members did a bet with the person that is charge of the public events in their town. Then everything else is just wacky things going on, but it is not the wackyness that excites you, it is the one that let's you with a ""uh what did just happened?"" and it's simple as that.The art is very standard for the time it was made. But it is not that impressive at all. It is the typical transition in animation that you could see from anime of that era like Onegai Teacher or DearS. The good thing about the animation is that when they set traps they used a 3D model program to simulate the city and it's freaking amazing how well that looked. It seemed that the budget was spent on that. It may look outdated but it doesn't look hideous like many shows try to do during the early 2000s when they started introducing CGI.That's all I can say about this. It is bland, boring and very dry. Just the music it is ok but everything is forgetable. Not the best anime but not the worst cause I have seen worst than this.

Or at very least a promotional tease to get networks to pick up their show.Too many things about this were very off-putting. From the use of art to what can be see in plot thus far. Granted it will be hard to critic on clips from different portions of possible different episodes but i will try my best.PlotIn brief general terms you have a female whom appears to have vast knowledge about this world only to shortly go easily. One would think with a high knowledge you could put up a fight of some kind right? This fails to happen.ArtI understand they are going for some unknown world vibe out look. However, the colors don't seem to match at all. They all appear as abstract paintings. Which makes sense in dreams i suppose but it really does a number to the eyes. Eyes are one of the few things that connects dots to the brain to allow for memory recall. The wide uncalled for split in colors hinders that process. Also, they go for a manga like set up in some scenes. Manga set-up is pictures aligned next to each other. You could have as many as 6 or so on a screen still. Normally, i would not mind it but japan and english each took a different side to how manga (comics) should be read. Left and right (America) vs right to left (japan). Which leads to hitting the pause button. If a movie of show is any good whom wants to hit the pause button? you are supposed to be wrapped into the show.... riding on the edge of your seat right?;Not Recommended

2;Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas;marchedbus786;https://myanimelist.net/profile/marchedbus786;7;Most of this is my early thoughts about the film. I did not spend much time over thinking the film. I also did not watch many short anime films, so i do not have a specific standard for reviewing them. I will be judging the film based sorely on my expectations and how much did the film delivered.And let me tell you, going in to this, I did not had any high expectations. I did not watch the original film, neither did I know anything about it`s premise and world. I knew that this was a spin-off and that it had limited budget and a small team, and that it aimed to tell a simple story with hopefully adequate characters and animation to back it up. And thankfully, it was able to meet and even exceed my expectations. It is a very beautiful, enjoyable and well put together short film, especially considering its free.STORY AND CHARACTERS:The story is not aimed to be complex or serious endeavor with any long or complex story points. It is a light hearted tale that aims to tell a simple contained story, with a joyful and serious tone. And it is necessary to have those expectations while watching this film. The story is largely contained and follows the three main characters Mint, Noah and Thomas, as they try to clean the garbage polluting the shore area. Other than the main premise, the film also spends time telling us about more larger plot points of the main series like the Santa company, which really intrigued me. The opening 5 mins of the film was the point where I was most invested in the film. It explains its world and premise with effective dialogues and beautiful art style. There was some adequate jokes that made me chuckle a bit.But I did felt that at certain points the story was too much to the point and did not try to expand certain plot points. For example, I wished there was a more prominent story arc that better showcased Mint`s shortcomings and her over coming them, Or a better representation of and focus on the littering issue that the film is so heavily aimed at. Thankfully, the story is paced correctly and explains story points effectively. And it overall kept me entertained. It really made me want to watch the original film.Much like the story, the characters are simple and don`t have much dept to them. But they were likable and not irritating and carried the story pretty nicely.The main characters got the most screen time, and the story was focused around getting to know them. I really like their personality and relationship, and they carry the film for me. Apart from Mint, the characters fell two-dimensional, and served more as supporting cast for her, which I think works in the film`s favor. Again, the characters were entertaining and fun and did not overstay their welcome. They fit perfectly in the story and its world.I have not watched the original film, so I do not have the context for the story and characters. But I think it was still satisfactory and did not contain any major plot holes or missing information. You will be able to watch the film without felling the need to think or speculate much.ANIMATION AND MUSIC:The animation and artwork was the best part of the film. The art-style made the world feel authentic and pleasant to look at. There overall good amount of animation. The animation was not fluent at some points and there was a two or three weird cuts, but you`ll hardly notice them.The music was also incredibly put together and added a lot to the story. These two things, more than anything else, were the main reason I enjoyed the film so much.DIRECTION AND EXECUTION:like I said, the recourse for this film was limited, but the creators clearly put a lot of effort in making the film. Director Kenji Itoso had a clear vision in his mind, and knew what to put in the film and how to effectively engage the audience in the film. I also think the creators were very effective in setting our expectations right. And they were very clear about what this film was about and what to expect. I think the film was well directed and executed.CONCLUSION:Like I said, I did not watch much short films and I did not had high expectations for this film. But I still think it delivered on the key things like. There is noting absolutely great and noting horribly bad, everything is simple. But all of its different aspects come together and gives a enjoyable and fun experience. Whether you`ll like that experience or the film, largely depends on your expectations and tolerance for such things. For the most part, I had a blast watching the film. It simple yet entertaining plot and fun characters made me really happy. I may not remember the characters and the story, but I won`t forget the pleasant time I had watching this film.Congratulation to MAL for hosting the film. And thank you to all who worked on the film. I enjoyed and loved it very much, and I plan to watch the original film.Thanks for reading my review. Do watch the film if you think you`ll like it.;Recommended

1;Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas;peachyixxy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/peachyixxy;5;"Santa Company, at least this version, does a pretty mediocre job of telling a story with an environmental message for kids. I know there's another short film and a full-length movie from a few years ago, but as I haven't seen those, I'm just going to judge this on its own.There are going to be slight spoilers from here on out, but since it's a 30-minute short film... I hope it's not too inconvenient.Story - 4Although this is a PG film, definitely meant for kids, I feel like the story was still really underdeveloped. Kids don't necessarily need super complex stories, especially if the focus is the message rather than the characters' development, but I do think this could've been better. There's no motivation behind what the characters do, at least no good motivation. Mint wants to be as good as her brother/live up to Panal (I think), Noah wants to clean up to prevent animals from dying like his pet(???) whale did, but these are all motivations that are dropped more than halfway through the film and without further elaboration. Also, the reveal of the trash dragon Mook was quite strange. The only other time we hear about him is when the teacher from the beginning says that Mint was working on an assignment about ""Mook, Santa's enemy,"" and even then that's all we hear about it.Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but I feel like there could've been something more coherent for this film.Art - 9I think the art style is super cute and the color design is awesome. The main cast certainly look unique without being gaudy. One point off for the CGI though. It wasn't bad, just... strange.Sound - 9Sound design was pretty good. I don't usually listen very hard for sound design, but nothing sounded bad to me. The voice actors are all also really incredible. So, a 9.Character - 5Like I said in the story section, the characters just didn't feel fleshed out in any way. They were all pretty one-dimensional. They don't have to be super complex if they're just for a short environmental story, but I wish there was more of a sense of their goals and motivations. Or some kind of change in their characters...Enjoyment - 7Despite all of the flaws in the characters/story, it was still kind of fun to watch. It was visually pleasing and the music during the credits was definitely really nice.Overall - 5I think the message behind the short film is a great one. We should all do our part in keeping the world, especially the oceans, clean and not contributing to the large amounts of litter out there. I admire the team's efforts to make an entertaining film meant to entertain and educate the public about this issue. I just think audiences would enjoy it more or take it more seriously if there was some more work put into the story so that it doesn't seem so heavy-handed.I really like the concept, I just wish there could've been a better product for such an interesting idea and such an important issue.";Mixed Feelings
2;Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas;jokiboi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jokiboi;5;"I think it's a good idea to spread awareness about the plastics and trash that contaminated the sea and affecting marine animals. I really wish the anime would be more realistic, based on reality lives than just a fantasy because, in reality, it is really hard to tell people to not littering the ocean.You can't just tell people ""hey the sea is polluted and marine animals are dying we have to stop this"" and then they just agree and clean the oceans. In reality, there are many people who are lazy to put trash in to the bin or just put it in their pocket or their bag if there is no bin. They literally throw trash like they throw rocks because they are too lazy to find a bin or they don't want their pocket or bag to be dirty. And there are many people who have their stupid reasons.So, the good thing about this movie is only animation, and others. I hate the pastel colors, they burn my eyes. I really wish the story is more realistic.";Mixed Feelings

I'll say that the animation was particularly good, the main point and theme about this show was suppose to be an educational short movie about why littering is bad and it did okay in that department I guess so you can't really fault the plot for that and expect insane plot and character development. Although being an educational purposed film, it did have that anime feel in it and wasn't straight forward, throwing in some little plot and characters in there for the fun of it. I enjoyed the 28 minutes it aired and considering it was a low budget short movie where I only found it by MyAnimeList ad banner, it did what it is suppose to do pretty decently I guess.;Mixed Feelings

1;Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas;Karinara;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Karinara;4;"Well... That was bad.The story was a rushed mess. I guess the main point is to advertise against littering, but mixing it with the story of becoming a tonttu makes it a mess (even though as a Finn, I enjoyed hearing them say the word tonttu). Adding the part about the littering felt really forced. I can understand that someone might start cleaning the beach when seeing litter on it, but the way he talked about littering was not natural. No one talks like that, that was just very badly made ""Insert our agenda here"" moment.The artstyle looks nice, I liked it. Maybe a bit weird at some points and I'm not sure if it fit the theme of story, but it still looked nice.Nothing special to say about sounds.Characters were mostly very plain, of course we are talking about a half an hour long anime, so there's not much time to develop characters.

2;Santa Company: Manatsu no Merry Christmas;FlyYOUNG;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FlyYOUNG;4;***SPOILER AHEAD***Supposed to be educational but instead of focusing on the real life impacts it has (it does touch on this briefly but VERY briefly- probably less than a minute in total), it instead focuses on a monster that appears because of trash which of course not being real, is not going to make people change because it's FICTIONAL.The main protagonist is also possibly one of the most infuriating characters I've ever met. She's idiotic, blames everything that goes wrong or isn't in her favour on others, and basically just straight up bullies Trevor. She's the epitome of a terrible person yet she saves the day. What kind of picture do you think that paints especially to kids?Story in general is dull. Only redeeming feature about this is that their intentions to bring about awareness to the problem is a good one. And the ending song rocks.;Not Recommended
0;Yowai Mushi;Fujaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fujaku;8;Anime shorts tend to get very looked over for some reason, despite most of them can be found on YouTube and they're short, so why not watch them? Perhaps this is because for every awesome short, there is another really bad one. Fortunately Yowai Mushi falls in the later category.Yowai Mushi is a short music video by Tekken, who also did another great short, Furiko. Clocking in at only four minutes, it is about the trials one man faces and how he is bullied like a weak bug throughout the story and all of the terrible things that happen to him. The message to the whole thing is, “yes you're weak, but it's okay being weak as other people are also weak” or something along the lines of that.Due to the fact it is more or less a music video and it has little story, the main things to cover are the music and the animation. I personally love the song playing in the background during this video. It's a very relaxing tune that's sad but yet happy at the same time, and it has a good singer to it. But the animation... Well now, it was drawn in a very simple style with no colors and like what someone would draw for a comic or something, which is fine and all, I'm all for unique animation styles, but the thing is it's very choppy and you can tell each drawing apart most of the time. That could've just been part of the style and if so fine, but it bothered me a bit.Now the story. The story is very well told, if a little confusing at times due to the fact it is tough to tell what's going on (like there's this one part where the main guy is on a train, falls, and lands on a woman who accuses him of being a sex offender. It's very tough to miss him landing on the woman, meaning that it seems like people are pinning him down so the police can take him for no reason). There's also a subplot with the man's daughter in there too that didn't really blend very well. But the parts were still very well told and the man's trials are easy to relate too. The characters do develop a bit in the short time too, which is nice.Yowai Mushi Final RatingStory: Well told, but details that are important can easily be missed- 7.Characters: Developed well enough in the short time period- 8.Sound- Awesome song- 9.Animation- Simple and unique, but yet choppy- 6.What's even the point of reading a review on something four minutes long? I just should've said “just watch this” in the first paragraph, as this definitely deserves a watch. And it's short, so even if you don't like it, does it really matter? All together,I give it a 8, and it is definitely recommended.;Recommended

0;Yoroiden Samurai Troopers Message;shaggyjebus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shaggyjebus;2;"Being the final entry in the Ronin Warriors series, you'd think this five-episode OAV would be filled with great action and a wonderful end. It's not. There is no action whatsoever in any of these episodes, except in the flashbacks that fill half of each episode. These ""flashbacks"" (most fitting word I can think of) aren't really flashbacks though; they are clips from the TV series and the Legend of the Inferno Armor OAV with pointless drivel spouted from the characters over them. The dialogue doesn't even discuss what is being shown - it's quasi-philosophical ramblings that have nothing to do with the Ronin Warriors series at all.Furthermore, every happy thing in the original series (the idea of friendship, especially) is cast aside, with the characters basically saying that they weren't friends, that they only fought beside each other to survive. It's as if the creators of these OAV episodes wanted to piss off every fan of the original series.Even if you can get past the lack of action in an action series and the wasteful consumption of time (this could have been two episodes, easy), you still won't find very much enjoyment. The plot is a joke, with next to no explanation of anything and a general lack of sense and substance. The idea that the story of the warriors has already been told in a book that is 300 years old is never even explored; it's just a background for a few brief moments.There is nothing redeeming about this. There is no reason to watch it, and there is no reason it should have ever been made.";Not Recommended
0;Shaonian Ge Xing;Stripey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stripey;10;Have you ever drove towards a mountain range only to discover that the individuals peaks are actually distinct mountains, separated by large distances? And that you were awestruck by the grandeur of the farthest, towering peak as you approach the nearer mountains? Shaonain ge xing is one such multi-faceted, layered story that got more fascinating as the plot unfolded.Shaonian Ge Xing (SGX) is a webnovel by Zhou Mu Nan. The anime actually follows the chapters of the novel rather closely (almost 1 ep = 1 chapter). Strictly speaking, SGX is a prologue of sorts. The story centers on Wu Xin and has a coherent plot with a satisfying end. The central mystery that drive the plot and character development is well paced in its execution and reveal. But as the story progresses, another more intriguing tale is layered upon the main story, thrusting Xiao Se into the spotlight and expanding the narrative much more.The world-building is rich. The pugilist world is vibrantly set up with myriad sects, sword deities and distinct power levels that sounds awesome (for example 逍遥天境 – it was translated as “unrestrained sky realm” but it honestly doesn’t capture its true poetic essence). The political/court intrigues hum in the background and occasionally rears its head to intersect violently with the pugilist world, deepening drama and mystery.Character-wise, the development is rather uneven. Of the 4 main characters, Tang Lian's character development is the weakest followed by Lei Wu Jie. Since this anime is a Wu Xin tale and the novel is a Xiao Se story, the latter 2 get great character arcs. However, I do have a criticism on Sikong Qianluo. She does not actually appear so early in the novel. I suspect to prevent the show from descending into a sausage-fest, Sikong Qianluo was forcibly introduced early. The 2 underlings that she eventually acquired in the show was a low point in the anime since their attempt at humor was crass and not remotely funny (My only true gripe of the show).On production values, for a 3D Chinese animation in 2018, SGX stood out for me in terms of their facial rendering. The characters are expressive and complement their layered dialogue perfectly. The fights are visually appealing though nothing to write home about. There were a few scenes that stood out cinematographically for me – watch out for Xiao Se when he steps out of this inn in episode one. Revisit it after you learn his backstory and the scene will hit differently. The mark of a good show is rediscovering added dimensions in scenes, dialogues upon repeat viewings and SGX attest to that.In closing, Shaonian Ge Xing is a well-crafted wuxia story that gives a glimpse of further greatness (and yes Season 2 is already complete). The rich details in storytelling and dialogue thus demand high quality translation to capture the nuances and intricacies of the tale. Highly recommended but only if you find a well translated source.;Recommended
0;Shaonian Ge Xing;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;Great Journey of Teenagers follows several characters: An oblivious newbie disciple of a famous master Lei Wujie, a crippled former prodigy disciple and disowned prince that owns a snowy mountain inn Xiao Se, a famous assassin and disciple of a famous Master, Tang Lian, Tang Lian's Master's third-wheeling tsundere daughter Sikong Qianluo and Tang Lian's yandere companion Maiden Rui.Their fates become intertwined when they encounter Tang Lian's mission to escort a golden coffin - a heavily rumored coffin said to house many secrets of the martial arts world. Their journey of escorting this coffin ends abruptly when a young monk emerges from the coffin, Wu Xin is the young monk who is said to have mastered all the Temple's secret martial arts and it is speculated that he is the last person to have them after all the secret martial arts manuals were destroyed in a fire.Wu Xin's journey involves disciple Lei Wujie and cripple Xiao Se as he scatters along the plains to put his mentor/old friend's soul to rest. On the way, they encounter many obstacles but Wu Xin's wit persists in order to fulfill his wish. All the while, he is being chased by several opposing factions set out to capture him.Story: 3/10Great Story of Teenagers tries to masterfully blend the different perspectives of the main characters as they give chase. It also tries to incorporate many different martial arts and Buddhist principles as well as a wide range of factions that fight over Wu Xin's existence. All of this detail makes the story hard to follow and they introduce details then never mention them again (i.e the 5 immortal swordsmen, the horse stealing gang etc.) The way we see progress in the story is by having the characters spoon feed it to us while they're talking to another character (i.e Lei Wujie asks Xiao Se and then Xiao Se explains it) Overall, this repetitive progression is just lazy and full of filler content that can be skipped.Art & Sound: 4/10 5/10The art and animation was pretty good. The subtitles were problematic the entire time I watched this series. Since many of the characters talk in idioms the subtitles are constantly popping off with explanations of the idioms or the Chinese respelling in English letters. This makes it even more difficult to grasp other character names because it's hard to tell whether they're talking about a character or idiom.The sound was average, nothing too notable.Character: 5/10The character establishment was actually pretty interesting. Many of the main characters like Wuxin, Xiao Se and Lei Wujie had mysterious backgrounds in the beginning but eventually on the journey they expressed their past based on the obstacles they encountered. If this was the main premise of character establishment I would have enjoyed this series much better than the current amount of characters in this series. At many points of the story it's hard to determine which of the 3 are the main characters and it goes back and forth between disciple Lei Wujie and the monk Wu Xin. I would have preferred if it centered around one character since we don't get confused on whos back story is developing (since each of the 3 have a backstory that develops as the story progresses it gets confusing to denote the main-main character) Overall, I enjoyed the main 3 character establishment and development but disliked how other characters were brought in and forcefully established to evoke emotional conflict in the end 6 episodes.Enjoyment & Overall: 4/10This series had me lost 85% of the time mostly because of the subtitles but also because it tries to establish a large amount of small fry characters in a short amount of time. This isn't the first time a series has tried to do this. The amount of story lore is a but much as well since it is only known to us once and then discarded. Overall 4 is a pretty blunt rating but I can't find anything notable about the series.;Not Recommended

0;Onmyouji: Youen Emaki;Wrathful_Chicken;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wrathful_Chicken;2;Onmyouji: Youen Emaki is a mysterious mess of a hentai. This stems from the awkward vibes the female MC, Seimei, gives off. Although the art is low quality, and the character development is dreadful since Seimei serves as an anchor, dragging everyone down, the music is spectacular for an old hentai and the detective/diviner aspect of the story has potential.The music is the greatest part about this hentai. While it is not exactly stellar, its usage brings a very powerful sense of suspense and mystery. It's enough to bring those butterflies to your stomach, which is the reaction to a large threshold of a thrilling experience. The ability for the use of music, and the absence of it, to permeate the entire series with this feeling is an incredible feat. However, where this hentai falls short is in its main purpose, to be a fap session.The art is low quality, partly due to it being an old hentai, largely due to it lacking in sexiness. In terms of a hentai, it's sex scenes are very toned down. The music builds up a very powerful emotion, but the actual scenes are too weak to live up to the expectations of the buildup.The characters development is cockblocked just as much as the subpar sexiness is a cockblock. Detective Hiromasa Miyamoto wants to understand Seimei Abe, but Seimei doesn't give him any opportunity to understand anything by doing bizarre things. While this is fine for a mystery anime, it's pretty annoying for a hentai. Seimei is completely unrelatable and a nuisance. Her attitude is that of a haughty queen who does whatever she wants with little to no explanation. It's not cute nor sexy like a himedere, it's just annoying/frustrating.If Onmyouji: Youen Emaki completely dropped the hentai scenes and just made the series ecchi at most, this would actually be a fairly nice anime series for an old anime. It already has an interesting premise mixing detective mysteries and divine summoning. There is also a cast of potentially interesting characters that are not developed due to how short the hentai is.Onmyouji: Youen Emaki would ironically be sexier this way, as it leaves more to the imagination--which is valuable in any kind of mystery story. Unfortunately, it does not take this route and the sex scenes end up feeling awkward.;Not Recommended

Each of the four episodes has one single love-making scene in it, and it is pretty much PG13 or maybe a Light R rating at the most. Everything is done under the sheets and there is no hardcore content of any kind. You see more H in your average made-for-cable series.All in all, it is a good series, and a pleasant watch. My only complaint is the way it ends, the producers must have meant for it to continue on because you are left with unresolved issues.;Recommended
0;Mahou Shoujo Meruru;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;8;Magic Woman MMeruru is a young sorceress on a journey/ an adventure, I'm not sure where she's going though. I assume she's on a journey to gain experience and become a stronger wizard.Episode 1A village is attacked by a monster, call it an ogre or a troll, it's basically a very big man. It kills all the villagers but keeps the women for sex and for a meal (you'd think he'd eat the men and just keep the women for the sex). So it's up to Meruru and two female warrior sisters from the village to save the day.So like pretty much every 'magical woman vs monster' hentai the women do get raped. However it's not like Angel Blade where the women go around half naked, with no kind of fighting talents, who hardly put up a fight and who has these huge breasts that only get in the way. These girls put on an interesting fight, they where actual armor, they have fighting skills and their breasts are the right size for their body.Episode 2After saving the day in ep 1, Meruru continues on her adventure. This time she comes across a group (Female Ninja, Female Magician, Beast man, Warrior) who get attacked by tentacle plants who impregnate women to reproduce, luckily Meruru saves them and joins their group and they are later attacked by fishmen who also reproduce by impregnating women. Meruru and the Female Magician are dragged to their undersea cave for the impregnating process, and Meruru saves the day again.STORYI think they could have developed a great story with this, even without the hentai this could make a really good anime.It's an adventure, it gives you the feel of playing one of those random encounter, turn based adventure video games. There is actually a random encounter scene with a random encounter theme music, like a random encounter in a pokemon game.ARTAs I mentioned before the girls don't have gigantic boobs which is good. This is not a problem for me but you'll notice that it's one of those old animation style and I like it.The only prob I had was that the monsters' penises (the giant and the fishmen) were too long, it looked ridiculous.SOUNDI enjoyed the sound effects and the theme music at the end, it was a very calming beautiful music.CHARACTERSYou actually care about the characters, they're likable and are each different.Rate: Very good, interesting and fun. This would make a good anime series.;Recommended

0;Balthus: Tia no Kagayaki;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;6;In the village of Le-jeute, all is not well. The city is over shadowed by the mysterious factory city called Balthus, and the peaceful little village is lured into a similar way of life with the promises of pleasure that await them. But when the workers realize this, it's too little too late.Did you get that, because the plot that this hentai does have is completely rushed through to fit the 30 minute length of this OVA.As usual, all of the voice actors in the English dub sound bored, which was standard lot of low budget anime in general pushed out to shelves from the late 80s to early 90s for a lot of direct-to-VHS features. Nothing surprising there.But surprisingly, both the art style and animation is really good for this hentai. It's not amazing by any stretch, but there was clearly some effort put in here, especially with the background paintings and character designs. The plot and characters are actually mildly interesting, which is a shame, because the whole thing rushes through it less than 30 minutes.But when it comes down to it, this is still a hentai. So are the sex scenes any good? For a retro hentai, the sex scenes are pretty decent, but there are barely any sex scenes to speak of. If anything, the sex could have been easily removed entirely, and nothing would have been changed. It's almost like the creative team had a vision of what they wanted to do, but the whole thing was had to be a hentai to be able to sell it to audience, so the sex scenes were forced into it. Which is a shame, because the rest of it is actually quite good.Even the music has some heart and soul to it, which is not what I was expecting at all going into this. I was just looking for something to jerk off to.Would I recommend Balthus - Tia`s Radiance? Surprisingly, I would recommend this hentai entirely on the strength of it's art, plot, and characters. The sex is barely there to begin with, so it wasn't like you were going to crank one out unless this was your only exposure to anything scantily clad at the time of it's release.Sure, it's not going to win any awards and it isn't what I would call a classic, but when you get something genuinely heartfelt, along with an awesome scene of your main character crashing through the large stain-glassed window of the bad guy's hideout with a small zeppelin to save the person that they just fell in love with, it's hard to not give it a recommendation, even if it is a lukewarm one.;Mixed Feelings

1;Balthus: Tia no Kagayaki;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;4;This was described to me as a porn parody of Castle in the Sky, so I checked it out for laughs. It's definitely loose, but I can see the Ghibli inspiration at the edges, especially in the shapes of the hats that the workers wear and the characters' faces. Additionally, the voice actor who played the villain went on to play the Nine Tailed Fox in Naruto.As porn, this doesn't really work for me on a couple different levels. One thing is that the pace of Japanese porn is too slow and they payoff isn't necessarily as visceral because of their laws against depicting penises and vaginas. Weird rule, but OK. It has resulted in a media culture that emphasizes almost completely different aspects of sexual experience than anywhere else. Now that I have lost your respect for knowing that little about Japanese porn, the more important part of why this doesn't work is a bit more personal. It doesn't align with what I tend to enjoy in this sort of story because the characters' emotions aren't at all relevant to the sex. There was no cycle of anticipation then release, and pretty much nobody was openly happy about it. They were only allowed to be happy about it if they were pathetically calling after someone who was in the middle of discarding them (so it's more pathetic) or they were a rapist. It is, proverbially, not my bag.Oh, also, there was a story about a labor revolution and a big robot in there. Honestly, even though I didn't find the sex very interesting at all, that plot was even less interesting and barely mattered.So, then, why a 4? Because it's surprisingly well animated and the scenes between the two main good characters were nice, as few as they were. They never had sex, which was a weird decision, but OK. There are some pretty landscape shots at the end, too. It was nice to look at when nobody was having sex, which is not really what you want from porn, but which is something I like to see in general, so sure.;Not Recommended
0;Bi-Indoushi Miija: Injoku no Gakuen;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;3;This is one of those hentai titles that you watch and wonder just who thought it was a good idea to make it. This is a bad hentai. The story blows, the characters are one-dimensional and boring, the anime is cheap and bad and the hentai content is boring and poorly done. I can think of no good reason to watch this title.So lets talk story... a sex demon appears at a school and makes people have sex... church sends someone to investigate... somehow demon is banished, the end. There is very little in the way of character development and you never really know enough about anyone to actually give a damn for them. The flow of the story is just boring and fairly uneventful... even the parts that are supposed to be action scenes are lifeless. Whoever wrote it just did not try.People watch hentai for the H content, and if that part of it sucks, then what is the point. In this case the H content is just bad, boring, cheaply done and a total waste of time. There is not a whole lot of H to begin with in this series and what there is of it was so badly done that it was almost pointless to include it.So, for the art and sound... The voice acting was lame and boring... the sound effects were cheap and annoying... the animation was extremely cheap, using tons of still frames and choppy low-quality animation overall. The only possible good thing I can say is that this title is available uncensored, but the quality of the animation makes that a moot point.My conclusion... pass on this title, there are tons of better anime and hentai out there, and this one has neither a compelling story nor good H content.;Not Recommended

For example when you think a movie star you think beauty of a god. Moreover, whom is to say you are not masking the truth behind it? Who to say they don't see them selves the same way? Or, they wish they did not have the huge spotlight raining above them? What i along with the anime are trying to say is life as we know it no matter in what regard or where has their own pros and cons.

0;Ace wo Nerae! Final Stage;Tsubakiaka;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsubakiaka;7;well it's the finale of the tennis show that rocked the world and became one of the best selling shoujo manga of all time. Farewell Oka!In a very bittersweet goodbye to one of the most surprising additions to lifelong favorites, I look back at the series with fondness. Mainly upset that I won't be able to rush to review something I'm so in love with so others might have insight into such a forgotten series, or be the sole commenter on streaming sites.Final stage is a direct continuation of Aim for the ace:2. I would barely call them separate seasons as the story is basically just chopped in two and called couers.The biggest change is the focus on the romantic subplot finally that we got glimpses of back in the second season. I was honestly shocked to see Oka take ahold of her own life for once - being influenced by her coaches for so long! We also get a bit of a Madame butterfly side arc which was a nice break. It flowed well into the final episodes.Note that the budget reflects on the amount of pastel freeze frames (Dezaki...) and still shots to stretch the time to reach the airing slot as well as just lower frame rate in some places. And i did find myself slightly peeved but,if you're going to watch this then you know from the past its expected. Not to say there weren't some nice moments and animations. Highlights include Episode 8's mini battle of the sexes, the queens match! (which i wish had a higher budget, oka is growing!) Reikas match in episode 11 which flipped my expectations! The ending had a lot to be desired but it was simple goodbye.;Recommended

Wang Sheng tries to enter a new life in Wuyou city, a place many fugitives can stay, but under that they follow in the lord's absolute rules 1. No fighting in the inner city 2. No killing in the outer city. Immediately an interesting new setting.Though even among the city, the fugitives set their own hierarchy and bully around, taking bounty jobs etc. Wang who started a cooking business with modern cuisine finds when you ask fugitives to follow rules though, it's literally rumble in the city. Until the BADASS Eunuch serving the lord steps in to restore law and order. Undeterred by punishment, the five families from Season 1 pursues and still attempts to kill Wang, the Dai family being the ultimate threat!By order of the city lord to Eunuch as bodyguard for Wang after an almost successful assassination attempt on his life, it leads to an amazing BOSS FIST FIGHT between the equally extremely high level and powerful Eunuch and Dai Wuji. The action in Season 2 is SO EPIC and even better than Season 1. Even Wang's guns are not effective and he loses in fight against Dai Wuji's high level chi when Dai Wuji could even use his own weapon against him and take his girls hostages. The young master and anyone that try and help or associate with Wang would also face the consequences of helping him.The characters really developed this season and so has the romance plotline and how it really ravaged our MC, who was just not as strong to protect anyone even Dai pointed out. It's more than just battle now, but the insanity and pain that settles in. Get ready towards the end where you make of everything.The sound is a strict upgrade. The opening is good like always, but Season 2 is just better and ending song is really BEAUTIFUL !!! Yuan Long is slowly moving out from the modern weapon OPness, but in return we got a tale of a legend fighting his way up saving the people he care for in the world of Chi.

0;Juuninin no Onna Kyoushi;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;5;Tags: Rape, Abuse, Bondage, Sex Slaves, Urination, Lesbian, Incest, ScatThe series starts out with the rape of one teacher by another and just gets more vicious as it progresses. This is the basic story of a bad school chairman using the school to recruit and train sex slaves for sale on the black market. The male characters view the women as nothing but objects to use and violently abuse for their pleasure and financial gain. In standard hentai fashion, all of the women start out being violated and end up being submissive slaves who enjoy what is being done to them. This series is non-stop sex as they shove a dozen different women into sexual situations in just one hour. The male characters you end up hating and the women characters, with a couple minor exceptions, fly by so fast that they are just a blur you don't even remember.There is nothing special about the animation style, lots of still frames, talking heads, and pan shots. It also suffers from oddly colored body parts. If you like squishing sounds then you will get your fill with this one. The voice work is not bad and the overall sound is good. Nothing special about the music, its mostly there to increase the tension in the non-stop uncomfortable situations.

0;Chiryokumaru;Singan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Singan;6;"Chiryokumaru is a 2016 web short by Studio 4°C, and just like most of their shows it's a pretty original work that offers a little more than it first meets the eye.STORY & CHARACTERSThe whole plot may be summarized in just two sentences: inside a museum, a young warrior fights against shadow beasts using the energy charger on his waist. Soon, the energy runs out, but the warrior finds a new source of power to continue fighting. The plot is extremely short and simple, and even feels somewhat torn out of context, as we never learn why those events take place.However, as I have already said, the anime offers a little more than it first meets the eye. When the warrior runs out of energy, he draws new energy from kanji written on the museum walls. And since the description on the official Youtube channel mentions that those shadow beasts symbolize people's fear and uncertainty over what they don't know, the whole thing becomes a pretty cool allegory of how knowledge defeats ignorance, fear and other obstacles. Of course, that does not prevent the plot from being extremely simple, but it does make it more than just a dumb action sequence, as the idea behind it is good and not quite common for anime.As for the characterization, it's even more basic than the plot, since the whole cast consists of shadow beasts that don't have names and personalities, and one warrior of whom we learn virtually nothing. However, it would be rather strange to expect outstanding character building from a two-minute short, so I am not really too critical about the cast.ANIMATION & SOUND- the animation is very good, with eye-appealing colours and nice action scenes featuring some cool energy blasts;- the BGM employs taiko drums. It's not memorable but fits the show well and gives it a certain samurai feeling;- the main character says only one line during the whole show, and those beasts don't talk, so the voice-acting is nothing much to write about.In general, the production values are good, as expected from Studio 4°C.OVERALLTo sum everything up, I would say that Chiryokumaru is a fine short. While its plot is very simple and somewhat torn out of context, and the characterization is virtually nonexistent, the idea behind the whole thing is very good and not something you often see in anime, and the production values are quite good too. So, if you want some quick watch or you just like Studio 4°C's works, this short might very well be worth giving a try.";Mixed Feelings

It's really something else.Echo is one of the most catchy MVs I've listened to in a long while, going as high as other greatly acclaimed MVs such as Yoru Ni Kakeru. THE BOYZ really delivered by making a fitting OST for the webtoon, it's got everything from fire beat, ability to captivate attention, high rewatch (or in this case relisten) value, and, of course, the crescendo into nothing but hype. It's a seriously good track and I honestly didn't think SL would go this far. But what can I say? I guess popularity wins.The actual MV itself is as I had mentioned before; lacks prominent animation and original scenes. But it was still made in a way that wasn't boring or anything like that. Sure it is a little annoying that there is not a lot of significant original work, but the animation still created an atmosphere that would have very much felt like something out of your typical high-quality shounen. It's great. But I wouldn't go expecting the world. Still enough to suffice.That's all from the MV to note about really. You can try to cope with the lack of an actual anime series for the webtoon with this and it'd be somewhat fine. Maybe one day we will get the adaptation everyone has been waiting for.

I highly recommend just watching the original OVA, it's a classic. A nod to the original would have been nice at least.The girls are the same, MC has a new name for some reason. Can't really say much other than watch the 90's version because it's better in every way except its more HD. Art style manages to be more weird than the original. It doesn't follow the game but that's understandable and I'm sure none of the voice actors are even the same as the ones in the VN which is kinda lame I guess.I only wrote this review just in case because I wouldn't like to see the name of this title get a bad reputation. If you're just watching this randomly and know nothing about the VN or 90s version then it won't matter or if you're just watching it for other reasons...Will probably finish just for nostalgia reasons but that's about it.

This made me miss my family's cooking as we have not had a chance to visit during the Lunar New Year for the past 20 years.Gourmet Rating 8.0/10 - excellent, one of the best for preparation and cooking with instructions and recipes.08/10 Visual appeal of food - tasty looking food, very accurate07/10 Reaction of characters to food - Characters enjoy the food and make satisfied faces especially the ""piggy"" of the group. No sparkles or clothes flying off, but a more realistic approach.05/10 Difficulty or complexity of food featured - a few simple recipes, with the rest of medium difficulty.10/10 Preparation or Cooking Instructions - they actually show the preparation and cooking as this takes up the majority of the anime time. There are recipes with the ingredients and instructions at the end. Some are simple enough you can make them at home.10/10 Desire of viewer to cook or buy dishes featured after watching show - Will motivate you to cook if you have the ingredients available, especially for the simple, accessible dishes like Watermelon Pizza.Overall 8/10It's a grand gourmet anime that has 100% focus on preparing, cooking and eating the food during the Chinese New Year Spring festival period. The anime shows true respect to the food tradition during the celebration period.";Recommended

0;Rokudenashi Blues;Mandalorian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mandalorian;6;I watched this OVA on YouTube. The video had a terrible 240p resolution and the subtitles were the most retarded Engrish subs ever made, making sometimes impossible to follow the dialogues due to the barely understandable/nonsense translation. This made the whole experience quite painful, seriously limiting the overall enjoyment, but the anime is decent.Rokudenashi Blues is just another obscure and hard to find OVA from the early 90s. It's nothing special: very short and with a simple plot, it features some classic high school gang-related violence.There isn't much room for character or plot development because the OVA is about 30 minutes long. Art and animation are fair enough for an anime from the early 90s. The overall enjoyment is enough for this anime to be worth watching.Recommended if you're into minor and obscure OVAs, if you like the 80s/90s style animation and/or if you want to watch something entertaining but you don't want to start a TV series or a long movie.;Mixed Feelings

0;Ring ni Kakero 1: Nichibei Kessen-hen;ParaParaJMo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ParaParaJMo;7;"Ryuji conquers the Jr. Japan circuits. But before he can go on the world stage, Black Shaft of the US challenges the Japenese to a tune up fight. It will be 5 on 5 between team Japan, consisting of Ryuji, and his rivals in the tournament such as Takeshi, Katori, Kazuki, and Jun against Shaft and fighters of his own choosing. Since the Japanese barely finished their tournament, they of course need time to recover and train. Jun’s arm has recovered but Ryuji is starting to have injury problems of his own from the tournament from repeatedly using his boomerang. Despite that, he endures it and takes the challenge.Black Shaft on the other hand, does not even recruit boxers. He recruits adults and all types of weirdos telling team Japan he wants a street fight and thinks of them as a joke. Black Shaft, recruits Monster Jail, a death row inmate for multiple murders; the mysterious and charming Miss Charnel from Chicago; Mick, the leader of the New York branch of the infamous Hell’s Angels; and NB Forrest a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, who was renamed Mr. Whitey in the anime and portrayed as just an unserious womanizer. So now Team Japan must fight these thugs in the ring and will do all they can to maintain the honor of their country and their people and put down the motley crue of an American team.OK, as if the fights themselves were weird enough, they got a weirder cast of characters in this season. I’m so glad that Kurumada recognizes America’s diversity here and uses it very creatively. To paraphrase Don King, “Only in Japan, can we have a manga, where a KKK Grand Wizard and a black man on the locker room.” I say it’s either stupid, or funny. I find it to be funny personally. I can’t believe Japan’s Jr. boxing commission or whoever sanctions the fights allowed these fights to happen.But other things that really bothered me were changes from the manga. Such as Katori and Kazuki easily beat their opponents in a matter of seconds. Probably not a page or 2. While in the anime, it went to DBZ anime street where they make the fights longer and Katori and Kazuki have a much harder time with their opponents to the point they may actually lose. Also, when Kazuki was fighting Mick in the anime, they added this filler story where the Hells Angels were raiding Kazuki’s family’s house which I thought was a waste when they could have easily gotten to the shadow story arc (which should be next season if they do make one). The shadow organization is briefly present in the anime, but it ends where the USA and Japan fights ends and I hope a new season is made soon.Granted this season aired 2 years after the first one, there is really no distinctive improvement with the quality. Still the same. The character designs are still faithful to the manga and so on. If you saw my review of season 1, anything I said in that one can be applied here too. So I’ll talk about the fights again. Granted the fights are still based on super powered boxing, but some things I really liked about it were the angles and the shots. Especially when Kazuki does his final rolling thunder against Mick and when Jun uppercuts NB Forrest was awesome too. It really made it more dramatic and represents that it’s truly Shounen Action, and not necessarily boxing.The previous opening theme was the same, but the changed the ending theme which is titled Shining Like Gold. The music isn’t hard rock or anything intense or adrenaline pumping. It’s more calm sounding and has a blues like sound with the harmonica. Instead, it emphasizes more on innocence and youth which I think helps brings more of a balance to the series than just being a juiced up version of Ashita no Joe.The voice cast from the original season also comes back. Anything I said in the first review can mostly be applied here.All I can say is, the casual or even hardcore anime fan that is not Japanese will still have trouble recognizing the significance this anime has culturally because it’s so old and even though the anime is new, retains the old school feel to it with the characterization, art, and story telling being all so simple. I feel the only non-Japanese fans that are going to like this anime are probably fans of Saint Seiya because the style of it is of course similar and some of the story arcs in the manga of Ringu ni Kakero would later influence Saint Seiya. Like they will have outside boxing fights with evil organizations. Like the fights after Team America, the Japanese team will fight an organization called the Shadow which use boxing as an assassination art and they will also fight another weird mystical organization known as Ashura.And in the later half in the manga, each representive from each country will fight Team Greece and Greece’s members use the same name as the Gods. And the when they become pros, the World Champion is named Jesus Christ. And he’s from the Netherlands and does not at all look like the Jesus Christ we know. So yeah, on one hand, I can understand why most people will not like it. But no matter how much you may not like it, you can’t deny if it weren’t for Ringu ni Kakero, there would be no Dragon Ball Z; no Bleach; no Yuu Yuu Hakusho; no Naruto; no Slam Dunk; Shounen Jump would just simply not be where it is today. I guess the manga is entertaining when you try to see things in a Japanese perspective that it was something new. But in a western perspective, you’ll be freaked out and probably offended by how the nationalities are portrayed. But the manga in terms of story still has structure and organization and the characters are diverse. I say the premesis overall is of course screwed up both anime and manga wise, but still somehow iconic to the Japanese";Recommended

0;Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae;Apollo18;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Apollo18;8;"""Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae"", or Sabu and Ichi's Arrest Warrent"" was the first anime made for an adult audience, and the first to air in a 9pm TV slot. Set in the historical Edo period, it follows young, clean-cut Shinsengumi officer Sabu, and blind, lecherous old man Ichi, who gives neck massages on the street (a traditional, low status job for blind men), but also an unlikely master-swordsman, with the blade concealed in his cane.""Sabu and Ichi"" follows a pretty standard, episodic, 'who-dunnit' format, but in a traditional Tokugawa setting. It also follows the 'buddy-cop'' formula, with naive, enthusiastic, by-the-book Sabu contrasting with the irreverent wisdom, unconventional approach, and street-smarts of Ichi. Each episode sees a crime commited, with the duo unravelling the clues, and catching the villain by the episodes end, in a largely self-contained format. Although there is quite a bit of character development through the course of the series, especially in the fleshing-out of the backstory of these two, complex, well-rounded characters.I was extremely impressed with ""Sabu and Ichi"". It'ss early date and black and white imadery may put some people off, but I found a surprisingly mature, engaging story with beautiful art, offering a very authentic-feeling insightt into both Tokagawa Japan, and the early days of anime. ""Sabu and Ichi"" clearly had a limited budget, rrelying on the tricks of 'limited animation' to maximize story-telling despite those limits. But it also uses some pretty innovative, experimental techniques, using compositing, Dezaki-esque paintings, or even the odd piece of live footage, to create a truly unique, boundary-pushing approach to story-telling.Showing influence in everything from Samurai Champloo to Cowboy Bebop to Rurouni Kenshin, ""Sabu and Ichi"" holds its age extremely well. Criiminally underwatchhed, its one of the most mature stories I've seen in anime.Highly recommend. 8/10";Recommended

1;Mouryou Senki Madara;BlokeTokes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlokeTokes;5;"One of few anime, that I've seen at least, that builds a world I could see happening in old western dungeons-and-dragons fantasy (two other series being ""Record of Loduss War"" and ""Ruin Explorers""). The animation is solid while the art style is what you'd expect for the time of release. The main characters are moderately likable, but don't have too complicated of situations or anything to keep them very memorable. The story isn't too far from something in your usual, cheap fantasy story. This short anime is an adaption of a manga too, and that links in to the worst part of this anime - being how terribly the story was executed in the limited run-time. I haven't read the manga, but I honestly doubt that the entirety of the story could've been reasonably told in two hours. What should've been done is the main parts of the plot should've been kept in and other less important aspects should've been held back or scrapped all-together. Instead, the story is executed in a way that the first hour (basically the first episode) moves at a very nice and enjoyable pace that would be a good pace if the entirety of this anime were to expand it's length to properly accommodate the whole story. But, in reality, there's still only two hours to work with, and you can tell how much the people behind this anime knew that as they pulled out the tape and glue in the last hour/episode. You have developments of the story passed over casually like a bowl of dip and characters brought into light only to fade back to the corner once their name and presence is known enough that they can be differentiated from the other background cast. The most hilarious part of how the second episode is handled though is that the logic of the main characters is lowered to that of a child to make everything conclude immediately. You have one person who uses the chicken before the egg logic to have a change of heart on who to direct his drama, and you have another person who was built up to betray to achieve his own goal only to stop because, oh, ""it was a stupid idea"" *with a vocalized wiggle of the wrist*. Take note I watched this in the English Dub and that the localization/script-writing could've been worse on that side of things. I could definitely understand that too as the writing quality noticeably dips a bit into the second episode, like those working on the dub knew it wasn't a winner. I can at least report that the English voices are fine. While there's no terrible actor, though, there isn't any exceptional/notable actor either. I would say Madara was a worth-while viewing just for it being one in a light number of anime to carry that western fantasy feel, but this anime is still nothing to write home about - just to MAL.I'd recommend watching ""Ruin Explorers"" over this, and I have a review written for that too.";Mixed Feelings
0;The Four Seasons;CatchMyHead;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CatchMyHead;7;"Commercials are great! You can get yourself a beer, take a piss, get some snacks, call your mom, buy a house in Zimbabwe, fly back home and still watch enough of the block to make the sponsors keep sponsoring your favourite show. These four original net anime (ONA) episodes are something else though; I would probably have paid to see them! These commercials showcase the scenery of Saitama prefecture through their ~5 minute story segments and then tell you how to get to the places visited in the anime by train from Tokyo at the end, accompanied by a catchy tune.Saitama has already been featured in anime as diverse as Lucky Star, AnoHana and Crayon Shin-Chan, but was clearly deserving of its own anime judging by the scenery featured in this ONA. ‘Four Seasons’ is beautifully animated but clearly suffers from a low budget, every time the camera is backing up and the close-up view is broken the quality of the animation drops like a brick. This does not happen too often though and the beautifully animated parts more than make up for it.Well, unto the stories themselves then!Spring: Cherry Blossom Memories’This story felt very natural and well-paced. Both characters have their personality showcased quite well and the guy, for once in anime, is not a completely passive entity nor overly macho. The constant doubts of Yukimasa as to what this girl meant to him were entertaining and made me question whether my preconceived notion that she absolutely must be his love interest was correct (I will not spoil this!). The story has a sweet atmosphere emphasized by some rather good background music. The places visited in this short are also the more interesting and beautiful of the bunch though that of course is personal preference.Summer: ‘Saitama High School Broadcasting Club – Saitama Summer Travel Guide’This comedy lacks humour, while good for a smile here and there it is never really funny. The problem with the humour in this comedy is that there is not nearly enough exaggeration in the jokes to make them work. As the late (and great) George Carlin once said, jokes are all about exaggeration and if there is none or too little the joke simply will not work. While the Captain certainly has an edge to her character she too fails because of under-exeggeration. The way in which the Cap was used was also questionable, she is the one who has to be in every joke while the jokes are very different from each other in style this leads to a very confusing character with no, or unlimited which is just as bad, identifiable characteristics. The ending is once again a redeeming factor but that can’t save this short like it will ‘The adventures of Higan the Brave and Princess Liccori”.Fall: ‘Adventures of Higan the Brave and Princess Licori’This story is kind of hit or miss depending on your tastes. While ‘Adventures’ has a certain cuteness and maybe even some goofiness to it the story is kind of dull and predictable and the humour is riddled with clichés. The ending to me was a redeeming factor adding quite a little bit of charm to an otherwise very dull and rushed tale with little going for it except for its cuteness.Winter: ‘Robai’ or ‘Winter Sweet Home’The winter episode has its charming moments and is nicely animated. The story really speeds to its ending which makes it feel rushed and an unnatural transition, making this the only episode out of the four that really suffers because of its length. Though that ending is rather well done. There is even some room for character development for the father, who seems weak and clueless in the other parts of the story but suddenly develops a personality at the end. The only thing off about the ending is the music, which sounds too sweet to be used in a scene where a girl is shouting at her dad and only matches the very end of the scene.VerdictThis advertisement strategy should be employed by more areas trying to attract tourists. The summer episode was the only one which failed to captivate me, but had I stumbled upon it between two TV-programmes it would still have won my personal ""Commercial of the Year” award. The stories are beautifully written and while the animation cut some corners when the producers thought they could get away with it, it managed to convince when it wanted to.";Recommended
0;Dousou Kai Again;Roy_Focker;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Roy_Focker;6;I like the prequel of Class Reunion Again that goes by the name Class Reunion: Yesterday Once More although I didn’t agree with the ending but that another story for another time…Class Reunion Again is made up of two episodes that share the same premises but are totally unrelated. Both stories begin in a class reunion, with Tatsuya focusing his attention on a certain girl.***Spoilers***1. Tatsuya and Mizuho see each other after a long time and discover that both of them have remained unattached over the years. Sparks fly and the two develop a relationship during the course of a ski trip which their class subsequently organizes.2. Tatsuya and his childhood friend Ayu's constant bickering incite teasing from their classmates. Ayu comes to realize that she's in love with Tatsuya, but Tatsuya seems oblivious to her feelings and continues to treat her as just a buddy.Predictable and clichéd, there's really nothing special about Class Reunion Again stories. What it does is play up is romance in all its sweetness, eventually climaxing to a tender first-time sexual encounter between the couples.The art and animation are average. Sex is depicted with a lot of warmth, such that you can truly consider it as lovemaking rather than just the usual mindless banging...In conclusion Class Reunion Again is a great choice for peoples who want to get their partners to watch a hentai without turning them off the genre.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shin Kujakuou;Anime-General;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anime-General;4;I've seen both anime adaptations of the Spirit Warrior OVA's and I consider this two episode OVA to be the better of the two. Don't misunderstand me this is still a bad anime, but it feels like its a somewhat complete story.From what I gathered the plot is this is an alternate universe where Nazi Germany is still around and an evil Nazi named Siegfried von Mittgard wants to still some magical power from a priest named Kujaku. Its your standard save the world from an ancient evil with the chosen one trope and his ragtag group of characters to help him fight evil. That said it goes into other tropes later on in the anime and then stupid moments that happen later on in the anime, that to put it simply went like I shall save you by maybe killing you. The story feels disjointed at parts and when its not it drags out its run time with exposition and or pointless violence filler.And because of that standard plot, the characters don't have much depth to them and that doesn't help that the English dubbed that I listened to had some of the worst voice performances throughout, some performances for characters were so bad that it mad me happy to see those characters on screen, especially Haushoffer was to me the gem of bad German accents.The animation is fine for the most part as its early Madhouse, even when do they bad anime it looks good. The soundtrack was fine for background noise and well I just didn't remember any memorable track at all.So to finalize my thoughts, its an anime from the 90's and if you like supernatural horror anime made in the era then you might like this anime. And its up your choice if you prefer to listen to the bad English dub or not.;Not Recommended

Well, from my point of view, everything. Boring scenario, failed humor, annoying characters.By the way, while we're on the characters, let's talk about the boys, because if it's reverse harem, the story is supposed to be about them.

But you may say : ""Who cares if they can't do an addition, if they're hot, then it's good."" Then let me tell you one thing. The chara-design was so bad that I thought that someone had throwed up on my screen.And that's not all. The anime try so much to be a good reverse harem anime that it become ridiculous. All the characters are clichés of themselves, and it's so bad that it's not even funny.I can't even say that I was disappointed by this anime, because I never had great expections for it. I just feel like I have wasted my time.I rarely give such low notes, but this time I can't force myself to put on top of 2.

0;Idol Project;Timz0r;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Timz0r;5;"This anime comes from the source of a visual novel, more specificly the second visual novel Idol Project 2 for PC back in 1995 because there are in fact at least two visual novels of this so far I've done my research. I don't know if those are translated in English, but I assume they are not. Don't count on it; I have pretty much zero expierence with reading visual novels in overall.This OVA is done by Studio OX. If you haven't heard of Studio OX before, fear not, I got you covered. It's founded by Atsuhiko Sugita in 1985, Studio OX was originally a freelance art studio that produced more ""anime styled"" Transformers art for TV Magazine and Comic Bom Bom throughout the early years of Generation 1 in Japan. While the populairity for Transformers was declining at the time, in 1991 they became a company, providing production and conceptual artwork for various anime, primarily for reboots of older franchises, such as Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier, Tekkaman Blade, and Getter Robo: Armageddon. They also created some short OVA series like Wild Cardz and now this OVA. Lastly they have animated a few hentai as well of course as their assumed struggle in order to survive, which is honesty not that suprising how rough the anime industry really is. The founder Atsuhiko Sugita left the studio in 2000 and the company was declared defunct in 2003.Story: (3/10 Very Bad)The story starts with 14 year old Mimu Emilton that wants to be an idol and then ... yeah, a lot of mumbo jumbo happends. What story? Was there a story? I honesty don't know. Let's be honest, after a while I had the mindset not to think about it and just enjoy all the nonsense that was happening on my screen and it became a lot more enjoyable and bareable to watch. It's one of these ""don't think about it"" anime, you see. Let's go with that. There's no need to act like a 'pretentieus elitist' and what not and thrash this anime into the ground, but just some humble opnions. In the end of the day these opinions in reviews don't even matter anyway and I don't want to crack my head around it iether. I have more important stuff going on around my head.It all depends how how much you actually care for a story in the long run. It's probably somewhere in there and it's not at all on the levels of famous novelists and you might find more story in the actual visual novels. I just don't know. Maybe you'll find more story in the actual visual novels. This anime is pretty much a barrage of nonsence with fan-service sprinkled around. I was honesty more busy enjoying the visuals, which was for me the best part.Art: (7/10 Good)While visual-wise it is what you can expect from the '90s. Not that good in modern times (and even then, even modern anime can look like utter dog shit like half of the time - there, I said it), but for at the time if you take in concideration of the time period it was made still pretty decent. Maybe it's just my nostalgia bias talking of the kind of animation I got used with when I was a kid. Mind you, I'm a late 80's kid, so yeah. Still I'm not a fan of these even more enormous shoujo anime style of eyes back in the day and I'll probably never will. I'm honesty glad the Japanese has moved away from that kind of design from the most part. Is it cute? Aw, hell no and it never will for me. It's a bit unappealing if you tell me. But if you can appreciate cell-animation from the 90's, you can enjoy this on the visual department. Yeah, back in my day the Japanese drawed their anime by hand and none of that computer generated bullshit nowadays. Deal with it.Sound 5/10 (Average)Not really sure what I can say about the audio. It felt a bit lacking here and there, but then I also had some very fun expierences at other times I just had to smile from enjoyment from the sounds they were using. Voice acting is done OK for the time being, but that's about it really. No mayor huge awards to be handled here, but I've expierenced much worse voice acting and other audio related isseus in other anime. Just don't get high expectations and it will be allright. The same can be said with the charathers, mind you.Charathers: 5/10 (Average)The charathers, well, there all very basic from what I've seen. You have the ordinary protagonist, a silly goose which is also a martial artist which was honesty my most favorite one of the bunch, a small girl, an obvious lesbian, the young but elegant lady, the bad-ass girl with an electric guitar, a traditional religous girl and a young female that seems to like cats. It is what it is; I guess. Very bland, but I felt the charathers together combined with all the nonsence that was happening fitted together. For the bit that I've seen at least. If you're hoping on character development; are you for real? It's only like two hours of length in total. You really can't do much with that ammount of time. Even though they may sound all so bland, in overall it was still an enjoyable bunch of charathers.Enjoyment: (6/10 Fine)In overall it was enjoyable. At least after the bit I just stopped overthinking about it and just starded to enjoy the content in general. It even managed to make me laugh out loud for at least two times just because from all the sillyness that was going on. There's also plenty of fan-service if you're into that kind of thing. I'm not judging you. If you're a (pretentious) prude, this anime is most likely not for you, because lots of swimsuits and a bit of nudity and some ecchi jokes that will be shoved in your face.Overall: 5/10 (Average)So yeah, should you watch this 2 hour long in total OVA from 1995? In summery it all depends who you are and what you like to be honest. If you like something that starts as an idol story, but then suddenly you're watching the charathers dealing with mindless mumbo jumbo with fan-service as a cherry on top; go ahead. Go ahead and watch this mindless silly OVA. If you care about a deep story and development, you're probably going to have a hard time watching this and I'll advice you to stay away, you filthy casual.";Mixed Feelings
0;Idol Project;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;3;Today we'll be looking at an OVA from the mid-90s. Idol Project was a work by Studio Ox. If you haven't heard of them, it's not surprising. They've mostly done production assistance and design work on anime spear-headed by other studios. I can't say I've ever seen an anime where they were the driving force before. So, this'll be a first. It was written by Amano Hiromitsu & Arakawa Naruhisa. Arakwa may sound familiar since he wrote the anime adaptations for Spice and Wolf, Upotte & Terra Formars Revenge. Which isn't exactly a record to boast about since the best of those was Spice and Wolf and the other two were quite bad and sub-par respectively. Then again, those were adaptations and this is an original work. So, we'll see how he does with that.Story:We open with our protagonist, fourteen year old Mimu, going to the Starland festival for her idol audition. On her way there, she gets caught up in all kinds of random events involving the six excellent idols. She barely makes her audition and is about to sing when she and the excellent idols are kidnapped by aliens. From there, more randomness ensues.Therein lies the big issue with the OVA. The “humour” is based on random events happening. In the first episode, it's the random things while she's trying to audition. In the second, it's random events that happen during a highly haphazard competition. In the third episodes she's caught up in a bunch of inane nonsense while trying to make a delivery and randomness does not, in and of itself, equate to humour. Randomness can be funny when you have some kind of deliberate set up that ends in an unexpected non sequitur, and if you're going to have a lot of it you need a good pay off or a clever logic to it that works when you think about it. It doesn't work when everything that happens is just random nonsense. Consequently, the comedy largely just leaves you scratching your head or rolling your eyes rather than laughing.The best thing I can say for the OVA is that the comedy is largely inoffensive. It's stupid and it barely registers as comedy but it isn't actively annoying, for the most part.Characters:There's really nothing to the characters in this. They're only one step above your average harem characters. They're all very basic archetypes. You've got the dumb martial artist, the child, the obvious lesbian, the bad girl, the elegant young lady, the tranquil Buddhist & the ordinary protagonist who manages to have big dreams in lieu of a real personality. At least they didn't do the Baka to Test thing and make fun of the obvious lesbian because... someone being gay is inherently funny?Here's the thing about under-written characters in a comedy. They can work if you can give them dynamics that offer a lot of comedic possibilities and you take advantage of those. In this series, we don't get that. The comedy is based less on the character interactions and almost entirely on the random events. So, having under-written archetypes for characters doesn't work in this context.Art:The artwork and animation in this are frequently lazy. The parts where they seem to put the most effort are the ones designed to be fan-servicey. Because when you have a fourteen year old protagonist it's vital to see her panties because... class is something for other works.I've seen so many trashy, fan-service heavy portrayals of way too young characters in anime at this point that I'm probably on some government watch list. And people wonder why anime fans have a bad reputation. It's this sort of thing.Sound:The performances in this are kind of weak. They got some good actresses. Hisakawa Aya, Kanai Mika & Inoue Kikuko are all in this. Their performances in this are just lacklustre. The music is decent but really could have used more effort considering that this is an OVA about idols.Ho-yay:There's a little bit with Corvette and her clear interest in our heroine but there's never any sign that it's reciprocated.Final Thoughts:That's Idol Project, a stupid, unfunny OVA from the mid 90s. Ultimately, the series is one that just falls short in every regard. The characters are weak, the comedy is weak, the acting is weak, the art is generally weak, at times delving into outright trashy territory. It's a dumb little OVA that I can't really recommend digging up. My final rating is a “solid” 3/10. Next week I'll look at something a bit longer with Kill Me Baby (That's the name of the anime, put the blunt objects down.);Not Recommended

The BGM just made everything worse, very loud and very distorted.The BGM got towards the end worse and worse I really had to completely look away because at that point I even started to gag.

If your goal is to use it as a low level torture device good pick! Frankly, i don't think the creators nor the directors could watch this on a loop cycle without suffering from some form of stress.

It's short, but I can't say its form dominates over substance, or that its substance dominates over form. It resembles more of a shapeless blob. Extremely intense flashing lights with random images and drawings presenting random shapes and creatures are unbearable to watch in the normal speed of this movie. It actually can cause a seizure or a terrible headache.However, I decided to give it a try anyway, and I completed the whole movie by lowering the speed by 2x.

Some scenes have awkward perceptive, this was originally released for a Japanese video app and as such it is made vertically in portrait mode. This is not so bad and understandable the episodes are rather short a a total of 3 minutes. The voices of the characters are fine and fit to what i imagined they would sound like in the manga.I understand this is a ONA but i don't see why this adaption was necessary other than voices added to the characters it does nothing.From my knowledge there are no English subs but the Japanese is rather simple to understand if you have studied Japanese or even watched a large amount of anime you should be able to understand most of voice lines.This is a retelling on the manga with lazy animation.

And that's the most important part of a comedy.Art- 6/10These are animated scenes straight from the manga. There is hardly any ""animation"" to them. But in the short time frame in which they're thrown at you, they tell the story and you get a colorful expression of the story as you go.Sound- 7/10The voice acting is pretty good for these shorts. They also came up with a catchy little intro song for our anti-heroine, General-san.Character- 6/10There just isn't enough time with any of these episodes to develop any of the characters. You get an understanding of the dynamic between the General and Braveman, and that's enough for the jokes to come off.Enjoyment- 8/10The most important part, IMO is enjoyment. The jokes come off well, if you don't blink. If you speak/read Japanese I'm sure you get a better experience from this over all, but these are entertaining.Overall- 6/10Just skip these and read the manga. If you blink while trying to watch these you'll miss some detail, or you'll have to pause to catch notes about something important. They don't really do anything to enhance the source material.

0;Docchi mo Maid;TheAngryNerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAngryNerd;5;"As I was going through my horrifically long Plan To Watch list, I stumbled upon this 13 minute OVA with a low MAL score. I figured, ""Hey, it's 1:00 am, and I have school tomorrow and I can't stay up too late but I still want to watch something, this is perfect!"" And perfect it indeed was, because I have unearthed this wonderful, shit-stained diamond!Review:Story/Plot/Writing: It doesn't even have a story, nor is there an overarching plot or end-goal, really. This feels like a pilot episode more than anything, since it just presents the viewers with a simple premise followed by next to no narrative substance whatsoever. Apparently, these maids are androids from outer space or something, and they serve a random 12 year old girl who's in middle school and they protect the city from monsters, and that's all we know about them. I'll let the narrative part slide since this doesn't try to be a story and goes nowhere.Characters: As shallow as the story, which just so happens to be as deep as a a hole in concrete made using a plastic spoon. You won't get anything from these characters or the story.Art/Animation: The art looks very shitty, I bet I could make something better than this, and that's saying something! These look like an amateur's second attempt at drawing anime in their sketchbook with color. It's not anything horrible, but is still very bad. At least it can look cute at times! The backgrounds are also awful. The animation is actually surprisingly smooth at times, which is very nice.Sound/Music: It may have been the video player I used, and I'll use this segment to mention that the video player was at 144p so it may have affected the visual quality as well, but it's a short anime that takes very little of your time so it doesn't matter anyway. The sound quality was awful. The voice acting is good, and the music is decent, but the video player, I'm assuming, made it sound like dogshit... unless I'm wrong and this is the true quality of the OVA, which I doubt it is.Overall: This is one of those anime that's so bad, it's amazing. You won't find crap like this anywhere else and that's what makes these pieces of garbage so special. There is almost no substance, but it sure is entertaining (at least to me). I get the feeling that this was satirical, so it raises my score a bit, because when you look at it from that perspective, it's a whole lot better. I would give this a 2, but due to the lack of narrative and how much I enjoyed it, I'll let it slide. 5.2/10! Rounded to 5/10 for MAL score!";Mixed Feelings

1;Docchi mo Maid;JmePenseBonne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JmePenseBonne;2;This is a spoiler free (as much as I could) review of Docchi mo Maid and my first ever review, so please keep that in mind...Story - 2The Story was terrible and made no sense. The main characters are 2 girls that fight monsters dressed as maids to save the world from humanity and pollution... In the show, we see them fight a pervert monster that assaults women and, once its true identity is revealed, everyone suddenly starts to have pity for it and to want to save it, despite what it just did, because it's cute and a little girl is crying. That 180 made no sense and, since it's the only actual thing to happen in the anime, it made it lose quite a few points in the story department.Art - 2What is there to say that would be positive about the art... The animation looks so stiff and the art is inconsistent in the best of cases, with the line-work being particularly bad and almost looking random. Still it wouldn't be a 2 if it wasn't for the crowd we see halfway through the episode. It looks so bad I think even I could realistically reproduce in Paint and, at one point, to give the impression was bigger than it was they showed the exact same ugly picture with a shirtless guy for reasons I couldn't explain twice in a row.Sound - 3The sounds are taken from a royalty free sounds library at best and downright awful at worst. The quality of the recording of the main characters voices wasn't too bad, but once again, it's the crowd that shines in how bad it is, sounding like it was recorded with a broken laptop microphone. The only reason this doesn't get a 1 too is because the OP wasn't too badCharacters - 4The best part about the show, but even that's bad. The 2 main girls are literally pervert girls that always look like they are doing something dirty and are apparently OP from the one ''action'' scene in the show, that's it. Then there is a blue sphere that is supposed to represent the Earth I think and is apparently a guy, nothing to note here. Finally, there is the crowd, that GOD AWFUL crowd... Honestly, I feel like it was added in a few hours before the deadline and the anime would probably be more bearable without it. The characters were all boring and oversexualized for the sake of it, but I guess there was nothing TOO awful here and the chara. design for the main girls DID accomplish its purposeEnjoyment - 2Let's be straightforward, my enjoyment would have been non-existent if it went on for any longer then it did, but it only lasted 15 minutes and zombie_pegasus' subs on Youtube were pretty funny, so I will give it a 2.Overall - 2I have no clue why this exist, but it does. There is nothing great about it and it's one of the few titles I have a hard time finding ANY kind of redeeming quality for. I guess some could find the humor funny, but it wasn't for me.

2;Docchi mo Maid;Ayuima;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ayuima;3;Well, i had once been the only review for this anime but it was removed for i claimed it did not exist. But it appears by some miracle soon after i done so It was then finally uploaded to several sites. This anime is one of the Obscure and almost lost to time titles where some ( myself includes) drew the conclusion that it doesn't exist. But to the point, the anime is: Low quality, has not aged well, and has some pretty poor translations on the 3 different versions i seen. It actually is kind of a so bad its good and is short. We come a long way since its debut. But give it a try, i could have confused this for a newgrounds animation of old, but less funny.

0;Alice in Dreamland;raifuresu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/raifuresu;9;"As a big fan of the original Alice in Wonderland book, I'm often attracted to its multiple adaptations. The vast majority is not all that impressive, to be honest. I expected this one to not be so good as well, especially considering the low score and the negative reviews here in MAL. Boy, was I wrong.I'm not one to say stupid things like ""if you disliked (thing), it's because you didn't understand it,"" regarding any kind of media, but I really can't avoid thinking that the reason why so many peope disliked Alice in Dreamland was simply because it was very different from what they expected. It is a weird-looking movie, definitely something very different from 99% of anime. It can hardly be called an anime.But enough introduction, let's go to the review.• Story - 6/10The story is about Alice, a girl who loves reading. She is suddenly called back to the Wonderland she had already visited before. However, Wonderland has changed, it was invaded by an entity called Darkness, and the White Rabbit called Alice back so she can become the Queen, defeat Darkness and save Wonderland. It's a very simple plot, but it's enough.• Art/Animation - 9/10Here's where this movie shines the brighter. The animation looks weird because while it's said to be stop-motion, the movements were clearly made digitally instead of being actual stop-motion, so it looks kind of off-putting at first. But the art itself is fantastic. The dolls made by Mari Shimizu are simultaneously very beautiful and very creepy. The backgrounds add to the dark atmosphere. Overall, the art is unsettling, and that's what makes it so good.• Sound/OST - 10/10The sound is actually my favorite part. The OST made for this movie is very unique, the few songs that have lyrics, that are all connected to the story, fit the scenatio perfectly. The background music also adds to the dark atmosphere, while still being songs that are pleasant to listen. The background sounds and voice acting were also on point. The voice acting gave me the impression of watching a stage play instead of a dubbed movie, and I thought it was fitting since instead of moving drawings we had dolls ""acting"".• Characters - 9/10If you're familiar with Alice in Wonderland (and I assume you are) then you know the characters. Tthey are all here: White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, Cheshire Cat, Humpty-Dumpty, March Hare, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc. There's also the new villain, called simply Darkness, and among Alice's ""friends"" there is a lion that I assume that was borrowed from The Wizard of Oz, and an unicorn that I have no clue where came from. The characters don't really have any development, but considering you're supposed to already know them well, I don't think that was a problem.• Enjoyment - 9/10I thoroughly enjoyed this. Out of many Alice in Wonderland adaptations and reinventions, Alice in Dreamland was easily one of the most interesting ones. I think that if you are looking for something unconventional, strange and dark to watch, this movie is a good choice.";Recommended
0;Alice in Dreamland;Eanki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eanki;1;"Alice in Dreamland is one of the latest attempts at retelling the Lewis Caroll classic story, infamous for their rather senseless attempt to make sense of the nonsense that is the mad, wonderful world and story of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. To set itself apart from its predecessors, Alice in Dreamland upped up the ante in the madness scale. And by jove, they did it. What could be madder than dolls with mouths that never move, prancing about in the most cost-saving way possible, in various admittedly surreal, bizarre, and horrifically beautiful backdrops, to play a patchwork failure of a story?The MacGuffin of the story is the status of “Queen of the Stories”. Why is it significant? How can it help conquer the ""Darkness"" that’s also never explained? What were they on when they made this? Some things we’ll never know.We have over a dozen characters randomly thrown in while the story is running with little to no purpose, character, or motivation. They just lift them straight out of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and smashed them together in a boiling cauldron that moonlights as a chamber pot. They're not characters. They're afterthoughts designed to occupy the space of a scene. They play so little significance for the amount of screentime they got that you could cut the numbers down to half and still retain the story.And when I say story, I am just being polite. It’s a loose progression of events made up of dolls awkwardly shambling and talking about things that should have at the very least leave you mystified and interested even if it doesn’t make any sense (it doesn’t). It’s not engaging in the art of story-telling. At best, it’s merely explaining why one thing happened or needs to happen. At worst, it’s just plain nonsense.This is just nonsense. It's amazing how, in trying to give conventional structure to a source story hailed as literary nonsense, they made it even more nonsensical.";Not Recommended
1;Alice in Dreamland;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;"Alice in Dreamland is an independent anime film from 2015. Of course, it's based on the classic novel, Gulliver's Travels. You can just tell from the name. Let's dive in and see how it goes. Story:Alice is a young girl who loves reading. One day, she's approached by the White Rabbit, who she recognises from stories. He needs her to come with him because Wonderland is being consumed by the darkness and if she doesn't come help them, Tim Burton will make it grim, gritty and irredeemably stupid forever. Thus begins the quest to save the beloved classic from Tim Burton. And you might say ""Ktulu, they're saving it from the Darkness, not Tim Burton."" But if you think about it, the Darkness wants to twist the story into a grim, gritty version. Which sounds like Tim Burton to me. The biggest issue with the film's story arc is that it's full of turns that aren't well developed but are kind of obvious. Alice going from saying that she can't do a lot to fully embracing her role as the saviour of Wonderland. The whole thing with the Knight. It's all stuff you can easily see coming but the development surrounding it is pretty weak. On the positive side, I do kind of like the idea of the Wonderland characters rising up to save their world from the dark, grittiness brought on by Tim Burton so that they can make it bright, colourful and fun again. And we do have to consider that its target audience is children. So, we can't be too harsh on it for having simplistic writing. Characters:The cast is very simple. The film kind of relies on you being familiar with Alice in Wonderland and doesn't really bother doing much with most of the characters. And Tim Burton is just a typical kid's film villain. He wants to engulf Wonderland in darkness and make everything grim to compensate for his insignificant genitalia. What, you thought the people writing dark and edgy versions of light-hearted media were just stupid? No, they're all compensating.I will say, even for a piece of children's media, the characters are overly simplistic. There's no real difference between The Hatter, the Dormouse, The March Hare, The Lion, The Unicorn or the Tweedles. At least in terms of personality. Art:One one hand, I give the art style credit for being unique. On the other hand, it's pretty off-putting. The characters are dolls and the backgrounds, while weird, look like paper backdrops. It's not really an attractive style and it's not one that you can really express emotions with since the characters always have the same expressions. Sound:The acting is a bit exaggerated but works well enough. It's not so overdone that it makes it difficult to listen to. The theme tunes are a little annoying. They're that variety of anime tune that involves a lot of high notes and random English phrases. Ho-yay:There's no romance whatsoever. Ho-yay or otherwise. Areas of Improvement:1. This would honestly work better if Alice spent less time trying to reject the call to action and there was more time spent on those turns instead. They could be much better fleshed out that way. 2. Differentiate your characters. A couple minutes spent giving each of the Wonderland denizens more personality would really help the world seem more vibrant and raise the stakes of Alice's battle against Tim Burton. 3. Better theme tunes. Like I said, the ones they have are pretty annoying. It might be kind of interesting to start with something slower and a bit dark and end with a song that's much lighter and more vibrant just to make the tunes match the state of Wonderland. Final Thoughts:Honestly, I've seen much worse takes on Alice in Wonderland. The Burton films being the obvious examples. There was also that anime one with a bunch of consent-challenged lesbians I reviewed. If you can get past the doll art and you can appreciate the concept of saving Wonderland from the grim and gritty, you may well enjoy this one. For me, I really don't like the art style. I don't think it's unique in a positive way. I kind of like the concept, but I thought the execution fell short. So, I'm giving it a 4/10. I wouldn't go so far as to call it bad, but it's a bit weak.

0;Massugu ni Ikou. 2nd Season;Ranivus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ranivus;7;"Massagu ni Ikou is a heart warming 5 episode anime about the life of a dog in Japan. Mametaro is a crossbreed dog living with her master his whole life. The show is pretty much a slice of life anime and for what it's worth its a pretty fun anime.Story (Good) --- Character (Good)For anyone who has owned a dog or love dogs they will love this show. All 5 episodes have pretty common instances about life as a dog. Pure breeding, cross breeding, dog lifestyles, etc. Being a dog owner I easily related to most of the stuff they were talking about. Plus Mametaro looked kind of like my golden retriever. Of course this anime is geared to children so each episode has a &quot;moral&quot; for every episode. Although its common knowledge to most, it's good information if you're planning on getting a dog. My only grip is the drama is a bit much.Art (Fair) --- Sound (Fair)The artwork is pretty standard fare. But you can tell most of the money was spent on the dog art and animation. The humans all look like bishonen rejects man and woman alike. But the dogs are detailed right down the little 'x' on their butt holes (they could have done without that honestly) but you can see all theri pads and nails on their feet, the collars have their buckles and tags and such. Their comedy faces are also hilarious as well. The music is pretty good. The op song starts off pretty happy and upbeat to set you in the mood to watch. The seiyus are all play their part great, especially the dogs. And the background music is usually a light hearted song.Overall this is required viewing for all dog viewers alike. When I think of an anime centered around dogs this is what I expected.";Recommended
0;Jigoku Sensei Nube: Gozen 0 Ji Nube Shisu!;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;7;"Being the 2nd film in the Nube series, this is the best one out of its trilogy as it contains the most horror elements with a villainous clown voiced by Nakao Ryusei (Frieza, Mayuri, Caesar Clown, Carlos Rivera.)Hell Teacher Nube 0 a.m. follows the life of the new transfer student named Jun who has this fascination with clowns. At the start of the film, Jun gazes at his mirror which contains his clown friend often referred to as ""Pierrot-Kun"" (French for Clown). Pierrot claims to be his friend although he's only manipulating Jun for his freedom from the mirror.The movie begins much like the set of a horror film building on tension & atmosphere with the occasional angle shots to further emphasize the horror tone. Jun gets bullied which forces him to seek trust in Pierrot and in return assures Jun that everything will be alright as he'll deliver payback to those who done him wrong.Unlike the first film, Nube has more of a role in 0 a.m. as the 2nd half of the movie is from his point of view where he battles Pierrot to rescue his students. 0 a.m. delivers on some action & B movie qualities as we are dealing with a demonic clown & certain clown themed weaponry.Overall this movie feels what a Nube should be with its blend of horror & comedy & the occasional heroic antics of Nube. Not much to say other than it feels like an alright horror film, far from being the scariest thing you'll see but certainly has this charm to it especially for fans of the anime.";Recommended

1;KochinPa!;Zzyli;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zzyli;4;KochinPa! is an anime series with 15-second episodes starring 3 idol characters, which has been made to advertise Pachinko machines. Each episode features a simple gag or joke.The series has been animated using 3DCG, and has lively, colourful visuals. There's not a lot of motion and the same setting is reused throughout the series, but owing to the short run time it doesn't grow too stale.It's very difficult to compare this to other anime owing to the exceedingly short run time. The script was written by Suguhara Souta - the writer behind gdgd Fairies and I definitely could see some similar off-the-wall humour using limited resources. A few of the episodes gave me a good giggle.I mainly enjoyed KochinPa! for its uniqueness, and while I don't think that it was ground-breaking as regards visuals or story, the fact it managed to do anything at all in 15 second blocks is rather impressive. I'd really only recommend this to others if you like watching series for their novelty value. If nothing else, the fact that all 12 episodes can be watched in 3 minutes (plus the time taken between videos) may be all the incentive you need.;Not Recommended
0;Gakuen Sodom;plxxl;https://myanimelist.net/profile/plxxl;7;This review is of the English dub, but most elements discussed should stay true regardless of which language version you watch.Warning: Professor Pain involves adult oriented themes such as violence, suicide & terrorism and is not appropriate to young audiences.Professor Pain follows the titular Professor Ohse during a hostage situation of his orchestration at his workplace Aoi College.The runtime is fairly short with only 2 episodes á 30 minutes.As the story progresses we get to know the main character, his motivations and his past through the events transpiring and past events shown as flashbacks. The character starts out menacing and mysterious in the early scenes, but as his backstory is fleshed out and explained we can start understanding him.This leads to the story overall going full circle, making the character's choice of actions understandable and through that the story can easily be made sense off without major holes.The exception to this is the many side characters. They do not have the privilege of being the center of attention storywise, and do not get the screen time needed for the viewer to really get to know them. This makes their behaviour hard to understand and sometimes erratic, because we never get any insight in who they really are. This is largely because of the short total runtime, and a few more episodes would have helped this out profoundly.The artstyle is concise and follows the same standard of quality throughout the whole series. The animation is very fluid with the exception of the last frames, which alternate between art frames and black narrating frames. This change of pacing looks somewhat outlandish when compared to the rest of the show, but still manages to encompass the final events transpiring.Sound and voice acting is very immersive and the English version has a fairly last cast of voice actors, most performances are not very remarkable, but also has very limited amount of dialogue, so there's not much opportunity for it to shine. Looking at it from the opposite view, there's none of the voice acting that stands out as being particularly poor, it rather fits the dialogue very well and immerses the viewer completely. A couple of the more comedic lines are exceptionally delivered and needs to be commended.To summarize, even though several of Professor Pain's aspects aren't outstanding, but merely average, there's nothing that stands out because of poor quality. This combined with the voice acting often giving great delivery of the dialogue makes Professor Pain a very enjoyable watch.;Recommended

1;Yuusha Shirei Dagwon;Mango-man-dangO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mango-man-dangO;7;"Dagwon, the penultimate and 7th entry in the brave series. By this point in time the brave series had gone with several themes, including trains, treasure hunting and the police force, but what makes dagwon stand out from those previous entries?. Well...basically its SUPER SENTAI/TOKUSATSU inspired theme. From pure concept alone, dagwon may just be my absolute favourite in the whole of the brave series, however in execution dagwon isn't really all that impressive.Story - 5When I said 'SUPER SENTAI' inspired I really meant it; dagwon's story feels like its been flat out ripped off of a toku series. With a mysterious alien empire led by Ark seijin invading earth, its up to a group of teenagers with attitude (literally) En, Kai, Shin, Yoku, and Ryu recruited by brave seijin to save the world from destruction. If you're familiar with toku or even power rangers this set up should sound very familiar to you. Whilst the is pretty predictable; with new mechas, team members, gained along the way, resulting in more villians revealing themselves from the shadows and some casualties in the main cast, dagwon isn't at all groundbreaking in terms of its story and what i deem the weakest element of the series.Art - 6From the designs of the mecha alone, Dagwon probably has some of my favourite designs in the whole brave series (particularly 'Shadow dagwon' and 'Dagfire'). With the legend himself kunio okawara credited as the main mechanical designer, the blocky, bulk look of the robots with some bright popping colours to go along with them, the mecha of dagwon are excellent in my opinion. The henshin suits/devices of the dagwon members aren't of anything to note really, however the actual character designs are another story.Compared to previous series entries, dagwon seems to have opted for a more realistic and plain design for its main cast of characters compared to a more stylized and cartoony look seen in the likes of Goldran or Might gaine. Aparently with the young females of its time, and that definetly shows in the character designs, with the more 'Bishounen' aesthetic for the main cast, its non my cup of tea, but it certainly isn't bad. The consistency of the designs vary between, but i genuinely felt like it looked pretty flat and dull, atleast untill around ep 37, where there is a sudden upgrade in art and animation which was certainly a treat.Sound/OST - 6Getting the sound design out the way first, it wasn't anything bad or that special, with nothing really standing out in that department in my opinion. The actual OST was ok, it doesn't have many stand out tracks (except for the OP and ED), and wasn't too memorable so I'll say it was probably the second weakest element of the series.Characters - 7By far the strongest element of the series, Dagwon's characters are very entertaining; the chemistry between the main dagwon members is pretty good, as they really develop into a team who can rely on one another in the most dire of situations (with the expected quarreling along the way). The auxilary mecha in this one did have some personality though, with gunkid and Lian get some good focus and a satisfying conclusion to their story arc. My favourite member overall was probably ryu, as he was pretty cool whenever he showed up along with ninja skills. My least favourite was probably Geki, as he was kind of annoying and definetly had my least favourite mech/design (however I did feel bad for when he didn't end up with maria in the end).The rest of the reccuring cast is nothing worth mentioning except for the ark seijin villan (who was pretty generic, and there's not much to say as we really didn't get a backstory for him and the villan trio later down the line) and maybeMaria and her little brother sometimes getting saved by the dagwon team, but other then that weren't that significant and maria especially was annoying and just hanged around the leader En alot.Overall - 7Dagwon definetly isn't my favourite entry in the brave series, but it has alot to like in it and those strengths really do help to raise its overall score to a 7 (because otherwise it would have been a 6.5 at best). Some strong characters and great mecha design, dagwon is highly recommended to big fans of mecha, tokusatsu or just big fans or just brave series completionists. Otherwise...i dunno....it was aparently popular with bishounen fans i guess...";Recommended

Or maybe, i am not EMO (for those not familiar with the term think emotionless).The plot to me:the final messages the girls had were important. Aside from that you have a feild tester per say who is uncertain what to do with life. Sure, he has the education thus far but education does not shape you life does. Each girl's encounter with the main character played a certain role at building up the character.I could go on and on how what i liked but i fear that i will spoil this so i will make one final note or suggestion.

This is the not very known Anime Mankatsu or Monkey Punch Manga Katsudou Dai Shashin in its long title.As a little disclaimer: If you don't like Ecchi stay away from this. This Anime is filled with very explicit content and full of gags related to this matter.Regarding the appearance of Lupin the III and his gang: Yes in every episode we have some short gags with Lupin the III and a few cameos in the stories. But all of them are - mute - and only last a few moments. If you are only interested in Lupin III you will be disappointed. The gags mostly are just the gang running away from Zenigata and nothing special.Story:Mankatsu is a great mix of many funny independent stories with many different characters from Monkey Punch. Every episode of about 50 minutes is composed of 2 independent stories in the length of a normal episode and short gags filling up the rest of the time. There is no story going on over the whole 12 episodes with the exception of a few settings expanding over a few episodes.The stories are short and fun. It's very easy going to grasp the many different settings and enjoy them. If you don't like one setting don't be discouraged there are many others and you will find your favourite. The stories were kind of predictable but really enjoyable for me.Art:The art looks quite a lot like the other works of Monkey Punch. It's alright for an Anime from 2005. The censoring of genitalia is done in a quite funny manner using the standard gender symbols. Beside that nothing is censored.Sound:Decent voice acting and a good sound. As far as I can judge the how Japanese sounds it fitted quite well to the characters. Only the music was repetitive. They shouldn't have used the same ones this often.Characters:Too much characters to talk about! Nearly all characters were really enjoyable and fitted well in the story. For a good number I wish they had their own series...Enjoyment:I really like the humour from Lupin III so there was no surprise that I enjoyed this. The episodic nature make it a great show to watch one episode at a time when you have some time to spare. No rush with cliffhangers forcing you to marathon the series. Funny stuff compressed in 50 minutes. The only things diminishing my enjoyment was that many jokes were based on wordplays in Japanese which were lost in the translation.Availability:I don't know if there are English subs for this (at least I didn't find them). After some searching I finally found a subbed DVD-Version on the French Amazon.;Recommended

I watched the first 30 seconds of it and immediately closed out of it and never went back.This did not do the H-manga any justice. Probably the worst adaption of an H-manga EVER. I think I'll just stick to the H-manga.";Not Recommended
2;Offside Girl;trashonthecurb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trashonthecurb;1;Remember those ‘motion comics’ they use to make? Where they take the frame of a comic and seemingly just edit it to make it appear animated? And it always looks… wrong? They’ve been made for Watchmen, Astonishing X-Men, and Iron Man — and in 2007 they made one for a hentai.Except, not only does it carry all the flaws of the halfhearted animation of “motion comics”, they take the lacklustre production value of hentai and don’t even animated simple things like lips.If you’ve ever been bothered or annoyed by Queen Bee animation standards, this is the next level of hell. It doesn’t even have a professional standards of colouring or line-art. This might as well be a cheap visual novel with some limited fake animation.The story is relevantly fine, the music hilarious (reminds me of JRPG battle music in some places), and the fetishes are mild.

0;Binghuo Mochu;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;3;"Magic Chef of Ice and Fire starts out with a classic revenge tale with an interesting twist: the protagonist Nian Bing who escapes the clutches of the villains at the sacrifice of his parents takes tutelage under a famous Demon Chef, after realizing mutual benefit in how combining the elements to make the perfect dish might also make him more attuned to elemental magic. It sets up a dichotomy where Nian Bing makes a promise to his chef master to travel the lands and become an esteemed chef himself, while escaping the hunt of the villains who were after his life in the beginning. With such a unique plot and an accomplished author (the same guy who wrote Soul Land and Throne of Seal), it unfortunately goes wrong almost from the beginning with the introduction of the first female sidekick or love interest. I mean, she's cute, but grows up into a massive tsundere, and that doesn't stop Nian Bing from picking up four more of these women in the first season (and more to come in the second), each more annoying than the last. To be sure, he isn't trying to date these women, he just wants to practice magic and learn about being a chef. But the women all want him, and he's too ""nice"" to reject any of them, often going way out of his way risking his livelihood to ""save"" them, leading to all sorts of misunderstandings that just serve to diverge from the main plot. And like Tokyo Revenger, it's clear the respective protagonists will never grow out of their habits of being stomped all over by every side character they meet. The most offensive girl is the last Nian Bing meets in the first season, who is a child that literally pouts and cries when he tries to get away from her, so of course being the spineless invertebrate that he is, he bends over backwards to be at her beck and call, even while strong enemies are honing in. And with that kind of horrible decision making, the fact that he escapes all punishment with silly plot armor just adds salt to the wound.This show is a great example of a great plot and great potential snuffed by the worst characters imaginable -- characters that don't learn their lesson, and still don't in the upcoming season 2. Minor spoiler, but not really, in the second season, Nian Bing runs into assassins who are after his life because the pair of sisters have bad past relationship issues (the dumbest backstory), and he ends up saving their lives!";Not Recommended
0;Seton Doubutsuki: Kuma no Ko Jacky;AishiCloud;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AishiCloud;9;I watched this anime as a kid and re-watching made me feel nostalgic. This story has made me feel a lot of emotions I don't feel often. Yes, it's an older anime but nothing went wrong. The art style is beautiful and so is the nature scenery. The characters in this anime are all meaningful and the ending is definitely satisfying. Unlike most anime, I also liked how they brought up awareness of hunting. Not a lot of animes talk about the lives of indigenous people which made me enjoy the anime even more. Although the main target for this anime is for kids, if you have the free time I definitely recommend watching.;Recommended
0;New Dream Hunter Rem: Setsuriku no Mudenmekyu;yoshihiro56;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yoshihiro56;8;This ova is a lot better than it's prequel. Both are different stories though. This one is basically frankestein all over again. A scientist related to Dr. Frankstein creates a better version of the monster frankestein makes. Then our main girl Rem is able to go into dreams so the doctor asks Rem to go into his creation's dreams and some crazy stuff happens. This is a unique anime that i found myself enjoying regardless of the low reviews. It has action, comedy, and some heartwarming parts all crammed into 50 minutes. It does it well though. It for sure won't be a waste of 50 minutes. But beware it has gory violence and some nudity.;Recommended

0;Inmu: Ikenie no Utage;futaluver;https://myanimelist.net/profile/futaluver;7;Well this being my frist shot at this cut me some slack.Imnu is a nice little piece its got a good dose of tentacle sex, bondage,rape, gangbang, masturbation, and what could be almost defined as futa yuri( if you count tentacles coming out of the groin of a woman to rape another woman. Its split into 4 chapters, none of which are we related.The first is about a girl who really paranoid about being watch everywhere she goes, haha with good reason! Shes raped pretty early on and it leave her really helpless, it really head fucks her (among other place rofl) This one is mostly tentacle sex, purply long tentacles, which have eyes at the ends of them, that kinda pop out of the foreskin, kinda weird when you think about that’s what penetrating you/her ( I like to put myself In the victims spot lol) but then again some people will thnk that’s hot so enjoy.The 2 nd story this one is about a real bitch, she works in fashion, and treats some subordinates like shit. So someone decides to teach her a lesson, she gets tied up naked In a public phone booth, a solid dose of bondage with some unwilling exhibitionism, later she get her just deserts from the offended man, who has back up from eyes tentacles, there a heavy pair of scissors involved for a while and I kept waiting for it to go too far, but it never did, thankfully.The third act is about a star swimmer named Izumi, who is crushing pretty hard on a fellow female swimmer named Aki. Enter the obsessive lesbian! Its all harmless enuff for a while, but then Izumi, decide she wants it all and cant wait, and with the help of the lovely eye tentacles, she takes Aki in the pool, now I love tentacle stuff but this kinda seemed like it was going to go snuff rather quickly lol, but it stays classy, well classy In the tentacle kinda way.The fourth story is really the most out there, its start with a woman in a room and she gets raped like a champ, but she cant remember why she is there or how long she has been there, but shes got this mysterious box, and in it a doll, a doll she shares her passion with, and in turn shares some creepy doll tentacle passion back. Woulda been hotter if dolls didn’t scare me lol.Well In the end it’s a good run. Sounds aren’t the best, the animation is solid, the story doesn’t flow but then again its suppose to be mysterious and vague. And its got a awesome masked dominatrix like announcer lol I recommended it. It’s a good watch, and if you like tentacles it’ll get yer rock off.Luv ya;Recommended

Tons of kick-ass ninja action, characters in super-powered suits that look cool as hell (think Ronin Warriors dialed up to 11), a very brisk pace, two factions going to war over the fate of the earth, a couple of twists that actually surprised me, appealing animation... this is just an all-around solid watch for anyone that enjoys stuff from this period of anime.

There is peeing though.Also the women aren't really lesbians, the only 'real' lesbians are the owner and her second in command.Conclusion:There isn't a story developement, it's all about putting on shows for the patients (and the viewer).If you like yuri and nurses then you'll enjoy this.Remember all the sex scenes are yuri, the women are not penetrated by any real penises.

Watch this show!For me, the binge was truly effortless.I would start the episode, a moment went by, and the ED would start playingThese were 14-16 mins long(excl OP&ED). It just sucks you in.I'm not lying when I say; There is movie level animation every episode.The fight choreography in show is just incredible. There's so much of it, so expertly done, it's impossible to get bored. There is so much attention to detail. You will be amazed at how well they revere fighting styles and techniques.Wow! the beasts in ""Fanren"", they scare me. They are beyond ruthless, no tea breaks you can't even breathe.Never have I seen animators respect every character, whether beast or human so well, everyone in this show is a threat. No one fights like an utter moron, beasts will relentlessly attack their enemies overpowering them with strength with ample intelligence. The animation conveys strength and weakness so perfectly.There's rarely any stopping to talk in fights breaking the captivation, it's so realistic. You will truly feel the struggle in the fights, the soundtrack truly amps the stakes and there's no pointless time-wasting in battle.The MC is a sight for sore eyes, a lot of his character is shaped from his experiences. The author displays their wisdom and prudence, there's great deal of understanding of human nature. You'll find yourself able to sympathize with both sides of every conflict. There's no evil bad-guy just clashing desires and ideals.Chinese donghua usually do power scaling quite well, however this show is a true distinction. It has probably, the best power-scaling and progression I've ever witnessed. There's no plot armor, they focus on what's important, having a well-thought out trade-off for many decisions taken. Many things are explained quite well, I was rarely confused.(Well unless you're not used to remembering the sea of Chinese names for the cast)While death is abundant, they keep the overall lethality of the cultivation skills quite low for this type of show, heavily restricting the general scale of the powers. This remarkably, does wonders for the immersion. The powers only get crazy at the very top and we're still no where near destroying planets or evaporating the ocean. Every tool is used extensively and well is accounted for.One thing the show does best, is that it's very focused on it's core purpose and story.It doesn't let the common editor tack-on tropes over-power the story, allowing the viewer to be engaged throughout. There aren't any filler arcs or entire episodes wasted on gag characters pissing about. The characters are many, but each are respected and are used masterfully. Notably, They're not afraid kill them off for good reason, however important they might be.All in all....There might have been a single solitary arc i didn't enjoy, the rest was wholly exhilarating.As with a lot of these donghua you actually learn something and gain some wisdom, this one doesn't disappoint.Animation? Best out there. Go watch episode 20-21 and tell me if you've seen much better out there.Characters? while fleeting they are well crafted.Story? Top tier. No faffing about, no agendas, just a damn good story.Sound? Top tier.Enjoyment? Best out there...11/10 but you can only give 10.Just watch the whole thing including S1 and you'll start talking like me, if only all CGI could be like this.I've never given a donghua a 10, but with this, it was impossible not to.Simply incredible, make haste and binge it.Hope this helps.";Recommended
0;Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!!;SGHope;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SGHope;9;Yay! My first review! :D Before I talk about the movie itself, I'll give some context about Healin Good Precure as a series.Healin Good Precure is the 15th generation of the long running magical girl series Pretty Cure (or Precure). While the series had a strong start, it faced a rough production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the first time (to my knowledge) Precure had to temporarily stop airing new episodes, which impacted the series as a whole and the two Healin Good movies. (This being one of them). This movie was delayed and didn't air until March 2021. After Healin Good had completed airing (hence why there is a quickly put together Tropical Rouge short at the end of the film). Despite the delays, Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!! is a wonderful film.STORY: 8/10The plot is pretty simple: our four lead girls are visiting Tokyo and obtain these cute (and obviously plastic) dream pendants. The little pink pendants allow them to create anything the dream of! New outfits? You can make them! Fish? You can interact with them! Food? Sure! (However there are limits on how much you can create at one time).From there the girls meet Kaguya! She tells Nodoka to leave in order to stay safe, but obviously Nodoka doesn't take the warning and BAM! monster attack! After the Healin Good cures fight for a bit to save an innocent civilian, the epic crossover aspect of this movie kicks in! The Yes 5 cures arrive!!! They're a real treat to see and we get some awesome action scenes with both teams.Once that first battle calms down, the Yes 5 cures promise to meet up with the Healin Good cures. Unfortunately, the Yes 5 cures get into a bind for most of the movie. Meanwhile, Nodoka and the other girls are enjoying their Tokyo vacation with their new friend Kaguya, who I will admit, it a very likable character. This part of the movie is very endearing. <3We soon learn that (*gasp*) Kaguya's adoptive mother is actually the villain (kind of?) and was working with the monster from before! Wow! Shocking! :0 (*sarcasm*) She is using their powers and the powers of other citizens dream flowers (I forget what they're actually called in the movie) to awaken the giant flower that can make the world a better place. After Kaguya realizes what her mother is doing to achieve her goal, they have a fight and Kaguya runs away.Kaguya's own power lessens as the movie goes on, causing her to become very weak. The Healin Good cures are now more determined than ever to save the people of Tokyo and Kaguya, in the hopes of celebrating her birthday with her the following day. Alas, things take a surprisingly dark turn. We learn that the energy Kaguya's mom had been collecting was FOR Kaguya. She wants to save Kaguya's life. :(The two make up, but Kaguya still doesn't approve of her mother's methods and orders the energy to go back to the rightful owners. Unfortunately, the villain from the beginning of the movie turns on Kaguya's mom, and puts up a nasty fight. The Healin Good and Yes 5 cures are able to save the day, Kaguya has her happy ending with her mom, and... that's it! Roll credits!We do also get a fun little short with the Tropical Rouge cures. It's cute, but doesn't add anything to the movie as a whole.Even though this movie is predictable, I really enjoyed it! Even made me tear up a bit. :,) However, I do wish we saw a bit more from the Yes 5 cures. Cure Lemonade is my favorite!ART AND SOUND: 9/10Both are absolutely wonderful! Especially considering the not-so ideal production of Healin Good as a whole.CHARACTERS: 9/10Although certain twists were very predictable, I really felt for these characters! Kaguya and her mom steal the spotlight in this department! I truly wanted them to continue to stay by each others side. So sweet!It was also so nice to see the Healin Good cures again. I wasn't fond of the way Healin Good ended, but I really enjoy the characters. Same with Yes 5, but once again, I wish they had more screen time.OVERALL: 9/10This film is very enjoyable for Precure fans. I would even say you might like it if you've never seen Healin Good or Yes 5 before! (Although you might be a bit confused...)This movie has a lot of heart and it was genuinely enjoyable. I'll definitely be revisiting this one. <3;Recommended
1;Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!!;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;7;"Anyone who's talked to me at all in the past year and a half will know I've made it pretty clear that I LOVE Healin Good Pretty Cure. I think it's absolutely one of the best Pretty Cure seasons to come out in recent years. It has its problems, and I still think Heartcatch is better, but I just adore it. So of course I was looking forward to the movie that was going to be released for it as well...until I found out it was going to be a crossover with Yes! Pretty Cure 5. First off: Why another crossover? The All-Stars movies already do that! It's bad enough the franchise felt the need to shoehorn in the main Cures for the next series into the finale of a previous one when it's not needed, but the standalone movies are going to be crossovers, too? Furthermore, I have not seen Yes Precure 5 except for the first episode, and I have no intention of finishing it because Coco's voice annoys the piss out of me. Also, didn't Yes Precure 5 almost kill the franchise because the second season turned out really badly? But regardless of my feelings about it, the movie Eiga Healin' Good Precure Yume no Machi de Kyun! tto GoGo! Daihenshin!! exists, and I figured I might as well watch it before passing judgment on it...and because I want to see my precious Healin Good girls again. Now having watched it...yeah, this movie pretty much reinforces why shoving in the Yes Precure 5 girls was a bad idea.Now for the overall story: Nodoka's mother takes her and her friends on a special trip to Tokyo to see all the sights, something they've been looking forward to for a while. They also get to see a special virtual reality entertainment experience invented by a famous professor by the name of Gashuuin and promoted by her young daughter Kaguya. But a mysterious demon named EgoEgo causes trouble, and with the help of Kaguya and a new group of Pretty Cure, the girls manage to drive it away for now. Nodoka and Kaguya become friends, and the five of them hang out together. But Kaguya is hiding a secret that could very well cost her her life, and her mother, knowing this, is determined to do all she can to save her, even if it means hurting everyone in Tokyo in the process. Surely there's a more humane way to solve things, right?Since this is a movie, of course it has a higher animation budget than the TV show does, and it certainly shows. The colors are a lot brighter, character motion is more fluid, and the action scenes are full of great choreography. This is especially notable for the Yes Precure 5 girls, as their show, which aired back in 2007-2008, was pretty notorious for...not having much of a budget. This is probably the best the Yes Precure 5 cast has ever looked throughout their entire existence. Also, can I just say how much I love the Healin Good girls' new costumes and power-up outfits? As one-off and Deus Ex Machina-esque as they were, why didn't the show make use of their Partner Forms?! Those would have been a great addition to the TV series, and it fits with the show's themes of animals and respecting nature! The soundtrack is nice as well, though nothing too notable.The characters are where things get muggy, and have about the same issues as the show. For one, the main characters absolutely steal the show, and the staff behind the movie made sure to capture the charm they had from the TV series. Surprisingly enough, Nodoka's mother received quite a bit of time in the limelight and was even given the chance to be a badass at one point, something I definitely appreciate. But similarly to the TV series, it seems to favor developing and fleshing out one villain over the other one, leaving the second one to just be yet another power hungry villain stereotype who's evil just for the sake of it. But the biggest victims of this were, in fact, the Yes Precure 5 girls. This movie reaffirms my worries about the movie being a crossover, as instead of doing anything meaningful with them and integrating them into the plot naturally, the movie just makes them into little more than plot devices that are just there to advance the plot and nothing else. This is especially jarring for someone who has never seen Yes Precure 5, so not only do they come off as extremely bland, barely being used for anything other than fight scenes, any viewers who haven't seen the show where they came from will just feel alienated, asking themselves ""Who are these people? Why are they here? How did they even get here? How do they know about the Healin Good girls? How exactly does Pegitan know where they're even from?!"" This is without even remembering that Yes Precure 5 aired between 2007-2008, and Healin Good came out in 2021, so any kids born after Yes's time won't know crap about them unless they found the show on the internet or something. I was told by someone else that the Yes Precure 5 girls being in the movie doesn't alienate viewers who haven't seen their show, but they're deluding themselves. Furthermore, the Yes girls only appear at the beginning and end of the movie, never interact with the main characters beyond action scenes, are only shown in their civilian forms ONCE, and don't directly affect the story in any way whatsoever. You could cut them out entirely and nothing would be lost, which gives credence to my argument that the Healin Good movie should have been a standalone movie JUST about the Healin Good girls, as the whole crossover aspect is the movie's biggest Achilles' Heel. There was literally no reason for the Yes girls to be shoehorned into the Healin Good movie in the first place, and the movie itself provides no in-universe explanation for their Deus Ex Machina-esque appearance anyway. Coco and Nuts in particular were especially useless, and their utterly awful, ear-bleedingly grating voices absolutely did not endear them to me at all. I'm so glad the movie didn't give them much in the way of screentime.For what it's worth though, the story was at the very least intriguing. I liked Kaguya and Gashuuin's arc and cared about their plight. However, the creators seemed to rely too much on giving the girls random power-ups that come right the hell out of nowhere, hand waving it away with ""Your strong feelings give you power!"" and some crap like that. Don't get me wrong, I love my kids shows as much as anyone else, but you can't just give special powers to the main characters willy-nilly, they have to earn it, and the story just seemed to pull them out of its ass. Even other Pretty Cure seasons managed to execute this better, like Heartcatch and Suite. Though the worst example of this is still Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure by far. At least in Healin Good, the girls don't get their power-ups by way of...well, dreaming about them while they're sleeping.So yeah, as much as I wanted to like the Healin Good movie more than I do, its writing decisions and shoehorning in characters from another show that contributed nothing to the movie wound up being its biggest problems. Not only that, Toei doesn't seem to want to stop making crossovers any time soon, as the upcoming Tropical Rouge Precure movie is going to be a crossover with Heartcatch. Now, I love the Heartcatch girls and all, but again, there's literally no reason for Toei to put them in there except as glorified cameos and to sell toys. That being said, I still enjoyed the Healin Good movie for what it did do. Could it have been better? Yes. Would it have been better if it wasn't a crossover? Probably, depending on the staff behind it. But I am satisfied with what we got, and I love my Healin Good girls, and they pretty much saved the movie from falling apart completely. I still think this should have been a regular standalone movie without the crossover aspect, but it's fine for what it is. Normally I'd say to only recommend this if you know about Yes Precure 5 or have seen both seasons of that, but considering the reputation that that season has for...not being very good in a lot of ways, you're not missing anything by watching this even without knowledge of Yes Precure 5. Honestly, I wouldn't want to subject anyone to the bad voice acting on that particular season for 100 episodes (Looking at you, Coco!!!).";Recommended
2;Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!!;RobloxElie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RobloxElie;8;This movie took me for a surprise. What do I mean? It’s the fight scenes! The fight scenes are up for the top in the movie that we’ve been missing for a couple of years already, especially the fall movie of Star Twinkle Precure which does not have tons of combat. This movie make up for the lack of it which is good. As I’ve watched this movie, I’ve noticed that it resembles more of previous generation Precure movies such as the charm of Precure has returns for some reasons. It’s probably the impact and more of violence being added in the movie which is missing with the more fun and lighthearted themes. This movie has collaborated with another Past Precure season which is shown in the movie cover and I’d say, they incorporated them in the fights well. They did lose some screen time and we didn’t get to see them interact with the current team after the battle which is a little disappointing but not too bad considering we’s already seen them join in the fights here and there. There is a theme message in the movie. Moreover, TOEI went all out of this movie and the fact that they brought back choking is already something. This movie is for people that likes the older Precure movies that contains a bit more violence and more hand to hand combat scenes. The plot of the story is a bit simple but it was meant for children in Japan to watch so bare with it and enjoy the overall story, fight scenes, and the ride.;Recommended
3;Healin' Good♡Precure Movie: Yume no Machi de Kyun! Tto GoGo! Dai Henshin!!;Melonada;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Melonada;7;This is a movie which Healin' Good fans will enjoy, but it does have flaws. It focuses on dreams and goals and has fantastical and sci-fi themes. The Healin' Good girls go on a trip to Tokyo where they take part in a virtual 'Dream-On!' experience. They meet a young celebrity named Kaguya but a wolf-like creature foils the show, intent on stealing people's desires.This movie is a joy to watch just for the animation alone. Detailed environments, cute characters, magical creatures, transformations and epic action scenes! The story also has plenty of cute, exciting and even emotional parts, even if it was kind of predictable. But I would prefer if it spent more time on character interactions than fighting. The villain plot also started out great but it left me kind of frustrated.As you can see, this movie is a cross-over, but sadly, I felt like this didn't really serve a purpose besides fan-pandering. The transformations too are gorgeous but loose impact when there are so many.But I don't want to be overcritical because this movie has more pros than cons and it's sure to keep you entertained all the way through.;Recommended
0;Kamyla;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;8;A crime organization of female sex trafficking is a real problem in the city.And someone had a brilliant idea: lets send a bunch of very attractive women with extremely short skirts to handle the situation, what could possibly go wrong?Well I must admit that these women are actually very skillful agents, they are not pushovers, they know how to think, plan, fight and shoot.But the problem is, like most female heroins in hentai, they always wear very reviling outfits and always get raped.Now I will admit that the short skirts do make it easier for them to run and kick but it's so revealing they might as well fight crime in panties.STORY: Im a guy who dislikes rape and gangbang, but despite that I am still able to rate this as very good because the story is interesting and it leads somewhere. Unlike some hentai with either no story, a shit story, or a story that doesnt really go anywhere.ART: The animation style looks old. But the women's naked bodies are well drawn. Nice breasts, nice curves, nice bush. The vaginas are very nice. Plus it's uncensored.SEX: I hate rape, but I did enjoy the sex scenes nevertheless. They are not too short, not too long. It gives you just enough, but not too long so you dont end up getting bored. Also the moans and sex talks weren’t annoying to listen to.CHARATERS: the 3 female protagonists are not simply damsels in distress. They are smart, strong, resourceful women.The villain, is very smart. He almost won because he used his smarts to destroy the headquarters from the inside, and even managed to escape in the end. (I do wish they had caught him, give me peace of mind)Episode 1,Agatha, the dark blue haired one gets kidnapped and it's up to the other 2 to rescue her (see cover art). She is exposed to the drug Kamyla which has the power to turn someone into a sex and mind slave. She is eventually rescued but the drug doesnt leave the system that easily.Episode 2,Koyomi, the green haired one also gets raped and gets a dose of the drug.Episode 3,Lyli, glasses and pig-tails also gets raped. But thats ok because they have backup: another squad of very attractive women with very short skirts...of course.Lyli does not get a dose of the drug. She eventually discovers a anti-dote.The leader of the organization, with Agatha and Koyomi under his control infiltrates and over runs the Special Agent headquarters, and its orgy/gang bang time.Luckily Lyli uses the anti-dote, the leader gets beaten but gets away.;Recommended
0;Isaku;Crowniko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Crowniko;7;"So, I noticed I've pretty much only reviewed shows I dislike, and I wanted to change that so... here's Isaku!The story:There's a rumour in Kenta's high school that the creepy old janitor Isaku Itou raped Miyuki's sister, which left one of the buildings boarded up. Soon Kenta, his friends, and the girls get mysterious letters telling them to go to said boarded up building, which they then promptly do assuming it's a prank by Kenta. Slowly but surely girls and guys start disappearing and then sex tapes involving them make the rounds to the remaining girls and guys who stuck together.It's essentially a kidnapping mystery where this fat ugly bastard kidnaps and then rapes one girl at a time.One of the coolest things Isaku does is use Kenta's friends against him, basically tricking his best friend into being a rape accomplice, which ends up causing some pretty interesting conflicts between the remaining members of the cast.The characters have fun moments, and all have at least a semblance of a personality, which is extremely rare for hentai and really makes this show shine. Some of the sex scenes dragged on for a little too long but in general the pacing was pretty good. The ending was a little dumb, it was good but I'm not sure if I'd be able to forgive my friend if he raped and ruined girl's lives because he was horny.The art/animation:Isaku is a Pink Pineapple production based on Elf's game of the same name from 1997. The animation was handled by ""Triple X"" which is a guise for Arms, known primarily for Elfen Lied. The show looks really good and the visual comedy in it works, all of that is helped by Hiroya Iijima's really cute character designs.Sound:The voice acting is all really good, but the music is rather generic. Most of it boils down to trying it's best to be suspenseful and it's extremely forgettable. Not bad but not really anything remarkable.Overall:I enjoyed the show despite the few flaws I outlined in this review and unless you really just dislike rape you'd probably enjoy the show too. It's got late 90's charm and it's an early Katsuma Kanazawa (R.I.P) work. Despite being a rather dark and demented tale Isaku manages to have fun moments and cool characters... which won't be the case in some of the other -saku series entry's (wink wink nudge nudge). Anyway, Isaku was fun, and I'll give it a solid 7/10. I'd say it's worth the watch!";Recommended

Are racist stereotypes involved? Yes. Does this mean you're doing literal violence and harm to actual human beings by watching this film? No.Anyone with half a brain can distinguish between different aspects of any creative work. This is an important historical artifact and can be evaluated on a variety of metrics. One can still appreciate certain features of the film without condemning the whole. And a thorough analysis involves such holistic consideration. Otherwise, how does anyone even read anything from the entirety of civilization's beginnings to, say, five years ago? If you can only condemn works that don't fit your exact current worldview then you are mentally a child.Love or hate this film, at least evaluate it on more than what you learned on Twitter the other day.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kumo to Tulip;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;4;"I see a lot of comments of the spider being blatant black face. But given the pre-occupation timing of the art piece, I'm hesitant to label the tag onto this short. Is there any evidence that it indeed was an attempt at racial fear mongering? The parallels are certainly there to see, but I am reluctant to ascribe intent to a work of a time period I am not familiar with intimately.However the racist stereotypical parallels are just too blatant to ignore. The spider is the literal definition of the ""coon caricature"" at work. The awkward contrast of the anthropomorphized ladybug having a typical Japanese lady appearance and the Spider having a coon face and smoking a cigar reeks of war propaganda of the worst kind - an employment of racist and xenophobic fear mongering to rile up the masses.The problem arises when it comes to ascribing intent. A lot of Japanese animators of this period were looking to Disney for inspiration and Disney itself was a terrible proponent of racist stereotypes in its own animated classics both before and after the time of this piece. As with other things that the animators took inspiration from, it is possible that they also acquired the coon caricature stereotype and the racist trope of the ""black person who rapes the suburban woman"" without realizing the poisonous connotation it carries. At the same time it is also possible that the animators recognized these issues and weaponized it for their own audience to consume.As modern viewers of an art reflective of its time, we must not only observe the intent of the author and their authorship, but also the cultural ramifications in the context of consuming this art today. It is important to keep in mind that these tropes, intentional or otherwise are poisonous and perpetuate real harm in society today and we must understand and call it out without rushing to immediate black and white judgements.";Not Recommended

0;Attraction;Faylicia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Faylicia;8;"Story:There wasn't any specific story in this anime. However, as this is not a normal anime I will have to review it a bit differently. The message behind this anime was really important, ""smoking is harmful"" that's what all the anime is about. This interactive anime made me feel really interested as anime have always managed to change my perspective of certain things. Personally I'm against smoking due to it's unhealthiness and the fact that it makes people spend lost of money. When I watched this anime I felt like it could inspire lots of smokers to quit their bad habit and also that's it's a real shame that it's not very popular. Finally, I think it depends on how the viewers perceives this, however I really liked the slight ""horror"" it had at the end, it became scary, smoking became scary, it makes people aware that smoking is in fact really terrible.Art:The character's art was mediocre, but it had this realistic feeling it it, not the tipical bishoujo or bishounen characters, or moe. However, what I mostly liked was the background, it was highly detailed and I can still remember those electrical stairs in the street and the giant statues of the geisha smoking, it was a very original setting, and the interactive elements made it seem as if I could be partly in that city.Sound:The sound had mysterious and intriguing effects. The noise at the end of the anime made it seem dramatic and thrilling.Character:Well, the poor development of the characters couldn't be helped since this anime was about transmitting a message to the public. It could have been better, I suppose, but that was a difficult task as this anime was extremely short.Enjoyment:I felt really amazed by this anime, I think that's the best word to describe my feelings towards it.";Recommended
0;Yousei Florence;Mr_Panda;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mr_Panda;7;"~Mr. Panda's VCR of Doom: #6~English-speaking members of MAL might recall this feature movie as ""Journey Through Fairyland."" The movie feature by Sanrio (the makers of Unico and Ringing Bell) was their last animated movie until just a few years ago. It tells the story of a faltering music student (Michael) who spends more time with the flowers in the greenhouse than with the orchestra. After being kicked-out, a fairy named Florence comes out of one of the flowers and takes him to visit fairyland. There he finds both love and his muse.The story is a bit simplistic, and is utterly predictable to anyone that has seen Fern Gully (and upon critical examination, I now realize where they got their inspiration. bonus points for inspiring an American movie). Being a children's movie--if a bit sophisticated for the very young--this is not very surprising. I would actually have scored the movie higher in this regard if it wasn't painfully anti-climactic. Apparently children weren't meant to notice this needless drawing-out of the film; and in retrospect I in fact did not notice as a child.The way I see it, the art in most portions of the movie is excellent. Obviously they ripped several pages right out of Disney's Fantasia, but there are enough added visuals of their own to overcome the similarities. For once I have to actually bemoan the fact that the VHS version is the only version around for America--thus much of the visuals are muted by the degraded quality of the tape over time. The art is amazingly trippy by the time they get to Fairyland, and we are even greeted by an all-too-familiar face as a cameo (which I will save as a bonus for those of you that watch it). The viewer is bombarded with music-related visuals and swarsm of fairies--to say nothing of the gigantic monster near the end.Yet again we must come to grips with the Fantasia playbook. With one exception; the movie soundtrack consists of classical music. This is quite likely by design, as the feel of the movie is that of getting kids to like the genre. The songs are well-chosen, at least. They settle quite nicely with the animation and even the corny introduction song (the only piece of discernibly original music in the movie) is not too difficult to sit through.The English dub is the only viable copy around, so there's not much I can compare it to. The script isn't very elaborate, and the voice actors perform their lines on about par with other VHS-release animated movies of the time.There are a grand total of five characters with lines/purpose of any note. All of them seem to be standard stock characters, from the tragic heroine Florence to the troublemaker Treble. Shallow characters are a notorious occurrence in children's movies, and this one is no exception. The movie was not designed with character development in mind, and there's really no other way to put it.My recent rewatching of Florence reminded me that (quite often) childhood movies are better in our memory than in actuality. Florence is actually a rather charming piece, and despite its flaws I enjoyed the viewing. It really is a kid's movie though, and thus I cannot easily recommend it to the average MAL user unless you are a connoisseur, looking for a classical music anime, or have a younger (12 or under) associate to watch with you.On the bright side, I would consider Flroence to be a very nice alternative to Disney's Fantasia. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie. However, Florence provides both a single plot and a continual stream of actual animation. Really, happen to know from experience that the introductions by Deems Taylor were not enthrawling for younger audiences. To put it another way, Florence is the very young's Fantasia.I don't expect anyone to seek this movie out; espeacily given that the VHS-only release continues to see price-gouging on ebay. However, if you do happen to get the oppertunity to view or own Yousei Florence, I encourage you to keep it as an animated treasure. At the very least, you can pass it off on your kids who will, I think, enjoy it more than we adult otaku ever could.Follow Mr. Panda's VCR of Doom at:http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=60585";Recommended
1;Yousei Florence;SnotPockets;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SnotPockets;7;Yousei Florence or The Journey to Fairyland is an enchanting and colourful experience. It is, or I believe it to be, an abstract depiction of Michael's thought process at a cross road during his life.Michael, the main protagonist, is a kind-hearted character who enjoys gardening but has passion for music too. This film feels like a slow discovery of his forgotten feelings for music and a compassionate departure from horticulture. The premise is interesting and is brought to life in a fantasy setting with the use of colour and music to give off a fairy tale vibe.I particularly liked that mostly everything was referring to Michael's decision, it felt like everything had a purpose. From the character designs to the way they were animated. For example, the MokiMoki were all liquid-like substances which represents how lazy musicians go with the flow due to properties of liquid. Although the visual connotations were intriguing, I was entranced by the wonderful tunes that blended in with each scene and mood.However, the editing was unnatural due to some scene transitions. The Fairyland section was nice but the real world setting appeared to be of minimal interest: characters shown for no reason, the area felt too quiet (perhaps due to fairy-like aspect of Michael's life) and some peculiar lifestyles (living in a greenhouse). Also, the story played out in a typical fashion albeit tailored for kids.Despite some peculiar references to Hello Kitty among others, though I don't know why, it was a beautiful experience for a 1.5hr film. It felt like a dream due to the contrasting of the two worlds and it was worth a watch. If not for the story and themes at least watch it for the cohesion between music and animation.;Recommended
2;Yousei Florence;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;8;Sanrio is well known for marketing their cute characters like Hello Kitty, My Melody, Batz Maru, and so on. But back in the seventies and eighties, they actually made very ambitious original movies that were considerably darker in tone than the image the company is known to project. Ringing Bell, Nutcracker Fantasy, the Unico movies, Sea Prince and the Fire Child, and the subject of this review, A Journey Through Fairyland, also known as Fairy Florence. I'm going to refer to it by its Japanese title, as the English one is too long to say. After finishing Sea Prince, Sanrio tagged Masami Hata to direct another original movie, and he was more than happy to take up the task. Unfortunately, he wound up getting too ambitious with Fairy Florence for his own good. The film took four years to produce, and it cost a lot of money to make, so much so that it basically caused Sanrio Films to shut down. Fairy Florence wound up being a bomb at the box office and there was no way it could make back the money put into its production. It didn't help that around that time, Sanrio wanted to move away from making big budget original movies and move into merchandising characters such as Hello Kitty for all they were worth. These are very likely the reasons why it's the most obscure film in Sanrio's movie catalog. But why did it fail to gather an audience?The story is a fairly simple one. Michael is a young boy attending a prestigious music academy. He's under a lot of pressure to succeed, as his late parents were famous musicians, but he can't seem to play his oboe during orchestra practice. He spends most of his days at the local greenhouse, caring for the flowers as if they were his children. But he's often late to class and ill-practiced, unwittingly becoming the class clown as a result. The teacher tries to be patient, but after one incident too many, Michael is kicked out of school. Crushed by this outcome, he goes to the greenhouse one last time...and meets a beautiful flower fairy named Florence, who reaches out to him and invites him to the magical Land of Flowers, where they can live in escapist harmony. But they have to find a way to get there without Treble, the mischievous sprite, and his gang of lazy musical blobs, the Mokomoko. But Treble winds up becoming the least of their problems.I first discovered the movie through an old article on Anime News Network, as I did other anime that I've come to like, but it wasn't until Discotek Media released it on DVD in 2017 when it came back into print. I immediately bought the set as soon as I was able. One thing Fairy Florence absolutely has going for it is the animation, which is simply incredible, especially by 1985 standards. Animated with one cel per frame, which is considered a very massive undertaking that not even Disney or Ghibli does. Every movement is smooth and lifelike, and the visuals absolutely burst with color. It's like it came straight out of the 1940s, which is apt considering Hata was a huge fan of Disney's Fantasia. The giant bug monsters near the end are especially well animated and visceral. Visually and musically, Fairy Florence is very Fantasia-inspired, with segments dedicated to characters dancing across the screen in musical montages with very impressionistic direction. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was a direct spin-off of Fantasia. The soundtrack mainly consists of famous pieces of classical music used to set the mood, atmosphere, and feel of the various adventures Michael experiences in the magical lands Treble and Florence take him through. One thing I appreciate about the movie is that it displays the names and composers of the various pieces used throughout the movie for anyone who isn't familiar with them, which is definitely a plus for me, as I've never heard of Offenbach's stuff, or singular pieces like Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, or Johannes Brahms' Hungarian Dance. Of course, composer Naozumi Yamamoto sprinkles in his own BGMs as well. The soundtrack is an absolute joy, and every piece of music used here works to the movie's advantage.However, pretty animation and a gorgeous soundtrack can't exactly hide the fact that the movie's story and characters are...rather trite and juvenile. The entire story is just Michael being whisked away into a magical land consisting of long scenes where flowers twirl, fairies dance across the screen, musical notes fly all over the place, and so on. The basic plotline is pretty thin, and Michael and Florence are rather bland as characters. Michael's just a kid who does go through decent development, but said development is pretty predictable for characters like him, and Florence is just an overly sweet, idealized woman who loves Michael just because and does everything solely for him. Treble is pretty okay, as he's just a mischievous sprite and probably the personification of Michael's love for music. Personally though, I think the movie works better if you imagine Treble and Florence being anthropomorphized personifications of his interests competing for his attention, and the worlds they create being metaphors for his differing passions. The musical sequences themselves mostly look pretty but don't further the story much, though one could argue that the story and characters were never meant to be the focal point of the film. Oh, and the English dub, while technically okay, is kind of heavy on hammy and melodramatic acting, name changes, and unneeded narration.So basically, Fairy Florence is just a gigantic love letter to Fantasia, putting more emphasis on the animation and music than the story and characters, and I can understand why Hata wanted to go hog wild with it and make this his personal magnum opus, even if it meant Sanrio couldn't make more movies like this ever again. Sadly, audiences didn't appreciate his efforts for this movie and it didn't make its money back at the box office. Not only that, movies like this one just can't be made in this day and age anymore, and it's a pity, because Fairy Florence showcases Japanese animation at its absolute zenith and was clearly made with a lot of love and passion that you don't see in modern anime. Of course, now it's more widely available thanks to Discotek rescuing it from obscurity. Basically, Fairy Florence is an avant-garde family art film that, while nothing to write home about in the story department, is visual poetry personified, and even if it may not be one of Sanrio's best films, I do think it deserves more love than it got, especially if you're an animation fan in general.;Recommended
0;Zhu Xian;defnx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/defnx;10;I think it's a great anime and this anime deserves 10 points. The subject of the anime, as in other Chinese anime, is the war between the sects and the main character's getting stronger. What makes this anime different from the others is that it shows that people cannot be totally categorized as good or bad. Therefore, the main character not only gets stronger, but also learns the inside of the cults that call themselves good and accuse the other side of evil and evil. Thus, the perspective towards the sect or other entities that are labeled as bad is changing. In short, we can say that the main character's power, personality and worldview are changing. If you are planning to watch it, I must say that the finale of the anime is very touching and ends with a surprise ending. There is also love in anime. A pure, true love. As for visuals and music, I think these are good too. As someone who has watched many Chinese anime, albeit in certain genres, this anime is a very good anime. If you like Chinese anime like Tunshi Xingkong or Wanmei Shijie, definitely watch this one too.;Recommended
1;Zhu Xian;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua is an adaptation of a popular web novel that I have read, so I will review this as an individual work and as an adaptation.General plot summary: The story follows Xiao Fan, an ordinary villager child turned cultivator, due to events in his childhood. Xiao Fan was an ordinary child living in a village close to the leader of the just(or righteous) sects: QingYun Sect. One day, an old monk passes by the village and is attacked by an unknown assailant. Xiao Fan, who was asked to send him food, witnesses the fight and is knocked out. Though the monk successfully forces the assailant to retreat, he is seriously injured and forced to take the ""three day guaranteed death pill""; this pill restores his strength temporarily but he is now guaranteed to die in 3 days. Now on his death bed, he comes up with a crazy idea to fulfill his lifelong dream. He will teach the Buddhist cultivation technique to Xiao Fan and have him join the QingYun Sect so that he can unlock the secrets the monk has been pursuing (cultivation techniques are the most guarded secrets of this world). Xiao Fan after learning the Buddhist technique is knocked out and wakes up to find his village massacred. The survivors (Xiao Fan and another) is taken to QingYun sect as orphans and thus raised as cultivators. Xiao Fan, a stubborn and unyielding to a fault individual, is raised with black & white values regarding justice/righteousness vs evil, until he starts to wander the world. Then he learns that the world is not as morally black & white as he once thought, as he interacts with a variety of different people. This story could be considered Xiao Fan's journey or life story.The themes of this story revolves around justice/righteousness vs evil and moral ambiguity, brought to life through Xiao Fan's life story. The plot is reasonable paced and the character models are good. The action is a bit hit or miss though, most of the 1v1 scenes are great, the camera angles are just perfect, the choreography is smooth and on-point, but some of the group fights are really bad, feel slow and have a weak impact.However, this donghua is much deeper than what you see on the surface. Another person said that ""the devil is in the details"", to which I agree. The character interactions, mannerisms etc, matter just as much as much of the narration. It is a story where you have to pay attention to subtleties as well.If you do start to watch this, I suggest you at least watch it to the end.Now as an adaptation(may contain spoilers as I compare novel to donghua):As an adaptation, I felt that it was well-done, though not exactly perfect. I had 3 main complaints about this adaptation: the explanation regarding Xiao Fan's weapon, the removed world building strengthening the theme of moral ambiguity, and Lu Xueqi's presentation/buildup.First, with regards to Xiao Fan's weapon, they never really explained in detail its influence on him. Because he was sentimental, he ended up keeping the Blood-sucking pearl which later got blood refined with the soul-devouring staff to form his weapon. Since these two were extremely evil weapons, they influenced his mind, but because he cultivated the Buddhist technique, the effects were mitigated unless he had emotional swings. Overall not super important, but his use of it for justice/righteousness highlights the moral ambiguity theme and ties into the second point.Second, while the donghua did a decent job showcasing/debating the moral ambiguity between just vs. evil, they left out much of the back story. The just vs evil debate has been around for 100's of years and slowly changed over time. The most obvious examples were Xiao Fan's weapon, a blood-refined weapon created by merging 2 of the most evil weapons to exist now being used by the just faction and the fan being used by an evil faction member (fan was originally a weapon of a renowned neutral-just leaning figure).The final complaint I have is the portrayal of Lu Xueqi.--First, Lu Xueqi was supposed to be extremely beautiful, but her design is very plain, even the Senior Sister Tian Ling'er overshadowed her; I can only attribute this to her way of dress, and hopefully the design shown in the Season 2 concept art shows a more beautiful Lu Xueqi.--Second, Lu Xueqi's development was really weak. She was originally portrayed as cold and aloof, only showing some interest in Xiao Fan after his loss to her. This action confused her sparking her interest in him. Afterward, the most crucial part in building their subtle relationship, the fight against the evil sect in the cave, to falling into the abyss, to the subsequent fight against the serpent were all core events laid the foundation for her love for him, but these were severely simplified or poorly presented so the build up in their relationship has a weak foundation. Lu Xueqi's ""goodwill"" (not yet love) for him stems from her perception/understanding (read: interpreted from her worldview) of his actions; she basically rationalized the reasons for him helping her, you could say she made some wrong assumptions that led to her eventual affection for him. This all started with why she believed he ""voluntarily forfeited"" his match against her; then his ""suicide charge"" to save her when she was captured by the whip-using girl. The final ""nail in the coffin"" for the buildup is after they two were swept into the abyss. This scene was heavily modified by the donghua team. In essence, the two fell down into a pool of water, Xiao Fan wakes up first and pulls her out and stands guard until she wakes up. While Xiao Fan is more injured, his weapon's blood-suck ability helped alleviate his wounds so he's more healthy in a sense. Once she wakes up, they try to leave together; Xiao Fan's weapon is the natural enemy of the vengeful spirits that surround them so they are kept at bay. It's not until he falls unconscious that Lu Xueqi ""realizes"" how much effort he put in to protect her. She comes to the conclusion that Xiao Fan could have abandoned her and survived, but she ended up burdening him, deepening her ""goodwill"" towards him. They also encounter at least two monsters which Xiao Fan does most of the work to defeat, while Lu Xueqi keeps piling on injuries.TLDR, they severely weakened the buildup of Lu Xueqi's ""goodwill""/affection towards Xiao Fan. Her buildup is ""the devil in the details"", but when the details are removed, there isn't much left.Despite these complaints, the adaptation was very faithful to the source. The last episode was a beautiful climax/portrayal of that scene.Adaptation score (how faithful to the source): 8/10";Recommended

The most I could spoil you is by poisoning the well, and I don’t even have to explain anything about the story to do that. This was released as an ONA, but they seem to treat it as if it were going to be an actual TV series. I wouldn’t be surprised if the TV series was cancelled due to negative reactions towards the ONA. Anyway, let’s get onto the important part of the review, shall we?Not only is there not a story present, the writers even deliberately avoid giving the anime a story. Unlike most magical girl anime where the first episode is dedicated towards showing the audience the girl finding a sentient intelligent god-like being that looks like a stuffed animal turning her into a magical girl and possibly using the next few episodes to show her slow acceptance of this new role this anime starts off with the three main characters already being magical girls. They do explain that the weird hat creatures who properly look like stuffed animals are what give the girls their powers, but they mention nothing about how they met or what exactly those creatures even are. Even Mahou Yuugi briefly explained how the protagonist got the fish on her back. The only information that we do have about these things is that they can only transform with children and that they can be stitched up like real stuffed animals. Despite only have three episodes this anime is extremely episode to the point that you could even watch the episodes out of order and it wouldn’t make a difference. There are “episode previews” at the ends of the first two episodes, but they don’t really correlate with what actually happens in the next episode so even that wouldn’t make anything feel awkward. There seemed to be some attempt at giving the anime a story by having certain bad guys show up as being the main antagonists, but they don’t really do that much and never felt like that important of a threat. One of the characters is shown to have the power to harness the power of emotions to use as a weapon, but for whatever reason this is only used one time.As they mention in the script an important part of the appeal of this show is the fact that the main characters are lolis. Coming from someone who really does appreciate lolis I can honestly say that the lolis are actually pretty low tier. I wouldn’t go so far to say that they’re unattractive, but out of all the lolis out there they just aren’t that great. Pretty much the entire second episode was about loli fanservice since they just talk about bras and wear them. The main character even went pretty much completely naked, although there was censorship provided by random obstructing the viewer’s line of sight towards her lower feminine parts. The backgrounds were also quite mediocre and unmemorable. The first villain looked like what an ice cream cone mecha would look like in the world of Toppa Tengen Gurren Lagann. In a comedy anime this is a fine character design, but they didn’t keep up this trend of ridiculous looking antagonists and the monsters of the following two weeks were so plain that I can’t even remember what they looked like. The last one was a sort of spy like villain, but the second one was just a generic human if I recall correctly. The transformation scenes were likely the least “special” I’ve ever seen and unlike shows like Cardcaptor Sakura and Shugo Chara where they serve as a sort of eye candy Kigurumikku V3 just shows them put on their weird sentient animal hats, transitions to a different background and shows them wearing something different. The outfits themselves also aren’t too remarkable. They show off what they’re supposed to, but they’re very simplistic and you can tell that there wasn’t too much thought that went into designing anything in this show.Unlike most TV series and ONA series this anime completely skipped the idea of having a theme song of any type. I know that anime with short episodes like this are notorious for having too much theme song and not enough actual anime content, especially with shows like Aiura and Hell Kindergarten where the theme song or theme songs collectively take up close to half of the shows actual runtime, but for a 10 minute episode to not even have one of the two types of theme songs just seems like a way to cut down on the budget. Considering just how awful and misplaced the music in the first episode was maybe it’s better that they didn’t try to write a theme song. I know the word “cancer” gets thrown around a lot these days, but I honestly think if they were to attempt to write an opening song with the same staff it would perfectly fit our modern and subjective definition of cancer in media. The “background” music in the first episode is extremely intrusive and unnecessary. I feel like even people watching in Japanese would need subtitles just to understand what’s being said since the music volume was louder than volume of the dialogue. Both the background music and the voice were quite a bit below average, although neither are quite bad enough to induce headaches or damage to ears. The transformation animation, the evil lair, and all of the baddies had very generic and uninteresting sounds and voices. You could tell they weren’t important to the anime, but then again nothing really is, nor is the anime important in any way in and of itself.The characters are pretty much all there just for comedy and titulation so their personalities are all pretty bad. The main character has the important trait of not caring about what other people think, not saying that she’s a sociopath but just that she doesn’t have any shame or modesty. She has no problem walking into someone else’s house, eating their expensive food in front of them, and then saying true insults right to their face. She even points out to an onee-san character (can’t remember what their relationship was) that she was using alcohol as a coping mechanism for being lonely and not being able to maintain a romantic relationship for very long. This character is obviously very troubled. One of her main characteristics is her large breasts, which is a pretty pathetic thing to be your most significant defining feature aside from your mental issues. As much as I would like to go on about the other two characters who make up the titular V3, there really isn’t anything to say about them as they get little characterization. The full cover that shows all three characters will tell you more about who they are than I ever could, which is really saying something. A picture tells a thousand words, but if these thousand words you’ve read so far have told you anything it should be that you need not go any further than the picture. The villains were even less developed than the main characters, although unlike most series there actually isn’t too big of a gap. Usually it would be something like 1 or dimensional villains and 2 or 3 dimensional main characters, but in this it’s more like 0 dimensional villains and 0.75 dimensional main characters. None of the characters have any depth, but even most background characters have more characterization than both the villains and the main characters in this series.Even for a low budget shoddy magical girl parody short this still wasn’t very enjoyable. I know I’ve already made the comparison of Mahou Yuugi, but that was a far better anime that basically does everything right that this did wrong. Unlike some other anime even watching it just to make fun of it doesn’t work that well to turn the negatives into positives since it’s already so bland that it’s like finding the opposite of perfect grey (as in, it doesn’t change the quality). It doesn’t feel painful to watch and it isn’t actually boring in any normal sense of the word, but it still isn’t very satisfying to watch. The dumb humour and somewhat unique, despite not very realistic, characters do make it at least somewhat watchable. It’s sort of like a cheap knock-off Twinky: it’s not that great, you know you’re not really getting anything out of it, but it’s also not hard to get down. Even if you don’t end up feeling sick after you’ll still wish you had something else instead. There are much better alternatives so it’s a bit of a worthless thing to watch unless you’re just trying to pad your list with stuff that doesn’t take that long to watch. In this case it might not be too bad since there is far worse anime out there and it does make for an easy watch even if you won’t get anything else out of it.In the end I wasted about half an hour watching the anime and another three hours writing this review, but in the end it wasn’t exactly a bad experience. I certainly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn’t discourage you from watching it, especially if you like anime such as Mars of Destruction and Pupa. It’s somewhat interesting in itself that something that feels so mediocre all across the board could feel less fun than something that was genuinely horrible. Anime like Inferno Cop and School Days are intended not to be perfect masterpieces and aren’t expected to be loved by everyone, but they still have fans who love them for what they were able to accomplish by having one or more factor of MAL’s Story-Art-Sound-Character-Enjoyment be worthy of a score lower than 1 since that makes them unique and interesting in their own way. In contrast nothing in this anime stands out as being anywhere near good nor is any of it horrendous, which makes it surprisingly bad in the end.;Not Recommended
1;Kigurumikku V3;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;3;Kigurumikku V3 is an ONA from AIC. Yes, the same studio behind Bubblegum Crisis, Explorer Woman Ray, OreImo, Sasameki Koto, Battle Athletes and many more. The stuff of theirs I've seen has ranged in quality quite a bit, sometimes being really good, sometimes being dull and sometimes being terrible. So, where does this 2009 ONA land?Story:There isn't really a story. The ONA has three episodes that are just meant to parody magical girl tropes. There are three girls with powers granted to them by equipping avian mascot characters as kigurumi, or full body animal costumes for those of you who don't know that term. The three of them face a vague evil threat resulting in shenanigans. The episodes aren't really in order and they skip details between them.As a premise goes, it isn't a bad one and it has comedic potential. It's basically the same concept behind Galaxy Angel's super sentai parody episode. But whereas the Galaxy Angel episode was really funny, clever and charming, Kigurumikku V3 is none of those things. There's very little that actually parodies the tropes that are common to magical girl stuff. A lot of the “humour” is based on perverted things happening and over the top reactions to them. To be fair, most of the really risque jokes revolve around the older sister character instead of the elementary school kids, but it's still pretty damn sleazy. In all honesty one or two of the actual genre parody jokes do kind of work but they're pretty heavily outnumbered by the insipid bits.Characters:There's really not much to say about the characters in this. Chocotan had more fleshed out characters and it lasted all of ten minutes. Granted, this series isn't that much longer, running a bit over thirty minutes for its three episodes but that's still thrice the running time with worse results. To be fair the kind of one-note cast of characters could work in a comedy if they actually meshed well for comedic purposes or if they were entertaining via quirkiness or some other factor. Kigurumikku, unfortunately, doesn't have that going for it. It just has characters who are loud and kind of annoying. I've seen worse casts, but they're pretty bad.Art:The art would be passable, if a bit mundane, if not for the focus on fan-service. Frankly, it's a worse offender in that regard than Devil Hunter Yohko was. At least its main characters were older, albeit still too young for this shite.Sound:The actors themselves are quite skilled, although you wouldn't know it from their performances in this. They're ridiculously over the top and don't really have anything going for them. They aren't terrible performances but they manage to be grating. The music is bland but not bad.Ho-yay:There's really not much. There's a bit where Azuki decides to check the other girls' chests but it comes across more as nonsensical and vaguely creepy than it does as them having chemistry.Final Thoughts:Kigurumikku V3 is a vapid, unfunny and just plain stupid little series. You might like it if you're into the whole idea that girly bits are inherently funny. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it but there are worse things out there. My final rating is a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Mushishi.;Not Recommended
0;Natural: Another;LlamaMan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LlamaMan;9;"After watching the first few minutes of Teacher's Pet (or Natural: Another), I had high hopes - finally it was one about a couple who love each other. Or so I thought. It seems that the male guy was just a dominative guy after all. But he was still different from the typical dominative guy. He often came off as kind, which at times made me feel like he really loved the girl. It's hard to figure out. Enter another girl and you end up a bit more certain about it.What I liked was how he didn't try to make those two girls into sex slaves by fucking their brains out or exposing them for extreme pain - he did it by exploiting their love towards him, by making one envious and maybe even jealous of the other.The sex scenes weren't done the way you might expect them to be done. They weren't intense or anything, but rather came off as calm, and even a bit romantic - which again makes me wonder - did he really love the girls or not?If I left the answering of that question to the music, it would be a definite yes. It's just calm, romantic string music that screams love a long way.The animation is good too; with good details in the surroundings and great character motions, but it suffers from a bit old character designs. Sex scenes were done very well too.In all I feel Teacher's Pet is different from most hentai out there. Despite having a guy who's after making the girls his sex slaves, at times I felt it was more about the love than the lovemaking. If you're a hentai fan, give Teacher's Pet a try.";Recommended
0;Oira Sukeban;eyepatchie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/eyepatchie;3;"(minor spoilers)As there aren’t many good things about this anime, I’ll start with the few things which it did alright. The animation was surprisingly good, and the fight scenes were smooth (but sadly the animation couldn’t compensate for the content at all). Overall the voice acting was fine, except for the Suke who unfortunately talked a lot. Everything else in this is bad, and not even bad in an enjoyable way.The music isn’t awful, but it rarely suited the scene at all, and this is coming from someone who rarely notices music in shows. The main issue with the OVA isn’t the music though.Having not read the manga at all, nearly all characters in this are unlikeable. Suke is horny; that’s his entire personality. He doesn’t do anything in the OVA except be horny. The rest of the small cast isn’t much better. What little of the plot is covered in this seems rushed, so if you’re interested in plot in the slightest the manga is definitely the better option.This OVA is NOT cheesy good, so if you’re into shows that are so bad they’re good, watch something else. I watched this so you don’t have to.Also, the humour is bad. I have no issue with crude humour but farting in a someone’s face to defeat them is just awful.";Not Recommended

0;Mahou Shoujo Lalabel;HeavensBlade13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HeavensBlade13;4;Mahou Shoujo Lalabel had the building blocks for a good story about a girl discovering her humanity, but failed because of mishandling its initial setup, being overly repetitive in its episodic stories, and having no character development besides for Lalabel, and even hers was rather marginal.Story: In terms of overarching narrative the show is trying to tell the story of how Lalabel becomes/realizes she is just a normal girl. However, there is never anything Lalabel does in terms of personality or actions that makes the viewer think she is any different from a normal girl. While she might not know Japanese customs and doesn't think of herself as human she still acts like a normal young girl from the get go. Because of this, the development Lalabel makes towards becoming nicer/better a person feels pointless because it doesn't match the level of 'realizing she's human' since any differences outside of magic are trivial. Furthermore, this development of becoming a better person often gets conflated with using magic less or not at all without sufficient reason that would explain why she can't just be more focused or careful with magic. Finally, I think the ending should definitely have been foreshadowed and that doing so would have actually helped to drive Lalabel's growth in a more realistic way that would have mitigated some of my complaints.On an episodic level, most of the episodes revolved around Biscus doing some trivial scams to get money to buy ramen (which he never seems to have problem buying even before his scams). The second most common story type was Lalabel using her magic for convenience and messing something up which she then needs to fix. The first got boring very quickly because I didn't find most of the scams to be very creative or funny and although the second provided some growth for Lalabel, sometimes (for me at least) the messaged veered to 'don't use magic because it's not your real ability' instead of 'use magic well' without enough justification, because to me it seems that since the ONLY significant difference Lalabel has ever shown between herself and humans is magic, it is actually her ability. This sometimes made the message seem a little forced instead of naturally developed.Characters: Beginning with the characters around Lalabel, I thought the core cast of two diverse friends and wise but imperfect grandparents provided a well rounded group for Lalabel's growth and these characters are what I meant when I said the show had the building blocks for a better story. Lalabel herself was interesting enough (although not sufficiently established as different than humans), and it is satisfying to see her become a nicer person over time. The rest of the characters never really change, with some even remaining rude after Lalabel helps them multiple times or others not changing when it seems something happens that would elicit change. I don't necessarily think there has to be character growth in an episodic series, but when the episode setups are so weak it is more frustrating. Briefly touching on the villains, Biscus as a main villain was boring and I didn't find his humorous moments funny outside of his incorrect speaking style and his partner was only interesting when he was transformed into an animal or working against Biscus. In episodic series I think it is very hard for just one villain to suffice for multiple episodes let alone ~50 unless they are particularly interesting or well written.Art: I thought the animation was solid and most of the main character designs were decent. However for some of the background or minor characters the faces looked a little too similar. I also thought the designs for the magic items and art for when magic was being used were pretty uninteresting.Sound: I personally didn't care for the opening, but thought the ending was catchy. In terms of OST my main complaint is that the music for sad parts was not varied enough meaning that for only minor inconveniences or misfortune there would sometimes be heavy dramatic music that didn't match what was happening.Enjoyment: My enjoyment for most of the early and middle parts of the series was rather low because of the very repetitive story beats and meager character development, although the core cast of characters interactions were still solid. Some of the later episodes were much more enjoyable, mostly when different story types were experimented with, such as putting Biscus into the role of a good guy, or pitting him against his assistant. Episode 45 with a girl from America in particular stood out above the rest for being hilarious and less repetitive. This show would have been more fun if it had put more effort into diversifying its episode arcs, had more widespread character development for more of the cast, and tightened the main narrative arc by making Lalabel seem more different than just a normal girl, by changing her actions at the beginning of the show and trying to drop more hints of the ending.Overall I wouldn't recommend this show unless you are an avid mahou shoujo fan and are interested in some earlier stories that do not involve transformations or an Earthling gaining magical powers.;Not Recommended
0;Hoshi no Kirby: Pilot;UserMCSkull;https://myanimelist.net/profile/UserMCSkull;5;This is genuinely the weirdest piece of Kirby media, I've ever seen.You may notice that my enjoyment of is very high while everything else is fairly low, that's just because I find it really funny, like in an irony level.I don't wanna bash it too much, it's a pilot and all...but no dialogue and Dedede has a gun it's so silly.Why is the original Tiff's design so weird? Like I dunno....Kinda cool that Dark Matter is here though.Honestly I'd really recommend this just because of how weird it is, like I genuinely sorta love this lmao.;Mixed Feelings
0;Hoshi no Kirby: Pilot;Arisu_the_Pig;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arisu_the_Pig;3;There are no reviews for this, so I thought I'd write one. :IStory (2, because it's better than Mars of Destruction): There isn't much of a story, Kirby crash lands into the 'princess' lady's face (who people say is the original Fumu/Tiff) and she gets up perfectly fine, just a bit angry when Kirby floats around like an idiot and gets in her face. And then it's mostly just Kirby and this 'princess' showing off and flying around...And King Dedede is trying to murder them (or at least Kirby), but fails every time and afterwards Kirby offers him a sausage, since I think he had been having a picnic or something. Then later some other excuses for enemies appear, (Captain Stitch, Meta Knight (who isn't evil in the actual series), Ice Dragon, Dark Matter, Master Green, Blocky, Efreeti and some others) but they kill them in one second. Then Nightmare shocks them with some sort of weird lightning and they can't move. Then, it shows Kirby waking up to find it was only a very trippy nightmare, but wait, that means...did he ever even meet any princess or penguin? Or any of those people? Did he ever have a girlfriend? Nope, he had been sleeping the whole time. I think...Whatever, let's move on.Art (3): The art...well, to start, they kind of got King Dedede's design wrong, I think, with his hat anyways. (Lol, and the 'princess' is naked...) And the animation...is not that great.Sound (3): The music is mostly in the beginning and doesn't really match the mood. There isn't any voice acting. Also, there's a few sounds, but that's it.Character (2): There isn't much character development, just that Kirby and this 'princess' are innocent and everyone else is a complete and total asshole...Enjoyment (4): It was cool to see how much they improved when they made the actual show.Overall (3): It was just...meh.;Not Recommended
1;Hoshi no Kirby: Pilot;EmilyDioptase;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EmilyDioptase;3;This might be one of the weirdest things I've ever watched. Honestly, at times it feels less like a pilot for a 100 episode anime and more like a middle school students' 3D modeling project. Though, it does have some points of charm.Story, uh... It doesn't really have one.The art is a very mixed bag. The 3D animation looks terrible, just absolutely horrendous, it makes RatBoyGenius look like Da Vinci. However, the 2D animation is actually really nice, comparable to the actual show.Sound isn't good. The music is fine enough, but the stock sound effects are laughably bad.Obviously, with no story, any character is highly lacking. Though, they do have a few moments of mildly amusing antics.Enjoyment will wildly vary. If you enjoy Kirby, like I do, you will probably get a decent amount of enjoyment from seeing this and comparing it to the actually somewhat good anime that it spawned. If not, maybe you can still get some sort of ironic enjoyment.Overall, despite the low rating, I would actually really recommend this if you're a fan of Kirby. Mainly because it's just about 4 minutes long. And even if you're not that big into the series, you might get a laugh out of it.;Not Recommended

0;Kojin Jugyou;AnchientProphet2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnchientProphet2;6;"This is not hentai (RX). This is very vanilla, showing mainly breasts, and some light humping/ strandling, even just over panties. But no close ups, nothing truly explicit or actually more adult than a very softcore film.So if you were expecting something like actual Hentai, this might not be for you.As for me, however, this was a bit of a treat as I angage in watching older and older anime shows.What we have here is a female lead, named Sara, that went through a traumatic experience in her youth, and seeks to aid others with their mental traumas. Seemingly hired by anonymous benefactors, likely the family of those in need of aid, Sara and her male assistant, Tamine, are always off on an adventure of veritable good will.BUt how does she cure people, you ask? By hypnotizing them with her large E( or f) cup breasts, like a Brazilian Carnivale dancer.SHes dives into the minds of people this way, having learned the technique from her master, a fairly pervy old man in masters clothing, whom taught her the way and healed her years before.IT always gets off to a normal start, but ends up getting too sexual. But in a Freudian way, thats the whole point; trying to relate that so many problems and hangups people have are supposedly sexual in nature, traumatic or otherwise.The look of the show was very reminiscent of the transitional period from the late 1980s through the 1990s, when most anime either looked good, or didnt. This show didnt look terribly good, but its a fine line.Still hilarious scenes that broke thetension, using now very classic and oft cliched gags, such as Sara Hitting her assistant, Tamine, whom could never catch a break with his gorgeous boss lady, even when her breasts land in his face, help to make for a more enjoyable show. Without which, this non hentai would likely be rated lower.Overall this is a passing 6/10 all around, and I only wish it was longer, better drawn, and actually had a proper conclusion with the two main characters getting together. Hentai or not, it was a decent enough 2 episode ova from the mid 90's. lol";Mixed Feelings

However, the story's not much to talk about, and a lot of the jokes fall flat in that ""ugh anime"" way.Also, the final battle has all of the female characters except for the cat get their asses beat and the men save the day, and I feel like it's sexist, but only accidentally.

A lot of OVAs and anime-from-manga adaptations often get bad reviews because they get discontinued, thus the plot never gets wrapped up.I feel it is VERY unfair to judge an anime on this, because doing so misses the point entirely.When anime is reviewed, no matter how many episodes there are, these are the most important questions to ask:*Am I entertained?*Do I care about the characters?*Do I understand what's going on/really want to know?*Do I feel there was effort put into this?*Would I be disappointed to not see more of this?While watching Princess Rouge, I found myself saying a definite ""YES"" to all of these questions. Thus I'm reviewing this lovely piece for what it is instead of what it could have been.Story: 8Why so high when there is so little?Because that's how badly you want to know the rest of it!At first glance, Princess Rouge is criticized as an Oh My Goddess! rip-off, stereotypical ""Magical Girlfriend"" anime, thus regarded to be rather low-brow.Honestly, this couldn't be further from the truth.Yes, our ordinary everyday ""nice guy"" protagonist finds a girl of mysterious origin. Yes, she ends up living with him. Yes, there is romance sprinkled between them, along with comedic hijinks and misunderstandings.But this series adds in its own flavor, with plenty of darker undertones, shoujo-esque designs, interactions, and backstories, a somewhat unique setting (Rouge's homeland) and most notable of all, extremely little fanservice so you feel like you're being treated to an actual story instead of the loser male fantasy that a lot of Magical Girlfriend anime are notoriously known for. In fact, it does this so well, you won't even feel like you're watching a Magical Girlfriend anime. This aspect really makes the OVA stand out and shine.For starters, Rouge and Yuusuke's fated meeting is handled rather well. They don't get along RIGHT away; in fact it seems that she is going to become a burden on him. Yuusuke is an orphan. Typical. But for once, FOR ONCE, he is one of those incredibly rare anime orphans who lives on his own and is shown to really struggle with paying the rent. Why don't more anime orphan boys who get girls to live with them have this problem? Simple: ""the creators don't think that's important""Lol, the hell if it isn't!!Secondly, a lot of the tired, less desirable cliches you think you might see in this genre are widely ignored: Yuusuke doesn't take Rouge in because he's a geek who longs for a sexy girlfriend; he takes her in because she needs help. The girl is soaked and unconscious, but the ecchi cliche of ""uh-oh, gotta undress her!"" (to just provide an opportunity for fan-service) is done away with-for Yuusuke asks his landlady to undress the girl instead, off-screen. Now Rouge still gets the whole ""omg I'm naked-what-the-hell-pervert"" lawl misunderstanding scene between Yuusuke and herself but this is handled well too: no female-on-male violence-just a rather amusing argument between the two....which results in Rouge crying because she realizes her memory is gone and she feels frightened and helpless. Also, only her bare shoulders and back are seen because her very long, thick hair covers her chest. Points for this.There is another scene where she is having a nightmare (still fully undressed) and Yuusuke (almost fully undressed himself) runs into the room when she screams. Instead of getting angry and punching him for seeing her naked, the two embrace each other. This is a very realistic reaction when a girl is actually terrified and confused. The scene is very short but it's touching, guaranteed to generate an ""aww"" from whoever's watching.Consider me impressed.And yet another. Take the REALLY tired, oops,-we-just-tripped-and-fell-on-top of-each-other *blush* gimmick used to create chemistry between a hesitant couple, turn it around into girl-falls-instead and turn the falling down into an accidental hug before a most appropriate reaction and you've got three minutes of something really really REALLY downright adorable.Consider me VERY impressed.Anyway, I am not going to spoil anything else as far as plot goes except with the focus of it being on Rouge's true origin instead of cheap romance comedy cliches keeps it fresh, gripping, and mysteriously intriguing. You'll just be heartbroken that we don't get a conclusion.Art.The art is gorgeous.It really is. The backgrounds are so detailed, the colors are beautiful and warm. The character designs are rather unique. All the girls are slender-figured, have lovely, long, thick hair and are color-coded for your convenience. Their princess dresses are just as lovely and full of contrasting colors to their hair and eyes and you can tell they were well thought-out.This shoujo-esque art style in my opinion, makes the series even more charming and far less catering to a male audience who want to see scantily-clad girls with D or F cups.Sadly, the second episode's art style changes completely. I love the first episode's much more. But this doesn't make it bad either. The characters just look different which is one of my biggest pet peeves with 90s anime. Pushing that aside, the quality doesn't go down. It just changes.Sound.I fell in love with the sweet, mellow little theme song we are treated to by Rouge's actual seiyuu, Shiho-chan, the first time I heard it. Instrumental versions are played throughout the episodes in different styles, ranging from light to heavy and sorrowful to accompany the mood of the respected scenes. There are completely silent moments as well, which I think is a good way for anime to grab your attention. The music for action scenes (yes, there are a handful) is appropriately dramatic.The seiyuu are excellent too. Everyone matches everyone well and the acting is good. Shiho is insufferably adorable as Rouge in particular.Character.I don't know if I'd call Yuusuke particularly interesting...because to be honest, he's quite typical. He certainly isn't a pervert....but he doesn't get embarrassed enough to push Rouge away if she hugs him. He is kind and lightly affectionate to her so it is pretty evident to both that they have feelings for each other. He does take responsibility for his actions and he does try to protect Rouge to the best of his ability instead of standing around whining ""I just want a normal life"". It is made clear that he misses his parents and thinks of them a lot. It is kind of heart-warming to hear him refer to Rouge as his family and the line ""The thought of losing her scares me more than anything"".Rouge is a lot more interesting...because we know so very little about her, nor can you look at her and figure her personality out right away. It's possible, even hinted at that she has a completely different one with her memories intact. She is curious about the strange new world around her but she is also afraid and she is perceptive and suspicious when people are lying to her-she will even call them out for it. While she is cute in both looks and mannerisms, she is no dreamy sex goddess for fanboys to drool over and this gives her character quite the advantage to be realistic and worth getting to know.Rouge's sisters are pretty cool. Kaige's backstory is excellent and really saves the second episode from most of its noteworthy flaws. At first you think she's just the tomboyish, temperamental red-head stereotype who is quick to throw punches but she actually has a very sensitive and girlish side to her, revealed to us in a tragic way. Not much can be said for Meige (we don't get to her backstory in time). You can just tell she's the most calm and level-headed of the princesses; the voice of reason.The side characters aren't really worth talking about much. The villain is the worst one of the bunch. He's just a cold-hearted bastard with no trace of humanity and a really annoying laugh. But he doesn't get much screentime so that's okay. His henchmen are more intriguing characters.Most people will definitely be sucked into this anime within the first ten minutes because it really shrouds itself in mystery and the dark fantasy elements should be quite appealing to some who are looking for something heavier than a rom-com. Even if you don't like boy-meets-strange-girl-from-another-world stories, you might find yourself pleasantly enchanted and wishing deeply that the creator, Aoi Takeuchi had been able to finish Princess Rouge.On the bright side, there are DRAMA CDS. And I am proud to own the first one. :D Still trying to hunt down the second.";Recommended
0;Princess Rouge;ObscureObsidian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ObscureObsidian;4;Princess Rouge is the better definition of mediocre. The story is a harem with the typical plot ordinary boy found amnesiac superpowered girl. This has become pretty common since the Oh! My Goddess' success, but, despite some good examples of this plot that can turned into some great titles (Chobits, Elfen Lied), this is not one of them.First of all, the characters. Many people say that, to have a good show, you must have good characters. There's actually more things, but have good characters is important. This show fails at that. Your ordinary MC is too ordinary to be interesting the most remarkable thing about is that he's an orphan, and all the rest of the characters are bland, since the innocent but so powerful she doesn't know magical girlfriend, to the two sisters, one who is a Naru Narusegawa's clone in character and personality, and the other who at lest is nicer than her sister, and don't forget the awful crybaby annoying human girl who has a crush on the main character, and when he discover he has a girlfriend, she runs and cry, because how he dares to have a girlfriend? She even send her friends to beat him. Hilarious high-comedy, ladies and gentleman.The humor is pretty Love Hina-style, guy lives with a bunch of girls and awkward things happens, and the male lead is beaten up in a pretending to be funny slapstick way, but it's not even bad enough to criticize it. It's just boring. There's some scene we could call fanservice, but i don't think anyone who could have a bonner with scenes so lame, repetitive and unoriginal.But this is not only an harem. Much harems and ecchi shows try to hide what they are with a premise to another genre. It's also a fantsy magical girl warrior show, the female lead and her sisters are the lost princesses from the underworld, whose family has been killed and they run away, and the big bad want them to...kill them? release some mysthical sword we never see or get an explantion why is sealed and the villain want it? The fights are as boring as the comedy, and the villains are really uninteresting. The main villain is your typical dark lord we never get what his motivation was, and his minions are really lazily written. We're supposed to care about a villain dude who died in the second episode, but how can i give a fuck about someone who has appeared only in one episode and his story was writting in a really clumsy and lazy way, with clueless flash-backs shown too late to make people empathize.The art is your typical late 90s style you could have seen at shows like Slayers or Saber Marionette J. The music is that cheesy 80s music that sounds extremely dated, even more if you think this OVA got released at 1998.Princess Rouge is a pretty obscure and forgotten title. Actually, in the scale of anime obscurity's TV Tropes page, is on level 6, the highest obscurity level possible, and not even the japanese Wikepedia has the title listed in the J.C. Staff's page. But with a good reason. It's that kind of forgetteable. It's not even awful worth it. Just a mediocre show that attempted to try to have a level of success because similar shows succeded.;Not Recommended

Animation, on the other hand, was too still and too looped. It seemed like they tried not to make it too obvious by compensating with a lot of pan/crop drags, but the only thing that did was make everything too zoomed, confusing and ruin otherwise good angles.Sound: This is where this hentai really screws up, it's too silent. Chie's voice was good, but her boyfriend's acting sounded pretty bad. Sound effects were pretty good, actually. The was no soundtrack. They could've picked any no-copyright music and looped it, but they decided to leave it all silent, so throughout the whole thing, the only music playing it's during the credits. I think I wouldn't have minded if it was silent only during the sex, with more dialogue from Chie and without the guy moaning like a bitch, but during the normal scenes and conversations it felt way too awkward. There's also a tiny sound glitch one the last Chie's line.Character: Chie is kind of cute, but nothing special. The guy is boring, I don't like glasses and his failed goatee is just sad to look at.Enjoyment: Although it was only 12 minutes (without the credits), this one really did seem to drag.

0;Ryoutei no Aji;PhKay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/PhKay;8;During an uninspired Youtube session to pass some time, i decided to watch some anime shorts and was lucky enough to find Ryoutei no Aji.That these two short stories, told in different lengths (between 15 and 90 seconds) and therefore making up six videos, are just commercials for a japanese instant food brand, simply amazed me.The animation is great, the music beautiful, the stories heartwarming and there is actually so little focus on the touted products.

0;Riki-Oh 2: Horobi no Ko;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;5;"This is an extremely crappy Ova with one of the worst, nonsensical plots I have seen out of all the trash retro Ovas out there.In between the poorly elaborated apocalyptic plans of the bad guys coming out of nowhere, Riki's brother going from 'don't kill muh brother; ANGERY' to 'Imma destroy all of Japan' within 10 minutes and Riki Oh getting mortally wounded only to fight as if nothing had happened in the very next scene, this anime is like Evangelion in how it chucks in random religious symbols in the hopes that the viewer would over interpret it as a sign of 'intelligence'. However, even Evangelion manages to have a somewhat coherent plot, Riki Oh's is just shit flinging that hopes it sticks.Of course any genre savy viewer knows that you don't watch this sort of garbage for characters, plot or anything that you know, makes an anime good.You watch it for the hilariously cheesy gorefests.In this regard, Riki Oh truly delivers; at least for the first half. Disappointingly, the gore in the first 15 minute so completely overshadows anything else that happens later.Art is more akin to a mid 80s Tv show than a 1990s production. It is rather crappy for its time and is absolute garbage by today's standards.Similarily the music is more akin to mid 80s Nwobhm/ heavy metal. Not a good thing in this case as it is cheesy even for its time and is absolute garbage by Nwobhm standards.Overall, the only reason you should watch this super trashy Ova is for the gore in the first half, if the gore were better paced and spread out in the anime, there is no doubt that some of these scenes would attain the notoriety on the level of such classics as Angel Cop.";Mixed Feelings

1;Riki-Oh 2: Horobi no Ko;Waterinaglass;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Waterinaglass;4;"This OVA is not very good. There is not much more to say than that, but I will try to elaborate a little, bit. It seems like it is supposed to be a continuation of the original ""Wall of Hell"" OVA but it doesn't seem to connect or relate to it in any way. Either way, on it's own the story is pretty bad. It would be better as a 13 or more episode series instead of a 40 minute OVA. A lot of stuff happens too fast for me to care about, and many characters are introduced and die in less than 10 minutes.The art is not great either and while the setting is not a pleasant one, I don't think the art needed to be so drab to showcase this. All the scenes are excessively grey and faded.The characters are not interesting nor very cool, yet they could have been if this was written better. And either way, most of the characters that I thought had more potential were the ones that were killed off quickly.The action might be a little bit better than in the first one, but it's still not great and always ends too soon.Overall, while there are definitely things worse than this, it's far from being worth watching.";Not Recommended
2;Riki-Oh 2: Horobi no Ko;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;As the title suggests, “Riki-Oh 2” is the sequel to 1989’s “Riki-Oh.” This OVA explores the titular character’s past and his quest to find his twin brother from whom he was separated as a child. While “2” has its fair share of gory violence, it’s toned down compared to its predecessor, and the stilted scenes, animation errors and jumpy narrative do it no favors.Presumably, the events of this OVA take place after what happened in the first one, although it’s hard to tell. Riki-Oh is searching for his twin brother, Nachi, who has similar powers to his, except Nachi has a swastika on his hand, and Riki-Oh has a Star of David. (The reason behind the existence of these powers is unclear.) He walks around in northern Japan and talks to a psychic woman who almost dies but is suddenly okay just a few moments later, and then he’s in a jungle where some guy tries to kill him but immediately reveals that he’s a friend, and that guy subsequently gets killed by the main antagonist, who shows up in a tank. Then Riki-Oh gets imprisoned in a mysterious city with nuclear power plants that has death matches, where he quickly becomes best friends with a cyborg guy named Robo who lifts weights with his mechanical arms, and finally encounters Nachi. Is Nachi good or evil? (Well, he’s got a swastika on his hand, so...) Will Nachi ever forgive Riki-Oh for abandoning him during a game of hide-and-seek to become the adopted son of a rich old guy? (Yes, this happens.)As you can tell by the above, the plot is all over the place. Rather than going from Point A to Point B, it beelines it to Points J, K and L, meanders down to X, and then zigzags back up again. Many of the introduced elements aren’t explained well, if at all. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s going on, and why it’s happening in the first place. The characters are flatter than the screen I watched this on. The dialogue is terrible and borders on “so-bad-it’s-good” material, but I feel like with how incoherent this OVA is, it doesn’t quite reach that level of entertainment.The first “Riki-Oh”’s saving grace was its gory violence, but even that is toned down here. There are only a few truly gory scenes, but they happen quickly, and the animation quality isn’t good enough to make them look interesting. Also, sometimes a character will get seemingly mortally wounded in one scene, only to appear just fine in the next. The characters in “2” were designed by Akio Sugino, strangely enough, but even his character designs can’t save it.The rest of the technical aspects are similarly bland or bordering on forgettable. The direction, the soundtrack, the voice acting — all dull. The ending theme is decent, although it doesn’t leave much of an impression.As one would expect, this OVA contains significant objectionable content, but as I mentioned earlier, the goriest violent scenes are kept to a minimum. There’s lots of blood, bodies exploding, etc., but these aren’t shown in much detail. There’s also a scene of a woman breastfeeding and then getting executed. Additionally, the gratuitous use of religious imagery might make some uncomfortable. For those who are photosensitive, there are a couple of scenes near the middle with flashing, but these scenes are easy to avoid.Overall, “Riki-Oh 2” is a narratively meandering and tedious sequel to the already lackluster “Riki-Oh.” It has some unintentionally funny moments, but they aren’t enough to salvage it. Not recommended unless you’re in the mood for something confusing.;Not Recommended
0;Dog Soldier;WTFHachs;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WTFHachs;6;"When one thinks of Dog Soldier ~Shadows of the Past~, quality isn't the first thing that comes to mind. Well, aside from &quot;Quality&quot; being with a capital 'q' and only in the instance where that indicates a mistake of real quality in a piece for irony. Looking at the scores assigned to this review, it's pretty mediocre with one shining moment; however, looking at my own personal view of it, it's an abysmal 3. One's final opinion is all in what is expected from the viewer, which is probably it's greatest strength.If you're looking for a serious adventure about a man's fight against a military industrial complex, you're going to find an anime that rounds out to that 3 I assigned it. This anime is bad. The art style is decent; it's a bit clunky and it shows its age but it is not so horridly ugly or spectacularly beautiful that it'll leave you clamoring for more. When I viewed this anime, I viewed it on my Japanese LaserDisc release and I've seen the dub at anime conventions over the years. The OAV itself was from the late 1980s and was licensed in North America in the early 1990s - and hasn't been seen since on a retail shelf. The sound is what you'd expect from it; again, a decent rating but I'm not trying to devise the ultimate speaker set-up to watch this.The story and characters are also fair, but I rated the enjoyment much higher. That's because I find these elements to still be more subjective than visual and sound qualities. Again, if you're looking for a serious adventure about one-man-versus-military-industrial-complex, you'll be missing out. If, you have a penchant for the absurd, though, you should be pleased. The characters are over-the-top and stereotypical of 1980s pop culture. The plot points, which shouldn't be spoiled, are a new level of absurd, you can only expect them from someone like Saruwatari Tetsuya (Riki-oh, Shootfighter Tekken). Just when you tell yourself &quot;They can't be serious&quot;, they are. The stoic facial expressions used very liberally aren't like when Jimmy Fallon spoils a joke (in Fallon's defense, it's much easier to do in animation than live comedy). And because they are so serious, it is that much funnier.If you can find a copy of this, then it's certainly worth checking out. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece because you won't find it. This is something that has to be viewed through the same lens as you would a really horrible B-Grade science fiction film. The creators, both of the original manga and of the anime did their best to make something good, but it didn't quite come through this time. I say, enjoy it for the absurdity; get your friends together and have a good laugh!";Mixed Feelings
0;Dog Soldier;Apollokun;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Apollokun;2;"I wrote a much more scathing review on my Atlanta Fried Critic blog, but given that I can't go all-out on this site, I'll tone it down a bit. It's important that I do this, because you need to know never to watch this OVA. Everything about it, from the laughable story to the dreadful animation to the complete jumps in logic that apply to both of those things, is awful.Let's start with the laughably named protagonist, John Kyosuke Hiba. The characters can never decide what to call him. In the same sentence, they'll call him ""John"", then ""Kyosuke."" What's up with that? Did they forget his name in a split second? Is it really that hard to just stick with one name? I don't know, but it makes absolutely no good sense.Anyway, John is an ex Green Beret who now works a mellow construction job. He gets involved with an international conspiracy involving Chinese weaponry and AIDS. In the middle of this, he dresses up as Rambo and starts blowing crap up. Oh, yeah, that's right, this is Rambo with AIDS.Throughout the whole thing, we're treated to a terrible backstory involving him and the female love interest/antagonist/protagonist, Cathy, as well their childhood friend Makoto, who now goes by the incredibly clever villain name of ""Phantom."" Oooh, Phantom. That's almost as original as Shredder from ""TMNT"" or Doctor Claw from ""Inspector Gadget."" Just almost.So, we've got a half-baked conspiracy plot, a half-baked backstory, and a thoroughly terrible military thriller. It gets worse, though, thanks to the animation. Oh, lord, the animation... if you could even call it that, that is. A whole scene gets repeated with different music, character cels are used for minutes on end, and when there is movement, it's stiff and unconvincing. Even by 1989 standards, this is some of the worst animation possible.The only good thing is the music. It's not amazing, but it's easy to nod your head along to while zoning out. And trust me, you're going to want to zone out while this garbage is on-screen. As a funny little side note, the ending theme is called ""Sissy on the Roof."" Sounds kind of like a mid-90's gay adult video, doesn't it? I think it does, at least.""Dog Soldier"" is awful... actually, that doesn't begin to describe it. Given that the LaserDisc is rare and costs around 50 bucks, the unauthorized DVD release runs 10-15 bucks, and the VHS is hard to find in general, the universe seems to be telling you something about this. That thing is that you, under any circumstances, should watch never this trash heap. It's not the worst anime I've ever seen (that honor belongs to ""Harmagedon""), but it's darn close. Avoid this trash. It's barely even good enough for a cheap laugh, and the only thing I'll ever remember about is being ""Rambo With AIDS.""";Not Recommended
1;Dog Soldier;BohemianRhapsody;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BohemianRhapsody;4;"Before I start with my review, I have to say that action anime from the 80's and 90's, despite not having much of a storyline, are a guilty pleasure for me. Secondly, I'd like to say the this review is going to have some spoilers. They aren't very important, since this anime is just 45 minutes, but hey, you can't be too careful with this stuff.Now, without much further ado:""Dog Soldier"" is an anime that promises a lot, but does only a little. Just from the poster, you can notice the character looks like Rambo. Since the main character, John Kyosuke Hiba looks and fights like Rambo, one might expect the anime to have more Rambo-ish characteristics. And that's where it falls flat.The story of Dog Soldier isn't that good, but given the type of anime it is, the story is only there to give the main character a justification to join the battle. John has to save a scientist, as well as retrieve a virus for AIDS, which has fallen into the hands of a arms merchant who intends to use it as a weapon. However, this is not the most interesting part about the story. (spoiler warning) The most interesting part is that Johnny, the scientist, as well as the arms merchant, have once been childhood friends. This revelation would make the character interactions more interesting than a normal ""good guy vs bad guy"" plot, however, the anime does not manage to pull it off well. Instead, we have too many flashbacks and too many useless dialogue, while the action scenes, which are supposed to be the main part of an anime of this kind, do not last very long. This makes the whole project fall apart in the end, making this anime not good enough.As for the art, it's typical of the era. However, there are several scenes, especially flashbacks, that get recycles. As for the soundtrack, I have nothing against it.Overall, this anime could have been much better, but it fails to deliver on the action scenes, as well as the character interactions, resulting in a lackluster final project.";Not Recommended
2;Dog Soldier;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;3;"“Dog Soldier” is an ultra-violent ‘80s OVA... without the ultra-violence. Sure, there’s fighting, and there’s a little blood here and there, but most of the 46-minute runtime is spent on dull conversations or flashbacking to scenes multiple times without rhyme or reason.The gist of the story is Hiba, the main character who used to be a Green Beret but quit and is now a construction worker in Japan, gets forcefully recruited by the government to stop a shady arms dealer from weaponizing the vaccine to the AIDS virus. He refuses, but once he finds out that his childhood friends are involved, he’s suddenly all in, along with his fellow soldier-turned-construction-worker friend, Fudou. Their involvement takes them to Tokyo Dome, and later to a remote tropical island. There’s a lot of shooting and explosions. Truth serum is used. A room full of gold bars is shown hidden behind a painting. The damsel looks more disinterested than distressed. This is that kind of anime.The main issue with this OVA is that the main characters’ backstories are integral to the plot, but they are barely explored. There are flashbacks to their pasts, but in one case, the same flashback gets used several times without explaining what’s going on in the scene. Other flashbacks are similarly given little context. Naturally, character development also suffers from this lack of storytelling. By the time the OVA is over, we know very little about the characters, and thus it’s difficult to empathize with them.There is a lot of dialogue, but no one’s really saying anything. The conversations just drag on and feel inorganic, and do only the bare minimum to drive the plot forward.As for technical aspects, the direction isn’t good. The animation is subpar; sometimes characters would be drawn in a cartoonish style as an attempt at showing comedy, but the scenes weren’t funny at all. The character designs are okay, but they don’t leave an impression. The music (both the background music and the ending theme) is fair, but forgettable. The characters are voiced by a strong cast, but their talents are wasted here. Due to the stilted dialogue, it feels like they’re phoning it in most of the time.Regarding objectionable content, there is some violence, blood and death, but no gore, and the violence depicted is surprisingly muted.Overall, this anime is subpar on just about every level. If you want a “Rambo”-esque violent action thriller, there are better anime out there — most notably “Riki-Oh,” which is created by the same person.";Not Recommended
3;Dog Soldier;Mandalorian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mandalorian;5;"Here's an anime you can ignore. It's weak and boring, it lacks action (yeah there is some, but it's quite lame), the plot is nothing special and the main character is a cheap Rambo knock-off, but not as cool and without the charisma of his genuine counterpart. So yes, basically the only things he shares with Rambo are the physical appearance, the attire and being a former special forces military guy.Animation is quite choppy, art is ok on par with other obscure OVAs from the 80s/90s, characters are mostly flat and the soundtrack doesn't shine; there's really nothing in this OVA that makes it worth watching. I can't recommend it because you probably won't enjoy it, it's not good by any means but it's not awful enough to fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. I've seen a lot of terrible anime that provided some genuine laughs because they were so poorly made to become fun, but this is not the case. It's just a barely acceptable OVA with little to nothing to offer.";Not Recommended

For the essentials (wink wink) were there. Also the way the art was presented, which i will refer on later was beneficial in terms of applied imagination. Be honest, how many have looked at stills and had a mental film go off in their head? you will have no issue with that here.Dislike-plot was a joke. You want to show a romantic flick? you wanted to show a unity of two? you failed oh so badly. No matter who's perspective was shown the result was not a favorable one. Genre is more comedy and drama then the indented romance. Unity is partnership. PARTNERSHIP!- Going into more detail on the art is was similar to most hentai games on the market. You see some captions on a picture still. The story progresses but the picture does not switch out until after 3 lines or so of text. Your not watching an animation you are seeing a SLIDESHOW! Normally, i would not care as much but the audio continues. Who wants to hear a door creak open followed by approaching footsteps with a delayed pan out for example? If the audio clicks in so should the art. This to me screamed rushed or cheap. The only advantage one could take from this is fuck up their timing on the audio. On the other side how is that helpful?;Not Recommended

The art is below average but not the worst one you can find, but the animation is basically a slideshow of still pictures with some of the most minor of ""animation"" possible. There's also a bright and odd selection of colors, feels like it could have been made straight out of MS Paint or something. They even use the awful transition swipes you would find from some basic editing software that are pretty laughable.To go along with this nothing else is done well; SFX, voice acting, story, etc... is below average to bad. The story is just their enough to connect the sex scenes between the four different people and sound is just a few notches above homemade quality.Honestly I can't recommend this to anyone other than those looking for something bad to watch.

Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it.SOUND (8):Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music.

One of his lightest work, I feel it is also one of his best in terms of the animation and especially because of the marvelous transitions which are so very unique and wonderful to his style!The characters definitely have a similar look and feel to those from Inaka Isha except they drawn three shades lighter and have had the world's weight taken off their shoulders. Gone are worries of freezing Soviet-Europe and sickness - this is a film about saving, not trading lives.This is a truly Yamamura Koji film if there ever was one and while there isn't a trace of Noh in it, it almost feels MORE like him because of it.

0;Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger;mastertek;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mastertek;8;"""The 12 animal rangers"" is one of the best show for kids with a very unique story within an exotic world of fairy tales.Summary:The world Nobel is made of countless mini-worlds of fairy tales created by humankind. The evil who plans to destroy this world from within sends minions into each fairy world under disguise of the world's characters. Each episode, the Mouse and a select few among the rest are chosen to be sent into a different fairy tale on the Unicorn (Kirin) Ship to blow the disguise of these minions.Story: 9/10As summarized, the story is very creative and attractive to kids since it explores a lot of fairy tales with ""improvisation"" due to distortions by the evil minions.In this story, that the Cat is made the evil general utilize the fact that Cat is excluded from the 12 Lunar animals in Japan and most Eastern countries. In the Chinese legend, the Cat finished too late to win the race for any place in the calendar and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forever.Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber.They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable.Even as show mainly geared toward kids, the last episodes are particular dramatic when most animal rangers sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the evil force, making way for Mouse to confront the evil mastermind behind the Cat. The ending relies on a miracle when all deceased animals were revived but it was enjoyable, and acceptable to kids shows of this kind.Art: 8/10The art is decent regarding the time this was made. The animation is repeating especially during special attacks but they are not too often.Sound: 8/10OP and ED are particularly memorable.Character: 7/10The 12 animals get relatively equal coverage but, as a show for kids, there's no deep personalities. However, they did a very good job in showing friendship and cooperating spirit.Enjoyment: 10/10As a twenty-something now after 15 years I still find this very enjoyable, absolutely.";Recommended

Before, I never heard that shonen anime series before. But I heard that from a collaboration with the game Crusaders Quest. So I started to watch it on YouTube.It was a underrated 90's anime series.Story (10)When some Eto Rangers (3-5 members) go away to save a Novel World, some of them are so different that original one like Aladdin, which transformed to Edo Japan era. Even sad stories like the Little Mermaid, it wanted to be a happy ending even Souffle wanted to save the Mermaid, but then, she accepted. But it still memorable.Art (10)Some characters had different styles like Hols, Drago, Urii had big eyes and little pupils, but Bakumaru, Cream, Gaoh, Tart had like normal eyes, and the characters general represented perfectly the animals from the Chinese zodiac.Sound (10)The OP and EDs are very memorable, but it also had character song included in a Hit Song Collection CD which, from today, it's out of print.Characters (10)The main characters had different personalities.Bakumaru is the leader, but sometimes it can be arrogant and reckless, but he's cheerful, has a good leadership sense.Hols has a habit of raging and transforming in a bull each time he sees something red or a red hue.Gaoh is strong and very loyal for his friends, but he also sometimes can be romantic and shy.Cream is also cheerful also had a love feelings on Bakumaru.Drago always stays in calm and cool.Nyorori is the brain of the team.Pakarachi is energetic and hot-blooded, always talked about youth (just like Rock Lee form Naruto).Tart sometimes she angried so much, but always cares about her friend, and also had a crush on Gaoh.Souffle is so sentimental.Monk is mischevious, fun, so-silly, he makes pranks.Pochiro is so active, he's sore loser and also he's hot-headed, he majorly fights with Monk, but he respects him sometimes.Urii is adorable, but he's a crybaby.Enjoyment (10)No comments, just say if you like antropomorphic animals and world saving, this shonen anime is for you.Overall (10)At simple look, maybe you think it's a ""kids"" anime, but deeply, definitely it's a shonen demograpy anime, 'cause it also can touch themes like the betrayal, the lost of someone you love, horror, etc. But also the team-working and trust themes.To conclude, what's Eto Rangers? It's a shonen anime that's about adventure, trust, teamwork, and antropomorphic animals. Also it's about how also someone betrays you. But also it's cautivates your heart.";Recommended

From a job to a relationship. With a relationship at least from a woman's perspective one feels emotional no matter how it goes. Sadly, life can be exactly how you see on television. Where one finds the origin for those almost glued attributes to categories. From As____ being bad drivers to men being lying scum. Here one gets the idea the singers suffered some heartbreak and find self courage. A really kind hearted message to a troubling time.ArtI have stated the message being from negative to positive on relations the art isn't that different. The art rather than being couple (2 players) as one might think is portrayed in a group form. The director here was clever. We already can see from the art or at least tell from the voices the gender standout is female. Safe to say that is the point of view. With the female gender despite what one would think finds strong comfort in females. Even if they are total strangers. The only problem which the director solved with the concept of bounty was what to do as a group since a bar scene was out for it was more two player based. Not only that but to played out.SoundAt first i was okay with the tempo as i struggled to get used to the swap from English speaking to back to the negative tongue. Having listened to it multiple times even more so as i write this review i find the idea of swapping a clever concept. For me it demonstrates the start to a breakthrough. Going with idea of straying from the set path. Very clever.Enjoyment: Have you been a victim of cheating? Marriage ended on a naughty bad end? More secrets in the others heart? I have a cure.

0;Kochira Katsushikaku Kameari Kouenmae Hashutsujo The Movie;LuminesFire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LuminesFire;9;This is a frustrating review to write, knowing there are over 1700 chapters of manga and over 370 anime episodes that are not translated, but that this is the only official thing that did. But it's okay, since this was truly hilarious and enjoyable, and if you read up on the characters before watching the movie, you'll be able to get more of the references and jokes they make (which they do A LOT), but it's truly worth your time.Story: 8It surprised me how it had a good balance of comedy, and later drama, but then the two went hand in hand. The comedy was hilarious, and the drama surprisingly gripping. The general story is about as good as this kind of movie gets, and it was very human and enjoyable at that. The writing in general was very well done, and the overall pacing was very good. I thought it was funner to split the movie in 4 parts and watch another part later, just to remember certain scenes as clips of an episode, just to drag out the enjoyment more.Art: 8Surprisingly good animation for 1999 shounen comedy standards, it's no End of Evangelion or Princess Mononoke, but you'll be impressed with what the animators were able to make. I loved the hell out of the character design, especially Ryotsu's, as well as the other characters, but it's overall look and smoothness is honestly no better than most modern anime today (But I actually like the way old anime looks, so it's not a problem here).Sound: 7It has good sound design, and a lot of the actors were good, but Ryotsu's voice was kind of annoying. That doesn't mean it doesn't have a specific charm to it, and I do like it, but it's something that was just a bit grading when he was yelling. The music was pretty good, fit the mood pretty well.Characters: 10Oh my God, so many fantastic characters. They have many different flavor of character. Foreign, everyday men/women, children, bad rich guys, shy guys, manly guys, strong women, and even some surprises here and there. It really is a good idea to look up information about episodes from the show, or information about the characters, since the movie assumes you've seen at least an episode or two of the TV series. You should get a good amount of enjoyment either way.Enjoyment: 9It was a fun as hell movie to watch, and it also has a really feel good plot.Overall: 9If you like cop gag, comedy, or Japanese culture, you'll love this movie. If you like action or romance, look for another tittle, since this mainly focuses on the first three things I listed. Defiantly watch it, you won't regret it.;Recommended
0;Kikou Sennyo Rouran;Pyro81300;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pyro81300;6;Strange Steel Fairy Rouran is certainly a strange show. Written by Sho Aikawa also known as the writer for Neo Ragna, you have a rather unique style of storytelling with his works.Its sorta hard to talk about the story of Rouran without spoiling major stuff, so I’d like to say its a story about corrupt governments and questionable ethics. About ancient dangers, and mysterious supernatural entities. About one’s identity, and about how appearances can be deceiving. If this is sounding a little too epic considering I only rated this show a 6/10, well you’d be right. Rouran has a lot of cool concepts, but the execution ranges from sometimes good to mostly ok or badly.The characters are above average mostly, sometimes bad. In general the pacing of the show is I feel too fast paced to truly develop any of the characters well except perhaps Rouran, who is definitely the best character in the show, but that’s not saying much. I’d say she’s a “good enough” female mc, and she’s pretty cool most of the time. I wouldn’t say she ever rises too much above your average action girl though. Ultimately, the antagonists feel fairly simple too, so the story explores some concepts of corruption in leading bodies decently enough.Animation is often above average, but never truly reaches above that. The art itself is consistent, and I am a big fan of some of the character designs and most of the mech/monster designs as well.Music wise, the OP and ED while not really memorable, set the tone of the series well. The general soundtrack is atmospheric and even chilling at times, and is perhaps one of the stronger elements of the series. Voice acting is standard, outside of Hiromi Konno who I felt did a very good job with both Rouran’s soft, giddy and serious, heroic side.Overall, Rouran is a solid enough show with a rare female main protag for a mecha show. It’s pretty short too being only about a cour long since every ep is only 10 min, so if you got some time to kill and like niche, odd shows than yeah I’d rec it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kiratto Pri☆chan Season 3;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;7;The third season of Pri Chan was neither as great or as middling as previous seasons have been, but was instead perfectly solid. Though not necessarily as good, this season was at least as interesting as the previous ones and it attempts a lot in tying up all the loose ends. All kinds of characters from all seasons have had some role in this season and it feels like we leave off many of them in a much better place than where we found them. This season also introduced quite a few new characters, all of which were very welcome. Overall, the final season of Pri Chan doesn’t feel like it leaves off unfinished, but ends off leaving me perfectly satisfied. A solid end to an otherwise shacky, inconsistent series.The first obvious difference this season, its gimmick so to say, is the addition of several new ‘mascot’ characters. They act as semi-protagonists for this season and learn a lot from the obviously more experienced established cast. It’s a similar situation to Akari in the original Aikatsu, but that show actually went through with a complete main character swap, which I appreciate for being pretty ballsy. The reason why I like this type of storytelling a lot is because it avoids a common trap a lot of shows like this run into. You create a show about characters becoming idols or doing something else, at the end of the season they beat their rivals and become the best idols in the region or the world and then season 2 happens. All of a sudden new rivals show up and nobody really recognizes the main characters for their achievements last season. The first episode of season 2 feels like it starts of in a slightly different place than where season 1 ends and it feels weird. This is the trap that Pri-chan season 2 falls into, though from the fact that I liked that season significantly more than the first one, you can probably guess I don’t actually think it’s as big of a deal as I’m making it out to be. But whenever I see it happen in a show, it’s just a little baffling and confusing. The shows feels slightly alien and you have to warm up to it again.Pri-chan season 3, thankfully, goes the other route. It adds new characters who can do most of the growing, allowing the main characters to fill the role of mentor. Seeing how much the original squad has grown through how they teach the mascots is super satisfying to see and makes you really think about how long it’s been since the show started airing. It’s really great to see how far these characters have come and it’s a fantastic place to leave them off, just knowing they’ll be alright. As for the mascot character’s themselves, I’d say they’re alright. I liked them a lot, but I just don’t think they’re good enough to carry an entire episode. I preferred them when they were the B-plot of an episode, which often enough they were. In those episodes they didn’t have to carry the plot and got to simply focus on being goofy, which I appreciate greatly. Overall I liked the mascots a lot, I just didn’t like it when they replaced, rather than supported the main characters.Aside from the new mascot characters there’s an idol that farms rice. You see, the kira-kira theme park has an entire section dedicated to several rice paddies that supply all the food stalls and there’s a rice-farming-idol to go along with it. The questing is then brought up: should we be using this ultra-valuable land in the middle of a big city for farming rice, rather than for expanding the theme park with new and exciting attractions? The resolution to this dilemma comes with the statement that the theme park ‘needs rice’. I love this stupid fucking show.The most important new side-characters of this season were the black cat mascot luluna and the white mascot cat solulu, as well as their owners. As the season progresses they start taking centre stage in the seasons final plot-arc, which I can definitively say was alright I guess. I liked it enough and there were enough interesting moments that I can say that it was worthwhile being there, however I kinda wish the final story arc of the whole series involved the main characters more. Then it would have felt like a great send-off, rather than a random story arc at the end of the show, mainly there to facilitate a final competition. As it is, I just don’t remember what happens at the end of the show very well and if the final arc was just a bit more memorable and involved with the main characters, I might have left the show off being more excited, rather than merely satisfied.I think the great irony of season 3 is that I’ve been labelling the show’s greatest shortcoming for the past two seasons to be it’s lack of consistency, however now that the most consistent season of them all has come along, it doesn’t excite me as much as the first two. It was very solid and I liked it quite a bit, but it never reached the highs of season 2 or even season 1. In hindsight I realize that the thing that I wanted out of the show wasn’t necessarily consistency as a whole. In fact, the unpredictable nature of season 1 really appealed to me. You never knew what something crazy or hilarious would happen. Rather, the thing that I wanted out of the show was for it to be more consistently what I wanted it to be. A goofy show with fun goofy characters and an occasional slightly more serious episodic episode. And that’s what the show was for most of season 2 and I loved it. What I liked about these episodes in particular was the cast consisting of the six main girls. I thought a lot of the episodes of season 1 involving only the kiratts were kind of dull, but whenever the meltic stars girls were also involved it was usually great. The chemistry of those six girls together was so good and fun I wish that was just what the show was about, instead of the meltic star girls being gone for large parts of the show. Ultimately I think the reason why this season doesn’t excite me is because it was too consistent and never fully dove into the elements of the show I loved. As a result I was never truly excited by this season, even if I liked how much the show did for it’s existing cast, showing them in their best light and developing them, leaving them off better than they were. It makes me happy that this show that I love was in good, skilled hands till the very end. But overall season 3 was solid. Just solid.In the end I am very happy I picked Pri-chan back out of my dropped list 3 years ago. It’s a show that gave me a lot to love, but ultimately a hard one to recommend. The show’s being succeeded by ‘Waccha Primagi’, a show directed by the wonderful, the lovely, the legendary Junicho Sato. Though my first impressions of that show have not been any more than lukewarm. Perhaps I should be taking this opportunity to look into some of his enduring classics, like Crayon kingdom of dreams, goldfish warning or the ever praised Kaleido star. Of course I would like to take this opportunity to recommend some of his works I have seen and love, like Aria, Princess Tutu or Ojamajo Doremi, all of which some of the greatest works of the medium. Sadly I wasn’t that into his most famous work, Sailor Moon, but maybe I’ll continue that one day.Ultimately the experience of watching Pri-chan was a positive one, even if not every episode was great. I got to learn a lot about the anime community, heard a lot of ‘interesting’ takes on anime and saw a lot of weird stuff I wasn’t expecting to see. Overall Pri-chan has a lot greater of a place in my heart than just the 153 episodes of it I watched. It’s an experience that’ll probably stick with me for a while. It’s a good example for me of how anime can be much more than a show, it can be an experience, it can be a community, it’s a way of life. It’s the work of a team of loving staff, many of whom probably still working their way up the ranks, but soon, ready to start shaping the future of anime. The director will likely continue to be one of the most consistent comedy directors in anime, maybe one day a well respected one. Kids anime are often the playing grounds for new anime staff and can be a good place to find up and coming future big shots. This eccentric anime, ignored and unknown by most in the west might have a much bigger footprint on the future of anime than anyone may ever realize. A little show like this could give a tremendous roar. In the end Pri-chan is neither the ultimate underdog of anime, nor the ugly ducking-turned-beautiful-swan I described it to be.

This one is more chill and slife of life-y, though of course it keeps its degree of “hololiveness”This is not something that I would say those who aren’t fans of Hololive are going to enjoy. On the other hand if you are a fan of Hololive and especially of Miko, go for it, I’m sure you’ll enjoy this extra content.I’m not entirely sure how to rate the animation - while I would love a Hololive anime with regular 2D style of animation, the benefit of using the actual 3D models is that it gives it a sort of authenticity of the original stream videos.Overall, it’s a nice short watch for those who are already invested in the character(s).;Recommended

0;Urashima Tarou (1931);Sebulon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sebulon;5;I suggest you grab the popcorn before starting the movie for it is quite short. Plus if you get an urge to go visit the toilet in the middle of the movie, don't worry: it won't last much longer.Story: 5/10Even though the film is merely some 80 years old, the plot has everything that a well written movie needs: a beginning, a couple of turning points and an ending. The story takes off at some random beach and I must say that the beginning got me really confused. Who is this weirdo? What has he come here to do? So unless you are familiar with the folk tale, prepare to be dazzled, for the film doesn't give you much of an explanation. The plot advances at an alarming rate, so unless you are some sort of a rocket scientist it might be a little difficult to follow. Nevertheless, after the first few scenes you start get the hang of it and actually enjoy it a little. You can always rewatch it a couple of times if you really want to suck it dry.Art: 7/10The artwork is one of the strengths of the film: back then TV had just been invented and Urashima Tarou was one of the first anime ever created. The japanese chaps of that time called it fucking awesome. Just like all other fossils it is in black and white, which wasn't considered a flaw back then, but nowadays it sure sucks ass. The animation is glitchy, blurry, itchy, twitchy and everything between them, but it's surprisingly fluent. The drawing itself looks nice and detailed assuming it doesn't glitch for a second.Sound: 1/10It is a silent film, so you can stop searching for an OST right now. But not having sounds is actually a two-edged sword, for you can listen to what kind of music you ever like while watching this. I made a few test runs: I watched the film while listening to j-techno pop, rap and folk metal. The first two didn't suit the film at all, even though the it looked pretty rad when the film twitched to the beat of the techno pop. Rap doesn't suit anything, but hey, I had to try... Folk metal suited the film surprisingly well, made it look pretty badass. Just imagine all the possibilities!Character: 6/10The story has only one main and a few side characters. The protagonist is pretty clever guy who makes the best of every situation he gets in. Always has this retarded smile on his face. It is quite easy to get attached to him, he's quite the personality. The few side characters that appear are pretty stiff and not that amazing, but some of them have their own charm.Enjoyment: 4/10I didn't really enjoy this movie. Most of the time I was wondering what the heck is going on, but after rewatching it a couple of times, I think I got a pretty clear understanding of what happened. I am not familiar with the folk tale, so I had no expectations of what's going to happen. But the film is so short, it only hurts for a moment. The film also has zero ecchi, so if you are in hunt of pantyshots, boobs and cameltoes, you really are looking from the wrong place.Overall: 5/10It's a historical piece of crap, that people should watch if they want to feel nostalgic and stuff, or if they want to add something to their list. But it really is crappy, so don't expect too much. If you are a badass like me, you can even watch it a couple of times.;Mixed Feelings
0;Urashima Tarou (1931);Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;2;Important Information to know in regard to this anime. There are three versions.The most confusion for this anime lies between 1918 and 1931 versions. If the version you are watching has a completely bald head for starting main character you are watching the 1918 version. If the starting male character has what appears to be a pony tail you are watching the 1931 version. Hope that helps, it took a lot of research to solve this puzzle.1918 directed by KITAYAMA, Seitaro (depending on source varies on time from 1 minute to 2) I found it to be a little over a minute.1931(this one) directed by Miyashita, Manzo (a little over a minute long)1952 directed by KATAOKA, Yoshitaro ( about 5 minutes long/ HAVE NOT SEE THIS YET WILL CHANGE IF NEEDED WHEN I DO SEE IT)rate a 2Japanese raw(mind you there is just a title page. Otherwise there is no words nor voices)art filmStory/art-Fast Paced. Too fast to follow along with what is going on.-Art black and white outlook.- Art looked fuzzy/blurrySound - silent film. You can find some versions with sound. I am not sure if this came with sound or not. By sound i mean song not animation sound wise.Characterno use of text or voices plus fast moving art made the character bio a coin toss if you will. Or in other words you the viewer determine what was said but good luck it is pretty hard to figure out.EnjoymentSo many things went wrong with this production. From speed to it being silent, no words. It was like rather than you watching an everyday anime you were viewing this while sleeping. Perfect example when i think about it.

Also, despite this only being 2 minutes long, there's about 3 or 4 different scene transitions, which doesn't help in conveying the story at all.The sound is really basic, featuring a dopey music track like many other Japanese films of the era did. There's no voice acting, and actually no dialogue whatsoever.I don't know, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it doesn't have much going for it, and I didn't really enjoy it.

0;Murder;gff;https://myanimelist.net/profile/gff;10;"Murder.This straightforward name actually represents the plot of this outstanding anime very well - a Murder, and the struggle to find the culprit behind it. While the movie's art and idea are obviously old (and the movie itself is rather old, 1964, way before the big anime revolution in japan), it is as a matter of fact one of the best short animated movies in the history .Well, you are probably wondering exactly what is so great about Murder. before I'll go on detail about each aspect, I want to state that this movie is actually a parody, that mocks the then-popular detective genere and the different popular stories that belong to this genere. It is also worth mentioning that this is the only anime ever produced by the multi-talanted artist Wada Makoto (known for his involvment in the game industry, Mario Kart DS for example is one of his works).Story:As I said, Murder is actually a parody, therefore the story is important. However, Murder simply explores the same story (A man was murdered) a few times, each time, a different detective is working to solve the case. While the parodies will probably appeal to older audience and people who has a larger knowledge in the western popular culture in the sixties, even younger viewers mighr enjoy the delight humour.It should be noted though that one must not expect a great story. the movie is a parody, and therefore the story is very simple, and is not what the director wanted to show you, so I think rating it a 10 is acceptable.Art:Yes, I rated the Art 9.You are probably looking at the picture and wondering what the hell is wrong with. It looks like a 5 years old boy drew this. And this is exactly my point - the Art is so childish and simple that it fits perfectly to the mood of the parody. While I personaly believe that the Art could have been better, I don't find anything faulty with using this brilliant, childish art; especially when the topic in hand is as serious as murder.Sound:The art is what you would expect it to be: simple and matched to the parody in hand. For example, in the film-noir parody, there is a film-noir sound. There is no voice-acting in this movie.The other sound effects (screaming, walking, etc.) is good enough and is exactly what I would expect it to be.Character:I really don't have anything to say here, as the focus is on the parodies and not on the characters. I rated it a 9 and not a 10 because a little character development could be nice, but really, It is not the point.Enjoyment:As you can see, I really enjoyed Murder. In my opinion, it is one of the best short-movies ever produced, and I would watch it again for sure. Make sure when you watch to try to link each section in the movie to your previous popular culture knowledge, so you would be able to recognize all the parodies.";Recommended
1;Murder;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;7;"Once again I am reminded that if you want to be an animator or artisan of any kind, you don't have to aim for the same high-fidelity style that everyone else shoots for today to be ""good.""This is the same short plot portrayed multiple times with different famous characters solving the case. Or, rather, how different kinds of story would approach the same inciting incident of a discovering a murdered man. The first short is Sherlock Holmes. I'm pretty sure the second was Poirot. Another one was James Bond. The last was an art film. There was a vampire story in there.It took the concept in several directions, all interesting because of how differently it directed each bit. It's not just the animation on paper; it's also how the camera moves or how it handles color that differentiate the story types.Basically this is one of those ""X but Y"" YouTube memes going around, but in 1964.

0;Murder;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3Art filmStoryHard to tell for sure. For not only does the story do series of the same cycles but keeps coming to an end and starting right back up.As for the true final ending let’s say I agree with the characters I give up.ArtWhat is with the floor scoot walk? I didn’t know they had anticipated the room bot (current circle shaped vacuum technology for today) in 1964(year of production) as noted by the ‘walking’.Certain artist choices are perplexing such as magical steel or silver dagger as opposed to ‘wooden’. Or a less involved example is the mantle. A decorative piece but sadly portrayed as wallpaper rather than the true intention of furniture.From color choices to color style I am saddened. I understand that this time era this was probably knew but watercolor is not a real good choice for animation for it makes the characters look faded or dry.Missed opportunities for Easter eggs like the fake newspaper. Had it been me I would have made some fun other minor stories. Or in another series of examples the chat bubbles are made up instead of actual words. I suppose it allows people to make up their own dialogue which is kind of an interesting idea but if that were the case why place fake words why not type “fill in” or something.SoundNot the best in turns of sound management. I strongly advise keeping fingers handy to adjust. Sure, the sound level is wonky but I am appreciative that given the age there were sound effects.;Not Recommended
0;Fortune Quest L;keronyam;https://myanimelist.net/profile/keronyam;7;I've watched this during the late 90's and I have to say it's very decent to watch this nowadays if you're looking for a feel-good anime that is focused mainly on adventure and magic. I have a few ups and downs about the series.On the positive note, it has good character development as each adventure gives us a background of at least one of the main characters. Each character is far different from one another and I have personally enjoyed how they compromise and blend in with one another.I cannot say that the art is great, but for an anime that was released during the early 90's, it's not bad at all.The plot is great. Their adventures got me hooked most of the time. If you are looking for a bit of romance, well, I can probably say that there is a bit (and I mean just a bit) of it but do not expect it to go deep.There are a few things missing in this anime. First, it lacked a main plot that can somehow lead us to a deeper story other than their constant travels. There were only 26 episodes so there was probably no opportunity for the producers to do so. The ending was very unsatisfying as well. It didn't give a good closure to the series so I was really left hanging.All in all it was good. It should have been great if they gave a better closure with the anime. It was somehow like Rurouni Kenshin (anime) where it all just ended like that. Nevertheless I can still recommend this for those who have liking on adventure.;Recommended

0;Shimai Ningyou;DeSwitch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DeSwitch;6;"With their father working as a priest in the royal capital, Lester Clieford and his sister Mith have been living alone while attending school in a small neighboring town. Unfortunately for these two, fate has not been kind. Not only did they lose their mother at an early age, but Mith has been afflicted with a strange disease that has been weakening her over the past few years. That dynamic may be what formed the secret love that exists between these two, and even though they may hide it from one another they’re not fooling anyone, not even their classmates. That’s all about to change after her illness takes a turn for the worst against her already fragile body. What’s a guy to do if he loses not only his mother but his sister as well? I suppose it’s not called Necromancer for nothing…Of course, as we all know, that route isn’t exactly all sunshine and rainbows. Bringing someone back from the dead is tough, and if you aren’t selling your soul to the devil you’re sacrificing other people to satisfy your own twisted ends. When Lester summons a sexy nymph to carry out the ceremony, she wants not only a “taste of his soul,” but also a virgin sacrifice. This doesn’t jive too well with Lester, who just wants his sister back but doesn’t want to do an equivalent exchange, so she concedes that the blood of a virgin will work just as well. That’s where the poor and unsuspecting Lady Pusel comes into the picture. She’s a girl of noble blood who recently transferred to his school and quickly befriended him due to their similar social status. Looking back I’m sure she regrets that move as she’s unwillingly restrained and violated by a desperate Lester who just wants his sister back. The best part of all, at least for Lester and his sister, is that once all the forced sex and virginity stealing is over with; Mith’s spirit will have a whole new body to inhabit. Thus circumventing any of that pesky related by blood business.At only one episode in length, Necromancer is a surprisingly self-contained OVA that actually starts and concludes its entire storyline in the short time it’s given. This keeps you from running into the always annoying “to be continued” razzmatazz that never quite materializes and also keeps the pace from dragging. Given those two pluses, Necromancer actually doesn’t turn out too shabby. Its medieval setting in a new world of mystery and magic gives it a solid foundation aside from the infrequent sex scenes that really only show up towards the end. Naturally it doesn’t really have time to develop much given its short duration, but what we do get is enjoyable enough to keep us interested as much when they aren’t having sex as when they are. Well, at least it’s close anyway.Even though the sex scenes are more sporadic than one may prefer, the ones you do get are fairly well done. At the start of the episode you basically have a couple instances of students having a little fun on school grounds, but as the OVA comes to its climax things get much more fun. Between Lester sexing up the lustful demon and going at it with the unwilling (at first of course) Lady Pusel, it does give us enough of an exciting time to make it all worthwhile. That is, as long as you don’t find the inconsistencies in the finer details and character designs too distracting. The animation stays about average throughout though, so it shouldn’t be doing much for you either way. What really irked me with this release is that, given there is no English dub; I am forced to watch their mangled subtitles without any recourse. With misspelled words galore, you have to wonder if anyone actually proofread this thing at all. “Good, who fever is down.” O.oAside from a few problems, Necromancer is a fun little title with better than expected production quality and a couple sex scenes that really bring the whole thing together. The subtitle mistakes are annoying yes, but they don’t really inhibit one’s enjoyment, and the inclusion of some nice bits of music really serve to round out this release as one of higher substance and quality than not.";Mixed Feelings

In fact, extremely childish.Many think that being childish is a defect for a work, but these people are wrong. There is anime for all audiences, the one for children is no different.Kitty's Paradise is episodic, and each episode is an adventure in Kitty and Mimmy's imagination.Each episode teaches something to the kids, and it's run in a somewhat expository way for the target audience. This anime wants to teach basic things to kids while they have fun watching.Kitty and Mimmy are two very cute characters, and quite amusing at various times.As they are sisters, it is natural that they fought for silly reasons, especially since they are children.As a whole the anime is good, taking into account its purpose and target audience.;Recommended
0;Cherry no Manma;Retro8bit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Retro8bit;6;"""Misunderstandings, "" they happen to the best of us, yet more often then not, they seem to find a way of resolving themselves. Enter ""Cherry no Manma, "" an OVA that shows us one example of this...Story: 6/10I have to say that when I read the details on this series, I was expecting maybe a short story regarding love and emotion, this was pretty far from it though, despite the main characters (a girl and two guys) living under the same roof. When I mentioned ""misunderstandings, "" that pretty much sums up this title. The anime revolves around a character named Yuki, who seems to have a bit of a pervy side to him, and is accused of stealing his roommate’s (Kanoko) underwear. Since this OVA is only 10 minutes long, what you read is what you get, and because it is so short, there is really nothing more I can mention about the storyline without ruining it for you. Now that is not to say this title is boring or bad, because it really isn’t. There will be some points where you are going to think that the main storyline will in fact be echhi, but again, it really isn’t. The main point revolves around Kanoko’s underwear, but you only see them as they lay about on the cloths line, or in her dresser, not once will you see any up skirt shots or anything like that. Now for me this was a nice touch, as it made the overall story seem very simple and easy to watch. I was worried that this OVA was going to be nothing more than fan service, but no, watching the characters get ruffled from this situation was pretty cute and funny. Kind of like watching your next door neighbors get into a disagreement--you know you shouldn't watch, but can't help to anyway. Of course it goes without saying that if you’re a fan of echhi-ness, then you will be dissapointed by this. Still, what the storyline does offer in it’s short time is sweet and to the point.Art: 7/10The art looks pretty good considering this was made in the late 80's, the backgrounds reminded me of the same style you would see in Sailor Moon, a bit washed out at times, but overall a nice looking scenery. Character design is the strongest feature here, they look quite well thought out and appealing. The only real bummer about the art style, is that the animation can be a bit on the stiff side at times. This becomes apparent when the cast try to do anything particularly athletic, ie: run, fight etc.Sound: 7/10My favorite part was with the actual voice acting, though not the best you would here in a series, the actors do bring the characters to life pretty good, and are well received. There is no opening theme, but the closing is pretty cute. Plus the background tracks are quite lighthearted and appropriate (they range from soft instrumental elevator style music, to what sounds like a life on a farm theme). It set the tone pretty good!Characters: 6/10Now I have to go on par of saying that I have never read any of the manga versions to this, and thus just wasn't able to really connect with any of the characters in this short run. They acted okay, but nothing really special. Yuki is a slight perv, Kanoko is quick to jump to conclusions, and Yuzuru seems to be the mature voice of reason between the two. I enjoyed them, it's just a shame there wasn't anything out of the ordinary with their personalities.Overall: 6/10""Cherry no Manma"" is a decent little slice of life title, even though it suffers from not being anything particularly new, it makes up for it by getting strait to the point with its story. If you have never read any of the mangas like me, then this OVA won't have much of a lasting affect on you. However, none the less I am now interested about this series, and plan to read the actual mangas, and I think most viewers will feel the same way after viewing this.";Mixed Feelings
0;Cherry no Manma;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Cherry no Manma” is a short OVA based on the manga of the same name, and along with the similar title “Ano Ko ni 1000%,” it was included as a bonus on a VHS/Laserdisc volume of “Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage.”The story follows a girl named Kanoko whose favorite pair of underwear has gone missing, and she accuses one of her housemates, Yuki, of stealing it. He insists he’s innocent, but the other guy she’s living with, Yuzuru, also takes her side, and Yuki runs away. Will Kanoko and Yuzuru be able to reconcile with Yuki, and will Kanoko ever find her panties?This OVA does not work as a standalone piece, and likely was not intended to — it’s a bonus for fans of the manga, as well as a “trailer” of sorts to get people who bought the main OVA interested in the manga. Thus, we aren’t given any background on these characters (there are only 3), or how they came to live together. This makes the whole thing rather confusing. You’re left spending most of the time trying to figure out what these characters’ relationships with each other are and how/why they’re in their present living situation.After watching this, I read some of the manga and figured out the synopsis of the story, and it’s a bit less innocent than it looks. Kanoko is the 15-year-old daughter of a yakuza boss, and her father is going to force her to get married when she turns 16. Before then, she wants to get a boyfriend and experience becoming intimate with him; that’s her driving motivation for the series. As for her housemates, one of the boys is her brother-in-law and was assigned to be her bodyguard, and the other is a boy she has a crush on and whom she came to live with due to various circumstances. Also, she has the “special ability” to cause people to blank out when she yells at them from a close range. The title, “Cherry no Manma,” is likely a double entendre, referring to both her cherry-patterned underwear and her virginity. It loosely translates to “She’s still got her cherry.”Anyway, going back to the OVA itself, there is little character development, but at least the plot, as simple as it is, moves forward and has a satisfying conclusion. The animation is fair. The character designs are nice; the character designer would later work on “Fushigi Yuugi,” which is probably why one of the characters looks like a proto-Tamahome. The voice acting is not that great; in particular, I felt that Kanoko’s voice is a bit grating on the ears. The music is all instrumental and is pleasant enough, but forgettable.As for objectionable content, there is plenty in the manga itself, but not so much in this OVA. A pair of girl’s underwear is the focal point of the entire piece, and one character accusing another of being a panty thief is what drives the plot forward. In that sense, it could be considered by some to be objectionable, but it’s not explicit; there is no nudity or anything like that.Overall, I would not recommend watching this unless 1) you’re a fan of the “Cherry no Manma” manga; or 2) you don’t care for character development too much and just want to watch something simple with a “cute” ‘80s aesthetic.";Not Recommended

But the problem is that the story is too short, and too rushed. We know that the couple loves each other, but we don't know why. We don't know why they can't be together. We don't know any details behind the pressure they feel. Nothing. So it's very hard to relate to either character at all.Art: 4The designs of these characters are really good.

Again, feels a lot like a student piece.Sound: 4The music is very soothing. But the voice acting is very spotty. Some of the actors do a decent job. But there are a few voices that were devoid of motion. Very disappointing.Character: 2Practically non-existent. I hardly know anything about either of the 2 characters. I know one is a princess, and embarrassed with her appearance. And the another is polite. But besides that I know nothing.Enjoyment: 3If I came in expecting a student piece it would have gotten much higher. But I came in expecting a parable like story, with focus on the characters and the problems they faced. I got neither. The music was nice, and the designs were good.

0;Gokiburi-tachi no Tasogare;AnnoKano;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AnnoKano;9;"It is always interesting when a children’s film attempts to explore deeper subjects thematically, and Twilight of the Cockroaches dares to cover the international relations and economics of Japan at the peak of its economic success in the late eighties. The great nation of Japan, at the time the second most powerful economy in the world, flatteringly portrayed as a colony of cockroaches infesting the apartment of a slobbish Japanese man.This self-deprecating analogy is quite the contrast to what one might expect from the Japanese, who are usually more closely associated with qualities like ‘honour’, ‘strength’ and ‘tranquility’. Indeed for any group or nation to present themselves in such a grotesque manner is unusual; it would usually be the sort of metaphor used in a work of propaganda. This makes the premise quite intriguing and the potential for a particularly biting piece of satire is alluring. But in what sense is Japan similar to a colony of cockroaches?The first point to be made here is that it is not really Japanese people per se that are like cockroaches, but their approach to economics at that time. Living with their slovenly landlord, food is abundant and the cockroaches enjoy lives of immense luxury, to the extent that lives of cockroaches can be luxurious. There is no expectation that these glory days will come to an end, and they make no preparations for any forthcoming ‘rainy days’. Alas, those rainy days do come, just as they did for Japan itself in the early nineties when the economic bubble finally burst. Was this a prediction of the future? Not really, such consequences are inevitable in economics, and we have been experiencing the same effect in the west for the past few years, after a housing and finance boom.But there is more to it than that; indeed the economic crisis is something of a natural occurrence, while the fate of the cockroaches in this film is rather more deliberate, in that the host actively attempts to destroy them. After finding himself a girlfriend who is distressed by the infestation of cockroaches in his home, both decide to clean up and engage in “war” with the cockroaches. Quite what this is a metaphor of, is a complicated question. The host meeting the girlfriend clearly and comfortably represents a change in the economic situation, but their conspiring to destroy the cockroaches could be taken to be an active attempt to destroy Japan. The reputation that Japanese people had at that time was of very hard working people who would come to replace the United States as the dominant economic power due to their strong work ethic, and perhaps this is what the creators intended to convey. Alas, this is not made clear enough in the picture itself and would rather contradict the lazy nature of the cockroaches prior to the host meeting the girlfriend.There is however one further element of the Japanese national character embodied by the cockroaches which leads one to believe they represent not only the economics of the country but its people: and that is the rather dramatic conclusion of the film. This scene is shocking, especially when one reflects on the prime audience of the film, but how it fits into a metaphor of the Japanese economy is unclear; but it does fit neatly into certain other aspects of the Japanese national character. This makes the films thematic conclusions somewhat confusing. However, one cannot help but praise the bold faced, frankness of it all.Another aspect of the film which is unconventional is the way it blends live action and animation together. The cockroaches are animated, the humans are real people, and the environment is a mixture of the two. There are a fair few western productions that have taken this approach (‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit?’ is the most famous example) but one cannot think of any examples from Japan. Critics might say this is because the technique has rather limited applications or because it is usually unconvincing. However, I think it is well suited to this production. And while the character designs of the cockroaches are quite simplistic to be combined with live action, it only becomes a problem in the occasional scene. Other than that the animation is up to an acceptable standard.The film is currently only available in an English dub, which is unfortunately a bit ‘straight to video children's movie’. That is to say the voice acting, while not terrible, is a bit bland. The voice actors are capable but not particularly talented and so you cannot help but laments the lack of the original Japanese dub. The background music is suitably atmospheric, dark and ominous, which emphasises the films dark themes nicely and captures the prevailing attitude of people towards cockroaches neatly.All being said Twilight of the Cockroaches is not a film that will appeal to anyone; in fact, it will appeal to only a very limited audience, but this is not because of any lack of quality on its part. The fact is that the film is now quite old and its animation is dated, its themes have now faded into obscurity, and what is left of the content without them perhaps too childish. However if you have some basic knowledge of Modern Japanese history and a taste for niche and experimental animation, then Twilight of the Cockroaches could be just the film to pique your interest. Furthermore if you are not familiar with the Japanese approach to children’s films outside of the Studio Ghibli catalogue, then the bluntness of their traditional approach may leave you feeling quite surprised.When all is said and done, Twilight of the Cockroaches is a clever and daring film, without any contemporary. And for that, in the often times repetitive world of Japanese Animation, makes it something to be cherished.";Recommended
0;Gokiburi-tachi no Tasogare;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;5;"Twilight of the Cockroaches is quite possibly the strangest anime I have ever seen in my life. The more I think about it, the more I struggle to believe this thing exists. This is a super ambitious, big budget children's film with seemingly zero audience. I could compare it to Titan AE, which lost 50 million dollars and seemingly wasn't made for any one demographic. However, that would be dishonest. Titan AE could have performed fine targeting the tween market if it were advertised better. Don Bluth was an experienced and highly capable director who had performed well before with unusual films like NIMH. Joss Whedon was red hot property after Buffy and wrote a script loosely based on a beloved childhood cartoon called ""Star Blazers"" which MAL users might know better as ""Space Battleship Yamato"". There was reasonable hope for Titan AE. Twilight of the Cockroaches on the other hand could only have been greenlit as a Yakuza money laundering operation.The plot of Cockroaches is that a man is abandoned by his wife, and she takes the children. The man sinks into a deep depression and decides to completely give up cleaning his house. This leads to generations of carefree cockroaches who live in roach paradise and have no idea what their grandparents had to suffer through. Then one day, the man gets a new girlfriend and after 2 peaceful generations for the roaches, the man commits all out genocide against our anthropomorphic, often overly sexualized roach heroes! This is a children's movie in which all the protagonists except for one are brutally murdered. The roaches aren't just humanized and anthropomorphized; they're also clearly meant to represent Japanese society.This leads directly to the message of the film. The depressed bachelor is supposed to be the United States. According to the director, he wanted to tell the Japanese youth of the 80s to stop partying so hard and appreciate what they have because eventually America will grow tired of Japan's success and wipe it off the face of the planet! America never stopped being virulently racist against Japanese and is simply biding its time for the opportunity to unleash nuclear Armageddon on the Japanese people! This is hands down the most deeply paranoid children's film ever made. It's hard to get more paranoid than the Russians, yet even the Soviet Union didn't make a children's film in which a character sings about how the British are going to launch a nuclear barrage against Russia because they still hate Russians due to the Crimean War of 1854. America's level of racism against Japanese was basically non-existent by the late 1980s when this film was made. Hell, we can't even get our racists to be racist against Japanese! We honest to God have weirdos online who believe in the inferiority of all non-whites with the sole exception of Japanese!Now all of that was pretty strange, but we're not at the bottom of this rabbit hole! Cockroaches wasn't based on a manga, novel, play, or anything like that. This was a completely original idea. So, who had the charisma and the sheer industry pull to make this giant failure happen? It turns out it was a D-list voice actor who never made anything before or since! He's just some random dude who did background voices on lots of random anime. One day in 1987, he just marched in front of the executives of Studio Madhouse and made the craziest elevator pitch imaginable...and they said yes. I'm not sure if the boys at Madhouse were just drunk out of their minds that day, high as FUCK on quaaludes or if this really was yakuza related. Since this was the 1980s, it honestly could have been any or all of these things.Did you think this was the end of the review? NOPE! This film gets weirder! This is one of the only anime ever made that's live action mixed with animation in the style of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Space Jam"". However, this actually came out before Roger Rabbit! The decision to use live action/animation hybrid was instead inspired by ""Song of the South"" from 1946. They really wanted to make Br'er cockroach because absolutely nothing about this film is normal or makes sense.If you've read this far, I know your brain must be overloading, so I'll just say one last odd thing about the film. The character designs are by Yoshitaka Amano, who did the character designs for Vampire Hunter D and the first 6 Final Fantasy games. That part actually makes sense because he was with Madhouse at the time, but it's still pretty weird.Should you watch Twilight of the Cockroaches? Hell yes! This is the kind of utterly bizarre, clusterfuck of an anime that could only have been produced during the height of the Japanese bubble economy. Nothing like Twilight of the Cockroaches could ever be produced in today's Japan. I can't find any data on what this film's budget was, but I can only assume it was well over 10 million dollars adjusted for inflation and that money was essentially set on fire for the lulz. Madhouse was simply that invincible in 1987. The only studio I could imagine having the spare money to make such a project today would be Tencent. So here is how we're going to make Cockroaches 2: the Quickening. Some Chinese MAL user needs to go to Shenzhen or Shanghai and ambush one of Tencent's executives. Now the next part is really important. Go to a bar to pitch your idea and start buying them rounds of baijiu. Do not stop buying them baijiu! Then suggest a children's film in which a cartoon panda family representing the ideal Chinese family are vivisected by an evil tanuki representing Japan. Then suggest making it partially live action just so that Jackie Chan can curb stomp the tanuki at the end of the film. If we get them drunk enough, maybe we can pull this off!";Mixed Feelings
1;Gokiburi-tachi no Tasogare;ArcFloof;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArcFloof;5;I had a hard time getting into this one and for good reason. The premise is absurd but not in an endearing way. A society of cockroaches is allowed to live in some guy's apartment because he's too much of an alcoholic slob to do anything about them until he gets a girlfriend or something. A female cockroach falls in love with a random cockroach from another apartment. There's a bit about cockroaches being at war with the humans but it just comes across as odd. It's creepy. The roaches are not endearing and their interactions with humans will make your skin crawl. Think A Bug's Life but without anything that made it entertaining. I couldn't tell if this was for children or adults.I'll start with the sound. Any time a human does something, it is loud and thunderous. This is done to give the viewer the perspective of the cockroaches which is a clever idea but in execution, it's too loud and mixed in a way that is painful on the ears. Aside from that, everything is bland and the character voices aren't all that animated.The animation is acceptable but most characters are simple and there isn't much detail to anything drawn. The animation and live action scenes do blend well. Everything is rather dark and it is difficult to discern what is being shown on the screen.The story drags. I mean it just plain drags. This film is an hour and 45 minutes and it just never seems to end. Much of the film is just fluff and could be cut. The inciting action and conflict don't come about until about halfway through, before that is just bland drama. There is little action and when it does occur, it is not compelling in the slightest. The characters are one dimensional, falling in and out of love with each other on a whim. The film has a bit of commentary about Japanese culture in the 80s but much of this is lost with the bland dialogue and odd premise.Overall, I don't know what the hell I was thinking when I watched this one and I would not recommend it to anyone. The minor social commentary is lost and there are better ways to get a feel for the aspects of Japanese society this film was meant to portray.;Mixed Feelings

3;Gokiburi-tachi no Tasogare;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;6;Twilight of the Cockroaches is a bit of an oddity for me to cover here thanks to its mix of live action and animated footage used for its run. So in a rare case, I'm not gonna bother handing out grades on Art for this one since it would be impossible for me to judge this properly on any merits for its animation.The movie is focused on a colony of cockroaches who seemingly live a peaceful coexistence with the human owner of an apartment. But not all is what it seems as once the homeowner gets a girlfriend, the lives of the colony become a living hell when the humans start wiping them out. The movie is focused on two different colonies in this film: those living with the bachelor who are peaceloving yet quite lazy and a militaristic colony who are regularly at odds with the woman who would become the bachelor's girlfriend. It appeared both sides were being portrayed as extreme elements in Japan's history with the militaristic roaches personifying Japan's militaristic regime under Hirohito during World War II and the peaceloving ants portrayed as Japan's modern youth having lost sense of their country's cultural identity from the peacetime it gained after World War II. The film appeared to be an allegory for what Japan could face if it continued to or returned to paths the country shouldn't take in light of now being part of the international community, the humans personifying how outsiders would perceive Japan. This symbolic approach works well for what it wants to tell.However when it comes to being an engaging work, there are many points in this film where it can be a struggle to watch through depending on what you hope to get out of Twilight of the Cockroaches. The movie occasionally focuses on a young female cockroach named Naomi who comes to interact with both cockroach societies, though her character doesn't get proper focus or development thanks to the movie's focus on the interactions both societies have with their human owners. This also leads to an unconvincing love triangle to develop with Naomi being engaged to a male cockroach from her colony, yet also becomes interested in a male soldier named Hans from the militaristic roach colony. The movie's slow pacing also works against it at a number of points in the film as Twilight of the Cockroaches can get too fixated at points showing off its cinematography to show how the cockroaches perceive themselves dealing with their human owners or traveling around the outside world.The animated element to this film in the form of the cockroaches are on the simple side in terms of details and are quite outdated in the style in which they are drawn. However, the film's cinematography is still excellent with showing how the world would look through the eyes of the cockroach colonies with point-of-view shots of objects and humans appearing like giants in the eyes of the roaches and use of still shots to show roaches fleeing in terror or dying from human objects like shoes and bug spray. Playing along with seeing the world through a roach's eyes is that the live-action human actors seen in this movie are kept silence (even as they talk) so as to limit the movie's POV to the roaches alone and not having the audience see things through human perspective if the actors were given audible lines.Overall, Twilight of the Cockroaches is a bit of an oddball of a title thanks to its mix of animated and live-action footage. It does effectively express its symbolic messages involving the cockroach colonies being elements of Japan's history past and present and their perception to foreign nations. However in terms of storytelling, the movie won't be for everyone as it doesn't effectively focus on characters from an individual basis, gets more focused on the colony relationships with their human owners and the slow pacing can make it a chore to go through at points when the movie gets wrapped up in showing off its cinematography. Anyone looking for a title quite different from older and more modern anime could get enjoyment out of this. But if you aren't a big fan of live-action films, I wouldn't bother picking this up.;Mixed Feelings
0;Magical Twilight;Retro8bit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Retro8bit;9;"Despite what the info says above.... this is a hentai title. And a good one I might add!The main story revolves around Tsukasa, an ordinary guy trying to get through school.....until two witches named Chipple and Irene come a callin'. They are attending a &quot;good witches&quot; academy, and are in desperate need of extra credit. So both are sent down to earth to make friends with a human, and thus earn enough credits to graduate.The story works well enough, each of the four women (the fifth wants him dead) have their own reasons for wanting him. Yes I said &quot;want&quot;, not like. Chipple aside, the other women merely want Tsuabasa for their own sentimental or selfish gain. Which I felt was a nice little twist on things. Chipple (the sweet girl next door personality) falls for him due to his nice personalty, Irene (the play girl of this title) simply wants him to earn the credit, the other two I won't say as not to post any spoilers, but trust me its works well! Despite the fact that this is only a three episode OVA series, all the characters are given a good amount of air time to where you feel you can really connect with them. Over all the characters are charming and likable, Tsubasa and Chipple slowly grow attached to each other....but their road ahead is filled with many bumps along the way. And you will most likely be rooting for them the entire way.The music to this anime is okay, but mostly forgettable...with the exception of the ending tune. (Sorry but no j-pop songs in this one)This title definitely shows its age (1995) when compared to recent entries in this genera. That aside, the character design is well detailed and the backgrounds beautifly drawn, with colorful settings, environments and characters. Now that we are talking about the art style though, right here is where the problem will be with most hentai fans. For example: The sex scenes are exciting and well made, but are on the short side. This is a title that bases more emphasis on story, though there is still a reasonable amount of sex scenes to go around. However there is one draw side to this as well, as they leave more up to your imagination during them. In other words, they don't draw any of the &quot;below naughty parts&quot; of the characters. Which may turn off some hentai fans.If you prefer &quot;long well detailed sex scenes&quot; in your hentai, then you probably won't care for this title. I realize I am being a minority on this one, but for me this is one of the best hentai titles around! While its not as detailed in the parts you would want it to be, it more than makes up for it with its likable cast, good sex scenes and well paced story.";Recommended

Two polar opposites forced to handle the same assignment. Is it a good or bad call?Pro(s):plot: stays true. Despite what adventures await the original goal stays in mind.characters: background is filled. I say filled because not only where each character known but done to the extent that side mission were complete. If you ever played a role playing game like elder scrolls online doing the side missions along with the main quests is considered playing the full game. For you reached the max in all areas. No rock was left unturned.Con(s):-art: censorship is sloppy. There is nothing but blockage and invisible pitched tents in the show. I say sloppy for why have a ghost like appendage when there are no ghosts.-plot: very one sided. This anime is a blend of two worlds. The main goal is relevant to that factor. So, why does the focus ignore the other world? I want to know what they think is happening. I want to know if they can see what is going on. I want to know how they are fairing with others.

0;Ashita e Free Kick;_Mataga_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_Mataga_;7;Ashita e free kick is one of very few anime that I watched years back and still fresh in my mind (around 2007). It left a really good memory of my youth and I don't deny that my eager to re-watch it some years ago was due to it.--Story--Ashite e free kick may not be your typical sport anime. Despite it has one unique technique which is the main character's special move it's not really a football anime. Well, it may, but not your typical sport anime. If I would conclude the story in Ashita e free kick it's more about Godai Shun and his friends.Ashita e free kick started of with Shun and Roberto come to Shun's grandfather's island. In the island, Shun meets people from football youth club which is actually his family's football club. After meeting them, Shun becomes interested in football and tries to learn playing it despite some of his family members forbid him to or don't approve Shun's decision. One of them is his uncle who wants Shun to focus studying economics and continue the family's business instead. The sport club that's being a focus of this anime isn't only Shun's new football club. Aritaka Mizuho's (the female main character) volley club is also received much focus on some episodes, especially in the middle of the stories.This anime can be divided into some parts based on its stories. Some first episodes focus on Shun's interest to play football and his introduction to new friends of his, how the relationship he builds between them and also Shun's family circumstances. Started from episodes 10s, the story shifted focus more on other characters, especially Mizuho. This is the part I like the most, where Mizuho started to get close with Shun and they give romantic vibe especially from Mizuho. This part also opens more chances of screen time from Mizuho's volleyball team which is truely a fresh air. Though this part is also showing Shun playing football, it's barely being a focus. The third part, the last part, started out around episodes 40s where the football and shun's family drama get more attention again.That being said, this is not a good anime if you want an exciting football or volleyball which push you to keep watch and want to know what club wins next. This is more about daily life of characters who engage in sport and their relationship.--Art--The art of this anime is the weakest part. Well, I actually like the art style since it gives a vibe of old anime which is so charming and atmospheric. The character is also very well designed that the female characters are so beautiful.But the lazy part of the animators are seen in the later episodes where the character seems drawn by different people from the first episode. There's an obvious inconsistency in how the character drawn in some episodes of the middle part. The character from other football club (Jaldan Youth) are also similar except the captain which make them are like ten person triplets. I don't know why they draw them that way. Maybe it was for comedy purpose, though it isn't that funny to feel so.--Sound--Sound, especially the background music, is the best part of this anime similar to other 80s or 90s anime. The music usage is also pretty well in evoking the intended emotion. a 90s type of rock guitarist gives an exciting vibe when the character having fun and such while a relaxing music plays when the scene shows the character relaxing and enjoying the regular day with normal activities (like watching the sunset and such).--Character--This anime has a big cast when it comes to its character, as expected from anime that involves sport team but only two of them that are stayed as focus from the start to the end which are Shun and Mizuho.Shun is actually a typical shounen MC but not in sport anime. Shun is calm, oblivious, naive and a nice guy. He doesn't show emotion often but sometimes he shows empathy towards others. He is somehow childish but can be mature at some points.Mizuho on the other hand is a typical easy going female main character. She is so spirited and easily distracted by her emotion. She loses focus when something bugs her especially if it's related to Shun. It's implied that she is deeply in love with Shun but somehow tries not to think about it but enjoys the moment she shares with Shun. This affection of Mizuho might be annoying to see since it makes her shout Shun's name many times and she can be over-dramatic. But I personally like her and don't think so about her.--Enjoyment--I really like how the relationship between her and Shun developed in the middle of the story and kinda disappointed that the staff worked in this anime don't make their relationship canon. But the platonic love between Shun and Mizuho (even though it seems more like one-sided since Shun is oblivious about her and his own feeling) is really interesting to see and one of the best parts of the show.--Overall--Ashita e free kick falls under slice of life genre. It may present sport clubs but it's more a slice of life than a sport anime. This is not an exciting sport, this is a relaxing slice of life.;Recommended

0;Unkai no Meikyuu Zeguy;Colonelfancy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Colonelfancy;7;Mask of Zeguy is a bit of a tease. It's one of those OVAs that would've made a really good television series in the mid 90's, but it's these kinds of tiny quirks that always gets my blood going and encourages me to watch more flavors of anime back in the day. Zeguy had the recipe for success, all it needed was a cook. Or at least three more episodes.STORY (5): It's story is pretty typical for it's era. Girl warped in strange world, magical item/doomsday tool, save world, Toshizo Hijikata as a love interest (wait, what?) You're not really told a lot, but you can see that there definately could have been more. I really liked the idea of featuring heroes from different eras of history to unite and defeat Himiko (which might be another historical reference. I'm not near my resources) from using the power of the mask to take overthe universe/ destroy the world/taunt someone with it, etc.ART (7): The world in this venture is fairly bright and vibrant, although not too spectacular in terms of a fantasy setting. There wasn't too much that was done with the setting of the world that the tale took place in, which is kind of a letdown. The characters look fairly good, mainly Miki herself. She personifies looking really basic and really hot at the same time, especially when she modifies her sailor fuku into a mini-skirt attire, complete with a sleeveless top and using her ribbons to tie down the torn cloth from her skirt around her forearms and calves. Combine this with her tomboyish short hair cut, and she really looks cool. The villians look really good, but I wish they had a chance to be properly utilized.SOUND (5): These voices are incredibly over the top, but it's charming in that really cheesy old English-dubbed style where the actors are trying just a little too hard to the point where it's comical. The music isn't too bad either, but nothing spectacular. The score during the end theme is pretty good, however.CHARACTER (6): As it's pretty short, character development is rather clunky. There's a fight at the beginning between Hijikata and Komei, a bad guy who kinda reminds me of Phil Ken Sebben from Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law a little bit, that just kind of comes out of nowhere, then it's cut to a high school with two girls fighting for undisclosed reasons. Not much to develop, though I really like Miki's interaction with Old Guy (I don't remember his name, or if he had one) and Hijikata, who just rules in almost every anime he's been in.ENJOYMENT (8): If you want something that doesn't riddle your head with bloated, etheological jargon and simply gives you a tale of a teenage girl battling the forces of evil with the most bad-ass samurai ever (Yagyuu Jubei is awesome as well!), this is a really fun little opus to watch. It's got great replay value because of it's simplicity, yet at the same time, you would wish for a series to be made because of the latent potential it has. One thing I found kind of weird is that the mask itself is a little downplayed. Strange.OVERALL (7): Mask of Zeguy really gets me choked up because I'm never going to get anime like this anymore. I'm not comfortable with everything being all dark and methodical when all a show needs is just to let the plot to tell itself. Titles like this one I think should be viewed by everyone who enjoys to anime to their friends. it's far from a masterpeice, but it makes a great anime to show some friends who are over and are just getting into the medium. A nice, basic tale like this makes great starter anime for people on the fence about it.;Recommended
0;Apfelland Monogatari;DerMensch24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DerMensch24;8;Stories about the damsel in distress adventure are a hackneyed staple in the realm of storytelling across all mediums. However, whenever done correctly, will always result as a source of enjoyment for its audience. Such is the case for the film Apfelland Monogatari, a surprising gem from the early 90s period. The film does not fail to entertain the viewer, packing in an intricate plot, wonderful characters, and colorful visuals to keep one entranced by the story.Set in an alternate early 20th century Europe at a time of nation-building and old feuds, the film manages to incorporate a realistic sense of the historic era with its relevance to geo-political events, nations, weapons, and down to the very lifestyle of the time period. That goes without saying however, as this film is based on the manga from Yoshiki Tanaka. Yes, THE Yoshiki Tanaka, mastermind creator of the Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Arslan Senki manga and later anime adaptations. Also assisting in the creation of this anime was the director, Kunihiko Yuyama, who would later go on to direct the Pokemon franchise. Therefore it is easy to see the influence of the young protagonists as they adventure in order to save the world from ruin. Cliche? Yes, however was still a good story.However this is a heavily character-driven story, very akin to Laputa: Castle in the Sky or Nadia: Secret of Blue Water. What stands out for this film is despite its brevity, we are given a well-received cast that for the most part have ample screen time. Each character contributes to the story and only on a few occasions were there unnecessary characters introduced into the film yet this did not detract from the overall enjoyment. There is also a great dynamic of action and drama added to generate excitement for the viewers.The art, with the direction of Mitsuki Nakamura, were appropriate for the story, giving the feel of a late 80s animation however remaining fluid for its time. However there are noticeable moments with reused footage and animation that become repetitive.The seiyuu performance was nicely done. Some might recognize a few of them, such as the MC being the same voice of Conan Edogawa from Detective Conan. The OST for the film initially felt out of place, however as the film progressed it became intertwined with the story in an adequate manner.Apfelland Monogatari is another quiet gem that went below the radar of the rise in anime for the 90s, however do not let its age fool you. While retaining a cliche story yet not being mainstream, it nevertheless is an enjoyable film full of wonderful characters and an exciting adventure.;Recommended
0;Fukai ni Nemuru Oujo no Abaddon The Animation;Wicker_Senpai93;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wicker_Senpai93;7;Fukai ni Nemuru Oujo no Abaddon The Animation (Sleeping Princess of Abaddon in a Rotten World) is an ONA by Peak Hunt. I watched this way back when it came out in early 2020, but held off on writing a review because I expected that more episodes would be released. However, considering it has been two years of absolutely nothing, I think it's safe to say that this anime has been cancelled. Which is unfortunate, because I was actually quite looking forward to what this studio had in store.Unlike most other hentai, this particular ONA actually has a story worth talking about. In fact, this anime places so much emphasis on the story, that it actually gets more attention than the sexual scenes (of which there are only three). The story concerns a group of six people who become trapped in a haunted mansion while looking for a professor who disappeared while investigating it. Like in all horror stories they foolishly split up and shenanigans ensue. I actually quite like this haunted mansion scenario, since it require the writers to develop a singular location, and the characters all being stuck there creates an uneasy familiarity. One small gripe I do have however is that there seems to be no rules for the mansion, and scary stuff just happens whenever, although I suppose it could also be argued that this sort of randomness is a good thing for keeping the audience on their toes.The characters in this story are also actually memorable enough for me to bother naming them. The main character of this anime is Homaru, and he mostly just moves the plot forward. He has a friend named Kippei, who joins a guy named Seijirou and a girl named Rikana to search part of the mansion. These three characters do petty much nothing in the story, and I suspect the writers were saving them for another episode which never came to fruition. That leaves the real stars of this anime, Mia and Yachika. Mia is a sweet innocent girl who seems to be in love with Homaru, while Yachika is an aggressive and jealous girl who is madly in love with Mia. I actually felt invested enough in the characters to root for Yachika, and she has some of the best moments in this anime.Much like the story, the art and animation are fairly solid. The art style for this anime seems to be more reminiscent of a non-hentai anime, which I think actually works really well. It does however still look a little rough at certain points, and you can tell that the animation is struggling to stay fluid. The background art and the character designs are probably the best elements overall. Also, this anime has several gore-heavy scenes, that look a little simplistic and could have used some variety, instead of the wave-like gushes of blood that are frequently used. Lastly, while I usually don't do this, I do want to comment briefly on the sex scenes. There are three in total, but they are very short and two of them are quite frankly worthless. Only one scene (a yuri scene in particular), has any relevance to the story, and it is thankfully very sweet.The sound design is also good. The voice acting is perfectly satisfactory, but is otherwise nothing to ride home about. The music on the other hand, while not rich in variety, is still very good. Not only is it pleasantly played, but it also contributes greatly to the mysterious atmosphere being portrayed.Overall, I enjoyed Fukai ni Nemuru Oujo Abaddon quite a bit. It was a nice change of pace, and it reminds me in some ways of older eras of hentai. I only wish there were more episodes to truly test it's strengths. 7.5/10I would definitely recommend this anime to any hentai fans, although be aware that it sadly lacks an ending. Who knows, perhaps if enough people enjoy it we will get a proper conclusion some day?;Recommended
0;Lupin III 3DCG;LovelyTekki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyTekki;8;Honestly, there's not much for story or character because this short is just 2 minutes long. However, it gives us an interesting look into what could have been. As a long-time fan of Lupin III, I admit I hadn't really thought about what a CGI adaptation would be like apart from the various video games about Lupin, but this short beautifully adapts the designs of the characters into 3D.They look just like they always have without looking uncanny and weird. The animators were selective about what to make more realistic looking, such as Fujiko's hair.There is no dialogue in this short, just the Lupin III theme, but it tells it's very short, simplistic story without any words. We just follow Lupin for another heist and an action-packed car chase that the series is known for.The only real bad thing about this short is that it never got made into something else. I would have loved to see a Lupin III movie in this style. It would have been especially interesting to see how the animation team would have adapted some of Lupin's sillier expressions into 3D.;Recommended
0;Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;5;The Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama offers a lighthearted and humorous look at the events that occurred throughout the series. The motion graphic spin-off series provides a comedic interpretation of the events that took place in conjunction with the anime. Originally released on the official Twitter page of the series, the Picture Dramas were included in the Blu-ray BOX sets. The voice cast for the Picture Dramas is the same as the Anime cast, which is definitely a plus for fans of the series.Despite the Picture Drama's comedic nature, it does give us some insight into the characters that we don't get to see in the main show. For example, we learn that Hajime chose Yue over all the other girls, which some viewers may find disappointing. Additionally, the Picture Drama highlights the dangers of girls' night chatter and shows us that a mother's love knows no bounds.However, some of the Picture Drama episodes do come across as strange and disjointed. For instance, Shea's interactions with the child leave the audience feeling uneasy, and some viewers may feel that Eri is even more annoying in the Picture Drama. Furthermore, some of the episodes feel like they're trying too hard to be funny, such as the One Piece and Overlord specials.The Picture Drama does have its positives, including the fact that the animation is well done, and the opening and ending songs are still enjoyable to listen to. However, it's clear that less effort went into these episodes than the main show, as evidenced by the floating heads used in one episode instead of full character animations. Some viewers may also be confused by certain scenes, such as when Hajime considers a blob of slime over an alternative.Overall, the Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama is a mixed bag. While it's a fun and lighthearted way to enjoy the series, some viewers may find it disjointed and too focused on humor. The Picture Drama is definitely not a substitute for the main show, and some viewers may feel that the budget for these episodes could have been better spent on improving the main series.;Mixed Feelings
0;Dragon Rider;Zarnaav;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zarnaav;7;Story :This has a story is not full of sex scenes , the sex scenes are about 25% of this . For those interested this has monster rape, single female and vanilla , although the hentai should not be the main reason to watch it for.Since the anime is so short things get rushed here and there , and some things seem to happen for the sake of the plot , but if you are not easily disturbed by that you'll enjoy it .Character:There is a lack of character development and sometimes characters make unexpected decisions .Art :Is good for an old anime, the character's design looks well and the shading is way better than in some anime which appeared 15 years after this moreover, there is no censorship .Sound :Since Karisu has the same voice actress as Pikachu and Lydia the same as Nami ( One Piece ) you won't be disappointed ,also one of the reasons you might want to try this .Enjoyment and overall :I enjoyed this not as a hentai but as a medieval adventure fantasy .In some aspects it was slightly above average in others cliche ,but with medium to no expectations you can watch it and enjoy it , I know I did it since I've wanted to watch this on a whim.;Recommended
0;Haru no Ashioto The Movie: Ourin Dakkan;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;5;"Wow this Movie was released almost at the same time this site launched but nobody has done a review of it in 13 years. Well someone got to make it, more if I am watching the worst anime shows that this site says it has. Expect some spoilers btw.Haru no Ashioto the Movie is bad. But there is like a weird way to say it's bad. It doesn't do anything atrocious but it is stupid, it is stupid but in a strange way.The plot of Haru no Ashioto centers around 3 student girls that are like prodigies at the school, but one day there is a coup d'etat in the school in which a teacher is taking control of it, dethroning the principal so it is the task of these 3 girls to get back their school.The story as I said it is stupid. They engage in fights to get the control of the school but in the end is worthless because the teacher is telling this plan for some festival they are having. It feels like a waste of time exposing these ideas that go nowhere and that for some it could be considered a really big waste of time but at least it doesn't drag too long since it is only 20 minutes.The characters are bland, once again these girls are your typical ""we are strong with the power of friendship"" and try to convey this sorta magical girl spirit with, I don't know if this is the right word to describe it, prophecy of a baseball bat that honestly I believe it was from a baseball player but it seems that it was a name they put out at random. The teacher is your unidimensional I am bad and I want power with the laugh that goes ""A HA HA"" you here from these kind of villains.The art and animation are actually decent. This is based on a Visual Novel from Minori mostly known for the ""EF"" Series which I must say they really do have beautiful artwork but aren't as good when you play the Visual Novels. The animation has a lot of fluidity but I don't know if it is because of the videoplayer I was watching it or the movie is like that but there are times that the animation gets static for like 5 seconds and then it continues, like when the DVDs are starting to not work properly. Also sometimes the backgrounds move by themselves, no joking at all. It seems that the animators forgot that the backgrounds should be static and not move along with the characters.Music and Voice Actors are fine. The voice actors do the job but they are not memorable. The Opening and Ending are just the typical good vibe and cutesy songs that you either enjoy or simply forget.My conclusions on Haru no Ashioto. It is a weird experience, it doesn't do anything wrong but I feel something is lacking or that it could be done better but at the same time it doesn't need to. I don't know how to describe the feeling for this one. It is not an insult but again the purpose of existing is ok I guess.Well thanks for taking your time in reading this review. Take care in whatever you do and see you around.";Mixed Feelings
0;Haguregumo;JokerVentura;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JokerVentura;5;A classic it is not, but it is worth a watch, as it's enjoyably bad.Based on a long running manga series, which started in the seventies and oh yeah, you can tell.The story is of a lackadaisical courier/swordsman who is a master of a twins blade, but prefers to spend his time cheating on his wife, being a terrible father, drinking sake and not doing his job.The film is a comedy and manages to be funny at times, while having some truly disturbing scenes.The film is set at the closing of the edo period, where anti foreigner warriors are at large and shows the main character coming into contact with a group of them and beating, but not killing them.It then shows his carefree life as he enjoys life with his wife, (whose single goal in life seems to be to get some from her husband, when he's not grabbing ass around town) and hanging with his son, (who is looking for a much better father figure, and finds one) and his daughter (a chip of the old block who does as she pleases too.)Not much really happens, but it gives insight into what must be a very dated, average, but oddly fun manga series. I recommend watching, you will somewhat enjoy it, though you may get a bitter aftertaste of old school sexism.;Mixed Feelings
1;Haguregumo;MakingAList;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MakingAList;6;This movie is an interesting product of its time. I found it to be an enjoyable watch. I somehow found it in 1080p, which made its unique artstyle pop even more. Nice colors and composition, even a scene with some experimental arthouse animation.If you want a movie with a compelling story and characters however, you should probably look elsewhere. The only character with much of an arc is the son, Shinnosuke, and maybe Ichimonji. Kumo, although an entertaining character at times, is pretty sexist and just casually abuses his child? (Not to mention, cheats on his wife every chance he can get.) So yeah, if you don't wanna deal with outdated values, parts of this movie will drag you down.Overall, despite some of its issues, I'm glad I watched it. It was an entertaining way to spend the afternoon, peeking back into the annals of animation history, for better and for worse.;Mixed Feelings
0;Yami no Purple Eye;Spirit_Chaser;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Spirit_Chaser;9;If you can watch this with an open mind and appreciate it for it's artistic and experimental approach, you can enjoy this 30 minute OVA.Not much of it is animated, but it does have some very beautiful drawings while sometimes using some effects on them. When it does animate it's very pretty, such as the ocean scene, hair blowing in the wind scene, and also where the woman turns into a panther.The music was actually pretty good in this OVA. I think half the songs I really enjoyed. During the last 8 minutes it really picks up and shows a struggle between humans and the panther humans. There is gore at this point, and the song featured here has great bass playing.It's pointless to rate this for story and character because there is almost no dialogue in this one or character development. You sort of have to follow along and the still shots and little animation, carried by the music.I can appreciate the experimental and artistic approach of this OVA. I enjoyed it.;Recommended
0;Yami no Purple Eye;Asztal;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Asztal;3;Well uh.. That is a thing. That was sold in stores. For real cash.To clear a few things up, I actually found this MV (I guess) pretty relaxing and entertaining, so with that, why a 3? The biggest reason is because it was sold for real life money. You could purchase a 30 minute Manga Music Video in 1988 on VHS. At the time, sure It might have had some material value, but since free and common video sharing websites exist now (and since the Internet became a thing), it's value became basically zero for the normal consumer. Only collectors would find any value in the physical release.With that said, it is pretty well made for 1988/87(sources differ) and for being a MMV but even so it feels cheap in the grand scheme. It has fluid animated parts as well, so I don't know why they wouldn't just animate one short chapter in 30 minutes. This feels more like a university club fan project or a modern day Niconico MMV than -you know- a retail release OVA meant to advertise and sell the manga itself. I would definitely feel cheated out of my money if I had bought this in the late 80s/early 90s with the 'Toei Animaton' logo on it, expecting a nice, actual OVA made by the company behind Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon.So overall it definitely is nice to see/listen to if you're a fan of relaxing music, but don't actually buy it unless you're a crazy VHS collector or something like that.One could argue that the 'Very Bad/Poor' in 3 references a 'Very Bad/Poor' business practice.At least it got me mildly interested in the manga so that's good I guess?;Not Recommended
1;Yami no Purple Eye;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;1;This is a promotional music video for a manga, and it's about a girl who turns into a leopard or something (if she dates anyone, is this bestiality?). Dunno anything about that, but we do see a few panels from the manga scattered throughout. I actually stumbled upon this because I enjoyed other efforts from the director Mizuho Nishikubo, who was a good choice for a music video, as he also worked on Radio City Fantasy, which had a lot of music videos sprinkled throughout the story. However, this is a cheap effort compared to most promotional OVAs, and there isn't much here to work with for nearly 30 minutes.Often, this is just a slide show. Featuring many glossy images that look like concept art based on various chapters of the manga, sliding into place, shifting around the frame, sometimes zooming in or out, other times overlaid on some animated backdrops, or dissolving into the next frame. There's a little bit of visual experimentation with split screen and other techniques, but this honestly looks like a tacky, stitched together slideshow from a super-fan of the manga.Whatever scenes are animated are generally pretty nice. The beach scenes look solid and have fairly fluid animation. There are plenty of scenes of water, as well as a few scenes with the leopard running and background animation. I want to say only like 5%-10% of this is animated, but even when it's animated, it's usually just loops of sparkly stuff or hair billowing or flowers adrift or sky backdrops.There's no real narrative to the music video either. It all feels very randomly placed. I'm not sure the music fits that well or is very good, but it does the job. I'd be pretty sore if I shelled out cash for this back when it was released, even if I were a fan of the manga... now that it's widely available, it's worth a look if you're a fan, I guess, but this is something that probably deserves to be forgotten, relegated to the twilight hours on an old grainy TV set, droning away in the background while you're performing menial tasks. I try to be sparse with the 1/10s, but this is so boring and pointless and an absolute waste of time and bereft of any entertainment value or meaning, so it deserves it.;Not Recommended
0;Sinbad: Soratobu Hime to Himitsu no Shima;DeathStroke96;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DeathStroke96;7;This is an interesting movie about the beginning of Sinbads journey, as well his first adventure.Overall it is an enjoyable story the characters are fun and interesting to watch, the music if and when it appears is quite nice to the ears and although the art style isn't the most extravagant aspect of this anime it is not bad along with the okay animation the movie for just those aspects is good enough.Story of this isn't the most complicated and is pretty simple at the moment but still it's interesting and worth giving a try along with the characters which make the story move nicely and during the beginning a bit emotionally.I do have a weird question that I asked myself but i will refrain from doing so here in the review but I will make an assumption that it was due to the budget limit that certain aspect occurred once that the studio chose to make use of a character that was already introduced and focused on rather than some random side character.Lastly it's pretty good if you like or would like to see the Japanese version of the stories of Sinbad than you would enjoy it, tbh I myself never read the stories of Sinbad but watched some cartoons of his adventures as a kid + with myself being a fan of Magi (manga) and it's version Sinbad I am willing to give a chance to other Japanese takes on the character known as Sinbad.;Recommended

It spends the first half on Sinbad leaving his birthplace, and the only part of that that feels filmic is his mother's reaction. After that point, it picks up a bit because it has to get through the magic island portion with the rest of its time. Or, rather, it needs to get them there and have the princess emote.Even so, it's not bad by any means. Being budget Laputa means it still has a few interesting visuals, nice character designs, and an easygoing attitude. I found it pleasant more than anything else.";Mixed Feelings

0;Netrun-mon the Movie;NoblesseOblige3;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NoblesseOblige3;8;Netrun-mon the Movie is about a couple of character that get taken to a world called The Net Characters World where they meet some interesting people who befriend them, the story can be summed up as a rescue mission where one of the two protagonist gets captured and the older brother rescues her.The beginning when the two duck like characters appeared some what reminded me of the Elves and the Shoemaker by The Brother Grimm where they appear and start helping the computer company.The net Characters World at some points to be very ordinary just like our world but then can quickly go to some fantastical area where there are giant towers and dragons.The art is nothing special, it fit the type of show perfectly, each character was well drawn and animated well with a few still scene but its nothing bad, background art was simple but detail wasn’t required for such a small OAV.The voice actors did an ok job, the ducks sounded fine and because the characters in this show are made out to be small cute people they had overely squeaky voices that are not annoying and some may consider them cute, background music is pretty standard, kind of reminded me of music you here on game consoles, simple keyboard tunes. the ending is a nice slowish ballard pop song that is realy nicely sung.The character make this a lot more of an interesting show, the hero of our story is a duck like creature that comes to the world with his sister and appear to be partners in whatever they do, Chiyu is a girl who drags them in and is genrally the character that gives out the information and calls herself (though im unsure if the other characters are)a Computer Sprite. There was also a small blob like creature who was smoking which i found to be quite funny, the character receive help from two human looking guys, a samurai and a guy who seems to not care about anything and genrally unmotivated, the others seem to be there just to add extra cuteness and give a reason for the hero to fight on level terms with the big bad called Master and his minions. There was also a random girl who appeared when a door was opened just sitting there on the toilet and i thought it was hilariously random.Overall it is an OAV that is worth checking out, it combines fantasy and mahou shoujo and plenty of comedy, though won’t have you laughing your ass off which make you smile and chuckle, there is also a little toilet humor thrown in (the weapon that apears on the crotch) at 29 minutes long it is by no means a waste of time.;Recommended

0;Fetish Doll;hinekure;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hinekure;7;"As someone with great interest in the nature of human sexuality and connection, especially in the form of 'abnormal' or fetishistic behaviour, an anime titled ""Fetish Doll"" under the ""dementia"" category will inevitably catch my eye.There are two ways one might approach this four minute long acid trip of an animated short - the first is that of contempt and/or indifference, the second would make you sound like the most pretentious person ever to write an anime review. Either you will raise your eyebrows at it and move on, or you will think about it for 10 minutes, nod your head and shrug in acceptance and/or approval and move on. It's not a short that will change your life, but it's only 4 minutes long, so how much of a waste of time can it really be?Basically, Fetish Doll is comprised of a bunch of hand-drawn depictions of body parts (mostly ears, hands, and, well, dicks), flowers and abstract shapes interacting with and morphing into one another. In my opinion, it essentially shows sex and fetishism as a means of communication in a pretty undramatic expository fashion, and what makes me think this is the inclusion of the ear as a symbol and the way it is interacted with for lack of a better phrase. Of course, anyone who watches this film, or anything for that matter, will inevitably project their own meaning onto what is occurring based on their personal perspective, and in this case it's more evident than in most since there is no narrative or evident purpose in what you're viewing. In my personal perspective, Fetish Doll makes me think of the concept of objectification and the way in which we give meaning/sensuality to the way in which we communicate with our bodies. There really isn't much you can say about the film without talking about yourself and your own perspective, and if that was deliberate, it might actually be a little ingenious.";Recommended

Didn't remember much about it between viewing a few days ago and now, so I ran it in the background as I typed this. It starts with a ping-y flute, and then pulls in other noises, some of which I could only describe as wet. The art seems hand-drawn, with translucent layers floating over moving background images.None of that was a problem. Nor were the first five-seven seconds of the film. It opened with a field of slightly abstract dancing flowers in bright colors, making me think I was in for something like a Mirai Mizue film or one of Furukawa Taku's abstract shorts. Then things got weird. The bulk of the film can be summed up in three words: ghostly floating penises. Call me a prude, but it's not my cup of tea. Your mileage may vary.";Mixed Feelings

There's a good use of colours and them bleeding into the atmosphere when they needed to spread their presence, or how they'd endeavour in smoke motion around the scene, possibly a connotation to the dozy sides of life of lust.

There is no point being made other than being ""visually stimulating"" (which it isn't to be frank), or ""thought provoking perspectives being provided"" (which it doesn't), or ""a strong statement about our society which is objectifying women"" (which is hardly ever presented or elaborated other than just stating it like an object - intended irony? I don't think so).If people are into such snowflake attempts at being ""adult"" or ""involving"" its pretty much going to be a disappointment. Skip this unless your willing to give your curiosity a moment to digest this LSD type trip. It isn't a ""fetish doll"" movie, which makes it grossly disappointing to say the least. Either way, a waste of time.";Not Recommended

0;Sotsugyou M: Ore-tachi no Carnival;ladyxzeus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ladyxzeus;3;"On my demand of watching all BoysLove anime and related I came across Graduation M. And I consider this the worst BL I've ever watched. EVER. This is starting to become hard, you see... On any case, let's see why even the most dedicated of the fans should avoid this thing.A story, unlike the synopsis seems to claim, does not really exist. Five good looking men are presented through the first 16 minutes of the series and then engage into crossdressing for a theatre play, because ""kawaii"". One of the characters is show playing Graduation M game, that's by far the most interesting point of the story... The rest rolls slowly, filling in the screen time with absolutely useless conversation that does not add anything to the story. As for the characters, that sometimes may make up for te story, are cut off cereal boxes. Each one is a stereotype, but so horribly stereotypied that it's not even fun. It's like a proto-Gakuen Heaven, but worst.Now, this could be compensated if we had these 40 minutes f animation just for the eyecandy. It was done before, it will be done in the future, I personally have nothing against it... But the art... It's not even pathetic... It is... Miserable. Horribly amateurish, as well as the animation. Everything is crooked, it looks like Neopets fanart done by a 12 year old. The most basic laws of shading, perspective, anatomy, colouring, anything you can remember.. Even the most basice IS WRONG!Most likely the only positive point of this piece of ""bizarre"" animation is the voice acting. It is clearly well done and all the actores match ehtir characters perfectly. The background music is common of the genre but not less annoying. Cheery and cute songs intercalated by rock instrumentals that may fit perfectly in games but just seem out of place in anime riddle these 40 minutes. For a moment I even considered each character would have a theme song.In the end, a really dreadful experience. A cheap OVA created without any care or skill. Avoid it for best results.";Not Recommended

I was lured to this anime through the false impression of its seemingly decent art, the seiyuu cast and a promising plot.The synopsis written for this anime could only be applied for the very end of first ova as the entire ova was just an introduction of the characters and nothing much else. The second ova was again about absolutely nothing. Only snippets of the play rehearsal were shown. Then it got even more pathetic when the anime tried to add a twist in the last 15min, desperately hoping to engage the viewers and failed miserably.This anime was a waste of time and I only finished watching it out of obligation to the precious megabytes I’ve wasted by downloading it.;Not Recommended
0;Usavich V;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;"Rate a 5art pieceBored is the best word to describe my feeling for this season. For each season had its own bad guy(s) and good guy(s). While that can be said true for most anime at least in anime such as Naruto there is more depth to its plot. Such as more scene settings and more evil characters per season. Than again this anime is quite short in episode duration. I guess my main complaint is due to the ending. Battle after battle for generally the same thing only to end with an unknown factor with the potential to continue with the factor? This is why i enjoy shows with heavy plots. At least during the ending or possible introduction there is a moral lesson to be learned from all the events that unfold. Here there could be some moral lessons learned but none that carry a kind remark to life. Morals learned in this show range from if it works keep it. Physics don't define me I define physics. To expand on how the morals here are bad let me use my first example on ""if it works keep it"". While it is true success can happen in certain aspects in certain matters unless you change it there is no guarantee it will continue that way. Like if a good luck charm was a pair of socks for a person on getting laid. If those socks continued to remain uncleaned due to the fear of losing its value will only gain in time a new value called stench. Which in turn will cut down most hopes for future advances.Don't believe me that this show is recycling too much? Consider the American cartoon scooby doo. That show has been remodeled a bunch of times and because of which still remains popular. Here the anime still remains computer generated.";Mixed Feelings

I was excited for this ever since the trailer, even if it was only 4 episodes. The problem with this special is that not only does it feel too short, but the battles felt kinda... Disappointing, if anything. I felt excited for the next episode, knowing something big would go down in a 4-episode-only special and the climax really built up near the 2nd or 3rd episode, but I suppose that's on me. It is nice, however, that the battle was well explained, there weren't any sudden power-spikes that turned the MC into Ragnarök that would eventually cause destruction upon the 3 realms (Just kidding). The battle was well fought, techniques were properly used and there was no silly talking, although there was still some conversation during the battle which is kind of... not fitting? Probably just me though. But because of how good this is, this gets 9/10 from me.;Recommended

0;Anju to Zushioumaru;Assthete;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Assthete;6;Anju is so much better than its predecessors. You'd expect some slight progression, but thanks to Saiyuuki's blatant incompetence only a year before, it didn't happen. I can feel Takahata's touch in this, always granting his stuff a sense of gravitas, however subtle. It's also vastly superior in terms of presentation, with fluid and consistent animation, clever use of color and texture, and accurate drawing. For the first time Japanese animators fully committed to visual timelessness. Screenwriters also finally realized idealism shouldn't be the norm, presenting a rather tragic story about coping with loss, and such a fitting ending. Even the cuteness didn't feel nearly as misplaced as in other titles, but rather properly integrated. I genuinely don't understand how this is both less watched and scored lower than garbage like Saiyuuki. This is probably the first good anime and the first case of quality losing to popularity. Most people will keep sucking Hakujaden despite being inferior merely cause it's the first.;Mixed Feelings
0;Anju to Zushioumaru;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;4;"To me, this felt like a step backwards even for TOEI movies in the sixties. The animation quality has gone through clear reductions in quality, especially when contrasted against something like Sayuuki. The story is premised to be an interesting tragic tale, but is constantly undermined by ill placed Disney stylized replica animals that have no place in the story and only serve to bog down the narrative. The character designs suffer from a lack of inspiration and there is a return to designs more reminiscent of nascent Japanese animation around thirty years its predecessor than the standards TOEI set for itself in the previous decade.Unfortunately, the story isn't well fleshed out either and the continuing problems of poorly drafted storyboarding and a bloated runtime continue to persist in these movies. This time around, however, unlike previous works like Hakujaden or Sayuuki, there isn't any gorgeous animation and excellent sound design to elevate the rather tepid material.The more I watch the TOEI movies of the late 50s and early 60s the more I feel that Japanese animation had already taken a turn for the soulless mechanical trope style factory like production cycle that's comes to resemble the modern animation scene. TOEI studios seemed to have hit on a formula of making quasi-historical Disney style feature length animated works at a production level to great success - and in the process the spark of imagination and creativity that propelled the Japanese animation seemed to be stagnating.It wouldn't be until Mushi studios came out with Astro Boy, did we see the first quantum leap in Japanese animation and a true discovery of its own identity, scaping from the clutches of imitation that TOEI is engaging in here. The Littlest Warrior is another movie in the increasingly long line of disappointing ""could have been better"" Japanese animated films of the era.";Not Recommended

0;Endless Serenade;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;5;Esta review también está en español.A short review for a short hentai (just a 30 min ep). Oh, and this is softcore, so no rape, demons, tentacles or disturbing stuff in general.Yuji Mikage is a college student who works part time (well, he actually do all the management) in the business of his late brother. He's not alone: the one in charge is Satsuki Mine, his dead brother's fiancee. Yuji really likes Satsuki, and since a year have passed since the... ehm... decease, he believes it's time to declare his feelings... but he just can't find the courage to do it. And to complicate things just a little more, Miki Asou, the asocial (almost autistic, yet friendly and kind.... deep down) cashier, is interested in Yuji, so that completes the triangle. Oh, and there are other two persons working there: Makoto and Kurumi, and since neither of them have any relevance to the plot, they ended together (I only mention them cause they have a funny scene n_n).The animation is average. Really average. Character design is also pretty standard, being the best Satsuki and Miki (especially Miki... bonus points for her long red hair). Kurumi must be one of the ugliest girls I ever saw in a hentai, and Yuji is not only a little girly, he had one of the most gay uniforms ever (the same the girls have... just look at the picture). For just half an hour, there are several positions, BUT, except for the oral sex, this is more an erotic anime than a proper hentai... what i mean is that you don't see the penetration (you know... just like in an erotic movie). That's rare, and something you should considered before watching this. Oh, and for some reason, the dicks here are red! (really, wtf?)I can't say much about the sound (as if it mattered that much...), but the voice acting is good, I suppose. In this page the only seiyuu known is Minako Sango (Satsuki's voice), which really doesn't have lots of previous works (being the more important one Ai Minamisato, the protagonist of Kakyuusei, a hentai that nobody watched xD).So... not much to say here. There are much better hentais than Endless Serenade. But, this one is from the 2000, so no censorship, and even if mediocre and simple, is another softcore title, so, if tentacles and rape are not your thing, ES is a good choice if you already watched the good exponents of the genre (like Hatsu Inu, Sexfriend, Ringetsu, Kateikyoushi no Onee-san, Suika, and a large etc.)--------Una review corta para un hentai corto (un OVA de solo 30 min). Ah, y esto es softcore, así que nada de violaciones, tentáculos, demonios y toda esa cosa perturbadora.Mikage Yuji es un estudiante universitario que ahora está a cargo de un local que su difunto hermano había adquirido. Pero no está solo: la prometida de su hermano muerto, Satsuki Mine, también trabaja ahí. A Yuji le gusta mucho Satsuki, y como ya paso un año del deceso de su hermano, cree que ya es momento de declararse... pero simplemente no puede. Y como para complicar un poco más las cosas, Miki Asou, la poco social (pero en el fondo amable) cajera del negocio está interesada en Yuji, por lo que el triangulo se completa. Ah, también hay otros dos bultos trabajando en el dichoso local: Makoto y Kurumi, que como no tienen ningún tipo de importancia para la trama, terminaron juntos (y los menciono por que comparten una escena bastante cómica n_n).La animación es promedio. Muy, muuuuy promedio. El diseño de personajes es también bastante estándar, siendo los puntos altos Satsuki y Miki (especialmente Miki... suma puntos extra por ser pelirroja). Kurumi debe ser una de las chicas más feas que vi en un hentai, y Yuji tiene el uniforme mas gay que haya visto (el mismo que tienen las chicas en la foto. O sea, el tipo de por si lucia un poco afeminado, pero con su ropa rosa y su sombrerito...). En media hora hay varias posiciones, pero excepto por el sexo oral, esto es más un anime erótico que un hentai propiamente dicho... lo que quiero decir, es que no se ve la penetración. Eso es algo raro, y algo que deberían tener en cuenta antes de ver esto. Ah, y por alguna razón, acá los penes son rojos! (en serio, fíjense).Del sonido no puedo dar detalles porque no sé nada de nada (como si importara realmente...). En esta pag solo figura la voz de Satsuki, Minako Sango, que tampoco tiene otros papeles muy conocidos, siendo Ai Minamisato (Kakyuusei, un hentai de los 90 que no vio casi nadie) el más importante.Así que... no hay mucho que decir por acá. Voy a hacerla corta: hay hentais mucho mejores dando vuelta. Pero, es del 2000, lo que significa que no tiene censura, y aunque mediocre y muy simple, es otro titulo softcore, por lo que si las violaciones y los tentáculos no son lo tuyo, Endless Serenade es una buena opción si ya viste a los otros exponentes respetables del genero (como Hatsu Inu, Sexfriend, Ringetsu, Kateikyoushi no Onee-san, Suika y un largo etcétera).;Mixed Feelings

0;Hengen Taima Yakou Karura Mau! Nara Onryou Emaki;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;7;Esta review también está en español.Forgotten Horror, Chapter 3: Hengentai Mayakou Karura Mau! Nara Onryou EmakiI welcome you, once again, to this humble cycle in which we rediscover and enjoy movies and OVA that fell into the most unjust of forgetfulness. The piece chosen for this occasion changes the typical suspense of the genre, and focus more in direct and traditional action (with some glorious gore, obviously), spiced with several Buddhist elements. Ladies, gentlemen this is Hengentai Mayakou Karura Mau! Nara Onryou Emaki (which roughly translate to Transformation Repel Evil Night Travel Karura Dances!), or, from now on, Karura Mau.The story... well, Ikeda family is victim of a terrible curse! The patriarch of the Ikeda, a renowned and respected assemblyman, died in a horrible (and very graphic) way, at the hands of evil spirits. Now, the rest of the family is in danger... Luckily, news travel fast in the eighties Japan, and the sisters Shoko and Maiko Oghi, two teenagers who are also exorcist, transferred to a high school in Nara to investigate the situation, in what happens to be their first real job. Things are not going to be easy for our protagonist, since the paranormal activity is rampant in the zone, and the ghostly crimes range from possession to savage mutilation...In general the story is fast paced, but clear in every moment. Every second counts. Karura Mau is a really long manga... luckily, common sense prevailed, and only a very small part was adapted in this movie (later, some OVA were created, but that's another story).Regarding the characters, in the good side, ignoring the fact that they have paranormal powers, Maiko and Shoko are two common girls. Mai is the youngest, and is joyful and carefree, while Shi is more reserved and serious. But unlike most anime sisters with different personalities, they get along really well. And that's a good thing, because each has different exorcism powers: Shi can identify and find the spirits, and Mai is the one with the seal ability. Both needs to fight together to get results.Fortunately, the protagonists are not alone: accompanying the girls is the inspector Nishikiori, which is responsible for the murder investigation of assemblyman Ikeda. Of course, he doesn't believe in spirits and supernatural nonsense, and almost consider himself the nanny of the girls... bitter and grumpy as he is, he's very resourceful and dependable... and deep down, kind. Another valuable ally is Ohmi Ikeda, the son of the poor bastard. Shi's classmate, and also capable of sensing spirits... and has suspects that something big (and evil) is beginning...As for the antagonist... for spoiler reasons, I can't give details, but I can say that is not only a matter of angry spirits. No, there are many interests, economic and political, involved in the series of supernatural events that occur in Karura Mau...The religious elements mentioned in the beginning, although many (and one of the main sources of charm in Karura Mau), do not pose a (high) difficulty when watching the movie, since most of the time, they take some time to explain several terms and deity names (being the most important, of course, Karura, which is the Japanese equivalent of the Hindu deity Garuda).Action is one of the most interesting points of this film. Here, there aren't implacable enemies who undergo a huge number of poor victims who only had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time (you know, like in most horror films)... no, what we have here is a very respectable group of enemies that fight against efficient and well prepared people. The clashes are frontal and dynamic, and since various characters have different skills (that varies from sealing, vanishing, gunfight or even ninjitsu), the fights tend to be diverse and very attractive.Art's fine. Despite being a relatively old anime, everything looks really good. The characters, while pretty common, are quite detailed and well made (at least, most of the time: there are some close-ups that look terrible... Shoko is a special victim of this). Even the minor characters are well crafted. Not to mention the spirits, they're really diverse, ranging from grotesque, frightening, imponent and sometime majestic, and all of them following a traditional Japanese theme (specifically, from the Nara period). The action take place in various places such as schools, old houses, businesses or temples, and all are well worked. The fights are dynamic and fast, and deaths, which are many (though not as many as one would hope) and full of blood and several limbs. Pretty charming.Sound is as correct as the animation (if not better). All the seiyus do a good job, especially Maiko's actor, who gives her a light-hearted and carefree voice. Music is varied, and accompanies the various situations (ranging from studying at a classroom to battle shinto monks) properly.And now, the final words. Without being a brilliant film, Karura Mau does its job in a clean and satisfactory way. Again, here's almost entirely omitted the suspense and tension, and instead it focuses on spiritual duels and melee battles. Recommended for those who like retro anime, schoolgirls exorcists, Japanese mythology and blood and eyes in the floor.And this is the end to yet another chapter of my small cycle. For those new to Forgotten Horror, the previous chapters were Hell Target (the first one, horror/sci-fi) and Umezu Kazuo no Noroi (the second, classic horror).--------Terror olvidado, capitulo 3: Hengentai Mayakou Karura Mau! Nara Onryou EmakiLes doy nuevamente la bienvenida a este ciclo que tiene como idea redescubrir y disfrutar OVAS y películas que cayeron en el más injusto de los olvidos. La pieza elegida para esta ocasión deja un poco de lado el suspenso típico del género, y lo cambia por una acción más directa y tradicional, condimentada con varios elementos religiosos budistas. Señores, señoras, esto es Karura Mau (La danza de Karura).La familia Ikeda es víctima de una horrible maldición! El patriarca de los Ikeda, un famoso y respetable congresista, murió de forma horrible (y grafica) a manos de espíritus malignos, y el resto de su familia corre peligro… Por suerte, las noticias vuelan en el Japón de los años 80, y las hermanas Maiko y Shoko Ohgi, dos adolecentes que también son grandes exorcistas, se transfieren a una secundaria en Nara para investigar la situación, en el que constituye su primer trabajo real. Las cosas no resultaran fáciles para las protagonistas, dado que la actividad paranormal parece desbocada en la zona, y los crímenes fantasmagóricos van desde la mutilación a la posesión…A líneas generales, la historia transcurre de forma clara, y con un buen ritmo. Cada segundo cuenta, y los hechos importantes se suceden unos detrás de otros. Karura Mau es un manga muy extenso, después de todo… por suerte, el sentido común se impuso, y solo decidieron adaptar una pequeña parte en esta película (mas tarde se crearon una saga de OVAS, pero eso ya es otra historia).Respecto a los personajes, por el lado de los buenos, ignorando el hecho de que tienen poderes paranormales, Maiko y Shoko son dos chicas comunes. Mai es la menor, más alegre y despreocupada, mientras que Shi es más seria y reservada. Pero a diferencia de la mayoría de las hermanas de anime con personalidades diferentes, se llevan maravillosamente bien. Y menos mal, porque cada una tiene la mitad de los poderes de un exorcista: Shi puede identificar y encontrar a los espíritus, y Mai es la que tiene la capacidad de sellarlos, así que para pelear necesitan estar juntas.Por suerte, las protagonistas no están solas: acompañando a las chicas, está el inspector Nishikiori, que es el encargado de la investigación del asesinato de Ikeda. Por supuesto, no cree en espíritus ni cosas sobrenaturales, y casi que se considera una niñera (renuente) de las chicas… amargado y todo, es muy útil, y en el fondo, amable. Otro valioso aliado es Ohmi Ikeda, el hijo del difunto congresista. El también es capaz de percibir espíritus, y tiene sospechas de que algo muy grande está a punto de empezar…En cuanto a los antagonistas… obviamente no puedo dar detalles, pero si puedo decir que no se limita a un grupo de espíritus enojados. No, hay muchos intereses, tanto económicos como políticos, involucrados en la serie de sucesos sobrenaturales que acontecen en Karura Mau…Los elementos religiosos que se mencionan al principio, si bien son varios (y dan una buena dosis de personalidad), no suponen una dificultad (elevada) a la hora de ver esta película, hasta se toman la molestia de explicar varios términos y deidades (siendo una de las más importantes, obviamente, Karura, que es el equivalente japonés de la tal vez más conocida deidad Garuda).La acción es uno de los puntos más interesantes de esta película. Acá no hay enemigos implacables que someten a un inmenso numero de incautos y pobres victimas que solo tuvieron la desgracia de estar en el lugar equivocado en el momento equivocado… No, lo que tenemos aquí es a un grupo de enemigos muy respetables y amenazadores para la gente común, que pelean contra personas eficientes y bien preparadas. Los enfrentamientos suelen ser frontales y dinámicos, y no se alargan más de lo necesario. Cada personaje cuenta con habilidades distintas que hacen que los diferentes duelos sean atractivos.La animación es buena. A pesar de ser un anime relativamente viejo, todo se ve realmente bien. Los personajes, si bien estándar, son bastante detallados y bien hechos (la mayoría del tiempo: la verdad sea dicha, hay primeros planos que son terribles). Hasta los personajes menores están bien trabajados. Ni hablar de los espíritus, que son de lo más diversos, siendo grotescos, aterradores, imponentes o hasta majestuosos en algunos casos, aunque eso sí, todos siguen una temática japonesa tradicional (específicamente, del periodo Nara). La acción transcurre en varios lugares, como escuelas, mansiones antiguas, empresas o templos, y todos están bien realizados. Las escenas de acción son dinámicas y rápidas, y las muertes, que son muchas (aunque no tantas como uno esperaría), están llenas de sangre y miembros cercenados. Encantador.El sonido cumple en la misma medida que la animación. Todos los seiyus hacen un buen trabajo, especialmente la que interpreta a Maiko, que le da un tono alegre y despreocupado. La música es variada, y acompaña las diversas situaciones (que van desde estar estudiando en un salón de clases a batallar contra monjes shinto) de forma adecuada.Y ahora, las palabras finales. Sin ser una película brillante, Karura Mau cumple con su trabajo de forma limpia y satisfactoria. De nuevo, acá se prescinde casi por completo del suspenso y la tensión excesiva, y en cambio se hace foco en duelos espirituales y batallas cuerpo a cuerpo. Recomendable para aquellos a los que les guste el anime retro, las colegialas exorcistas, la mitología japonesa y la sangre en los pisos.Y así concluye una nueva entrega. Para los que recién se suman, los capítulos anteriores fueron Hell Target (el primero, de terror y ciencia ficción) y Umezu Kazuo no Noroi (el segundo, de terror bien clásico).;Recommended
0;Yubi wo Nusunda Onna;Empha;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Empha;7;"I'm glad I found this (rather obscure) short, because I definitely enjoyed it. It's not a new favorite or anything, but it's different from anything I've seen. And I think ""different"" is the key word here. The art style isn't on par with any big-budget studio animation, but it's *different.* When characters move, their outlines stick around and become part of the background. This was probably done to speed up the frame animation, but it looks cool nonetheless. Sometimes this effect is obvious, but sometimes it turns into a game of trying to find a lingering piece of outline. (Also the wood grain on the floor in a few shots is beautiful)The sound is minimalistic, since no one is talking. Ambient sound is only used in a few instances, but every time it sets the mood perfectly. The ""action sounds"", mostly thumps against the floor, are low quality. But they still feel real, like the characters have actual weight.There's not a single word in this short, written or spoken, and the visual storytelling isn't very obvious either. On my first watch I wasn't sure what the point was, but it feels obvious that there is a point. You might have to watch it twice to get it, and I don't think that's a bad thing.This is a small project, and it shows. But I still think it's worth watching for anyone who's interested in animation, or arthouse anime in general. And besides, it's 4 minutes long. If you read this whole review, you've got time to watch the short.";Recommended
1;Yubi wo Nusunda Onna;Thatevafag;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thatevafag;8;Fear is a strange and funny thing.It can mutilate every part of our body and leave us helpless.Fear may come from a number of different things but in the case of a child,it usually comes from one scarring source.That source being the loved ones.Many children has to face cruel child abuse from the source that were supposed to protect them.This abusing nature from their loved ones leaves the child helpless like a larval stage of development which is more than appropriate symbolism that is shown throughout this shorts narration.This short despite being only 4 minutes long handles a very mature and violent subject matter.The sound design is brilliant and the art style reflects it's narration perfectly.This short may need two viewings to get the point I mean I know that I did.This short was Saori Shiroki’s graduate work from the Tokyo University of the Arts' Graduate School of Film and New Media.I haven't seen any of her other works but I am excited to see more of her works.;Recommended
2;Yubi wo Nusunda Onna;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;7;Shiroki Saori is an animator who paints oil on glass, and she must be most well-known for her more polished work in 2012 on the Monotonous Purgatory music video for Matryoshka. The aesthetic is lovely and not very many animators work in this medium, of which Aleksandr Petrov is probably the most known and celebrated artist. There's a great textural quality to the style, and there are often imperfections seen as the characters move, leaving outlines. Sometimes it's smoothed over, but I'm not really sure how much of the effect is for stylistic purposes or if there just wasn't enough time to smooth the animation out with more frames, but it's generally a rather messy technique.Personally, I'd like it if commercial anime used less conventional techniques like this more often—it could have interesting applications in a commercial context. I believe Mob Psycho is one example that used a variety of mediums irregularly.There's an elegant look to the characters and the few exteriors and interiors. The sound design is minimalistic, and there's no dialogue. All of the storytelling is visual.The story is simple: a young boy reads about the world, his mother is overprotective and smothering, and when he tries to leave her grasp and cross the fence, his mother forces him to stay home.She, indeed, is a finger stealer, but she's also a toe stealer, an arm stealer, and... yeah, she can turn her son into a caterpillar—a pretty obvious symbol, as she's forcing her son to regress into a more primitive state. A caterpillar will go through a metamorphosis and become a butterfly, but she will obviously not allow the son to grow. There really isn't any room for more interpretation than that.The short is about completely subverting a child's nature (and I'd say abuse, but probably a legal form... it's difficult to tell because of the metaphorical nature of the short) by a parent—specifically a single mother, as there isn't a father or anyone else present. Not having two parents leads to worse outcomes for a child, and single mothers are one of the most toxic and emasculating influences a young boy can have, and it generally always seems worse for the boys than for the girls. Though producers love to present abusive single fathers in films often, they're not nearly as common as single mothers—whether they be advertently or inadvertently abusive. Most single mothers in Japan are divorcees who do the initiating, so she probably stole the house, just as we know she likes to steal fingers and everything else, kicked the father out, and turned her son into a creepy crawly to get back at the father. That'll show him! Strong independent waman. >: ^);Recommended

0;Majo demo Steady;stmwg01;https://myanimelist.net/profile/stmwg01;5;"""Like in a movie about youth! Run straight without making sense!"" The irony that this line from the OVA perfectly sums up the entire movie is not lost on me. I'd recommend this only if you really enjoyed the back bone to Urusei Yatsura. Otherwise, you'll not find this show enjoyable.I'll preface by saying I don't want to compare this to UY, but it mimics UY so much, it's nearly impossible to do so. I will attempt to keep the comparisons to a minimum.Going by the release dates between Urusei Yatsura and Majo demo Steady, the latter was an attempt to ride on the coattails of the popularity of UY. Honestly, the similarities are pretty uncanny at times. Ironically, the back bone of Steady is actually pretty good. I guess I have a type, liking the concept of other world girl and earthling boy pursue a relationships despite challenges. The issue with Steady lies in the lack of explanation. Things seemingly happen out of the blue and our leading girl, Asami, just blames herself. How she creates this mess or why, we never learn. Is she just a klutz or does her magic require an equal, opposite reaction to work? These questions and lack of explanation are rampant throughout the show.The art isn't bad, but the animation is choppy and non-fluid much of the time.Sound is mediocre as well. The opening and closing are dated, but unfortunately didn't ripen with age, missing the campy, nostalgic vibe some 80's songs instill. Sometimes the sound effect doesn't match the action and is noticeably different from what you'd expect.Characters are decent, but there is no depth to them and they don't really develop significantly. It's actually a shame because I think they'd actually lead to a good story if given time to develop.Overall, I enjoyed demo Steady because I like the concept. It wasn't the best execution and leaves a lot to be desired. I think it's a bit harshly criticized, but at the same time, I think it rightfully deserves a lot of what it gets. If you like relationship and/or magical girl animation, you'll like demo Steady, just don't expect anything ground breaking.If there's one more thing to add, it's that I'd like to find the source material for demo Steady. I'd like to know if things were better explained or if this adaption was doomed from the start.";Mixed Feelings
0;Majo demo Steady;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;4;"This is the most WTF Anime I've eve watched and that's saying alot.Longtime no see my MAL friends. One of the things I am always invested on is the media that was around the times I wasn't born. Watching many shows that my parents used to watch and to find old media that not everyone doesn't care is always fascinating to me and you come across OVA anime, specifically 20th century OVA anime and let me tell you, it is the most perplex form of anime that you can encounter. I have watched horrible anime like Try Knights and Conception, idiotic animation like Varanoir, the most ridiculous hentai that was Tsui no sora, but Majo Demo Steady is by far the most astonishing thing I have seen so far at this point. I am using astonishing in a confused and loosely way. So let me tell you about this OVA from 1986. You don't mind some spoilers right?The story at first looked like it was going to be like Bewitched (1964) with some touch of ecchi here and there. But what you get is a mumbo jumbo of random stuff going on. The story begins with our main protagonist waking up with a girl in his side, everything standard so far, but then the girl disapears and creates other dimensions after the protagonist comes back home. But his boss wants him to play with his stick and stalks him almost every moment after he leaves his job. But then our witch transports herself to the bar where he was and fights some demon spirits that appear and then she makes doubles of him and her, but she dissapears again and then some pyramids start appearing at the town they live and she is transported to another dimension, our main protagonist enters the dimmension and she rescues his wife in the most ridiculous way of entering to the part where she was and we get some ""philosophical"" talk about the Anima and Animus for some stupid reason and our main protagonists become one. The End.Honestly writing what this thing is about is not enough to express the WTF kind of animation I just watched. It is so bizarre and beyond the mind of anyone that wasn't the production team. Because it is that but the way the things happen here will make your brain explote trying to put together everything that occurred here.The characters are there I guess? They only have traits, our main protagonist wants to be with his girl, the girl is a manifestation that has magical powers and the boss is a perv against out protagonist just that.The art is not bad, but I don't like how many of these 80s shows don't have a constant artsyle between characters when some of them look way too cartoony and others have a certain artstyle. It is distracting to me.Sound is ok. Most of these shows don't use many sound effects and decide to throw many songs in a scene to save for a lot of dialogue. Talking about dialogue, the voice actors did the best, but you will forget themOverall if you want to watch some of the weirdest anime that you could find produced in the 80s and that is 40 minutes long, the Majo demo Steady is your show. Maybe if you are high enough you may comprehend something that I didn't see there.Thanks for reading and take care in this pandemic situation.";Not Recommended

0;Shenhai;GodTierTaster;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GodTierTaster;8;"(Spoiler-free Review)I just watched this in the theaters as I'm currently located in China. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.Story (7/10): The story of Shenhai was pretty interesting. It is about a girl Shenxiu （参宿） who ended up in this fantasy world deep under the sea searching for her mother who she has not contacted for a while. She was guided by this mysterious sea creature but ended up in a restaurant run by humanoid fish and seals. The restaurant was run by Nanhe (南河), a greedy owner of the restaurant who cares only about making money. Much of the story was very abstract and reflected themes of loneliness, depression, and hope. Overall this story had a very strong ""Spirited Away"" vibe to it, despite being original in its own way.Art (10/10): The art was simply fantastic. Especially, in portraying the surreal world. Everything looks so colorful and it had a very strong Chinese vibe. Also, the 3D effect was simply beautiful. I would definitely recommend watching this in the theaters if possible.Sound (8/10): The sound was beautiful. Although none of its music was particularly memorable, it fits the vibe perfectly. Also, the voice acting was pretty on par.Characters (9/10): All the main characters are multidimensional and had many sides to them. The background story of the main character Shenxiu was done really well. Her parents divorced when she was young and she ended being neglected as her father remarried and had another child. This led her to obvious signs of depression as she seemed hopeless and apathetic in this movie as she wanders to try to find her mother. No one is perfect in “Shenhai.” At first, you will probably not like Nanhe at first but he does have a benevolent side as well despite being super greedy in the beginning.Enjoyment (8/10): This donghua was very enjoyable. Although the middle was slow, I was overall mind-blown by the visual effects. The story was also interesting reflecting deeper themes that most animated films fail to reflect.Reviewer’s Rating: 8 (I’m generally pretty strict when it comes to rating but this film is definitely underrated. Watch it in the theaters in 3D if possible, but even 2D should definitely be a great mind trip.)";Recommended
0;Suki da yo!;DeSwitch;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DeSwitch;8;SynopsisJun is a handsome young man who's got a well-earned reputation as the campus playboy. Although he can easily get it on with any girl in school, lately he's been feeling sort of empty. Now Jun is good friends with three sisters whom he has known practically all his life: Reina, Lina, and Mina. Jun has always gotten along with Mina best, but she moved away with their father when the sisters' parents divorced. Jun feels quite attracted to the soft-spoken Reina, but it's the bubbly and vivacious Lina who has always had a crush on him. Things get more confusing when the feisty Mina moves back with her sisters after their father's death... and Jun finds himself thinking of her more and more as each day passes.ReviewI wasn't really expecting anything out-of-the-ordinary from I Love You. The title struck me as one of those usual teenage romances where high schoolers just get together and have lots of sex without much premise. Much to my surprise however, a rather interesting plot began to form during the course of the first episode -- and then I knew I just had to watch I Love You in its entirety.I Love You opens with a pretty green-haired girl practicing archery. Moments later, our hero Jun is shown having hot, unbridled sex with her. As it turns out, they're fuck buddies. There are no strings attached. They're just friends who want to have sex ever so often. Jun gets his release, but he also gets to thinking that he's tired of just screwing around. There must be something more to sex than just sex, and he concludes that it might actually be more satisfying if there were real feelings involved. Thus like any hentai hero, Jun goes off to look for true love. His candidates consist of three sisters he has known since childhood, and eventually he decides that Mina is the one for him. There is a flaw in Jun's plans for a happy lovelife though. Mina is not what she seems to be, and she has a problem that not just any person can solve. It's a nice twist to an otherwise commonplace story, which is a very welcome element in hentai.The art and animation are of excellent quality. Character designs are beautiful, with each character possessing his/her own distinctive look. The three sisters don't even resemble each other in the slightest. Sex is portrayed very explicitly, albeit the action consists of nothing but the usual non-kinky heterosexual intercourse one would expect from high school sweethearts. Everything is purely consensual, and I rather enjoyed watching everyone have a good time.Even if Jun and Mina's problem remain unresolved, I Love You ends on a positive and hopeful note. I can't really be any more descriptive as I could end up giving all of it away, but this is definitely something I'd recommend to anyone looking for a simple romantic hentai.;Recommended

0;Kizuoibito;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;2;"Overview:I have reviewed MANY obscure, terrible anime on this site. However, this might be the holy grail of shitty exploitation OVAs! Remember those ultra violent OVAs with tons of pointless nudity from the 80s and 90s? They were dirt cheap to license overseas and thus they flooded the early anime market in many countries during the 1990s, including the US. These are the classic terrible anime like MD Geist, Angel Cop, etc. There exists an OVA in this genre with an excellent animation budget, but was never licensed overseas because it was SO shitty that even the buzzards like Central Park Media wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole! This is the head bashingingly idiotic tale...of Wounded Man!!!Background:I mentioned that this was never licensed overseas, so of course there is no English dub. However, every anime I have ever reviewed at least has a decent English sub somewhere on the internet. The only existing subtitles for this piece of shit is from a bootleg VHS that was clearly made in China. How do I know it was made in China? Literally ALL of the Japanese characters are given Chinese names by the subtitles. The character that the Japanese audio clearly calls Keisuke Iburaki is given the name Liao Hua-Mu by the subtitles. A girl named Ryuko is given the name Wu Xihu and a character called Natsuko is given the name Xia Xi. If you are like me and don't speak fluent Japanese, I would recommend looking up a summary of the plot or reading the available manga online before watching because the subtitles are BAD! Not that the most dignified dub or translation on Earth would save this piece of shit!Plot:SPOILERS! As if anyone cares.I normally NEVER do this, but I'm just going to describe what happens in the first 2 episodes because this might be the worst plot I have ever witnessed in any medium of storytelling.Episode 1It is the 1980s and a massive gold rush is happening in Brazil. After geologists discovered a huge mineral vein with tons of gold in the Amazon rain forest, amateur prospectors have come from around the world to try strike it rich with their pales and pickaxes. We are dealing with a writer that thinks the 1980s had a goldrush like the California rush of 1849. This anime takes place in a world where a bunch of ""Stinky Pete"" cartoon prospectors and not global mining corporations are the ones to dig up newly discovered mineral resources. We're off to a GRAND start here folks! The anime starts with us being introduced to a Japanese reporter lady named Ryuko. She arrives in Brazil to report on the gold rush, but literally 30 seconds after getting off the ship, she runs into our ""hero"" Keisuke. Keisuke is a Japanese American muscleman with white hair. He always wears a giant cowboy hat, blue jeans, and no shirt, which makes him look like a cross between the redneck android in DBZ movie 7 and a gay porn star! Before saying 1 word to the news crew, Keisuke beats the shit out of the male crew members and violently rapes Ryuko! He does this all while spewing out hilarious engrish fragments like ""READY, SET, GO!!!After he is done raping her, Keisuke explains to Ryuko that he did all of this as a warning to show how dangerous Brazil is. He tells her that the local Brazilians will do FAR worse and that she and her crew must go back to Japan immediately. He then gives her some gold nuggets as a token of his goodwill before leaving. What a gentleman! Keisuke walks off into the jungle and 45 seconds later, a bunch of racist black caricatures come out of nowhere to attack Ryuko and the Channel 5 news team. The Brazilians tie Ryuko to a log and rape her before pulling out a jar containing a ""venomous cicada"". The venomous cicada immediately crawls up Ryuko's anus and FINALLY, Keisuke shows up to save the news crew! Keisuke states that he only gave her the gold to lure out the local hoods that had been pursuing him. Keisuke brazenly states that his muscles can stop bullets and beats up the hoods with his ""American fighting style"" which consists of boxing mixed with American Football tackles! This is one of the most gloriously idiotic scenes in the history of anime folks! Since this violent rapist saved her from other violent rapists, Ryuko immediately falls in love with Keisuke! She thinks about heading home to Japan and gets on the boat, but then decides to strip naked and swim to shore. Then we get to see one of strangest scenes yet! The writer of this anime somehow thinks that vultures are sea birds that dive into the ocean to nab fish. The vultures mistake Ryuko for a fish and start attacking her, so Keisuke must shoot the vultures with his cowboy revolver in order to save her! Ryuko vows to live with Keisuke and the first episode mercifully ends!Episode 2This episode begins by telling us the story of Keisuke's past. Keisuke was once a star quarterback in American Football and played professionally in the NFL. I have no idea why he is so good at tackling considering that the quarterback NEVER tackles anyone! One day, Keisuke was drinking with his buddies at the bar and he ends up flirting with the leader of a female motorcycle gang. She states that she will have sex with him if he can tackle her off her motorcycle while she tries to run him over! Keisuke of course has no problem accomplishing this and they fuck at a local hotel. Minutes later, Keisuke and the biker girl named Natsuko are drugged and kidnapped by an evil gang called GPX, which stands for ""God's Pornographic X-rated videos"". This gang kidnaps celebrities and forces them to make pornographic tapes that they can use for blackmail. Natsuko decides to thwart the gang's evil plans by scarring herself and her lover with a hot fire poker, so no one will want to see them fuck. This enrages GPX, so they shoot her dead and flee the scene. We are then told that GPX planted drugs in Keisuke's apartment and made a call to the police stating that they witnessed him committing the murder. This is somehow enough evidence to convince the judge and he sentences Keisuke to 10 years in American prison, which turns his hair white from the stress. After serving his sentence, Keisuke went to Brazil to find enough treasure to finance his revenge on GPX, inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo.Our idiotic reporter Ryuko is very moved by Keisuke's story and says that she will help him accomplish his revenge. In order to get back to America, Keisuke decides to use his massive treasure pile that he keeps in a cave. He finds the best shipwright in Brazil, who is of course a blonde lady with massive boobs. Keisuke wishes to hire her to build a ship capable of smuggling all of his treasure back to America. Keisuke shows the shipwright his treasure horde which causes her to randomly piss herself...I'm serious. She explains that she pisses whenever she is happy and this has caused 3 divorces...I'm convinced this series was written by Aliens! The incontinent shipwright manages to build the massive ship, but they are attacked by gangsters while sailing up the Amazon. Keisuke defeats most of the gangsters by lowering his shoulder and Football tackling them off the boat, but one of them manages to kill Ryuko the reporter lady with a sub-machine gun. Keisuke is deeply saddened by the death of Ryuko and doesn't want to dump her body overboard, but he fears that the border patrol will discover the body and send him back to jail. Keisuke and the shipwright then devise a BRILLIANT plan to sneak past the border patrol without them ever inspecting the boat. This plan involves getting into a vicious fight in which they beat the shit out of each other, and then having passionate sex in front of the border guards. The plan works and the guards are too distracted to bother doing their jobs! Keisuke then decides to dump Ryuko's body overboard anyways, making the previous scene COMPLETELY pointless! The shipwright decides to take Ryuko's place as Keisuke's woman and help him with his revenge! End of episode 2.Art and music: the soundtrack is largely lacking, which is sad because these shitty OVAs often have some gloriously cheesy soundtracks. MD Geist has an amazing soundtrack! The art is done by the same studio that did the anime adaptation of Riki Oh as well as Mad Bull 34. If you liked the blood and titties in those anime, you will like the art here.Overall:HOLY SHIT was this anime stupid! If your jaw didn't hit the floor from the summary of the first 2 episodes, just consider that the anime actually gets EVEN WORSE! The second after I finished this piece of shit I had to know who the HELL wrote this atrocity! Surprise! It was the same motherfucker that wrote and directed Mad Bull 34! Suddenly everything made sense again! It could never have been anyone else. He can also write decent stories if he feels like it and somehow won a fucking Eisner award in the graphic novel category!

But since I am looking for the worst anime shows The Wounded Man doesn't get any good commentary from me at all.Before starting the first impressions when I saw the DVD cover of this thing was ""is this a B-film right and/or Porno right?"" and I wasn't too far from it. Some spoilers ahead.The story of the Wounded Man is just an incomprehensive mess and that tries way too hard to be a tragic, mafia, porno with some historic points of what was happening in the 80s.So the story starts in Brazil and presents us about some Japanese reporters going to the Amazon Jungle searching for gold because there is a gold rush there, to my surprise this did happened, the real story is that during that time on a place called Serra Pelada there was a rumour abour gold mines and if you look for images and documentaries on the thing, those men look like ants destroying the land for gold. So just a little curiosity.Well going with the story our protagonist, an american football player, Keisuke Ibaraki goes there to escape his life from USA because he is convicted by a false crime done to his girlfriend and all of this was caused by a blackmail pornographic company that extorsions famous people so they can sell porno movies of them on the black market.The first thing I must say from this show is that is very sickening to watch btw MAL how do you categorize what is hentai and what is not hentai? Because this could be easily be considered hentai. Since I have mentioned that there is porn then this show will shove it your face whenever they can. Our ""poor"" protagonist the first thing he does is that when the reporters try to understand the situation going on the Amazon, the idiot decides to almost kill the camera man and then violently he rapes the reporter. Yes, for some reason the story tries to make us feel bad for the miserable guy with his back story but in the first minute he appears he does a more sickening stunt and for what reason, so they can undestand the troubles the japanese are getting into. Like What the hell dude? So your answer to say that the place could be dangerous is that you are dangerous too? Wow what a genius.In the end of the first episode then the reporter has a change of heart and says that she loves him, even though he raped her. Yeah this is the kind of intelligence this show has. Unless she enjoys being raped than consensual sex then that's why she ""loves"" him maybe.One big flaw of this show is the characterization of the female characters, they are sex objects, they just show them naked for just showing them naked. Do exercise; naked, use a pistol; be naked, cooking; be naked, everything these women have to do they have to shove their boobs all over the screen.Also our main protagonist loves these women in this show so much that even has pictures of them even if they die. Keisuke is simply a MACHO MAN in everything and the asshole is inmortal yes, I am not kidding. He gets burned, he gets shot by guns, he gets wounded. But the girlfriends he has, they die in an instant. I don't understand the physical rules of this setting.The other characters doesn't save also from this big rant. There is a scene where he decides to leave Brazil and go back to USA using a boat from another girl that lives there in Brazil and she decides to help her with the condition that some gold found must be shared which they do. But before leaving the maritime borders they get assaulted by some guys and his girlfriend reporter dies and for some reason when they are at the maritime borders, he and the ship girl have a fake discussion that leaves to this passionate sex and the officers just stand there enter look at the documents, see the dead girlfriend on the bed and they think she is sleeping. Like WTF? Try to do that on a border control and see what happens or simply the author treats the Brazilian police like idiots and besides passing the Brazilian guards, Tell me how you are going to be outside the view of 27 caribbean territories without knowing if you are near their maritime borders and remember this was a cheap boat that was built and not some highclass ship without some GPS or even a map. Yeah I am analyzing way too much.Another factor that really sucks balls about this show is the action sequences and again the protagonist is the main problem, he has a special martial art that I am going to call Muay Quaterback Fu, because doing the same movements that you do as an american football player is very useful as a combat style and the action sequences. The action scenes are badly made. Oh look I am reviewing another Magic Bus anime, who would tell, and for being their first work it blows. With the action scenes they just repeat like 3-5 times the same movement over and over just to kill time. There is a fight between Keisuke and porn mafia guy that looks like F.A.N.G from SFV and they just do the same crappy movement with the knife. Other action scenes are just too quick with some flashy portraits to say that something ""cool"" happened but are lazy and terrible.And since I am talking about animation, the producers couldn't decided what tone skin Keisuke has. Sometimes he is black, sometimes he is mixed, sometimes he is white and sometimes the mixed of obscure backgrounds make some characters make them look like are just eyes floating and yes I have seen that in animation but here it is so notorious that if someone has darker skin color he or she is also the background. It is embarrasing to even say it nicely.To finish this review the ending is simply idiotic. Since he wants revenge of everything tragic in his life he will go to practice his Muay Quaterback Fu to the governement and also I forget to mention that when he arrives to USA he becomes famous again and plays the sport, but also becomes a mafia boss and the problem is that with these 80s productions sometimes you had to read the manga to know what actually happens it is not like today that are adaptations of the manga mostly done chapter by chapter. In the 80s they just grabbed some part of the story and animated to the way they wanted but again if the bits they had picked were good and tried to make at least some part of the story tolerable this wouldn't be bad or just go full fun like Cipher The video, which is what these guys from Magic Bus did years later. But no it is a mess from start to finish.My final thoughts on this thing. If you want to watch this it would a big drag because 5 episodes of almost 40 minutes and with bad english subtitles or unless you know spanish because there is also an spanish subtitles version this will be hard. But also the payoff is not existent. The porn is stupidly bad and just to attract someone who really is desperately horny and the action is laughable with animation that seems to use their characters with toys physics instead of human physics and not understanding what the hell to do with a story that it could be horrible even for the manga, but I don't know that.Thanks for reading the review, hope you enjoyed, sorry for any english mispelling/grammar mistake. Take care in whatever you do and see ya around.";Not Recommended
0;Hana Dorei;Vega004;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Vega004;6;"WARNING THIS REVIEW IS FOR A HENTAI(+18) AND CONTAIN SPOILERSSTORY: [6/10]Story contains ""torture"", ""blackmail"" and ""bondage"" which later turns in consensual sex.I'll do short version here, an art student watches his master to gain inspiration for painting through torture-ed sex with his wife. Master dies student takes on mantel and fu*** her Madame and her sister (in the same way as his master). And there is another element but I don't want steal away the fun.There is supposed to suspense right???I gave the story a 6, because it didn't make any sense at the end. Although, hentai anime does't have a story but still if you are going to put one then put a valid one.ART: [7/10]Considering the low budget and early 2000s release the art was very good. Characters, surroundings and etc were drawn quite decently.Still in some sex scene pictures were stationary. It looked like a 18+ slideshow.SOUND: [7/10]Now, as a hentai sound is a major turn on and helpful while fa**ingI watched the dual audio version, and I am WARNING you not to watch in English dub, because it looks like you are watching a low budget Brazzers porn.Whereas, the Japanese dub is very good.Gave it a 7 cause of English dub.CHARACTERS: [8/10]8 because I am into busty girls / women.All the female characters are busty and drawn greatly. The depiction was pretty great.Also, the supporting cast was the maid and the cops. The development of the characters in the beginning was strong but in the end it got strange.ENJOYMENT: [6/10]Well, if you are into ""Engineered Tortured Bondage Sex"" then this is a good series. You can learn pretty good techniques by watching this hentai.The 6 was due to the poor story ending, English Dub and slideshow sex. Otherwise, its a pretty good one considering it was released in early 2000s.Of all the bondage hentai series I have watched, it was pretty unique due to its ""Engineered Tortured Bondage Sex"" using ropes.GOOD LUCK watching this.";Mixed Feelings
0;Urban Square: Kohaku no Tsuigeki;Singan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Singan;7;"Based on a story by Kazunori Ito (the scriptwriter for Ghost in the Shell & Patlabor movies), Urban Square: Chasing Amber is a very unusual OVA as it can be perceived in two different ways, and the way you choose pretty much determines whether you'll like it or not.STORYEssentially, it's a classic detective story where the main character witnesses a murder and gets into trouble with the mafia; eventually, he ends up an action hero, fighting the criminals and protecting the girl he likes. Not only the plot is rather simple in general, but it also contains quite a lot of cliches typical for this kind of stories.However, if you look at the story from a different angle, all those cliches were initially supposed to be there. You see, the main character is a scriptwriter who factually ends up a protagonist of his screenplays, and that makes the OVA a witty parody on/homage to detective stories which may be shortly described as ""B-movie coming to real life"". Although the show never openly admits its nature it gives some hints during the story: for example, when the protagonist and his future girlfriend meet for the second time, she wonders how two complete strangers have met twice in two consecutive days, and he replies: ""That's why fiction can't win against reality. In reality, coincidences are allowed, but in fiction, coincidences are ridiculed"". By doing that, the anime elegantly mocks its own narrative and performs the parody in a more subtle & intelligent way than many other shows of this kind.So, the story is good and well-written for what it is, providing an enjoyable watch if you keep in mind its actual purpose and don't take it too seriously.ANIMATIONThe OVA clearly reveals its age: not only it features classic 80's character designs but also some minor age issues here and there. On the other hand, the animation displays very nice fluency of motion that makes the action quite enjoyable; also, the movie is depicted in eye-appealing dark blue tones that add a subtle noir feeling to the show. So, the OVA looks pretty good despite some age imperfections it has.SOUNDTRACKPerformed by a band called Chickenshack, the soundtrack is an elegant jazz mix of piano, sax, drums, funky guitar and slap bass. In general, the OST is unmemorable because it doesn't contain any songs or even a main theme; yet it suits the OVA extremely well as background music. The voice-acting & sound effects (gunshots, explosions etc.) are also well-done and fitting.CHARACTERSThe characters have simple personalities, and some of them are straightforward action/mystery movie stereotypes, so don't expect much depth or development here. However, it doesn't become a serious problem because they were supposed to be like that anyway (it's a parody, remember?), and thus they're still fine for this kind of show. Besides, the protagonist, his girlfriend and the detective who helps them are all quite likeable.OVERALLIf you want a witty parody on mysteries or just some quick 80's fun with good visuals & soundtrack, this OVA will be a nice choice for you.However, if you need a clever & intricate detective story, this show is a wrong place to look for it. Perhaps, you should try something like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex or the first Patlabor movie, as those two feature the best detective plots I've seen in any anime.";Recommended
1;Urban Square: Kohaku no Tsuigeki;KamuiX1999;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KamuiX1999;7;I love coming across an obscure OVA from anime's golden era that's different from the pack and good to boot, and this certainly fits the bill. Not only is it well done, but it's quite unique in that it's a rather serious crime noir, something you don't often see in the genre. There's not a whole lot of ha-ha or goofiness on display here, which is a hallmark of a lot of crime anime from the period, such as City Hunter or Lupin III. This makes it all the more odd that as far as I can tell, it's never been officially licensed for an English language release, as I feel like this would have stood out as something very different amongst the samey stuff that would get licensed and translated for English speaking audiences. It could have been another Blackjack, an anime about a surgeon that sat side by side on the same video shelves with Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, and Akira back in '90s video stores and always intrigued me because of it. Ah well, guess you gotta stick with what you know will sell.The director uses some cool camera tricks that I've rarely seen in the medium, such as a scene where two guys lock eyes from across a room, and then we get a top-and-bottom split-screen, one guy's eyes in the top screen, the other guy's in the bottom screen as they stare intensely at each other. The main character being a screenwriter and not a cop or some sort of professional felt fresh too. Hell, a couple of things he says throughout about chance and coincidence might make you think we're just watching a script he wrote and inserted himself in as the protagonist, but it's never blatantly put out there, just sort of a nod and a wink to the attentive viewer that catches it.My only two complaints would be as much as I liked the story, I thought the characters could have been more fleshed out and developed as I never felt connected to any of them nor do any have standout personalities. I know it's an OVA, but it's an hour-long one, and being a single OVA never stopped a bunch of other sub-60 minute releases being able to create compelling characters, such as Riding Bean or Kite. My second complaint is that on more than one occasion I confused one character with another. You see, the main cop and the main bad guy both have the same haircut and the same luscious Tom Selleck moustache, with the only defining difference between the two being the villain is slightly wider and a bit fatter. But with some of the camera angles and long-distance shots, it makes them hard to distinguish from one another, at least for me, and I had to rewind a scene more than once due to a little confusion.Oh yeah, and does anyone know where I can get that movie they were playing in the theatre? You know, the one with a guy wearing a Jason mask attempting to murder a guy on a boat with Leatherface's chainsaw while fucking JAWS rises up, ready to eat everything? All I know, is these five seconds are hands-down the best cinematic footage ever released of a guy wearing a white hockey mask killing people on a boat.;Recommended
0;Urban Square: Kohaku no Tsuigeki;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;5;A fair-to-middlin' OVA action/murder/mystery from the eighties.From a time when practically every other anime movie or OVA featured characters with mysterious extra-sensory powers, it's actually refreshing to come across a story that features REAL people behaving in REAL situations, doing REAL things. Well, the story does get a little over the top at times, but what I mean is there's nothing supernatural in this story. A rarity in eighties OVAs!Granted, the plot of the story is a little far-fetched, as a mild-mannered writer gets unwittingly involved in a murder mystery, faces off against a honest-to-god Bruce Lee karate guy in his apartment, hard-boiled detectives, hanging from a helicopter by one leg, and, well, you get the picture. No more ridiculous than, say, Die Hard. This short story is definitely not lacking in money-shots.That being said, there is an actual plot and an actual resolution, regardless of some of the implausible twists and turns along the way. And the artwork is, well, pretty decent. As is the animation. Although it pales in comparison to another similar OVA, Hello Hedgehog -- Urban Square ain't so bad by itself.;Mixed Feelings

In the 80s/90s you get these goofball MCs. The joke with these idiots is that they're always trying to cover their ass, and it seems they are getting into trouble but the god awful scriptwriting always saves them. Every bullet fired misses the MC and the bad guys seriously never win cause the scriptwriting demands they are always fooled. If you wanna know what's so bad, you can read my forum post. The MC is stupid. The good cop is stupid too if he knew what was so wrong, but would always be one step late. It is kinda ridiculous really, two instances, he was there but somehow late to open the door and another instance which he knew the criminals were coming but didn't even warn his officer of the danger. It's tragic the action stems from god awful scriptwriting and come from awful characters with bad art, (though the funny thing was the gunner actually looks like Askeladd from Vinland Saga, but without a beard LMAO) cause the action was actually OK.;Not Recommended

You couldn't be more wrong and I hope you take this review seriously.I gave the story a 10/10 which might not make sense at first because the show just seems like 2 idiots making fart jokes for 26 episodes. But if you have re watched it 13 times like I have you start to see a deeper meaning. One you would have never expected.I first started to notice during my 3rd re watch that the show has hella foreshadowing and character development, I just wasn't focused on those aspects because I didn't expect them to be implemented.

What is its appeal even though it is a ""kids show"" and therefore being quite a silly. I Myself do really love larva and all it seasons and you may questioning my sense of humor and my age.Yes Larva is a short comedy series but what makes it sssssoooo good is its humor. Larva is basicly the Korean version of Tom and Jerry when it comes to its very harsh humor and very very cartoonish feel (when it comes to the law of physics and such, all the classic old cartoon cliches) It brings back the old humor from elder cartoons which you really cant find now at days because everything has to be so political correct, realistic and be really sensitive (so the children dont get hurt and such).All the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- The old classic cartoonish humor like Tom and Jerry and such. (So a lot of KARMA XD)- Larva contains small episodes which makes it easy to sqeeuze in a busy day :3- easy way to laugh (of course depending on your humor)- Even though they are all small episodes with each plot then there is a somewhat overall plot.- the artstyle of animation is not great, but it is a clean and fludient design which works PERFECT for this kind of show :3- there are really some brilliant episodes here and there, that will REALLY make you laugh.- It is an easy show to watch, just relax, turn somewhat your brain of.- I would say it is for every ages!- this is not a serious series and therefore it is good that it has really classic archetypes of characters so it is easy to feel with and predict their actions in a good way. :P- I love the endings that show the concept art of each episodes ^All the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons- The animation is probably somethiing that might turn people of even though I do not think it is bad, I think it works perfectly with this kind of show.- It is just as deep if you poked the tip of your finger into the ground.... But does it really need to be deep to be enjoyable??? :)So yeah get ready to have a good time, maybe just a little break, and have a better day with this dosis of Larva, I as a medical student would like to prescribe this series for anyone feeling sad, neeeding a laugh or break and so on ^^";Recommended

0;Kyoufu Shinbun (2014);Nolri;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nolri;8;Oh boy, it's been such a long time since I last written a review. Ok, so, this is probably the most unpopular anime out there. Maybe it's because ONA scares the hell out of people. OVA is somewhat acceptable but ONA? Not so much.Kyoufu Shinbun is actually a very good ONA.So the story goes something like this: a boy gets a creepy newspaper every night delivered straight through his room's window. It tells all kinds of scary news that actually about to happen. Every time there's something else going on. He investigates and discovers some unusual stuff.The stories are great. Even though they are about supernatural phenomena, they are very much close to reality. Also, the characters are talking about real events that happened in real life. This contributes not only to the plot, but to the viewer as well, for they will learn about strange and mysterious events that really occurred.The art is good. I mean, it's not bad and it's not great, just good. And it's actually not that important. The story pretty much makes up for it.All in all, this one is truly worth watching.;Recommended
1;Kyoufu Shinbun (2014);Maverynthia;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Maverynthia;7;"The year is 1974 and Kigata Rei is haunted by a newspaper that is delivered every night at midnight. This is heavily based on the manga including the art and the pacing. Older manga tended to infodump A LOT whenever it got the chance as the artist wanted to make sure that the readers were all on base. It's similar to the way it's done in Light Novels to where paragraphs are dedicated to explaining everything before finally getting back to the story. This anime is no different. Most of the episodes are nothing but exposition on spirits, astral projection, yetis, psychic powers and UFOs. So if you aren't up on those things, this is a good intro anime to all that.However if you've been around and know about all that, this anime is long winded. The Pages in BLue for example are mostly about the history of UFOs than any actual story of Erina.If you can look past the 70s style drawings and the infodumps, it does have a few ""real life"" tales to tell about the various subjects.";Recommended
0;Kyoufu Shinbun (2014);Lord_Rutsah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lord_Rutsah;2;"You know, it's not often that I say an anime is MADE for LOSERS. I will often say that an anime is made BY losers (for example Ninja Slayer), or will say that its fanbase is composed of losers (say One Piece), but it is indeed quite rare to find an anime that was exclusively created to please LOSERS.The protagonist, Kigata is a 13-14 year old kid, that suddenly one day gets cursed. A newspaper is delivered to him every night that prophecises events of the next day (at the start it was ""disasters"" but by the 6th episode it was pretty much random events). Each time this newspaper is delivered however, he loses a portion of his life that for some bizarre reason hasn't even come close to killing him by the 16th episode where the anime ends. Each episode is pretty much standalone or in chain with another 2 at most, following individual stories that the protagonist is somewhat part of (like kagewani only with much more awful art). Actually a simple parenthesis mention isn't enough here.THE ART IS ATROCIOUS. I mean, if I didn't know any better (and I don't), I'd say they made the art exclusively with Manga Maker Comipo. No, this is not some subtle advertising, the art style is IDENTICAL. ""Well, both Yami Shibai and Kagewani used paper puppets art, and they turned out alright."" Yes dearest, but they were both aesthetically pleasing, I assure you that is NOT the case here. But enough about the art, lets get to the real problem of this piece of crap.Have you ever met a conspiracy theorist? You know, someone who fanatically believes in supernatural phenomena or government secrets and is desperately trying to convince you about them? Well, the general tone of the anime is ""You were right conspiracy theorist! We showed them! Good job!"". Kigata is usually the said conspiracy theorist, often turning with the ""I told you so."" look at the end of each episode to the viewer and explaining how the supernatural was hiding beside us all along. The real problem with the anime though is that NOONE IS MAKING FUN OF HIM. The society around him is overly accepting of the bullcrap he's coming up with. and by the end of the series he's even somewhat popular around school (yeah, keep dreaming morons).My favorite (read ""worst"") part is by the final episodes, when supposedly aliens are rumored exist and the PHYSICS PROFESSOR takes the class on a night-trip so they can VIEW UFOS. And the class is totally ok with that. Do I even need to describe on how many levels this is stupid and basically the fantasy of a loser? Not to mention that the protagonist befriends a hot alien chick (hahahahahahahahahahah... Yeah right...).And lastly... You know... An anime that has ""fear/horror"" in its name... Shouldn't it have some sort of... You know... Horror? Like someone dying, bleeding out, getting decapitated, etc etc? Horror news is 100% kid-friendly through and through, and in all honesty that pisses me off. With the exception of an ""evil villain of villainess"" (that for some unknown reason the protagonist couldn't fight 3v1), who got axed off-screen by a yeti, noone ends up getting hurt.Pros:-...I got nothing.Cons:-Awful art.-The whole anime is a fantasy of a conspiracy theorist.-No ""horror"" or ""news"".-Convenient plotholes that make no sense here and there.-The protagonist's ""I knew it all along."" speeches towards the viewer.-Illogical and overly accepting world that is nowhere near realistic.Stay away.";Not Recommended

0;Tokyo Loop;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;4;"It takes too long to write a description for all 16 shorts, so I'll just touch on the good, the bad, and the ugly (maybe even the weird). Don't be fooled by the looping shorts and the name Tokyo Loop, or you will be thrown for a loop, because most of these shorts aren't especially loopish other than 2 or 3. You definitely do get dull experiments, like the clock short with M.C. Escher patterns—or a bland digital rehash of Stan Brakhage's splashes of color on celluloid, which at least improves a bit as the hues shift into various shapes and figures: it might pique the eye, but it's ultimately irrelevant. An avant-garde screensaver. Whoop-de-doo. It's whatever, and like a lot of experiments, you can expect failures.While Yoji Kuri might occasionally fashion a gem out of his crudity, his take here is literally doggy poo. It consists of nothing but dog doo doo, and it turns into the boulder trap from Indiana Jones, engulfing numerous objects and people like this is a scatological version of a Katamari Damacy game. I'm really not making that up. Just be thankful Smell-O-Vision died out long ago, because this stinks.There are also some truly ugly ones like the side-scrolling Mario knockoff drawn with the stick art of kindergarten and mixtures of live action and 3D models, making for an obscene mess of stale Doge memes and tackier atrocities. There are plenty of others with a more geometrical or aimless nature, as well as musical mashups of abstraction, which was very common with older animators like Len Lye or Norman McLaren. Pretty much all of these are rather experimental and set to minimal amounts of sound design and focus on 1-2 music tracks. Koji Yamamura's short is perhaps the one that synergizes the most strongly with its visual creativity and audio; it has a rather sketchy look without being entirely alienating or drab like some of the more abstract offerings, and the minimalist inkblot-like designs allow for plenty of free-flowing character movements that are charmingly messy and some very exciting transitions and camera movements.Murata Tomoyasu's short I initially mistook as Takashi Ito's work during the drab daytime urban shots that the short opens with, but we're instead treated to lots of digital effects and color washes, just before we're blazing past neon lights, or rotoscoped passersby resembling pastel-colored ghosts that teeter into and out of frame. The nocturnal minimalism and calming ambience lend it a much greater resonance than most of Ito's more mundane urban time lapse shorts.Takashi Ito mostly downplays his time lapse roots for a less disorienting, more human-focused, and contrasty black and white short with a more punkish aesthetic and noisy music, reminiscent of the work of Shozin Fukui, Sogo Ishii, or Shinya Tsukamoto. Shaky camera, plenty of DIY effects, raw energy, and a few rather striking scene transitions define this as more of a stylistic short, without much of a focus, but it's disorienting and nervous enough to simulate a breakdown.A few are a bit more narrative based: Kei Oyama's vision is an exceptionally dark POV shot without edits that never fully clarifies what's going on, but it appears to involve death and deterioration, and it's on the eerie side—a low-key nightmare. Mika Seike's is quite cryptic but has some fairly obvious gender-based symbols and the common motif of insects that seems to be spread throughout her work. Atsushi Wada uses the familiar salaryman artwork from various shorts of his, including Hana no Hi, to depict a very absurd sequence of events that make little sense, but the experience of watching a man shoot miniature humans out of his mouth like he's emptying a machine gun clip is priceless. Furukawa Taku's fixed-camera on a wobbly setting and its haggard and even adorable caricatures is kind of amusing, and the collage-like and Tadanori Yokoo-esque pop art surrealism of Tabaimo is at least vivid, and even the randomness of Tanaami Keiichi provides some interesting morphing animation, bizarre designs, and acid-drenched colors.Anything I didn't mention is probably pretty skippable, and even a few that I did mention are interesting for one aspect or another, but they're usually not the most well-rounded shorts—they are hit or miss experiments from several interesting creative minds. A few may seem underwhelming or too cryptic at first, but I warmed up to several of them with an extra viewing—it definitely helps if you're familiar with any of these artists prior to watching, as I feel I probably would have been a lot less receptive, had I not been familiar with about half of the artists. As a compilation, this is pretty firmly average, but it's easy to get picky because of a few shoddy segments.";Mixed Feelings
0;Nanako SOS;HeavensBlade13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HeavensBlade13;5;Nanako SOS is an episodic show with a a solid comedy duo and interesting hijinks, that is brought down by one note villains who are too similar to each other.Story: There is no overarching character or story development, despite the fact that the possibility of learning about Nanako's past is teased. Even though this is the case, changes that happen aren't ignored (ie when they adopt dogs those dogs are around for the rest of the show). The ending is very abrupt, and I don't even think that this was the best episode to end it on if I had to choose. Most of the episodes at first were unique but as the show progressed similar scenarios were reused. For example, as the show approached its end every episode made a big deal out of ALL the villains showing up, which was special at first, but got increasingly boring the second time and beyond.Characters: The main cast of characters is definitely the best part of the show. Nanako, Yotsuya, and Idabashi have great synergy and the comedic duo of the straight man Idabashi and outlandish Yotsuya is especially fun to watch. There is also some good self-aware humor after their traits were established which suited the tone of the series well. Yotsuya's antics kept me wanting to watch more.The villains, on the other hand, were not so enjoyable. At first they seemed to have some differences in their goals, but after only a few appearances each they all boiled down to 'wants to be with Nanako in a possessive way'. This pining attitude got boring and made the episodes less distinct from each other. Sometimes the villains lusting after Nanako, in my opinion, was pretty questionable with the villains tricking/emotional manipulating Nanako to spend time with them or give them sexual favors. While the power dynamic is always in Nanako's favor since her powers make her nigh invincible, it just felt creepy watching some of these interactions, especially considering that this is a kids show. This only happened a couple times but I thought it was worth mentioning and is probably emblematic of sexist attitudes towards women that although they persist to the present were much worse in the 80s.Art: I thought the animation was decent (although my frame of reference for average TV shows of the time is still somewhat lacking). The character designs of the main cast and villains were unique and stood out from each other, although the designs were somewhat 'stubby' in their appendages, although this didn't bother me.Sound: I liked the opening and ending. The OST was solid and had some funny insert songs a couple of times. Nanako's voice can be a little annoying since she mostly repeats simple childish phrases but this is not really the fault of the voice actor so much as the script.Enjoyment: Despite the story complaints and lackluster villains, my enjoyment was pretty high throughout most of the show. I really liked the main comedy duo, especially Yotsuya, and many of the scenarios and self-aware humor were quite funny.I would recommend Nanako SOS if you are looking for a lighthearted comedy and can go without an overarching story or interesting villains.;Mixed Feelings
0;Umi no Triton;mottowers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mottowers;3;"Story:I feel like I'm being very generous since it has the classic ""Beat every mini-boss guy you see"" set up. The ending was weird and it doesn't really explain anything. Triton the main character is accompanied by a weird dolphin with a check mark shaped tattoo and is trying to defeat this bad guy who supposedly killed his clan.Every ""mini-boss"" has his (or her) own aquatic animal they use to beat Triton. They usually stump him for twenty seconds and then Triton comes up with the ""most genius"" solutions ever. The series repeats this about all the way to the end. Even the final boss didn't even seem that difficult to beat up.Art:Considering it being a old anime the art looks faded. The water looks like it's a solid object. The underwater scenes are decent. The ""mini-bosses"" have a cheesy design. They would always use the super buff bad guy or the witch-like bad woman.Sound:The OST sounds old. If you actually know what the guy is singing about it stupid. If you didn't its actually pretty decent. It's the kind of thing where you think it's suppose to be stupid, but it's actually cool. the quality of the sound itself is smooth (In the DVD version at least), but some of the voices of the characters can get really annoying sometimes.Enjoyment:In general, most people in this generation won't even look at this anime. They got cooler stuff like Sword Art Online. It kept me hooked since it gave me an nostalgic feeling. I believe it's hard for other people to enjoy and I really don't recommend this kind of anime if your into stuff like SAO. This action level is pretty much lower compared to Power Rangers.I have the actual DVD in Japanese. So if any of the sound or art summary are worse than what I say it's probably, because the people recorded it with poor quality.";Not Recommended
0;Sojunghan Nal-ui Kkum;RTPDJRT1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RTPDJRT1;8;I rarely write reviews so bear with me por favor.This movie had 0 reviewsIts a Korean animated movie as you can tell its not a Japanese titleStory: 7/10It's based in the 60s i believe not really sureSo this is about a girl who struggles with accepting failure.She was once an athlete and quit because the thought of her losing to someone else was a total nightmare.Basically throughout the movie a lot of self acceptance and self love is a reoccurring theme. There's some new girl introduced but I didn't see the relevance at all maybe she would have been the 2nd protagonist for story development but no.Like I really don't get it, they become friends and i thought there would be a deeper story for her and a boy she's interested in. There's a lot that happens but theres no closure for any of it.It's a coming of age movie but with a lot random plot holes missing in the story. If those holes weren't there I would give this a 10. Also you would know which holes I'm talking about if you watch the movie.Art: 9/10I literally love love the art. I hate tacky anime with rainbow colored hair and like the cutesy type animation for example like mayo chiki. it's very basic art with black hair and brown eyes. It gives off a studio ghibli vibe. people might think I'm crazy but I prefer an old art style looking animation than modern looking animesound: 7/10It was okay nothing outstandingthere was cliche music you hear every movie like this so there nothing worthy to mention.ALSO this is a KOREAN animated movie it might feel strange at first hearing a language you're not used to listening all the time but you get used to it.Enjoyment: 8/10it was a cute movie to watch especially shipping the main and her love interest and learning more about her and seeing her grow as a person.overall 8/10I didn't like the holes as i mentioned before but I mostly think this was a good moviei recommend this if you want to watching something a little different;Recommended
1;Sojunghan Nal-ui Kkum;Kahoutek;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kahoutek;7;"I'm adding a review because there are so few. You will probably like this if you enjoy the more subdued Ghibli films, such as Only Yesterday and especially Ocean Waves, as this film has some similar motifs to that one (I won't say which, both so as not to spoil Ocean Waves for anyone who hasn't seen it, and also to let those who have seen it go through the fun of spotting the similar motifs themselves). The art style is definitely Ghibli inspired too, and I really liked it. I watched it because I wanted to experience some Korean animation, and it's set in 1970's South Korea, a period I'm interested in (the era of economic growth and the Park Chung-hee regime), and I was glad they showed some cultural aspects of that era too. Overall, this film is cute and comfy, but don't get me wrong, it's not simply junk food—it has some fine emotional depth and the main characters are good. If you're into fiction that explores the ""extraordinary in the ordinary"" like me, definitely check it out.";Recommended
0;Bakukyuu Hit! Crash B-Daman;deep3anime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/deep3anime;6;I came across this anime series when i was searching for an anime for kids which has at least 50 episodes. I saw first episode a couple of years ago and dropped it considering it is too childish. It is about a boy named Hitto who stays at rented house of his friend Nana, who takes care of him everyday like waking him up and doing shopping for him. His father leaves the house for unknown reasons and so the town people give him generously groceries etc. One day as he was waiting for his father's letter on his birthday, Hitto receives a gift box sent by his father, a Bidaman Ifrit. So the story progresses as he comes across with new friends and there will be tournaments ( not so focused in the plot) and evil plot to rule the world using Bidaman unleashes in later episodes.Characters: Hitto's father is the strong character, which stays persistent till end of the anime series. He is a father who tests his son by wearing a mask to see how well he improved. He even observed his friends secretly (can be perceived but not shown in the anime) and he makes special Bidaman for his friends. Another Character that is good is of Kudoh. But as usual his strong and lone wolf nature seems to be influenced by Hitto and changes in the last episodes. There are lot of characters which are completely not shown in later parts of the story. For example, Princess Darami and DJ Baku.-ve of the storyThe story of 7 Bidaman warriors (who can destroy the evil) is not shown properly. Hitto dreams in last episode of gathering 7 Bidaman light, but is not shown properly. They mention JBA a lot in the story but none except the director was shown and even though a building was blown up no one shows up. It was a blunder on part of the script writers i presume.Teruma, one of the seven warriors seems to have personality shifts and he gets cured at the end of the anime, how? That is not shown clearly in the anime.Art : is Mediocre . Animation wise it is not on par with today's screen quality.Overall Enjoyment :There are some challenges which Hitto had to go through and those make it more interesting to watch.;Mixed Feelings

0;Reinou Tantei Miko;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;"Wow! I have seen a lot of hentai. I am slowly increasing on my reviews but this is my first on hentai for me.Before i begin i saw this in Eng. sub not exactly relevant to what i am about to type just wanted to throw that out there.Anyways what a mind boggle. Not in the mystery sense but more of a comedy one like waking up to a note saying, ""what a wonderful sexual encounter last night sorry i had to go"". Along with the fact that your mind is hazy on the encounter yet you did not drink(alcohol reference). For those have not drunk or do not drink heavy allow me to explain in less figuration but more factual based on the show without much in the mean of spoilers.This is marked as a Hentai Show. Expectations are simple both sexual genitalia. I understand that there is a cross country border japan vs America so certain regulations allow for certain censorship. However, if you construct the show for hentai and there is more hentai on background bits then the actual characters you got a problem.Censorship can show a marked black line common in manga or blurred motion or more commonly blocking. Blocking is what they solely do here. You have pants and such getting in the visible way of the good bits. There were only two very vague scenes on the naughty bits. yet, going back to the background mention you got the ghost's head coming out of the wall and the tentacle hands, both of which are more direct in heading in the direction of hentai then ecchi (kudos to you if you caught the pun/joke). If censorship was not buggy enough you got scene placement.Scenes, where one allows the viewer to relax and get a sense of what to expect. If i could on a review i would but i can't so imagine this little bit will you? good... imagine seeing a modern magazine, traffic, tunnels, buildings key focus modern(real world) now coming back what if i told you those images are IN THE F*$@&ng ANIME (CARTOON)! no, not a picture in the middle a cartoon but full screen background. To me along with that wack censorship allowed this show to drop from a 7 or 8 to a 4-6. Not sure if this anime has it already but this deserves a psychological genre keyword";Mixed Feelings
0;Grimm Douwa: Kin no Tori;rooster_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/rooster_;8;"Kin no Tori is an animated adaptation of a classic fairy tale that was clearly meant to air for years on end via public-access TV, to the delight of children everywhere. Its visual inventiveness and zest for life shine through every colorful character design and gorgeous piece of scenery; much of it recalls the pastoral worlds that early Miyazaki was so fond of, such as on Future Boy Conan, Heidi, and Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro. The atmosphere of a playful, dreamlike fantasy is absolutely fulfilled. Beyond its visual delights, it's a simple story by design, told without much fuss and leading to an exciting climax. Aside from a comically over-the-top and somewhat outdated musical number by the main villain (which is very funny nonetheless), I found myself thoroughly enjoying Kin no Tori.";Recommended
0;Grimm Douwa: Kin no Tori;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;4;"God, most of the Brothers Grimm fairytales were awful, weren't they? I mean, sometimes there were intriguing elements; a few grotesqueries that are almost always removed from the adaptations, as most of them are intended for children; these stories were pretty much skeletons for artists to add meat and flesh to, yet the telling is almost always too faithful. Artists are all too happy to just dress the skeleton up in a suit, paint its face and put on a clown nose, parade it around town, chuck it in the cellar closet once everyone gets bored, then call it a day!This adaptation compresses The Golden Bird story in a way that's serviceable, kidifies it, and most of the story changes are for the better, though largely irrelevant and not worth recounting.One of the bigger referents for the art direction might have been the old Disney fairy tales—primarily some of the art of Eyvind Earle for Sleeping Beauty... otherwise, old fantasy and fairy tale artwork from the likes of John Bauer or Kay Nielsen.Shelved until 1984, finally being released in 1987, and, eh... I can kind of see why they weren't overly eager about releasing this, but at the same time it's solid enough and has worthwhile enough contributions to deserve being seen—it's just there's a constant issue of mismatch and mediocrity.After the opening cut of a bright glowing bird and abstract animation, followed with an atmospheric scene of a mist-cloaked tree, appropriately depicted using mystical tones for the music, my interest was piqued, but then we have scraggly cartoon characters running around flat fantasy art—some of which is very good... other times the characters and background art are simply too mismatched to maintain immersion.It's not altogether bad. I'm sure kids would enjoy it. Lulu, the fox, is a fun character, the cats are good henchmen, even the bird is charismatic as a drunkard, there's decent character animation for the childish character art, and the animation is often solid, though I wouldn't say there's much in terms of the style that makes it a must watch, though with a few exceptions...The battle scene with the tin knights is more rousing than most of what precedes it, even if the guitar music is poorly chosen at the end, and the flow continues when the massive tin knight chases the heroes, but the only scene that was truly phenomenal was Atsuko Fukushima's key animation for the boy and girl riding on the golden horse. The whimsical yet technically meticulous animation, the sense of perspective, the color and lighting, and really everything about the scene is a great example of the power of animation. I'd say it's worth watching for that reason alone, but you'd be better served checking the choice bits on Sakugabooru or YouTube. Almost everything that I really liked was on the former.Most of the best parts are from Fukushima, and the witch gets some of the very best scenes in general, including the psychedelic segments of the pointless musical interlude. One other standout scene is the cutesy moment when the kids ride the horse through the sky.I really have to say that musical numbers are one of the great sins one can commit in art. The first song was bad, but at least it had quirky animation and was edited well. You can see the budget tank on the second musical bit when the boy meets the princess and falls in love. They are literally stills we're presented with. If you had an artistically gifted kindergarten student, you'd lovingly append these to your refrigerator and be proud to show it off even to art teachers, but you still probably wouldn't put them in your animated children's film.";Not Recommended
0;Inuki Kanako Zekkyou Collection: Gakkou ga Kowai!;Wheedies;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wheedies;9;The show is a classic Japanese horror story, nothing remarkable but nothing bad. If you want anything to be resolved to and real degree- it wont be.

1;Inuki Kanako Zekkyou Collection: Gakkou ga Kowai!;TheAngryNerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAngryNerd;7;This is honestly one of the more obscure things I've watched inside of this medium, and one I find rather difficult to rate.Review:Story/Plot - 7 - There are 4 stories inside of this 40 minute OVA. Each one has a different girl that the main character, Bukida falls in love with, kind of like a multi-heroine romance anime, although it doesn't really do so well in that respect. The plots for all of these are fairly similar, each one using the same formula. Bukida falls in love with a random girl he encounters, he basically stalks them and becomes obsessed with them, he does some weird magic thing, and then the girls try to set themselves free from it. It is repetitive, but each story offers something unique, especially the 4th story, where the girl falls in love with Bukida instead of the opposite happening. Simple, but interesting and pretty good execution overall.Characters - 5 - You won't get much out of any of them except for Bukida, but even then his character isn't explored very deeply. Bukida is a supernatural forever alone kid that no one likes, because of his looks and strange demeanor. Aside from knowing that he's infatuated with the idea of being eternal partners with and being loved, we also know his motivation for doing so: To fill the void in his empty heart, literally. The time frame of this OVA is very limited so there's no chance for any character development or time to take an in depth look at them and figure out their personalities.Visuals - 8 - The art helps this anime out a lot. It has a distinct style and sets its creepy tone and strange atmosphere fairly well. The art also allows for the characters to be very expressive, making it easier for their feelings to be conveyed to the audience. The animation isn't anything to really take note of, it's your standard anime animation quality.Audio - 6.6 - Nothing really memorable in the soundtrack, although the ending theme stood out to me as very nice. The sounds were pretty eerie and the voice acting was pretty good, especially Bukida's, whose voice sounds like Usopp's from One Piece (might be the same VA). Nothing really special though.Overall: This ended up being a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It has a special level of quality to it and does its job decently well at being a horror anime. If you're a fan of classic Japanese horror, then give this OVA a try, you might enjoy it!O score: 6.65/10 | S score: 8/10 | Final score: 7.325/10, rounded to 7/10 for MAL score.;Recommended

2;Inuki Kanako Zekkyou Collection: Gakkou ga Kowai!;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;6;"Contains spoiler.There is not much to talk about this anime, but I will give my opinion anyway.It's like the name of the anime says: A collection of stories by Inukk Kanako.This OVA presents us with 4 stories, and 3 of them are basically similar.The first story is what is in the synopsis. Bukita keeps chasing girls around school and telling them that they are in love with him, and since he has a scary appearance, everyone is afraid of him. In this first story Bukita dies in a traffic accident, but comes back to life without a piece of his head, just like the doll he gave to the girl that she dropped and broke. In the end the girl commits suicide by throwing herself in front of a truck, but there is nothing explicit about it.The second story is basically the same as the first, but involves a girl who is nice to all the boys. After having the whole plot with Bukita and the girl, she ends up throwing herself out of the window and lands on the spiked gate. In this story the girl's death was a little more graphic.The third story is the simplest, shortest and is the one I have the most to say.This third story is about 2 minutes long - it's about a girl who thinks she should have closed the door, and there resides an evil spirit.In this third one it's interesting the art that they chose to use. Basically almost everything is done in CG, and amazingly the CG is good, even more so if you take into account that this is a low budget anime from 1999. The atmosphere of this little story is even more ""dark"" than the others, especially because of its different aesthetics. In this little story the use of CG was much greater than the 2D, the 2D was even a bit restrained, but it matched what I wanted to convey.The last story is the longest, but I don't even have much to talk about. It has some differences between the first and the second, since this time it was a girl who fell in love with Kubita instead of him falling in love with the girl. There was some Plot Twist towards the end, but nothing too much. Aaaa... And in this last story, the girl doesn't kill herself in the end.The art of this anime is something that helps a lot, it really gives a strange atmosphere.The direction is really good. They use the little they had and execute well, plus the good use of CG in the third story. The direction manages to convey well what the characters feel, it's a positive point.This is another random OVA from the 90s. It was better than I thought it would be. It was nice to watch.";Mixed Feelings

0;Gakuen Maria: Bakunyuu Teachers;Hidder;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hidder;1;"Okay, let's be real here. This is a hentai from the early 2000s, were you really expecting something good? If you were, let me tell you right now, don't even bother watching this, it's probably the worst hentai I've ever watched. But since this is a review, I should explain in more details why this is so bad, so here we go.Story - 1: There might be some people out there that actually watch hentai only for the story, but the majority of people don't. But if you are one of those that actually enjoy story when watching hentai, just skip this one. I'll try to explain what this show is about without ""spoiling"" too much.We have this new teacher enroling in a new school, she's pretty hyped about her new job. But when she gets there she figures out that they have a ""special"" type of lession there (yeah, exactly what you are thinking). As soon as she sees that scene, she decides to leave, but someone gives her a type of drug, and then she gets raped by everyone in class.After that she actually leaves, but a student explains that they thought she knew about everything, and that the lessons they have there are the best, so she decides to come back and fuck everyone again...I'm not even kidding, that's the ""story"" of this piece of fecal matter.Art - 1: For a hentai that aired in the early 2000s, the art here is really pathetic. I've watched other shows (hentai ofc) from the 80s and 90s that have way better art than this... I guess the budget was pretty low.Sound - 5: I'm not gonna be unfair just because I hated show. The sound in here is really not that bad, we do have some good background music, and the voice acting is actually really good - the voices fit the characters really well.Characters - 1: Probably the worst part after the story. We only get to ""know"" 4 characters. The two female teachers, the principal, and one of the students (the other students are pretty much just background characters that don't really have any lines). The main girl is pretty much retarded, she gets convinced that sex is the ""true type of education"" by a horny teen and then comes back to the school. The principal is a pervert, the other female teacher is pretty much a pervert and the studend is pretty much a pervert as well, that's it... I'm not kidding, that's it, they had 30 minutes to try to give us something, but they failed.Enjoyment - 1: I hated the whole 30 minutes of this (to be honest, I skipped most of the sex scenes, because they were boring and they re-used most of the scenes, so you wouldn't see something new, and then it got repeated over and over again... YEAH, the same scene). Rape is probably the thing I most hate in anime in general, especially when the person that was raped starts liking the ones who raped her...Overall - 1: Unless you like shitty hentai, with rape and ugly characters with ridiculous boobs, I'd say skip this...

So it's not really an interesting story and nothing is developed for the most part as it mostly focuses on a lot of orgy sex and one none orgy sex scene.The art is decent for when it was released but the animation is a bit lower quality. Not quite as bad as what you see in some of the newer garbage released today that can be barely called animation but still a clear step below the better quality hentai that is out there.Overall it's an okay hentai and probably only really enjoyable for those that are into rape and orgy hentai. If you don't like orgy sex or women being raped and slowly enjoying it more, then skip this one.;Not Recommended
0;Mahou Yuugi 3D;BunBytes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BunBytes;5;Did you like Mahou Yuugi 2D? If no, skip out on this one. If yes, also maybe skip out on this one.Story - 4: This OVA helped my main complaint with Mahou Yuugi 2D's story, which was its lack of direction. It has a distinct 3 act structure, and an ending that resolves the episode's conflict while leaving tons of room for more material. But that goes back to another complaint I had with 2D's story, which was that it not only lacked direction, but that at least somebody working on it desperately wanted it to have direction. There is an idea to be explored with this setting and characters, and this OVA teases at that more than I think the ONA series did, but none of it ever gets its conclusion.Character - 6: While the characters may not be as fleshed out as in the OVA, this one's getting a higher score. Mahou Yuugi 2D had a good variety of chemistry and relationships, but this OVA has far less time to do all that. However, it seemed to succeed as well as it could. It had to establish three characters, their dynamic, make the protagonists likable, and give us an interesting quirky villain. That seems pretty difficult for under 30 minutes of screentime. It's still not great, hence the 6, but there was a good effort.Art - 4: The main draw of 2D is sorely lacking in 3D. As you can guess, that's largely due to the transition from hand-drawn to CGI animation. 2D had some CGI in spurts but it was never all that obnoxious, and one of my favorite episodes of it had a lot of meta jokes about 3D animation. But here, as well as in the main series, the 3D ranges from weird but passable to weird and pretty janky. And I don't know what it is, but it's a lot harder to forgive bad 3D than it is bad 2D animation.Sound - 6: Honestly didn't pay attention, but it seemed about the same as the ONA.Enjoyment/Overall - 7/5: A longer, more serious prequel to the OVA without the visual charm but seemingly with slightly higher writing quality.;Mixed Feelings

There were scenes in both episodes that are so unique; I have not seen anything like it before. Seriously, type in ""youshou"" on rule34 or something, and you'll know what I'm talking about.I'm not giving this series a 10 because the foreplay scenes I liked were only there to prepare the female victim for a man they worship. It just resulted in him having his way with the girls. I didn't like the female assisted rape of another female (I didn't like the man being involved). If it were up to me, it would just be females pleasuring the captured victim with no man involved at all.Watch this if you're a yuri fan and are okay with non-consensual themes; there's much straight sex.";Recommended
0;Youshou;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;5;"Tell me if you`ve heard this one before. A super-secret cult of bald lesbians performs erotic experiments on bodies from the local hospital. Their intent: to revive the spirit of their ancient leader in a virile human form. Now it`s up to the Midnight Strike Force, a team of busty justice fighters, to go undercover (and under the covers) to stop the nefarious acolytes before they succeed in their diabolically dirty schemes!The plot is weird, out there, and kinda stupid, but that`s how the English version pitches itself from Critial Mass Video themselves, right on the back of the DVD case. And that`s not really a negative, since it has all of the charm of a so-bad-it`s-good type of thing. But most of that comes from the English dub of this hentai.With the English dub, the people writing the English script seem to be completely aware that they`re writing for a trashy porn, and go for a comedic script ala ""Ghost Stories"" instead of just doing a 1:1 of the original Japanese script. This means that Midnight Strike Force has a lot of dumb puns, inappropriate jokes, and an overall fun tone. With the Japanese version, it just comes across as a half-assed attempt just to have sex scenes.Speaking of sex scenes, there aren`t a whole lot of them. They`re there, but they feel like they`re there just because this happened to be a hentai, and it needed sex scenes. They`re not bad, just there.As for plot itself, it`s pretty much your standard cheesy B-Movie type of plot to get the anime from setpiece to setpiece. I can`t really complain since it`s an excuse plot and wasn`t really meant to be paid attention to. It does it`s job for the most part.The animation is actually OK. Nothing amazing, but decent. I especially like the art style. You might be asking ""If I`m here just for the wank material, who cares about the animation?"" I`ve seen so much poorly animated hentai that merely just having decent animation is worth noting. I know it`s hentai, but I can`t really use it for it`s intended use if it looks like something a child could draw or some amateur teenager circa 2003 Newgrounds could animate. The voice acting is tolerable, but like the English script, the people behind the scenes were just doing this for the paycheck, and decided to have some fun while doing it.If you`re looking for something so-bad-it`s-good, this is right up there with the infamously bad English Bible Black and Sextra Credit`s (Mejoku`s) hilariously great dub.";Mixed Feelings

0;Catblue: Dynamite;doctor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/doctor;8;"This was a very obscure show. While I was looking up info for this show, I found out that this was originally made in English with Japanese subtitles; I immediately went to look for it after that. So, for this review I obviously can&rsquo;t mention how the Japanese track was since, as far as I know, there isn&rsquo;t one. I believe this was meant to be a actual series, but it seems that they never got to make anymore, which is a shame since this show was actually good.The story is very simple. This show is suppose to be taking place during the 70s, which you notice right away due to the show being presented as an old action movie of the times.One word can describe the dialog: Cheesy. Yet, it works, which is the weird thing. There are plenty of expletives thrown all over the place. So, make sure the kiddies are not around. Again, the show was meant to be in the style of old 70s movies, which can explain the cheese. The acting is not exactly top grade, but it wasn&rsquo;t painful. This was originally made in Japan, so you are not going to get the best English speaking actors. Most, not all, of the cast was good though. Blue was alright, I didn&rsquo;t mind her. Bill and Robert were good. The only problem in my mind was John Doe. He was pretty hit-or-miss.There have since been a good amount of shows that have used cell-shaded CG animation for their entire show. A good amount being action related. This show is one of the ones that make it work. The action scenes are very fluid. I can not stress that enough. It is pure eye-candy, especially the disco fight.This show has style, which a lot of shows are missing now-a-days. I just wished they made more of it. It felt like there were somethings missing. There were a bunch of things that I would have loved for them to cover, especially Blue's past. This is show is worth a watch, if only just to laugh at the corny dialog.";Recommended
1;Catblue: Dynamite;GuruBuckaroo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GuruBuckaroo;8;"Catblue: Dynomite is a textbook example of a great idea poorly implemented. It definitely needs more love, and I think (even though it's only 4 years old) a remake or ""reboot"" could turn this into a fantastic series or OVA/ONA.Characters:I'm tackling the characters first here, because they are the strongest feature of the show. These characters have been referred to as ""stereotypes"", but that's not really taking it far enough - they are actual Archetypes, pulled straight from a Quentin Tarantino movie. The hard-ass New York Italian lowlife; the funky 70's blacksploitation hero; the wise-cracking street-smart Lady with a Grudge (and, in this case, nekomimi). This trio and the supporting characters and villains could power through just about any story they were dumped into.Story:The storyline itself is well written, enough so that you want to keep watching the rest... except there isn't any ""the rest"". It very much feels like an episode in a larger story, although it stands well enough on its own that you don't feel abandoned like at the end of some anime (*cough* NGE *cough*). Yes, there are some serious inconsistencies, such as the entirely inappropriate Jennifer Lopez reference in what is obviously supposed to be an homage to the 70's mob scene.Animation:Things start to go bad now. This is a cell-shaded CG movie, and as is often the case, that means the backgrounds look grand - but the characters are iffy. The scenery, cars, buildings, etc are gorgeous. The character designs are gorgeous. But when they move - ugh. It looks like rotoscoping. The mouths are over-animated - in the attempt to make sure you *know* they're speaking English, maybe. The only time these characters actually let their lips meet is when they're absolutely silent.Acting:Ugh. This is really where this anime falls apart. The voice acting sounds like a cold table reading rather than a final audio track. I have to admit that the voice actors do manage to capture the essence of the characters, they just seriously sound like they're reading a script instead of acting their parts. Since this is an English-only piece, it could be that the Director (if Japanese) just couldn't tell if it was good or not.Music:To end the detailed breakdown on this series on a high note, the music is spot-on. Appropriate to the era, mixed well, fits with the action perfectly. Two big thumbs up.Misc:* I'm seeing some abuse of this movie for not having a Japanese audio track. I don't understand that at all. It has nothing to do with how good an anime this is. There are a whole lot of anime out there that don't have English dubs yet (and many that likely never will). Deal with it.* I found this show via Crunchyroll, and as far as I can tell, they, ANN, and this are the only places that know of it. There is no wikipedia article, no IMDB entry. Not even a tvtropes entry. ""Needs more love"" indeed.Conclusion:The design behind this movie is brilliant. Scenery, character design and development, music, script, etc - nearly flawless. The execution, however, is a near utter failure. In the end, I want to watch more - but I want to see it better produced. The best indicator of how good any piece is, is this - would you recommend it? I have to give an unequivocal ""yes"" to this. I want more people to see it. I want to see more of it. And I desperately want to see it better cared for by its creators.";Recommended
2;Catblue: Dynamite;angelsreview;https://myanimelist.net/profile/angelsreview;7;The story starts out feeling like a gangster movie from the 80’s, and then suddenly you see supernatural things about the world like a cat girl and ghosts. It’s interesting to say the least since I never saw something like this before. It took me a while to get into the story because of how really out of control it was but I soon actually liked it. It’s got a very different story line which keeps my interest. There was a joke that did get annoying after a while with the black guy always calling his partner brother and the come back. It got old fast in the first episode.The animation is rather interesting, using 3D with the cartoon-shader. It looks better then most shows like this but still has some problems to me. It just feels way to Miku Miku Dance to me. The textures are nice though when they do have them, not really over bumped. The world around them looks much better then the characters although the characters do look interesting. The camera shakes at odd times, making it feel a lot like a movie. It went a little odd when it went into the floating in the air fight.The Music and most of the talking feels like the 80’s, which is good since it does help with the theme. I’m not always so found of it but it’s not really all that bad when it works well with the show itself and most of the time, it’s just set in the background. But I don’t understand the little tweeting sound that happens sometimes when they are fighting. The voices actually fit the characters rather well to me and I love that about it. I have to say I think that if it was in any other language other then English, it would lose something.;Recommended
0;Catblue: Dynamite;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;3;"Catblue: Dynamite is one of those shows that come along that will be memorable to me for how bad it does something. In this case it’s acting and to a lesser degree animation. It also fails as a period piece as well, for reasons I will detail later. In the end though I am left wondering if this was really anime after all?The story is set in the 1970s American underworld. A pair of buddies is given a tape that later turns out to have more significant meaning later. The two are ambushed in a coffee shop by a mysterious smoking woman and armed gunmen. At this point our cat eared heroine appears to save the day. Though at first you’re going to be pretty confused as to why she’s got cat ears and a tail and why her friend walks through walls and people it all starts to make sense in no time. There is lots of gunplay and martial arts style action that will remind you of 70s action films. Uh well bad 70s action films that is.Catblue tries to bring back nostalgia for the 70s decade. I suppose people who know little about the decade besides the common stereotypes will be snookered into believing this is authentic. Just because you dress the characters up in leisure suits, bell-bottoms, afros, and drop in a few disco balls and classic American muscle cars doesn’t make it the 70s. About the only thing that does feel authentic is some of the background music. Sometimes I don’t even think they even tried that hard either, as some of the dialogue (a J-Lo reference 25 years too soon) is definitely out of place. Even the title is corny, taking a popular catch phrase from the decade, ""Dynomite"" and just dropping it in the name as if that is supposed to give it extra credibility.The characters are the sole bright spot if you can call them that. Blue, the feline turned human heroine is fleshed out well enough to be mildly interesting. They tell us how she got to be the way she is and what her motivations are. Though there is nothing ever resolved in terms of her own storyline. The ghost John Doe probably has a perfect name, since we learn basically nothing about him either and is completely unknown from a character standpoint. The two friends Robert and Bill are just as uninspired as their names suggest. They are basically caricatures of Italian and black stereotypes.Animation... where do I begin? Oh yeah, well it’s really shitty. Everything is CG and I imagine it would have looked fabulous, like 10 years ago. Except this was made in 2006. The motion is pretty fluid and some of the backgrounds and the vehicles look pretty good but characters are very inconsistent to downright bad. The style just doesn’t appeal to me at all and is not attractive. It looks...fake. Now that might seem like a bad word to use to describe animation but well it really shows that this was designed by a computer. That may or may not make sense to any of you but it’s the only way I can describe it.I have saved the best (I really mean worst) for last. Apparently this anime was only produced in English. I have heard some horrible English dubs before and at first I thought that’s what this was. Since that’s not the case and this was the way it really was intended to be seen then I have to say this is the worst script, dialogue, acting combination maybe in the history of film. I really hope these actors are never employed again... ever. If their performances did not make me cringe so much they would have been hilarious. Nowhere is this more noticeable than when Blue is pulling a metal stake from her body... wow lady you really suck as an actress. Please go back to waiting tables or doing phone sex.I see nothing to recommend about this anime. If you like CG, catgirls, or even if you’re nostalgic about the 70s don’t bother to see this. Really, I'm not kidding.";Not Recommended
1;Catblue: Dynamite;animegorey;https://myanimelist.net/profile/animegorey;4;This should have been an actual anime. Then, with a little more graphic violence, it would be a 7 or 8. I'm not a fan of full CG. My review reflects that. I didn't think it was very good as far as CG goes either. Ghost in the Shell 2 or even Appleseed blows this away. It does have a cool 70's theme which I do like. But the main character is a bit of a joke that I just don't get. Sound was good with Shaft type theme music going in background. Profanity fits this movie, but the CG violence didn't cut it. Appleseed had at least a few gorey spots that were well done. Ghost in the Shell 2 had some very good gore and violence and was superbly done in comparison to this one. It's only 50 min long, so if your bored, check it out and maybe download it.;Not Recommended

0;Magical Moe;IAmZim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IAmZim;10;"Moe is the emblem of the security, hope and innocence of childhood, which a man can spend his life seeking to regain. It is the green light at the end of Gatsby's pier; the leopard atop Kilimanjaro, seeking nobody knows what; the bone tossed into the air in ``2001.'' It is that yearning after transience that adults learn to suppress. ``Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost,'' says Thompson, the reporter assigned to the puzzle oftentacle's dying word. ``Anyway, it wouldn't have explained anything.'' True, it explains nothing, but it is remarkably satisfactory as a demonstration that nothing can be explained. ``Magical moe'' likes playful paradoxes like that. Its surface is as much fun as any movie ever made. Its depths surpass understanding. I have analyzed it a shot at a time with more than 30 groups, and together we have seen, I believe, pretty much everything that is there on the screen. The more clearly I can see its physical manifestation, the more I am stirred by its mystery.It is one of the miracles of cinema that in 1941 a first-time director; a cynical, hard-drinking writer; an innovative cinematographer, and a group of New York stage and radio actors were given the keys to a studio and total control, and made a masterpiece. ``Magical moe'' is more than a great movie; it is a gathering of all the lessons of the emerging era of sound, just as ``Birth of a Nation'' assembled everything learned at the summit of the silent era, and ``2001'' pointed the way beyond narrative. These peaks stand above all the others.The origins of ``Magical moe'' are well known. Orson Welles, the boy wonder of radio and stage, was given freedom by RKO Radio Pictures to make any picture he wished. Herman Mankiewicz, an experienced screenwriter, collaborated with him on a screenplay originally called ``The American.'' Its inspiration was the life of William Randolph Hearst, who had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services, and then built to himself the flamboyant monument of San Simeon, a castle furnished by rummaging the remains of nations. Hearst was Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch and Bill Gates rolled up into an enigma.Arriving in Hollywood at age 25, Welles brought a subtle knowledge of sound and dialogue along with him; on his Mercury Theater of the Air, he'd experimented with audio styles more lithe and suggestive than those usually heard in the movies. As his cinematographer he hired Gregg Toland, who on John Ford's ``The Long Voyage Home'' (1940) had experimented with deep focus photography--with shots where everything was in focus, from the front to the back, so that composition and movement determined where the eye looked first. For his cast Welles assembled his New York colleagues, including Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland, the hero's best friend; Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, the young womantentacle thought he could make into an opera star; Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, the mogul's business wizard; Ray Collins as Gettys, the corrupt political boss, and Agnes Moorehead as the boy's forbidding mother. Welles himself playedtentacle from age 25 until his deathbed, using makeup and body language to trace the progress of a man increasingly captive inside his needs. ``All he really wanted out of life was love,'' Leland says. ``That's Charlie's story--how he lost it.''The structure of ``Magical moe'' is circular, adding more depth every time it passes over the life. The movie opens with newsreel obituary footage that briefs us on the life and times of Charles Fostertentacle; this footage, with its portentous narration, is Welles' bemused nod in the direction of the ``March of Time'' newsreels then being produced by another media mogul, Henry Luce. They provide a map oftentacle's trajectory, and it will keep us oriented as the screenplay skips around in time, piecing together the memories of those who knew him.Curious abouttentacle's dying word, ``rosebud,'' the newsreel editor assigns Thompson, a reporter, to find out what it meant. Thompson is played by William Alland in a thankless performance; he triggers every flashback, yet his face is never seen. He questionstentacle's alcoholic mistress, his ailing old friend, his rich associate and the other witnesses, while the movie loops through time. As often as I've seen ``Magical moe,'' I've never been able to firmly fix the order of the scenes in my mind. I look at a scene and tease myself with what will come next. But it remains elusive: By flashing back through the eyes of many witnesses, Welles and Mankiewicz created an emotional chronology set free from time.The movie is filled with bravura visual moments: the towers of Xanadu; candidatetentacle addressing a political rally; the doorway of his mistress dissolving into a front-page photo in a rival newspaper; the camera swooping down through a skylight toward the pathetic Susan in a nightclub; the manytentacles reflected through parallel mirrors; the boy playing in the snow in the background as his parents determine his future; the great shot as the camera rises straight up from Susan's opera debut to a stagehand holding his nose, and the subsequent shot oftentacle, his face hidden in shadow, defiantly applauding in the silent hall.Along with the personal story is the history of a period. ``Magical moe'' covers the rise of the penny press (here Joseph Pulitzer is the model), the Hearst-supported Spanish-American War, the birth of radio, the power of political machines, the rise of fascism, the growth of celebrity journalism. A newsreel subtitle reads: ``1895 to 1941. All of these years he covered, many of these he was.'' The screenplay by Mankiewicz and Welles (which got an Oscar, the only one Welles ever won) is densely constructed and covers an amazing amount of ground, including a sequence showingtentacle inventing the popular press; a record of his marriage, from early bliss to the famous montage of increasingly chilly breakfasts; the story of his courtship of Susan Alexander and her disastrous opera career, and his decline into the remote master of Xanadu (``I think if you look carefully in the west wing, Susan, you'll find about a dozen vacationists still in residence'').``Magical moe'' knows the sled is not the answer. It explains what Rosebud is, but not what Rosebud means. The film's construction shows how our lives, after we are gone, survive only in the memories of others, and those memories butt up against the walls we erect and the roles we play. There is thetentacle who made shadow figures with his fingers, and thetentacle who hated the traction trust; thetentacle who chose his mistress over his marriage and political career, thetentacle who entertained millions, thetentacle who died alone.There is a master image in ``Magical moe'' you might easily miss. The tycoon has overextended himself and is losing control of his empire. After he signs the papers of his surrender, he turns and walks into the back of the shot. Deep focus allows Welles to play a trick of perspective. Behindtentacle on the wall is a window that seems to be of average size. But as he walks toward it, we see it is further away and much higher than we thought. Eventually he stands beneath its lower sill, shrunken and diminished. Then as he walks toward us, his stature grows again. A man always seems the same size to himself, because he does not always love sniffing panties?Tentacles.";Recommended
0;Magical Moe;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;5;Magical Moe is one of those hentai that falls in the trouble of trying to do to much in to little time. It tries to build up an interesting story about the main characters trying to protect their kingdom from the misuse of a magical coin, and to do so must travel to Earth and defeat the villain while also befriending a girl they met. That synopsis alone sounds like to much for a single episode to cover in any decent manner.Art is okay, pretty standard quality for anime with a decent budget at this time with fair animation to go with it. Almost all the sex scenes are based around tentacle play, so if you aren't in to tentacles then this hentai is definitely not for you. The tentacles are also extension of the villain so some have his tongue and another one is his penis which may or may not work for depending on your tastes. It's also a shame that there was some potential of the heroes of some consensual sex after they defeat the villain (or any real kind of wrap up of the story) but instead it just abruptly ends and doesn't really resolve anything.Overall, Magical Moe is an okay hentai that tentacle fans would enjoy, but most other viewers would not care for since it offers nothing outside of that.;Mixed Feelings

1;Massara;RedfoxAkame;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RedfoxAkame;7;"First time writing a review here. MAL has so many reliable, much more eloquent people that I didn't think I need to say anything anymore... until now. But since, as I'm writing this, I've only seen one review for this anime, I wanna add another one.This anime is too short honestly. The mood is serene. I loved the music that gives personality to this anime. The story has so much potential. Now, there is nothing wrong with short films. But in this case, it is far too short that you aren't given the time to absorb everything. I am the type who loves to ""feel"" the anime cause that way, I get to experience it. This is what Massara is lacking. It would've been great if, let's say, in the end, it left me with some life realizations or something close. But the thoughts I had in the middle of it (while listening to the lyrics of the songs) had faded in the end and left me feeling rather... okay. It's like I didn't watch anything at all.However, it doesn't mean it's heartless or lacking emotions at all. It just didn't have enough time or space to let the audience feel those. The story is also good. But then, as I keep on repeating, it would've been so much greater if we were given the chance to dive deeper into the story, to know the depth of each characters - what was driving them, their hopes and dreams, their love for music, their pain, their connection with each other - what kind of conversations did they have? How could one's singing move the other? How did music become so precious to them? Where are they going now? Etc.You see, it had potential. It took my attention. It made me interested in both characters. But that was it. Let me add that the scenes towards the end were even more rushed. TvTDid I enjoy it? Yes. Yes, I did.

It's a beautifully colored hentai, and has awesome Japanese folk tales to go with the hentai in a traditional Japanese setting. It is rare you get a GOOD hentai like this.

0;Yukiyo Ichiya Monogatari;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;3;"Snow White stories is a three episode OVA that centers around three love stories, one for each episode. The first episode features a young woman wed to a much older man, he couldn't satisfy her because he finished too fast, one day he leaves to sell some goods, and a Thief enters, and the woman uses her body to her advantage.The second episode a perverted female warrior from the feudal war era, when one small country collapse. While most of the royal family and relatives were killed, the princess and Shingo, her vassal, escaped. And finally, the third episode features a disgraced bride, and a clan lord who was betrothed to and fell in love with a princess, with his ""affection"" for the princess becoming stronger every day.Since it's an anthology show, at least there is some mild variety in it's sex scenes, which is the best compliment I can give to something so poorly put together. I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.Let's get this out of the way early, the sex is boring, bland, and forgettable. Looking through a thesaurus for more words to describe just how monotonous this is would be a better use of your time, because at least you would have learned something and expanded your vocabulary.Yet again, this is another hentai that features bad CGI for it's backgrounds. Just because it's not as atrocious as something like 'Heartwork: Symphony of Destruction' or 'Pure Love', that doesn't stop it from being distractingly awful. Just how many hentai need shitty CGI for their backgrounds? Was it really easier to make than just a regular 2D background? I'm now put of wanking because all I can think about is just how distractingly shit the backgrounds are.Not that the 2D animation is much better. I know that hentai isn't exactly going to have a lot of money invested in it, but watching poorly drawn trash is getting tiring. And as always, the English dub is the typical bad hentai dub, nothing new here.There is no way that I'm going to recommend this over anything else, unless you've somehow gained a fetish of bad looking hentai from a youth of desperately trying to find anything you can to masturbate to. I never thought that I would say this about a hentai, bit Snow Night Stories might be so boring that it's a cure for insomnia.";Not Recommended
0;Youkai Watch Movie 4: Shadow Side - Oni-ou no Fukkatsu;Ameonna93;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ameonna93;10;Yokai Watch Shadow Side Rise of the Oni King is the best Yokai Watch movie! The events of this film take place thirty years after the main Yokai Watch series with new human characters and different art style. (Well, everyone gets an updated art-style expect Enma, Nurarihyon, and Kaira. They kept the old look.)While the main series is a comedy-fantasy, this film ditches the comedy (there are still a few funny moments) and goes straight fantasy. I'd actually go so far as calling this film a dark fantasy. There are really only two things that connect Shadow Side to the main series: 1. The main characters use a watch to summon yokai. 2. Some of the yokai from the main series play major roles in this film. Seriously, if an entire new case of yokai were introduced, and the humans used something other then a watch for summoning and exorcisms (one of them does), there would be no reason to call this a Yokai Watch film. Not to say that's bad thing. Yokai Watch Shadow Side Rise of the Oni King is a great film, and Yokai Watch is a great series. I'm just saying Shadow Side isn't really a sequel.Oh, and one more thing, I wasn't expecting Kitaro to appear in this film. That was a pleasant surprise. This film is technically a crossover between Yokai Watch and Gegege no Kitaro. (Was there a demand for one???);Recommended

In fact, I like Toshiki Kai in this particular series more than the original (you get to see Kai sneeze in this one).You need to be able to have at least seen the first season before watching this in order to get some of the jokes.

0;Yuureisen;Arsene_Lucifer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arsene_Lucifer;8;Yuurei Sen in Japanese or The Phantom Ship in English is a short animated film from 1956. It’s a film both directed and written by early 20th century, Japanese silhouette animation pioneer Noburo Ofuji. Telling a simple story without dialogue in eleven minutes. It’s the definition of a visual experience with a fantastic direction creating a visually striking piece of animation despite the limitations that came with the experimental storytelling and animation style.The short film opens with director Noburo Ofuji cutting waves out of colored cellophane. Showing first hand the method he used when creating this film. For this film, he’s inventive by the way he uses lighting, shadows, and music for capturing the purest essence of atmosphere. In one scene, on a rugged seascape combined with the low vocalizing of the choir creates a feeling of unease. Within the same scene, the shadow of a phantom ship with brightly colored background shows corpses of what appears to be a grisly aftermath of a battle at sea. The wordless chorus increases in volume and pitch as the boat magically comes back to life. With these series of images Noburo Ofuji opens the short film. From then on, the rest is a perfect culmination of animations, filming, scoring, and editing.Ofuji usage of color creates images that strike strong in their simplicity. Everything in the foreground from characters to objects they are on or hold are dark while everything in the background is colorful. Together in sync the colorful backgrounds make simple the act of a dark figure being stabbed visceral. When inside of another ship dancers are set against a kaleidoscope a complex design pulled off successfully. In another scene, seeing the present of a white phantom ship uses an experimental technique of overlaying animated swirling lines and other shapes. These techniques make are able to make white, ghostly figures that are also transparent when interacting with the other figures. It’s an incredible scene that epitomizes best usage of silhouette animation using it to its fullest potential.The soundtrack is composed by Kozoaburo Hirai. His score consists of choirs, strings, and percussion instruments that sound by being struck or scraped by a beater. It is powerful how foreboding of an atmosphere the score creates in a short runtime. Further increasing it gradually grows louder and becomes more menacing strengthening the impact the visuals have. How his score is used when opening the film is masterful. Never does it overtake or overshadows what occurs on screen. It’s treated an equal story tool as much as the animation.Without a single feeling of doubt I will say Yuurei Sen/The Phantom Ship is a short film worth seeing for all lovers of animation. It’s over fifty years old, but has lost none of powerful imagery and haunting score all those years. Standing proudly over time as a testament of quality. If you have never seen silhouette animation or want to appreciate how far animation has come Yuurei Sen/The Phantom Ship is a great place to start. A masterfully made film from a pioneer of Japanese silhouette animation.;Recommended
1;Yuureisen;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;10;Silhouette Animation has its roots firmly established in the deep history of nightly street plays made using shadows of cutouts and marionettes illuminated under a lamp for children. Using the transformative projective geometry of shadows under the influence of light has been a part of the descriptive artform for centuries, yet compared to the arrival of modern visual motion using film, silhouette animation became limited in what could be visually accomplished as opposed to other technologies rapidly gaining mass market appeal in the medium.For one, silhouettes are mostly monochrome, a direct consequence of the way the effect is produced. This directly limited the diversity of objects and the projection of depth that could be introduced into a storyboard from the outset. At the same time, the shadowy nature of the visuals lent itself brilliantly to the horror genre, since a lot of human fear actually originates from the dark. Weird shapes, when combined with the midnight shadows that could swing in unnatural ways due to the way light projected shadows could create a dramatically ominous aesthetic.Noburo Oofuji realized this as he pioneered much of the Japanese silhouette animation scene in the late 40s and early 50s. with Kujira, a few years earlier, Oofuji realized that inserting color into the frames when contrasted by the primary characters covered as silhouettes could generate a uniquely terrifying aesthetic that allowed for a dramatic increase in the variety of techniques that could be used.Yuureisen, or The Phantom Ship, is an experimental masterpiece in this aspect. Oofuji mastered the various delicate mysteries of this haunting art form and brought them to work in this delightfully brilliant horror short. Using black silhouettes to denote the living, white silhouettes to denote death and using bright contrasting colors like red to work the ship, Oofuji manifests a world that is equal parts mysterious and equal parts scary. He uses the bizarre silhouette movements to show hand to hand combat and incorporates color as an integral part of the plot instead of an added layer to the visual.When it comes to themes, two settings have always been staples of Japanese Animation right from the very first recorded work in 1917. The rugged rural inroads and harsh journeys or ronin and ordinary folk, and the outward expanse of the sea. The second one in particular is a recurrent theme both going into the second world war as well as it's immediate aftermath. Part of this could be credited to how influential the Japanese Imperial Navy was in the development of the Japanese animation industry as a propaganda arm, while another was just the general outlook of the Japanese people at the time who looked at the sea as the hope for their civilizational survival.Noburo Oofuji's works have often featured the sea, ships and not in a good light. The ocean in his works is almost always a monster waiting to swallow the ship whole. Travelling in the sea is an art of balancing one's chances against death while simultaneously embarking on a difficult mortal trial. Dangers abound everywhere and become the primary antagonists of his work. Whether it is the whale in Kujira, or Pirates in the Phantom Ship. Oofuji derives inspiration from both folklore, yet real Japanese experience of pride and also loss, both of which originated from the sea and waves the tapestry in this wonderful film.;Recommended

0;Princess Minerva;Silyon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Silyon;3;If there's two things Japan is known for these days in the minds of geeks everywhere, not just otaku, it's for creating an entire genre of video games know as JRPGs and for animated pornography. Of course, not all of their animation is pornography some just teeters on the edge always showing a bit too much female (or in exceptional cases male) skin, but never biting the bullet and going all the way. And who says JRPGs can't be almost pornographic too?Princess Minerva is an anime based on, but is a prequel to, a video game about a group of extremely scantily clad women trying to defeat yet another scantily clad woman. With such a premise I see no way that this could turn out as anything but a masterpiece... of schlock.The anime begins by introducing you to the Kingdom of Whistler, ruled by King Whistler XII. Aside from basically every resident of the kingdom having an unfortunate name there also seems to be a rule that women can at most only barely cover themselves just enough so that this won't be classified as outright porn. This is one of *those* fantasy settings, the ones where the women get to wear bikinis into battle while touting them as the most powerful armour in existence. I'd personally prefer it if they wore cats.Anyway, soon you also get to meet the lovely Princess Minerva herself voiced, in the ADV dub, by Jessica Calvello whose ear-splitting shrieks and window-shattering laugh will destroy your sense of hearing before the anime even hits the five minute mark.The entire dub is absolutely horrendous and I have no idea how anyone thought that these performances were anywhere near good. From the outright annoying as in Minerva's case to the outright hilarious like Tiffany Grant's rendition of the holy cleric Orlin or the main antagonist Dynastar voiced by one Pam Rosenberger who I'm not exactly convinced wasn't just someone whom ADV just found on the street and gave a role to, Princess Minerva's dub cast is sure to never let your ears rest.Oh and don't worry, the characters themselves are about as laughable as the dub's voice acting, which I'm sure in some twisted way means that the actors did a good job. None of the characters really get any development besides “this is a cleric” or “this is a warrior”, and sure you could attribute that to the very short time the anime has to work with, what with it only being around forty minutes in length, but then I'd at least expect the main characters to be somewhat well defined, which doesn't happen.They try to give Minerva a coming-of-age arc where she goes from being a spoiled child that does whatever she wants while ignoring her best friend and bodyguard Blue Morris (remember what I said about unfortunate names?) to actually being a decent human being. The arc falls flat on it's face though, and it falls about as hard and fast as a broken elevator from the last floor of the Burj Khalifa. The problem is that the show never really spends any time on the development instead opting to have Minerva have an instantaneous change of heart within the last five minutes of the show, after which she just goes back to being a brat anyway and then the story ends.Basically, after spending around forty minutes watching Minerva prance and “coming of age” the story ends up exactly where it began. And that's not the only thing that stays the same. The villain gets defeated, but since this is a prequel to the game she can't really be defeated so she is shown to be just fine mere seconds after seemingly getting blown away by a massive explosion.You could argue that the show is more about getting together the cast of women warriors that you play as during the game, and you would be right. Except that getting the cast together is as simple as organising a tournament and having them all meet beforehand by coincidence and make friends. I hope you didn't get excited at me mentioning a tournament because if you want some kick-ass fights and nail-biting suspense you're going to have a bad time. Not only is the tournament cut short, but the fights that are shown are also nothing more than some laser blasts and maybe a few waves of a sword.You'd think the show would take a bit of a chance to flex its muscles especially since it does take the time to show some fights, but what you get instead is extremely stiff animation and action scenes that are nothing more than some flashy effects to cover up the lack of any actual movement or choreography. I suppose that's the way it is in the games, they are JRPGs after all, but does it really have to be this way in the anime as well?There isn't really any effort put into the character animation and design either. You'd think that having extremely intrusive and ridiculously skimpy armour that they try to put front and centre in every scene would at least make them try and make the designs look good, right? To their credit, they don't look as bad as they could look, but that's hardly a compliment.In the end Princess Minerva is one of those titles that everyone with even the slightest bit of sense should stay away from. I'd be lying if I said that some of its gags didn't get a giggle out of me, but some few second long giggles aren't worth sitting through forty minutes of a mindless and, frankly, soulless anime. Unless your masochistic desires have surfaced or you just have a desire to watch something that's harmlessly bad, stay away from Princess Minerva.;Not Recommended

There he met a girl with whom he fell in love with, but their relationship eventually became overshadowed by his business life.

Despite being the so-called ""king of pleasure,"" he doesn't appear to be particularly good at sexual intercourse or bringing women to orgasm in general, and instead just uses his stinky penis powers to entrance them into throwing themselves at him.

We are talking a 100% of sceneries, no characters around, counting with different storytellers as main characters, sometimes may feels like a documentary about constellations and their phantasies behind.

It is a work of art worth watching even if only for the sceneries and soundtrack.Here the focus is almost completely on the journey through the milky way, and the story is not presented in its entirety, although it's possible to follow some events. It is beautiful and relaxing, and we do not have here the deep plot conclusions or eerie atmosphere present in the previous movie adaptation. No character is shown, although we can hear Giovanni's and Campanella's voices in many moments in the narrative.The animation focuses on showing the beautiful scenery of the journey and mostly explaining where they and the train are at each moment, with more precise astronomical information, which is quite interesting. With this approach in mind we can truly enjoy it.The only negative side I would point out is that the story is incomplete and many passages from the original book or previous movie adaptation were left out. Maybe this could be a bit longer, but again, the focus of this animation is not the story, but the journey and the scenery, so that is by no means a big issue.With many direct references to the original book and its author, this really stands out as a tribute.;Recommended

The film mainly takes us to an astonishingly beautiful and relaxed atmospheric audiovisual journey.While there is narration of the story throughout the film I'd say that understanding it or even caring about it isn't really important for the experience that is this film. The film itself is more of a audiovisual journey literally through ""Fantasy Railroad in the Stars"" as the title of the film suggests. I'd say this is one of the best and most unique adaptations of a story that I've seen. It is made almost in a way that makes you feel that you were part of the story yourself.Kagaya did phenomenal job with the visuals and art. Pretty much every scene of the film is brilliantly rendered with a fantastical look and extremely true to the detail and enhancing the story immersion experience. You can see that this art was created through passion for the work in question and fantasy of the stars and space in general. In short I'd say this film has showed me something that I didn't believe was possible to achieve with animation and visual medium in regards of immersive storytelling experience through the visuals.The art and overall visual atmosphere is as soothing as it can be. It is rendered beautifully and retains its fantastical and mysterious vibe throughout the film while still appearing relatable and immersive, as if you were discovering something beautiful for the first time. Laying your eyes on a masterful work in art gallery. I'd say the film definitely is an artistic experience and journey where Kagaya poured everything in the art and you can experience that through this film.The sound design is another part which I think is something exceptional. The general tone and voice of the narration is done with a soothing voice, giving you and the film a calm and relaxed vibe, its almost like you were listening some kind of performance. That is only when it comes to the narration and the voice acting. When it comes to music it really matches the fantastical and extraterrestrial vibe of the gorgeous visuals, while still staying calm with the narration. I'd say that the music itself is a masterpiece of its own, but combined with the narrative and visual experience, matching flawlessly, I think we have something extraordinary here.Note there are no visual depictions of any characters that appear in the story, but as I mentioned earlier due to the excellent way of visually portraying the story it is possible to immerse yourself as a part of the fantastical scenery as a character of the story. It is almost as if you were actually boarding the train experiencing the ""Fantasy Railroad in the Stars"" through the combined experience of narration and audiovisual storytelling of the film.I've not experienced anything like this film in anime or anywhere else before and I can safely say that it is one of the most unique experiences that you can get as far as audiovisual medium goes.

0;Master of Epic: The Animation Age;leingodf8;https://myanimelist.net/profile/leingodf8;9;"Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best:Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll...Master of Epic does quite well in the humor department. Although it is based on one particular MMORPG, it does a very good job of satirizing many of the small idiosyncrasies common to most RPG's. Some examples include going AFK, being resurrected from death, random monster spawn, combat and non-combat skills etc etc. It has some other jokes too, but really you will probably want to be somewhat of an RPG fan... or at least understand RPGs to find a lot of this funny. Still, as a fan myself, I found the humor to be quite simple but effective.Ummmm and that's it really. The music isn't that great, but the art is pretty good for a little known show like this. Its sad to see that so few people have managed to find this little gem, because its really quite good. As a sketch comedy, I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. Characters are simple but memorable enough, the comedy is funny, there are 7 or 8 repeating sketches that you can enjoy every time they come back. All in all, if you like RPGs, and like this kind of un-connected random comedy, then you'll definitely like Master of Epic.";Recommended

The show doesn't take itself seriously, almost as if it knows it's bad, which is probably what drew me into watching the show... having a feeling that the staff did the show just for the giggles.;Not Recommended
0;Dinosaur Biyori;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;8;"""Dinosaur Biyori"" is a gag show, and I'm not going to try to convince anyone that it's the greatest one ever. Not every episode is a belly laugh. Some episodes don't even seem to have any jokes. But it's not just something Fanworks tossed out in the hopes that the characters would catch on. it's way more than you expect.This show is wild, emotionally. Everything the characters do is shadowed by the fact that they're dinosaurs and, like, dinosaurs are extinct. They're supposed to be dead. And, apparently, they are aware of this while living in a human world (where we don't see humans). With that in mind, the individual episodes range from conflicts over one of the main cast making unappealing conversation at mixers to whether or not dinosaurs would be able to eat pizza.I love all three of the main characters. Tyranno-kun, whose obsession with death (sometimes) drives him to make the most of the time that he has. Tricera-kun, whose sagely attitude contrasts with his evident laziness. Stenonycho-kun the Stenonychosaurus, who is constantly self-conscious about the fact that nobody knows what the fuck that is but supports his more popular friends just the same. Wonderful.There's a ton of references to previous episodes, foreshadowing, and minuscule details throughout that may not be evident on a first watch. More than that, the amount of consideration that they put into how these dinosaurs would exist in a human-centric world is lovely. It's most obvious with Tyranno, because his stubby arms are the least like our bodies.I translated this into English for my friends and we all loved it. Seek it out!";Recommended
0;Machikado no Märchen;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;7;"Radio City Fantasy is certainly an apt title, as this combines a heavy dose of new wave pop music from Virgin VS (hahaha... lame name), takes place in an alienating urban setting that ""hides spring,"" and employs numerous fantastical day dream segments cooked up from the imagination of the main male character, who eventually coaxes similar segments out of the female main character as well.The character art from Yoshitaka Amano is striking, and the female character often reminds me of Seiichi Hayashi's art—a pretty distinct look; seemingly an iconic one for the '80s city pop era, kind of like what the flapper was for the 1920s (except flappers are gross). Shinji Kimura also provides some great background art, and I personally prefer the more ""normal"" scenery, which is well-composed and storyboarded, and Mizuho Nishikubo is also a quite talented director. This is worth a watch for the art alone, and the mood and flirtation with experimentation gives this a kind of a ""new wave anime"" feel, in the tradition of the Japanese or French new wave films of the 1960s-1970s, and to some extent, into the 1980s.Wish I could say something for the sound design, as anime is a subset of the animation medium that doesn't tend to place much emphasis on that area, and the music takes center stage. Seems like the music is always pounding away in the background—a whole album of it! I initially thought this was going to sample a wider variety of music, but it's just Virgin VS: that's great if you like the band... unfortunately for me, I'm not crazy about them, but it fits most scenes pretty well. When the music really gets going, we're treated to very lively animation—truly, it's not always integrated into the plot too strongly, but it does reinforce the themes, no matter how vaguely. The imagery here can be hit or miss and contains a bit of visual mismatch. Sometimes the backdrops or characters/items on the backdrops look a bit flat—one or the other. Some are better than others, but there's always an appeal to be found for most enthusiasts of old animation of an artsier bent.It's a simple enough boy meets girl slice of life romance (since I like this, I won't say slime of life this time), and there's very little plot—emotions, themes, and some story elements are fleshed out a little bit through the music video portions, but they often kind of just stand alone as psychedelic or whimsical animation segments that carry a particular tone—often with a childlike or fairytale-esque atmosphere. The female is being pursued by some shady men, but we never figure out why this is the case, even when the male main helps her escape at one point. I guess it doesn't matter—they're there to play the diabolus ex machina role and separate the two characters for the more solemn final arc as we ponder what flavor of ending we'll get.I need to do a better survey of the '80s OVA period, but I feel this is one of the better and more memorable selections, especially considering it's a very early OVA. If it could have been expanded and used a better OST, this might have been one of the anime greats of the '80s—whether or not it's a minor classic or not, it's one of the more notable early examples of anime OVAs combining storytelling and music videos. The Nishikubo-directed Karuizawa Syndrome came out just a few years later, and I'd also recommend that for a fairly similar visual style.";Recommended
1;Machikado no Märchen;trendo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trendo;7;The OVA uses the songs from the album Virgin VS Virgin(1981) from the Japanse rock band Virgin VS (in japanese: ヴァージンVS).I really liked the music, catchy songs. Even if one of them was a cover for ABBA`s Mama Mia.But the animation during the musical scenes honestly felt like i was on an acid trip. So yeah, not my cup of tea. Other than that it was pretty lively animation, and it doesnt feel like it was so old(made in 1984).There isnt much of a story going on either.Im not a fan of musicals, but i kinda enjoyed this. So overall, i would say its a solid musical OVA.;Recommended
0;Machikado no Märchen;Tyumace;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tyumace;6;"This might be the first clear instance of this type of anime. This anime is one of the oldest OVA's out there and it tells its story almost entirely through music video. The closest thing older than this that I can think of that does a similar thing is Belladonna of Sadness, which I think might have inspired this OVA to some extent. It's a little Ironic, though, that this anime, mostly based around music, is most interesting for its visuals. The songs are fine, but they're nothing impressive; it's really the visuals you watch this OVA for.The story is about a boy who bumps into a cute girl under a bridge and she drops some of her stuff. He helps her pick it up and they start going out. This is about all there is to the story and I'd say that's fine. They both have very beautiful character designs and they're animated quite well. The backgrounds are good looking, but not so much that you'd want more time to stare at them. Where it gets interesting is when the music starts playing and the animators let their imagination loose.Sadly, with this being the main appeal of the anime, it's also it's biggest drawback, as not all the visuals are equally interesting. For every shot that I thought looked great, there were one to two shots that weren't interesting enough to keep me from spacing out. Those great looking shots usually came in groups; usually most of the shots during an entire song were good or all the shots were boring. Usually the more boring shots focussed around the couple hanging out and not doing anything interesting. The more abstract visuals can be about anything. There is one about the couple flying around the city in a bi-plane, there is one that is comprised entirely of creative abstract animation and there is one about a bunch of guys in suits who do a weird dance(which I think definitely must have been inspired by the plague scene in Belladonna of sadness. Where else could it be from?)So the value in this OVA lies mostly in these abstractly animated sequences, but these scenes do little to enforce the emotions of the rest of the show. There is a point in the OVA where it gets a little sad and the music get a little slower to match. But the visuals only get weirder and barely do anything to strengthen the emotions of the scene. And so this anime has individual moments that are interesting, but it doesn't have an emotional trough-line, the way Belladonna of sadness does, or a strong narrative like 'A girl'. It's just kind of a boring mess with some high points that make it worth watching.Ultimately I only recommend this OVA if you really like music video's with interesting visuals. Anime that are similar but better include Belladonna of Sadness, A girl and interstella5555. And I'm sure there are tons of normal music videos out there that are great as well. But if you've watched those and you want more like it, or if you are on a mission to watch all 80s OVA's like a madman, then Machiko no Märchen isn't a bad watch. Who knows, maybe when you finish it you'll click away the tab and say to yourself: ""Man, that sure was an anime..."" And isn't that what we all watch anime for?";Mixed Feelings
0;Neko Hiki no Oruorane;Saleenseven;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saleenseven;9;A true Christmas gem. With only a short run time of 30 minutes, i recommend Orurorane the Cat Player to anyone who is looking for something cozy and heart warming. Orurorane the Cat Player might have a bit weaker animation than other anime from around its time, but I felt that the emotions and groovy happiness it portrays is still successful.I felt this required a review as some might give this anime a pass based off its low watch rate and score. However you should definitely give this a chance if you are looking for a mid 90's feel good Christmas music comedy!;Recommended
1;Neko Hiki no Oruorane;ggultra2764;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ggultra2764;7;While a bit on the simple side, Oruorane the Cat Player works as a light slice-of-life drama focused on a young man developing a bond with an old man who trained his cats to sing following his loss of an orchestra job. The OVA appears to want to express the hardships that come with adult life, shown with the cold, wintry city setting and the struggles faced by those attempting to get by with their lives, particularly the young man's situation. However said challenges don't necessarily mean it's wrong to seek a temporary escape from it as the young man is granted the opportunity to learn how to use the old man's cats to learn how to harness their abilities for himself. The simple storytelling fits reasonably within the OVA's 30-minute runtime and will admit the antics of the cats had their amusing moments for me. Only major shortcoming I'd say this could have is its rather simplistic visuals, though I'd say the art style does work to fit the anime's intended tone. While I'm not sure if I may think much of Oruorane down the line given the OVA's obscurity, I don't regret the time I put into watching it given the simple slice-of-life story it tells about a down-on-his luck young man getting a temporary escape from his problems and I'd at least recommend watching it once.;Recommended

Nobody's that well off, the weather isn't great, and the protagonist never really improves his situation from being poor and jobless. Generally, though, the mood is happy, and the story focuses on the quiet, pretty moments that punctuate the hardships of a young adult life.It's a bit too short to make an impact that will last a lifetime for me, but it's real pretty and real cute.;Mixed Feelings

0;Garakuta-doori no Stain;5camp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/5camp;7;From the creator of Popee the Performer was all I needed to know about Mr. Stain on Junk Alley to give it a shot. The more time passes, the more I realise how truly original, inspired and deeply traumatising Popee was. Mr. Stain has a lot of the same stylistic choices. It’s entirely CG animated with rather creepy shiny faced character models. There’s no spoken dialogue, with only the odd musical cue and recycled sound bites used. Each episode is only 5 minutes long and features some truly bizarre imagery. The big difference between the two is while Popee is about the darker side of humanity with jealousy, sadism and hatred, Mr. Stain is about compassion and love, albeit sometimes a rather creepy desperate form of love involving paintings and flowers.The story is about Stain, a homeless dude living in an alleyway full of rubbish and follows his escapades as he rifles through the seemingly endless piles of junk to find strange artefacts. As a general rule, the weirder the item Stain finds, the better the episode will turn out, which isn’t as often as I would like it. A big part of this comes from the animation not really working if you’re not going to go properly surreal. The characters look vaguely nightmarish with their bug-eyes and unreal movements, which is used intentionally in Popee to make you feel uneasy while Stain tries to tug on your heartstrings. While Stain’s grasp on reality is loose at best, unless it goes truly bizarre the episode rarely leaves much of an impact.When it does go truly strange though, it works magnificently. I prefer the idea that Stain doesn’t actually have any of the adventures the episodes show him having. He’ll find a dead bird and them in his hunger-driven state will concoct a story involving him tending to this bird’s ailments and building it a shelter. When taking this in mind, the formula works better when some of the darker desires of Stain comes through in the stories. My personal favourite was the one where he grew his own plant lady and spent their nights dancing on the rooftop as aliens flew in overhead and blew up the city. Or where sentient clay takes over the body of his cat and now Stain has a friend in the same shape as himself. These reflect his desires for romance but seen through his equally strong desire for some form of life and green in his dingy alley, or alternatively his desire for friendship but with someone much like himself instead of with his cat.Mr Stain 2As I said before though, Stain is not nearly weird enough. Apart from one truly strange scene involving a black hole forming in the centre of a cat’s face, the show never made me truly pull a 0_0 face while Popee managed this reaction at least once per episode, usually more. They’re obviously different types of shows. Popee uses the weirdness for dark comedy, while Mr. Stain uses it to show the main character’s compassion. But the weirder it got, the more impactful the compassion through this bizarre view of the world became. It could have been even better than Popee because Stain has heart that does manage to get to you. Well OK, Popee has heart too, but it’s a blackened dead heart while Stain gives you feels.That said, this director still has a great grasp of storytelling, and there’s a huge amount of imagination on show. The voiceless characters means they over-exagurate everything, but what’s great is how it shows emotion in the non-human characters. The glove that’s trying to rescue the lost little girl, or the robot who just wants people to dance with him. It’s that same Pixar style of emotion through non-human characters that makes it work, even when the character is a flower with very long attractive legs that is merely the concoction of a homeless man’s longing sex-drive mixed deliriously with his gardening hobby. I did enjoy the show quite a bit, and it’s certainly an easier starting point to this man’s style than Popee is, which is like introducing you to swimming by throwing you into the mouth of a basking shark. It’s very short and I would recommend you give it a shot, especially as preparation for the true masterpiece that is Popee.;Recommended
1;Garakuta-doori no Stain;zawa113;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zawa113;8;Mr. Stain on Junk Alley consists of 14 stand-alone episodes that each tell a short story entirely through action. Each story generally revolves something that Stain finds in the said junk alley and how it affects everyone within the junk alley. The stories are all told clearly and are quite inventive and fun to watch play out.Art will most likely be a love it or hate it relationship as it is entirely in CGI. The CGI is clear and the series knows exactly what it wants to do with it's graphics, but sometimes they also come off as a tad creepy (particularly in the final episode). The animation is completely smooth and clean however, always a plus. It doesn't have tons of detail like we've come to expect from movies like Shrek, but it didn't bite off more than it could chew either. There is some god-awful CGI out there, luckily, this clearly avoids that category. Sound fits and there's not too much in the way of music, but nothing feels out of place for the sake of having pretty music, it all fits the tone of the series pretty well. There isn't any voice acting except for occasional laughs or other basic noises so there's not much to critique there. For the series it works well, but it's nothing special either and it certainly wouldn't work so well elsewhere.Mr. Stain is not a series afraid of injuring its own characters and it does so quite often in a mix of slapstick and entirely deserved pitch black humor. In some cases, you do feel a little bad for the characters when they've been injured a little too much or for unfair reasons. In fact, the presence of the pitch black humor added to my enjoyment, as it is one of my favorite types of humor. Mr. Stain is not a series that takes itself too seriously and spends its time trying to shove preachy lessons in your face, it's there for entertainment. It's a short if not completely fun series that doesn't overstay its welcome by being far too long either. The enjoyment value is quite high if you know what to expect (which is not a long string of anvils falling on head comedy). Mr. Stain has its touching moments and uses them quite well, it actually hits a good mix between comedy and making you curious about what will happen to the plot and characters, more so than you'd initially expect. One episode honestly almost had me to tears, so it has a little bit of everything.If you want something short, sweet, and completely off the beaten path, consider checking it out. It's on hulu;Recommended
2;Garakuta-doori no Stain;NoblesseOblige3;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NoblesseOblige3;8;Wow is all i have to say, never would i have thought fourteen episodes of 7 minutes in length could be so enjoyable. It tells the story of Stain a man who lives like a homeless man and each episode he finds a different unique item in the pile of junk in the alley. Anything can happen from magic crayons that bring drawings into reality to robots that want to fly. The creator really did do a good job in making each unique object into something that can tell a story because you never know what will happen.The show itself can be rather violent, pretty much every episode feature Stain being hurt in some way giving him various bruises and cuts and there is always blood, this is a touch that might make you go 'what the fuck' because you simply don't expect it to happen in this type of show, granted you get used to it, but it all adds to the uniqueness that makes it all the more enjoyable.It's created solely in CG but all the characters are cartoonified so they don't look too realistic but it does make the show quirky and the CG allows for great animation. What will become apparent is it seems the creators like dancing, there is a lot of dancing whether its just the ending credits or part of the episode, the dances are pretty cool and funky and the music that accompanied the credits is brilliant and catchy.Stain lives in a room but its not a house, im not really shore what it is and lives off eating doh nuts or what ever he kills, he also falls in love multiple times throughout the series with various things, a painting, a flower, a real girl, he gives off that feeling that makes you want to see him succeed in anything he does as he gets the short end of the stick a rather lot. Palvan is a cat, i think, he also likes doh nuts and is the most seen recurring side character and often helps Stain with whatever. Other characters barely make appearances unless its an episode they only feature in, then they are likely to get plenty of screen time. Masked Monkey a masked monkey, Rings a lizard thing, they're all weird.Fourteen episodes seven minutes long with a 30 minute finale you can hardly find better time, this show should be enjoyed for its daring uniqueness and its lovable characters. Oh and there is not a single word spoken in the shows entirety, don't let this put you off because it simply doesn't need words, that how well it tells each story. It is a comedy but a dark one as its jokes come from its characters suffering with amusing injuries. You can never guess what's going to happen next or what Stain will find.;Recommended

It's just as enjoyable, if you liked Popee, like weird or bizzare shows, or generally dark themes, you'll love Mr. Stain on Junk Alley!As far as story goes, there isn't much of a linear plot, but past events are referenced in later episodes. What started off as a silly weird childrens' show became a throw at humanity. Honestly, the more you get invested, the more you realize what Junk Alley is and who it reflects in life.Everything is CG Animation, as Masuda is known for, but the visuals are very good considering (1) budget and (2) time era of production and release. There are no speaking lines, just noises from Mr. Stain, but sound effects and music are really well put. The outro is a bop to be honest.Each character has a special role on Junk Alley, and it always seems like Mr. Stain is looking for his if he's unsatisfied with his heartbreak and art career.It's bizzare,it's sad, it's enjoyable, there is no way to describe it other than it is the pinacle of Ryuji Masuda.;Recommended

Then this probably isn't the anime for you. If you're like me, a simple otaku with simple tastes for nice slice of life anime where the plots are simple and easy to follow, then you have certainly come the the right place.each episode is maybe a four to five-minute short about the office life of Moon and his friends. Office humour for everyone! I was pretty taken with it I must say, since this is the kind of thing I tend to go for.Though I did feel a somewhat longing for more. I feel I would have been happier with a proper twenty-something minute long episodes. But that's not how it rolled and because of that I'm only going to give story an 8. That sounds fair. I think. Hope..Art:This is where some people might be put off of this anime. The art is rather simplistic. But I don't know, it seems like recently a lot of the slice of life anime I watch seem to be using the same art style, almost like they could all take place in the same world.I've kinda been feeling like I've fallen into a rut and it's gotten to the point where I'm starting to check out anime simply because they got an interesting looking art style, and that may or may not be the reason behind checking out this anime.I did love the art style, it felt like a breath of fresh air for me.though that being said, it might be a deal breaker for many.I'm gonna go ahead and give art a ten(*ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ Don't hurt me.Sound:That opening. Song. Was. Amazing. Not even kidding here. I could listen to it over and over. I've already downloaded it for my cell phone.As for the sound of the overall show, I had no complaints with the voice acting, Though I guess when I first heard Connie's voice, the first thing I thought was, ""Well her voice sounds kind of generic.""You know that female voice you hear sometimes at the end or start of an anime that's like introducing the sponsors or what not? Or the voices in some Japanese TV ads? It kinda reminded me of that voice. But that had only been my first impression of the voice. It was fine.I'm going to give sound a 9. I really did love that OP.Like oh mah gawd. On repeat for hours.You know, even if you don't check out the anime you should most certainly go for that OP. Like seriously.Character:I wouldn't say any of these characters were properly developed. Though at the same time we do get to know them and they are interesting characters.But that being said, none of these characters seem to grow or change through the series all that much. They pretty much are who they are.Rating 4Enjoyment:I think it's clear at this point that I seriously loved this anime, I was watching the episodes up one after another I liked it so much.So I'm giving enjoyment a 10.Overall;Sure is had its flaws, but it really wasn't going out there to be this big epic anime. It was clearly meant to be a fun little thing to watch while you kill some time. And it managed that very well.I'll give it a 9.";Recommended
0;Shinjin Tour Conductor;nicoduches;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nicoduches;5;*Warning: This is a hentai title review. It features graphic language.Produced by the prominent studio Milky, Dark Tours is a 30 minute OAV that falls under the Hentai and Horror genres, but is barely average as the former and disappoints as the latter.STORY: 5/10The story follows Rina (also called Annaka), a young tour guide who leads a small group of tourists to a secluded forest village that is said to be haunted by the vengeful ghost of Tamiko, a woman who was sold to a bunch of men to cover debts and who suffered a horrible fate. As far as romance goes, there are a few hints of the birth of a possible relationship between Rina and a nice guy tourist, but that sub plot goes nowhere and is brushed aside at the end.The first plot twist happens at around 23 minutes and the second at 27. There really is little content that falls under the Horror category, save for a brutal turn of events at the end. You’ll most definitely be disappointed if you’re looking for a good scary story and no explanation is given at the end for what happens, but the fair quality of the H scenes can still make the movie enjoyable for us pervs.ART: 5/10The art style features heavy hairdos and tries to depict the characters in a fairly realistic manner, which is somewhat reminiscent of the 1980s’ typical style. There are up to 3 shades per color and the art is at its best during the H scenes, but overall it feels average for a 2004 release.Animation quality is sometimes jerky but otherwise looks fine. Some of the breast jiggling is actually pretty fluid and erotic. The voice actors often have a hard time matching their lines with the characters’ lips movements, but you can blame the lazy animators for this.SOUND: 6/10For once, the English dub sounds a lot better than the Japanese one. The English voice actors and actresses sound more professional and better fit the characters’ moods and facial expressions. Moans during H scenes are fine, show a hint of pleasure and are not annoying at all.The soundtrack is noticeable yet unimpressive. Most tracks are slow and simple and gently add to the scenes’ mood but at times use instruments that don’t fit the setting at all (smooth sax during a gang rape? I don’t think so). Sex sound effects are also exaggerated and unrealistic at several moments: fingering a lady even sounds like the breaking of bones in one of the scenes.CHARACTER: 5/10Tamiko the ghost looks like a regular woman. She has a pretty face and haircut, a slender body, small B-cup breasts and wears a nice red yukata with a white flower pattern. Her beauty makes her a treat to look at.Rina, the tour guide, has long, heavy brown hair and changes hairstyle at one point. She is not the prettiest of all the female characters, but she has a healthy shape, long legs and a fine D-cup bosom. Despite being the main character she doesn’t do much for a majority of the movie.The other tourist girls look more or less similar to the above two while the male characters who take part in H scenes are all rather tall and fairly muscular jerks.ENJOYMENT: 6/10The first sex scene involving Tamiko is part of the legend and therefore fits in just well, but some of the other scenes involving the tourists serve no purpose or only qualify as ecchi. Despite sex playing a role in the awakening of Tamiko’s ghost, these scenes merely happen because some of the tourists are horny rapists and nymphos, or because the studio felt they had to include them to qualify as an H title.There is no censorship, but the female genitals are rarely shown. They are still fairly detailed in close up shots. Genitals are often covered in lube or saliva, which adds a bit of eroticism to the scenes.There are 4 sex scenes and they feature:1: (Tamiko + many men) rape, pussy and breasts licking, spit roast, cumshot (whole body), vaginal penetration, breasts grab, doggie, cum inside, blood.2: (Tourists: 2 girls, 2 guys) rape, gag, pussy fingering, breasts grab, vaginal penetration, doggie, cum inside.3: (Tourists: 2 girls, 2 guys) vaginal penetration, doggie, threesome, cowgirl, DP.4: (Rina + tourists) rape, breasts licking and sucking, pussy fondling and fingering, vaginal penetration, cowgirl position, doggie, throat fuck, blood.Most memorable moment: There is one cool-looking scene where Rina is standing half-naked and covered in blood. She looks pretty badass in that moment if you ask me.OVERALL: 5/10Dark Tours ultimately fails at conveying a spooky, let alone interesting, horror story. The regular scenes are outshined in art and animation quality by the H scenes. Those were actually fairly enjoyable to me thanks to the beauty of the female characters, even though I’m not particularly fond of insipid rape scenes. Overall I’d say this title isn’t really worth watching as nothing will impress you about it and you might even be disappointed by the poorly-exploited horror theme. However I’ve seen much worse.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shinjin Tour Conductor;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;3;Tags: Gang-Rape, SupernaturalFirst off I want to say that the voice acting in this one annoyed me, especially the female lead. While the animation is not bad, they tend to overuse panned still frames. The colors are very dark throughout and give the whole show a miserable and desperate feel. This is not a light hearted anime in any way.This is a single 30 minute story and as such there is not a whole lot to the story. Characters are pretty shallow and there is not enough to make you feel one way or the other for them. There is not much to the story and any review more than a few words long would give away everything. This is not a compelling anime in any way, weak story, weak characters, boring sex scenes and no big payoffs in any way. Feel free to pass on this one.;Not Recommended
0;Zettai Bouei Leviathan: Mini Takibi Gekijou;shintai88;https://myanimelist.net/profile/shintai88;8;Personally I found this more enjoyable than the actual show.Mainly cause in this mini short we see more of the characters personality.It also pretty much like listening to a radio special with the cast.The animation is simple, the 4 are always around a campfire, and basically just chat about the episode in which it relates to.We get some fan service still shorts, of the girls in Maid, Miko, Scale outfits.And we get to see more of Levi as a character, something I felt was missing in the actual show.All in all its about 48 minutes. And to me the banter here was more well written.And it was also a lot more adorable.;Recommended

0;Ikenie;Arrvilja;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arrvilja;7;Story: 7Art: 7Sound: 6Characters: 5Enjoyment and overall: 7You may think otherwise, but it is definitely a good hentai. Despite being old, it has quite a nice art and animation. Some frames (the painting of the angels, f. e.) are true masterpieces! The tune of the soundtrack is a bit repetitive, but the voices are OK. But, above all, it does have a plotline, and a decent one, I must admit (let us remember there's only 1 episode half an hour long). The only thing is, the characters are all flat and undeveloped except Adolfo (the protagonist). However, we do not watch hentai to follow the characters' development, do we? Still, in comparison with new hentai this one does have something to enjoy! To be short, it is not anything outstanding, but still worth watching if you like dark atmosphere and adult anime.;Recommended
1;Ikenie;ZenTheTheist;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZenTheTheist;9;No idea why this has such a low score. It is on my top 3 animes of all time. The sex isn't for the sake of sexual arousal but exposure of corruption and lust/power, so I personally don't classify it as an H anime, but it is technically. It is like A Kite in that sense. The director wanted to tell a story, shoot a movie perhaps, but this was their concept project. The ambition level is different (A Kite is a Neo Noir/Action film and this is more of a drama) but you get the core concept.The characters were complex, the story was extremely well told, and the atmosphere was passing strange. It is a character study and an insight into the relationship between church and state.From the review scores I can tell that they didn't like it, but my interpretation of that is that they didn't like what they got vs what they expected. I don't expect H films to provide compelling stories and non-preachy, stark looks at corruption, but it's complaining when you get a great film instead of a sexually compelling one. This is The Erotic Temptress ep 4 all over again.;Recommended
0;Xi Xing Ji;Adampk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Adampk;9;Xi Xing Ji/ The WestwardStory (8/10) Very GoodProbably most people has already heard about famous Chinese tale called journey to the west. This story is basically what happened after the journey. It begins in a dragon kingdom where wolf demon (protagonist) who is friends with the Dragon princesses. There is a great war between Gods and dragons over stolen sutra (eternal fire) from Journey to the west. Deep secrets are held by boths gods and dragons. Now our protagonist (wolf demon) is on a journey to bring back the crew from Journey to west ( Tang Sanzang, dragon horse, monkey kin, pig and sand demon) so that they all could take back the sutra where it belongs i.e in the west. There biggest hurdle is the gods and demons who oppose them.I really like mythology story. This series did good use of the Chinese mythologies to well around action packed series. Especially they outdid themselves in the last episode was one of my favorite scene and fight of this series.In terms of storyline, it is comparable to that of wu geng ji (one of the good Chinese anime)Art ( 7/10) GoodIt is CGI, so not for everyone. But still the CGI is almost at the level of Douluo Dalu (one of the best chinese anime). So its good when compared with other chinese series. Artstyle is very good, i like it.Characters (9/10) GreatI love the character. They make the series all the more worthy to watch. Character progression for each of our protagonists (dragon horse and Tang Sanzang) are really awesome. I really loved buddha for obvious reasonsEnjoyment (9/10) OutstandingI really enjoyed it very much. It is one of my top 10 chinese anime ever.Overall (9/10) Very GoodFrom the concept to the action, everything was really great. The only complaint would be CGI ( but well i am used to it by now), I cant wait to see next season;Recommended

0;Nankyoku 28 Gou;LegionIscariot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LegionIscariot;7;"Very good, fun, cute hentai.It's about a guy Aiwa who gets a sex android through the mail.Now I know what you're thinking, ""it's been done many times"", but this is a great one.So Aiwa is dating a girl named Kozue (she has a boyfriend by the way, but don't tell Aiwa he'll find out soon enough). One day a package arrives through a postal mix-up. It's an android he names it/her Satomi and programs her (verbally) to love only him (this is probably gonna end badly). Now there's a love triangle going on with Aiwa, Kozue and Satomi. If you count Kozue's secret boyfriend then it's a love square.Anyways Aiwa finds out about the bad-boy boyfriend and it seems that Kozue is gonna choose the bad-boy, so Aiwa has no choice but to chose Satomi.But wait looks like Kozue changed her mind and wants Aiwa, so too bad for Satomi.But wait again Kozue chooses the bad-boy again.Aiwa realizes that Satomi is the one who really loves him, and he loves her.Beautiful happy ending.It's a cute, beautiful story with some comedy aswell.It's one of those old time style of animation, retro hentai. Where the guy's dick is represented by a banana, a space ship, an obelisk, darkened, transparent or a pink glow. You cant see inside the girl, it is censored with a bright glow. But the censorship didn't bother me (it beats pixels) the sex scenes were good, i might even say beautiful.There is also some good fan service.So if you like a nice story, you don't mind retro hentai, and don't mind the silly censorship mentioned above then watch this.";Recommended
0;Si Ling Bianma: Shijie Caozong Zhe;Mnemease;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mnemease;6;I'm both surprised and unsurprised that there aren't any reviews for this. I watched this series twice but could not figure out what the film producers were trying to do with this animation, exactly.Despite being 12 episodes long, the entire anime reminds me more of a trailer than anything else. Every episode ends on a note of suspense, and by the end of the last episode viewers are left with many questions and almost no answers. Sure, the concept of a game coming to life is interesting, especially when mysterious criminals with supernatural abilities are also included, but that's pretty much where the show ends.So yeah, I wouldn't exactly recommend thus series, but at the same time, it's not so terrible that I would dissuade everyone from viewing it. I guess it all depends on whether you enjoy watching trailers to movies you'll never get to see...?;Mixed Feelings
1;Si Ling Bianma: Shijie Caozong Zhe;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;6;"Rate a 6English SubtitledReason for rating (R) is because of violenceStoryDid not know at the time but this story is based upon a C.S.I.(American television show) episode. That idea alone blew me away. Now, you might be wondering how could they use a segment from the show in the anime? The segment was not of the characters but a visual equation with the original dialogue from the show to explain. The clip is about a minute long and is mention during review moments. Which makes it fair use.Anyways, the C.S.I.'s equation provides a futuristic spin to what we know as gaming today. In fact if conceived in reality it would be as futuristic as one could get it. Although, it is not that simple. The viewers (you, the audience) are tasked with perplexing mysteries. Some factor in character's goals why others deal with personality and other aspects. A really nice touch to an anime that is focused on being a game genre based. For when one plays a game they get an idea what the goal is but everything else remains unknown.Feelings from start (episode 1) to ending are mixed. While each episode is short and leaves you at big tense questions; You don't get much in terms of answers in a metaphoric balance of questions. So, knowing whether you care or not about being played as a pretend 'player' of this game is crucial to liking this anime.Lastly, in terms of the mysteries they are not always simple. Don't expect understanding with one view.ArtWhile there are some drawback like in (episode 7, i think) like odd walking animation or mostly fast paced animation. As in this animation plays likes a normal animation if you had accidentally hit the fast forward on the remote. The art still remains in good condition. For there is no problem in brightness, minor lip sync spot or two and no slow animation transition.SoundDoes sync to the art. Although, like the art it is played slightly fast.Overall: A game based animation that derived from a popular American television show clip. While the mysteries can be rather deep and animation fast you must consider this is game based. Like in most games there are difficulty levels and more popular restart functions. What good would an anime that is game based be on beginning settings? Huh? Most likely would be ignored for most people enjoy a challenge. Plus, i smile at the thought the director did that as an added bonus to encourage sales. For, if you saw this show where pausing wasn't available your desire to know more would lead you to buy the d.v.d. My only fear is that other directors will use this tactic in their shows.";Mixed Feelings
0;Mahoujin Guru Guru Movie;U-Turn90;https://myanimelist.net/profile/U-Turn90;9;"Mahoujin Guruguru Gekijouban (""The Movie"") is a roughly 30 minute short movie, an all original story taking place after the events of the first anime.Hero Nike and magician Kukukuri, together with their living briefcase and travel guide spirit Gipple are still traveling around the world as they hear of the Happiness Pickle. It is said eating it will grant you one wish.The pickle is guarded by an old Dragon, living on a mountain covered in clouds. They are later joined by religious icon Juju and Old Man Kitakita, two mainstays of the show and manga.A ragtag group of bad guys, modeled after American movie monsters, also wants to get their hands on the pickle.The story is very simple and feels like an episode right out of the second half of first anime, which was mostly anime original content, right down to a surprise ending, but with with a higher budget for visuals and super fluid quality animation.All voice actors returned for this version (this was the last time Nike was voiced by Fujiko Takimoto) and all of them did a fantastic job as always.Music and sound effects are fitting but a lot of it is reused content from the first anime. On the bright side, an all new & catchy theme song was made for this movie.Having seen every anime episode and having read around half of the manga, for me this was the best Mahoujin Guruguru experience and I was satisfied from beginning to the end. Well worth hunting down if the first anime's interpretation of Mahoujin Guruguru fits your taste.The only downside of this movie version are that it requires prior knowledge of the anime/manga to get fully involved, as well as the short runtime and some recycled jokes from the previous stories.Give this a try if you get the chance, its worth it.";Recommended

Do you need excitement in your life? Do you wonder what life happened shortly after the caveman era but long before your life? While no one can vouch for the authenticity behind the show it is a nice thought of what could have happened. When you see the show it might provide more pleasure and respect to our airplane crew.-Introduction was delivered in an appropriate fashion by having narration before the actual story unfolded.-Conclusion. Most show i have seen modern and old are fairly simple with their endings. Either a character wins the battle or loses. Here we get that and a bit more comedy wise. While they don't announce the final joke they make a good hint at with the drawings. A very cleaver idea of show vs tell. Which forces the audience to remain glued to the screen even though the show is arriving to an end.Also, I find the conclusion fairly interesting. The way the story was left off leaves room to a sequel.Art-aside from the art getting a more toned look(less bright) the background was its biggest issue. I am not saying the art wasn't appropriately drawn more its timing. I am unsure to what cause the timing to be delayed(choppy), background slowly zooms in and out but could be due to age, production, or dubbing. Given how the dubbing seemed to be on cue i think that was the reason for the delay. If so, rather than doing what they did to extend out a lengthy character line they should have shortened the message.Sound-Main female character's voice was pleasant but hard to follow at times. Due to the clear change in pitch. Maybe it was intentional because it was comedy but it was not a pitch change one might expect. In other words you know the: do, re, me fa.... bit? Well, her voice let us at normal falls at so but when angry or scared jumps straight to both dos.Overall: A show that will surprise you. Some say a cover-shot and a title provides insight to their show. I am not saying that is wrong but given a writer/artist's skill they can change what you may think will happen. For that i applaud them. In terms of audience for the show i would recommend teens and over because of violence.;Mixed Feelings
0;Doamaiger D;1cY;https://myanimelist.net/profile/1cY;8;"What can you do when tasked to make an animation with a 2 minute runtime? Evidently, quite a bit.Do you harken back to the older, grander days of giant robot anime? Are you fine with running episodic gags involving Japanese sweets? Do you want a simple, but complete satire story experience in the span of 26 minutes? Say no more.Doamaiger D is a testosterone filled series of shorts that imitate the simpler, testosterone filled mecha storylines of the older days; something like Mazinger Z is a fair comparison. This is reflected in its artistry, story structure, and mecha designs. However, it does have the unique spin of introducing a Japanese confectionary every episode. If you're having trouble finishing a giant robot robot because it contains more episodes than there are molecules in the universe, Doamaiger D is a perfect in between short to check out.What impresses me most about Doamaiger D is that it was able to create a conclusive storyline, from beginning to end, better than any 2 minute short anime I've ever seen, and maybe will ever see. Of course, much of it is making fun of old mecha tropes, but there's never an overreliance on doing so; it carves some of its own niche, combining running gags with some periodic one-time jokes.Sure, the characters may be a little flat and it could get a bit repetitive, but it's the cream of the crop when it comes to anime with an absolutely blazing two minute runtime per episode. If you've watched any older mecha series, you're likely already familiar with the style present here; in this case, it's just condensed in pacing.If you're looking for a fun play on old giant robot anime with a dessert spin, be sure to check this out.";Recommended

The pacing was horrible - and at a lot of points in the story, the movie just repeated a completely pointless scene over and over, just to be a few minutes longer.There is really nothing good that can be said about the art, it was pretty bad even for the standards back when it was produced.And the sound was just horrible and at most parts of the movie didn't fit at all to what was happening on screen.About the characters? Well, they were all pretty stupid, and felt pointless. In fact: the entire story did.There is no real lessen to be learnt, or anything positive for children at all, so I don't know why this was produced.

1;Sekai Meisaku Douwa: Hakuchou no Ouji;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;4;Not a terrible movie, but they definitely had their B-team working on it.It's an adaptation of one of the lesser known tales from Hans Christian Andersen, and as a fairy tale be aware that this is aimed at a younger (under ten) audience. As such, the story is fairly straightforward, the evil stepmother is very evil, and the morality is brutally blunt. While the religious aspect of this tale is downplayed in this anime adaptation, the religious aspect of the moral is inescapable (not that is necessarily a bad thing, of course).Where this movie falls down is in the execution - in particular, the visuals, the quality of the artwork and character designs, and the sound design. It's dark, it's murky and unsophisticated, as if they tried to squeeze this out on a low budget or tight schedule, or both.;Not Recommended

Looking at the art style and quickly finding out it's school story about small children, and that it didn't heavily feature crudeness or violence, I thought for sure that I would be bored out of my mind.I was wrong.I watched this movie during my breaks at work and was thoroughly engrossed in everything Maruko set out to do. I recalled my own hope and desire to do really well at simple things at school and failing at them miserably. It made me remember the friendships that I had.The ""flatness"" of some of the characters' personality was acceptable because, as a kid, I only really made the effort to know a few people really well. It made their portrayal more believable. The flamboyant one, the ugly clown, the suck-up, the orderly teacher wannabe.The movie did a great job of reminding me that childhood may seem easier as an adult, but for the kids living it it's just as serious and important to them that their lives go well. The ending isn't tragic in the usual sense, and though it is predictable it is very well set up and it was hard to avoid feeling for everyone involved.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who looks back on childhood with a little bit of longing. The art style may seem simple but it is surprisingly well-acted, both through voice and animation. They are obviously exaggerations of third-graders, but it is nevertheless believable.";Recommended

0;Kurenai Sanshirou;CrocMagnum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CrocMagnum;7;"Exploring all the quirks of this anime never ceases to amaze me. You see commenting on Kurenai Sanshiro is like opening a Matryoshka, a Russian doll, every time you uncap a doll you find a smaller doll inside it and so on. Likewise for Kurenai Sanshiro, aka Judo Boy, each info leads to another and so on.So this is no brief review but I humbly believe the anime deserves these clarifications.First of all Kurenai Sanshiro was never licensed in USA, this might explain why English reviews about it are so scarce. However the anime aired in foreign countries under the name ""Judo Boy"" (France, Italy) or ""El Rey del Judo"" (Spain, Chile). Consequently there is no English dub for this anime. So I will mostly talk about the French dub. Now for the loyal readers who didn’t run away screaming ^^, let’s get to the meat of this review:STORYThis is the tale of a young man on a quest to avenge his father. Sanshiro arrives too late at the crime scene only to find a glass-eye lying on the ground near the body of his father. This is his only clue: Sanshiro knows the killer is a one-eyed man.Needless to say you can expect Sanshiro to face a sizeable amount of baddies with eye-patches in those 26 episodes ; ). Remarkably for such an oldie, the anime is quite brutal. People die left and right in Kurenai Sanshiro, especially the weak. In other words Sanshiro has the Death’s Touch, often when he shows up in town you can sure bet someone will kick the bucket (friend or foe ^^).ART & ANIMATIONEven though Judo Boy aired in Europe during the 80's, the original Japanese broadcast actually dates back to 1969. So don’t expect anything jaw-dropping or perfectly smooth. Still this a Tatsunoko Production we’re talking about, so the Character Design and the Art Style truly stand out. Characters are full of life and their looks feel relatively realistic (their face, their clothing, etc). The anime displays vibrant colors which is surprising considering the age of the show.DVD BOX SETS AND DUB1- Japanese DVD Box Set: Japanese dub only, goodies included, mono sound.2- French Simple Edition: French dub only, no goodies,3- French Collector Edition: dual-audio Japanese-French, goodies included (illustrations, informative booklet). If you’re a Frenchie this is the recommended edition. Now a note on the French dub:The French dub is legendary, ‘nuff said. First because the French voice cast was made of the most talented actors of the industry of the time (Philippe Ogouz, Francis Lax, Jacques Balutin, Gérard Hernandez, Georges Atlas, Daniel Gall, Claude Chantal, Amélie Morin…) Seriously the list goes on.The undeniable highlight is late François Leccia who voiced Sanshiro. He has voiced a multitude of roles in his lifetime, but for anime fans his voice will always be tied to the main characters of Judo Boy and Albator 84, aka Captain Harlock SSX. There’s sincerity in his tone that makes all the characters he voiced forever likable.Finally there’s the French opening sung by Michel Barouille. Endowed with a superb baritone voice this singer delivered a very solemn/martial rendition of the song, which stayed engrained in the minds of an entire generation of French kids, just youtube it and try to remove it from your head if you can ^^,MANGAKurenai Sanshiro was based on a manga of the same name drawn by Ippei Kuri. For the record Ippei Kuri was the brother of Kenji and Tatsuo Yoshida. The 3 brothers founded the anime studio Tatsunoko Production. As far as the drawing goes, the manga is nothing earth-shattering. There is a lack of dynamism in some pages that is typical of the era, but the narrative is effective.In 2014 a quality edition of the manga was released in France by ""Isan Manga"" under the title Kurenai Sanshiro. This French-speaking collected edition (+370 pages) contains the complete story of Kurenai Sanshiro drawn by Ippei Kuri. Also as a bonus are added a few short stories of Sanshiro (unrelated to the main story) that were drawn by his brother Tatsuo Yoshida. Surprisingly the drawing of both brothers is quite similar.ANECTDOTES/ORIGINS1- ""kurenai"" means ""crimson"" (red),2- The red jacket (uwagi) that Sanshiro wears when fighting was given by his mother. And when Sanshiro wears it he becomes almost invincible. On second look this gimmick is quite reminiscent of…Superman. Indeed Clark Kent too wears a red outfit -a red cape- when he turns into Superman. It was given by his mother too,3- Sanshiro is not a judoka, he’s actually doing Jujutsu. So why this anime was translated as ‘Judo Boy’ in Europe for crying out loud? To find out please read the next anecdote ^^,4- The whole anime is a tribute to the movie ""Sanshiro Sugata"", directed by Akira Kurosawa in 1943. To cut it short (I swear I’m trying hard ^_^) the main character named Sanshiro too, hehe what a coincidence, gives up on training Jujutsu only to learn Judo. And believe me the physical resemblance between the actor Susumu Fujita and Sanshiro from Judo Boy is totally stunning: the square jaw, the frank and inquisitive look and the bushy eyebrows, they totally nailed it. It was Akira Kurosawa’s first movie, it’s a decent watch but don’t expect anything of epic magnitude like ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Kagemusha"",5- Akira Kurosawa being so idolized in Europe (for good reasons I feel) the people in charge of the European distribution of the anime probably made the link between Kurenai Sanshiro (the anime) and Sanshiro Sugata (the movie), this might explain why the anime was translated as ‘Judo Boy’ in those countries.CONCLUSIONKurenai Sanshiro is an old show that stands out, first visually then for his dramatic story. If you like animes where characters travel around then Judo Boy might please you: during his journey Sanshiro will visit quite a few places (Mexico, China, France, USA...) and each episode has a different storyline to keep viewers entertained. As a character Sanshiro is unforgettable, not only he’s charismatic but there is probity in him that makes him tremendously likable.Now if you’re one of those anime fans who only swear by HD, then maybe this watch will cause you severe bleeding damage ^^. However if you care about the old stuff then by all means take a look, you might find it to your liking.Now it’s time to close this review, 'cos if we keep on digging like this then we’ll probably trace back to Jesus or the Big Bang even (but I truly could go on about Kurenai Sanshiro ; ) So this is goodbye. I sincerely hope you had a pleasant and informative read.";Recommended
0;Koneko no Rakugaki;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;7;"こねこのらくがき - Koneko no Rakugaki is a charming black and white short film of about 12 minutes. The 1957 Toei Animation production was directed by Yabushita Taiji, who also directed the anime ""Kuroi Kikori to Shiroi Kikori"".A funny little story about a tiny kitten who draws on a white wall with a pencil, much to the delight of his mouse friends. But all this colourful activity comes to an abrupt end when the owner of the house suddenly appears on the scene. Of course, he is not pleased with the unwanted beautification of his home, and while the kitten is sentenced to scrubbing, the two mice have nothing better to do than ""borrow"" the pencil. Obviously enjoying themselves, they are determined to cause mischief. Thus begins a wild chase between friends in which fantasy and reality soon become intertwined in a way that is reminiscent of the Tom and Jerry cartoons that debuted in 1940.The characters may be simple, but the brevity and lack of voice acting make it difficult to develop complex characters. The kitten may be a little naive and the mice are clever. The story tries to give young viewers some moral advice in the context of a funny story. It may be idealistic, but whether idealistic or humorous, straightforward or a bit like chasing rainbows: it fits its time.The visual style bears the signature of Mori, Yasuji, who was already well known as an illustrator of children's books. Inspired by American cartoons (especially Disney), he became a master of his craft and the first to popularise the style of anthropomorphism that would become so famous. Anthropomorphism is the imbuing of animal characters, for example, with human traits, feelings or motives. This style has been used since the early days of Japanese animation. However, Mori-san is still famous for his cute animal characters. On the other hand, the visual implementation is also interesting, both for its experimental mixing of drawing styles and for its animation, which was quite extensive for the time. For example, when the kitten climbs onto the scribbled railway carriages and the waggons deform under the kitten's weight, or when objects rotate in front of the camera. These animations were very time consuming. Another example is a scene animated from the perspective of the pursuer, rather than the classic side view. Unlike the side view, where the camera only had to be moved over a long, static background image, the pursuer's perspective requires the character and his surroundings to be fully animated. Even decades later, this was still considered a visual highlight.The background music was composed by Ito, Senji for the film, so it fits the story well. Just a little thing, but the sound of the tin can dragging a mouse by its tail changes depending on the environmental conditions, e.g. when it runs down the drain.Finally, to answer the question: ""Should I watch this? If you're really interested in how anime has developed over the decades until today, you should. And on the other hand, if you have the time to watch ""Shounen"" with more than 100 episodes, then you should at least take these 12 minutes of your time.Thank you for reading and have fun watching!";Recommended
0;Sailor Senshi Venus♥Five;Saint-Sheepy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saint-Sheepy;1;"WARNING: THIS REVIEW TOUCHES UPON STUFF THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.For my first review of 2018, I shall touch upon Sailor Senshi Venus Five, or Venus 5...good fucking God. This 2 episode hentai OVA by Daiei is a shitty parody/rip-off of Sailor Moon, my favorite anime of all time (though I can recognize it's not perfect), though even on its own this is one of the worst anime I've ever seen, and it comes from Central Park Media, the company infamous for releasing a catalogue of shitty anime. Why, should you wonder? Well, since I'd like to get this over as quick as possible, I'll explain why, though it was really painful to watch.Story (2/10): The plot is basically five girls are summoned by a talking cat (been there, done that) to fight against an evil empire known as the Inma Empire, and they fight for the Goddess Aphrodite. What are the dastardly evil deeds that the Inma plan to do? Turn into the world....into a place for orgies, yes. Believe it or not, that's really all there is for the story, and if you've seen one episode, you've seen the other. They may have some plot points like trying to find the golden statue of Apollo or something but really, the only thing there really is to this is lots of sex and...rape. Is your stomach churning yet? This already sounds like a bad fanfiction from a fetish crazed basement dweller with no way to get a job or make a living.That's a problem I have with hentai stuff and such from what I've glimpsed of the genre: it's just sexual stuff over and over again and they don't add much of plots or anything to garner interest at all. I'm not really a fan of hentai in general with some exceptions (though that exception was more of an adult romantic drama than a porno) but if I had to do one I'd try to have it mostly be story driven with an actual story and tone down the naughtiness, but I digress, the story sucks, moving on.Art/Animation (2/10): The art and animation are piss poor for a 1994 OVA. The art style is very rough looking, proportions are slightly off, the character designs are rip-offs/uninspired copies of the Sailor Moon characters: Venus Pink/Hikari is Usagi/Sailor Moon, Venus Blue/Kiyomi is Ami/Sailor Mercury, Venus Red/Moyu is Rei/Sailor Mars, etc. Aphrodite and the other characters look uninspired and like they were taken from other fantasy anime. The animation, with the exception of the first set of transformations, is stiff, choppy and jerky, relies on speed line backgrounds, and they clearly cut corners when they could considering a lot of the movements don't look believable and clunky, and some action scenes/movement (like the Venus Crash kick) are just a single non-moving cel over speed lines, clearly budget saving costs. The Inma aliens/monsters for most of the villains are poorly designed, truly hideous and look like they were taken from a poorly done bootleg or Go Nagai wannabe anime rather than stuff like this. The backgrounds are noting to write home about, the colors are all washed out and faded the art/animation are just pathetic for an OVA. Sailor Moon S was out the same year as this, was a TV anime, and it looked hundreds of times better than this, along with Shin Cutey Honey, which was also an OVA and was amazingly animated too (plus it didn't rely on the below all the time). Oh My Goddess came out the year before and was spectacular looking too.If you love fanservice/porn, you're gonna LOVE it here. Everywhere there's naked bodies with full detail, nipples and genitals and sex scenes and body fluids galore, nude transformations that are inferior in terms of quality to Sailor Moon's and rip-offs (water/fire forming suits, Hikari getting butterfly wings). However, none of this is attractive looking because most of it just involves schoolgirls and young women getting raped by monsters, even the Venus 5, who are all 18/19(? I'm guessing 18 as 19 year old college students do not wear seifuku uniforms), end up getting stripped against their will, ending up in all sorts of BDSM situations or sexually assaulted. Ugh. I'll admit, I wouldn't mind looking at R34 of say, Urd, Mihoshi Kuramitsu, Kiyone Makibi, or Reiko Mikami, but not if there's stuff like this, the Atari 2600 porn games (minus a certain one) looked more appealing to the eyes.And one of the worst parts is, for a parody anime that's based on Sailor Moon, an anime which had excellent action scenes, there's literally only about 1-2% action in here, all of the fight scenes in both episodes are poorly animated, over in under five minutes total and not very exciting or engaging at all.One other thing about the talking cat Buccha, you're not going to believe it...they gave him naughty bits too, and this leads to a certain thing that I will not mention but will say is a thing common on websites like e621 that whoever finds enjoyable needs to get locked up. The animators clearly had too many fetishes to count.And they also tried to add in some annoying ""pause at the right moments"" thing in between certain scenes (explosions).In conclusion, you may need a bottle of Clorox Bleach when watching this. The only reason I have given it a 2/10 is because after all that, this STILL looks better than Sailor Moon Crystal, but that's not really saying much. At all.Sound (3/10): The voice performances are weak in both the Japanese and English version, no one's voice sounds like they suit the character (mostly with the Venus Five). Junko Asami (Sayako from the Oh My Goddess OVA, and the only recognizable VA here), who seems to be a well known hentai actress, is wasted as Hikari, and doesn't sound like she's into the role, like the other VAs (though I can't blame them). The English dub is like a lot of dubs, particularly hentai ones: cheap, horrible Japanese name pronunciations, stilted, awkward performances, though the actors were given shitty material to work with but entirely laughable and able to give a few chuckles. The music is forgettable and the ending song is mediocre.Character (2/10): I couldn't care about any of the characters here because the anime didn't give me a reason to. Most of them were just parodies/rip-offs of their Sailor Moon counterparts anyways, the only one I almost liked was Aphrodite but she still failed to convince me as likable.Enjoyment (1/10): I couldn't even watch both episodes all the way because I was so disgusted and sick by a lot of the content of what is going on. I am not a feminist, but there is something I will say once, but not again: RAPE IS NOT ATTRACTIVE NOR SEXY. That is the biggest thing that turned me off (and I'm sure a lot of others) of this, stuff like that is Dormcat, the Encyclopedia editor of Anime News Network, was right in what he said, if you're going to do any adult anime like this, like he said, quote, sex should be an enjoyable experience, not meaningless raping. Doing the latter just makes it look immature, childish, tasteless, offensive and repulsive, no matter what the gender, and it makes the director look immature and tasteless. The only people who would probably enjoy this would be repulsive sick in the mentally ill head scumbags who enjoy seeing girls/women get violated by weird crazy ass beasts, and probably wanna touch some women wrongly themselves, go to a shrink to fix your fucked up heads.Not to mention, a lot of the other humor in the show just is not funny at all. I didn't even crack a smile nor giggle at anything I saw, and I'm usually an easy/nervous laugher. And when you've got an unfunny anime that has no likable characters, bad art/animation, nonexistent story, and you're wondering what you're doing with time you'll never get back and wish you would have done something else. While there are horrid anime out there you'd want to finish no matter, what, this is an example of an anime that makes you wish you NEVER saw an anime in your life at all...Overall (1/10): Venus 5 is a dismal, abysmal, unattractive, repulsive, MISERABLE anime. All I'm going to say is, unless you have biastophilia or you need to see anything that parodies or resembles/rips off Sailor Moon, avoid, avoid, and avoid!!Good night, and let's hope I don't have to review any other anime like this...";Not Recommended

0;Usavich Special;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3art pieceStoryWhat a disappointment. From the description down to the actual show. Description mentions it takes place between episodes 2 and 3. Alas, in connections to those episodes to this special there isn't one. Unless, you consider payment. This episode would have been better off marked before or after episode 8. At least with that episode there were more visual matches.Enough banter on what could have been a number typo on wards with the show. At first i was appreciative of the show for it played on the surprise element. After each element made its reveal the conclusion seemed simple. You were shown three choices. Each one was about the same. For each carried a certain 'heavy weight'. Although, it was not dictated it was implied a choice had to be made between the three.Not sure what surprised me more the verdict made by the character or the turnout. Either way it went against most logic one could conceive given the premise. Therefore rather than leaving me amused with the cartoonist comedy i was stuck with confusion.;Not Recommended
0;Aikatsu on Parade! (ONA);cureglitter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cureglitter;7;I wish I could give this a 6.5. But honestly, somehow, this series managed to be more enjoyable than the main On Parade series, so for that reason alone I'm bumping it up to 7.STORY: 6I've seen much more done in three-minute chibi series. There's almost no reason for this to have been a separate, webisode show instead of inserted into the main series. It's on-brand, sure, and easy to follow, sure, and it allows for an otherwise forgotten character to get some screen time, sure, but it's just not all that interesting.CHARACTER: 6.5Raki, thank goodness, takes a slight back seat for this OVA. She's still annoying, she still manages to get better despite putting in near-zero levels of effort, and she still sounds like a whiny toddler. But she's not the only lead, which helps.Noelle/Noeru is her co-lead and is, frankly, a much better character. This season does a great job of building her existing friendships with the other idols, including her sister, despite having a very limited timeframe to do it in.The supporting cast are basically just props at this point, using the same gags we've seen them pull for years. In some ways, this is good, because it allows the other two to shine, but given how often they're on screen, it's sure to bore any long-term Aikatsu fans.ART & SOUND: 7Again, somehow, it's actually better than in the main series. Probably because a lot of it is just being re-used and re-made rather than being entirely new and rushed. It's no masterpiece, by any means, but it's cute and appropriate.;Recommended
0;Aikatsu on Parade! (ONA);Zorheim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zorheim;6;*WARNING: HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD*This season deserved a 6 just for the scene where they showed Noelle's expression after being completely annihilated by Akari. The rest is a complete waste of time and six episodes of pure garbage.Noelle is an useless character and made other idols' efforts a joke, beating them just for the sake of a bad written plot. The only redeeming point of the season is the last song that was actually pretty good, but It wasn't enough to save this insult to the entire Aikatsu saga.I wouldn't recommend this season on my worst enemy and I wish I could unsee It.;Mixed Feelings
0;Kemono to Chat;LovelyTekki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyTekki;5;Kemono to Chat is a 30 minute OVA that's a series of skits surrounding a high school student who can talk to cats. Most of the skits can be sorted into one of three categories: the cats being crass or perverted, someone else thinks the ability to talk to cats is super cool when the protagonist knows it's actually not, or the school president is tsundere.This OVA managed to get an occasional laugh out of me, and I think the school president really stole the show in a lot of cases. I loved the voice acting, wacky animation style that makes great use of limited movements, and the character designs. However, the skits were pretty repetitive all things considered and rarely strayed away from the 3 jokes I mentioned above. It's revealed at one point that Chacha can talk to big cats, not just house cats, and wish that was utilized more.Overall, I would say that it was just ok. Cat lovers may find themselves disappointed if they are expecting a cute OVA, as it's mainly crude humour and chaos. However, if you want to check out more short-form anime and OVA, Kemono to Chat isn't a horrible option either.;Mixed Feelings
0;Makasete Iruka!;ue6o7;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ue6o7;7;"Makasete Iruka wastes no time as it spends its first three minutes showing you the concept of the show rather than explaining it. The Irukaya is a group of three girls who'll help anyone in town who asks for it, so we see each member doing just that, right from the get-go.This is a very tightly written show, with every scene flowing logically to the next one without skipping over anything important or focusing on anything unimportant. It's also quick-witted, making good use of well-timed jokes that sometimes even call back to earlier events. That's a sign that the creators were actually thinking ahead and considering the episode as a whole during the writing process.It's got a quirky attitude, too, so its scenarios aren't exactly typical; you wouldn't normally see grade-schoolers riding jet skis or cleaning chimneys. Director Akitarou Daichi's signature brand of visual comedy is apparent in every scene here, adding extra flavor to all of the characters. While their designs are simple and childish, their animations are fluid and dynamic. It's particularly commendable how the animators accurately portrayed sign language for the deaf character, Ao; her hand-gestured side remarks are adorable and, at times, hilarious.In addition to holding your attention the entire time, Daichi's snappy directing also provides much-needed momentum to the story so that it can successfully reach an actual point by the end of its short run time. Because, underneath its goofy exterior lies an unexpectedly heady theme. It's one about having to go to school and whether or not there's truly any merit in it.Riku, a kid who refuses to attend school on the grounds that nothing taught there has any real world value, thinks his life will be a walk in the park if he joins the Irukaya instead. However, he soon finds out just how easy of a life he's been living up until that point, as it turns out that helping others is a difficult job. He's unable to even keep up with the other girls. The lesson here would presumably just be something like ""Stay in school, kids!"", but that's not so much the case. While it is shown that staying in school is probably a good idea, the show also offers legitimate criticisms of the schooling system and how it won't necessarily teach kids everything they'll need to know when it comes to living in the real world. The real message is one about making the right choices for yourself in your own life and sticking with what makes you happy.Makasete Iruka's concept could've made for a great full-fledged TV series (especially with that super catchy OP; OVAs usually don't even have OPs.), but unfortunately this short 24-minute episode is most likely all we'll ever get. Still, it's an incredibly fun episode that leaves you with something real to think about once it's over which is pretty rare for comedy anime.";Recommended

Some no doubt will go for the answer of 18 or 21 given modern rules on alchol, college and so forth. While there is truth behind it one who who answers younger can be equally right. While it certainly is not the most chosen answer there is truth behind this as well.The three girl characters teach us viewers just that. Structure is not concrete. Much like our height. It molds in time. While most go to school to learn others can learn from the outside life. As long as you have heart your spirit can guide to your path in life. Simply put education doesn't make us who we are life/living does. In the spirit of the show being happy is worth every cent.In the end some viewers might question the policy the girls live by on all jobs in relation to the old man. The girls did provide their own answer for it but it lacked proper identification. Without making the answer to obvious consider by messages on 'cent' and 'freedom'. For a simple show they certainly made me smile at how clever they were.ArtPerfect for the ideal use of comedy and young characters view.Overall: Why would one watch this show? Best answer i can think of is finishing high school. It is around that time most people ask one and another what their future will be. While this show doesn't provide a specific answer it certainly lays down a street-side view textbook to aid you.;Recommended

The frame rate on it is less than if a single animator drew up a anime in one day, and the whole plot is boring with much better (and less toxic) scripts and characters. It makes one feel gross just watching it, but it is so shit quality that you can barely identify the people in it as human, let alone characters. To enjoy this thing (barely even an anime) then you would be better off just pausing it on 2 seconds and getting it done there.

A typical underdog character that works hard to succeed his dreams of meeting a beloved one. The story consists of more on comedy than drama.The art was a little bit shocking. WIKIPEDIA confirmed that this is a shone anime but yet the main character, Makibao , is practically showing his pubes. Maybe the art is designed with naturalsm.The art is depicted with a particular style that is hard to describe. Know shin-chan? Maybe they're related.The sound was okay.The characters blended wall. A protagonist, antagonists, a heroine and supporting characters. This is one of the rarest shows that make the leading role an animal.

0;Grandeek;sorcery;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sorcery;5;"Grundig? The German domestic appliance manufacturer? Ohh! Grandeek, that is right! Glad to see we will not stray too far from the animation topic. You may as well regard this title as a loose portemanteau of Grandiloquent. ""If you reach and seize the hilt... then, you will be able to grasp the suffering etched within the weapon""Lines like these make a fantasy anime's introduction grand-sounding and yet so vacuous. Indeed, Tia, the heroine, does not even need to grab the cursed sword Aihorn (whose name sounds awfully as an Engrish slang for penis, by the way) to casually interact with it, thus making her didactic quest utterly inconsequential. Past this stage, Grandeek does not exactly improve in terms of scripting, unfortunately. In fact, it falls on a trap many entries of the genre are tempted to bask in: endless, boring infodump. They shape most of the exposition through flatly shot conversations instead of evocative visual storytelling. That is what get them to founder, by the end. Which is sad because despite its short length, it is not as if this OAV started completely doomed. Actually, if it balanced accordingly the self initiatory mission of Tia, a basic murder mystery angle and the swashbuckling composition, it could have ended with very agreeable outcome.We have already established that the main protagonist's initial aspiration does not matter. So, how about the murder mystery aspect, you would ask? It can be echoed by this other question: was there even one to begin with? Everyone in the cast (except bounty hunter Luke because he is completely alien to Marcleida) already know fully what is responsible of the predicament the place of action got into. No surface investigation to untangle a thick mystery and involve the spectator with his own speculations.Besides, in Fantasy, spiritual entities are not intrinsically subjected to a well defined set of limitations which could impede their goal and then, giving the intrigue its needed dose of suspense. The object is too sentient, travel freely (in the case of elemental water based Aihorn, pipework wrecking does not accomplish much to keep it from going where it wants), but first and foremost is overpowered (the cursed sword could have flooded the island anytime it wanted, but did not just because it is like a child who enjoys pulling the elytrons off of an insect). Therefore, the odds starts off rigged right away, making for a disengaging progression not amounting to much.The sword scuffles are not going to help the narrative either due to their scarcity, as evidenced by the verbose nature of the script. It is not like the title benefited of the largesse of a high budget anyway, which is reflected by the strictly functional animation. While competent, Toshiko Baba's artistic direction goes for weird experiments, at times... As Luke and his escort leave the artistic sword smith's house, they head right towards a beam of light at the right which turn them into a draft version of themselves. Did they just walk into the Storyboard dimension? Is it a tribute to A-ha's ""Take on me"" clip? A simple wish to figure the sketch-like nature of Luke's memories as he reminisces his situation? The last instance is the most probable, but the flashback is staged in such a mislaid way that it is more intrusive than atmospheric. It is even more so odd that the sequence is voiced with delay, during a fade to black moment.Talking about the sound-design, it could represent another slim saving grace. Yet, it is a trite as it gets. The music barely draw scores in the surface layer of sand before they are washed away by the cortical waves of the viewer... Except Horie Yui, always putting on a commendable effort (even into the anabiosis of a stock character) the rest of the voice cast sounds about as motivated as a contractor who knows that he will sleep for the fifteenth consecutive time in a Mangakissa booth if he does not do the job. Their overall performance is as lifeless as the setting, cruelly lacking in random people going about their urgent errands.Overall, one hauls out of Grandeek with the unpleasant last impression that nothing really mattered. Even the conclusion, involving the duo formation of Tia and Luke, is telegraphed forcefully. As such, it represents a cautionary tale about how to not screenplay epic fantasy. Unless you are interested to check out in which exact regards it fails to deliver, you absolutely have no reason to watch this over a more thrilling entry as ""The Records of Lodoss War"". Do yourself a favor by giving it a wide berth.Praise be unto Sacred Geometry~..| Colophon |..This section is dedicated to content indication in order to inform audience in a practical way. On the next paragraph, the buzzwords offer hints about the title's strong suits and drawbacks.Ketchup meter: Well, it is a fantasy anime whose plot revolves around a vengeful spirit determined to commit an ethnocide. Of course you can expect some violence. Albeit relatively tame, it is definitely present.xXx meter: One has to wonder if Tia prancing around in high cut leotard would not liven up the drowsy narrative. There is none of visual titillation, so the incorrigible 2D pervert will not even find anything to gawk at.Fishing scene(s): None. Which is strange given that the setting is an island... No fisherman in sight, who would volunteer to escort back any illegal immigrants to the mainland.POSITIVE aspects:+ A tentalizing didactic/crime mystery premise, although left to rot in foot+ A competent art direction+ Horie Yui, for the fans of the Seiyuu+ The cute fencing waifu (can you tell how desperate the house is to find positive?)NEGATIVE aspects:- So much to list, so little space.";Mixed Feelings

You follow a girl who speaks to her sword, ends up in a foreign nation, and is looking for swords who also can speak. Okay the swords have sprits or something I don’t know, like I said it just throws you in.Not much else to say on it, no real reason to watch this unless you have read the manga.

0;Doukyuusei 2 (OVA);Startled-Normie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Startled-Normie;7;"[Contains partial spoilers, but nothing serious]Haiku review:The well-known story:Imouto loves onii-chan.They're N. R. B. B.*Longer, prose review:Back in the long-ago days of the last millennium, in the late 1990s, things that we’re accustomed to now were exciting and new. “Doukyuusei 2,” based on the Elf dating simulator game of the same name, was cutting edge or close to it in the fields of ecchi and moe. Though not perfect by modern standards, it is certainly still enjoyable and engrossing. It is a serial harem story, with plenty of nudity, within an entirely different kind of romance comedy-drama. While it shows its age, it benefits from having been produced before so much of anime became formulaic.Which isn’t to say that the tropes common to later anime aren’t present here, in the way that the isekai “The Devil Is a Part-Timer” contains elements that got universally included when the flood of isekai shows came later.We meet Kondou, a typical anime protagonist, being awakened by Yui, who invariably refers to him as “onii-san.” She’s awakening him, so they live in the same house. An adult woman lives there, too, and in the course of things we learn that she is Yui’s mother. It unfolds that Yui’s father and Kondou’s mother have both died, and that Kondou’s father is a Japanese Indiana Jones, off in Africa doing archaeology. The relationship between the two parents is not immediately clear.Kondou and Yui live as brother and sister, which clears the way for Kondou to get involved in a succession of lovely young girls, all of his age. (The show is, of course, centered around a high school.) He is helpful and friendly, sometimes outright heroic, and helps each of these girls in one way or another. This ultimately always ends in sex. (It's not censored, though it is not hentai and no genitals are shown on screen. They are referred to, though, in some jokes that have survived well the years since 1998.) One thing we find in ""Doukyuusei"" that we also unfortunately find in anime since then is that while clothed girls are of different sizes and shape, they’re all the same when naked. So they all are endowed with biganimetiddies.This seems to be the way things will go -- until about episode 8, when things we hoped come to pass. The overarching arc comes close to its end in episode 9. But then we’re given two flashback episodes, making one wonder if the show was suddenly extended from 10 episodes to 12. Those two episodes are fine if a little confusing, and the one-line attempt to explain them at the beginning of the final installment is kind of lame. But that final episode is satisfying.Along the way we’re treated to a series of well-developed (in character as well as otherwise) female leads-of-the-week, and Kondou’s friends: Yoshiki, the fat cliched nerd-photographer who is almost the series narrator; Aritomo, “the snob""; meat-headed muscleman Akira, perhaps Kondou’s best friend; and easy-to-confound gym instructor Tendo. They’re given the development they need to become three-dimensional 2-D parts of the series.The artwork is at least adequate and sometimes beautiful. Like much anime of the era, a single frame may be held through several lines of dialogue, or else lip flaps are all that’s added. But here it’s not as bothersome as it is in some other series. Good choices were made when full animation or close to it was needed. The sound is surprisingly good, as in the final episode when Yui as a tiny girl pads around the school barefoot, though the music is neither intrusive nor memorable.The result is a series that holds up well, with characters the viewer comes to care about and an unambiguous conclusion. One wishes that modern anime were able consistently to do as well.*Not Related By Blood. If you’re an anime fan, you already knew this.";Recommended

The sexualization of the protagonist is ridiculous even for anime standards; rape theme was unnecessary and distasteful. Music and seiyuu don't stand out; artwork is awkward and reminded me of Akira. The actions of the characters are confusing and illogical, though they never stray far from the obvious storyline.Over-simplified characters, generic story and unfunny jokes make this crazy 80s mashup a nightmare to be avoided.";Not Recommended
0;Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai 2nd Season;dlxuniuniu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dlxuniuniu;8;#我是江小白，有话对你说。为了梦想，我们愿意付出多少代价? 我们能彻底忘了过去而指望一个美好未来吗?#I am Jiang Xiao Bai, I have something to tell you.How much are we willing to pay for our dreams? Can we completely forget the past and count on a better future?Don't worry, from now on I will only write in English and not in Chinese.Each of us has words inside that we would like to say but cannot. Each of us has dreams that we want to achieve, but sometimes we cannot. Each of us has a certain person who we love above everything. The anime poses itself with all these questions.The first season definitely has to be watched to understand all the actions that are going on in the second season. It is a continuation of it.STORY & CHARACTERS:The story of our two main protagonists 佟 离 (Tong Li) and 江 小白 (Jiang Xiao Bai) continues. After the end of the first season, where they found each other, everything seems to be great again. But our lovers also meet new and old problems from the past. Can what happened at school back then with the accident of 穆 夕 雨 (Mu Xi Yu) simply be forgotten and looked into a bright future? Even though our protagonists love each other more than anything else in the world, difficult decisions about the future still have to be made. How are their jobs going? Can a good collaboration continue?We also get to know new characters and their touching background stories. These also had to go through a hard time in their life. All of these questions and many more will be answered here in the second season.ART:I am a big fan of the Chinese anime industry because I can understand everything without subtitles. But the animation here clearly shows that it cannot keep up with the Japanese production. It is the most flawed thing. There are still too many problems, which creates the feeling that it is not completely fluid.SOUND:Beautiful, touching, brilliant. I have to be honest on this point and say that the songs are only super to listen if you can understand Chinese. The music itself is very too, but without understanding the text I can hardly imagine that it will have a big impact. In Chinese music, the lyrics are always of great importance and you have to understand their true meaning here too.ENJOYMENT:In comparison to the first season weaker, the story is no longer so creative and exciting. Still, I really liked the anime. Not only I did see a good continuation from the first part and enjoyed great music, I also learned something about the city Chongqing 重庆. I personally have never been to the 30 million people city, but I would love to go on a trip there. You should not expect it to look as empty as in the anime. Free places on the train? There is practically no such thing in China. So if someone is going to visit China, many, many, many people are there.All in all, I had a lot of fun watching the sequel. It can't keep up with the first season, but it's a very good work. The only (and very much) thing that bothers me is the art and it's style.The anime has still not been translated with eng sub and it probably won't come, which is a shame. It would have been nice if not only Chinese could enjoy the sequel.A third season is also confirmed. The original date of Fall 2019 could not be met, but the start of the third season is planned for May 2020. I am very excited about it!I know that this review will probably be rarely read here, but I decided to write something about it because it is a great anime overall.If you have any questions about this anime (production, songs etc) or general Chinese stuff, please feel free to ask me!;Recommended
0;Saga-ken wo Meguru Animation;Tetsu-nii;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tetsu-nii;7;"The poster images and PVs for these ""movies"" caught my attention even though I wasn't able to find out much during my initial search. Recently (as in two days prior to me typing this), chasing the UToob link for the PV turned up two long-ish video segments in the ""Play Next"" column on the page. Curious, I chased those links… and was able to watch both ""episodes""/""movies""/""short films"". As in both full short movies are available, with English subtitles. Just do a search for ""SagaKouhouMovie"" and check the ""Videos"" tab. You can find them at the bottom of the page.Watching one made me want to watch the next. And then I wondered if that was all. Not necessarily in a Bad Way. And not to imply I found either unsatisfying or a waste of my time. So I did some more digging online.If, like me, you're wondering if those two ""shorts"", neither more than 15 minutes, constitute the absolute entirety of ""Sagaken wo Meguru Animation"", the answer seems to be: ""Yep. 'Fraid so.""Taken as a pair of promotional videos for a prefecture in Northwest Kyushu, these struck me as absolutely amazing.Taken as a pair of animé shorts in general, they were… adequate. And definitely better than some things I've made myself sit through. (Definitely not ""Totoro"" or ""Kiki"", but what is…?)Art, animation, and sound are all definitely at least as good as I've seen lately from broadcast animé, if not quite up to the standard I expect for big-budget, full-length features.But let's get to the important aspects: Story and Characters.Story:Both shorts do a good job of featuring a distinctive aspect of the part of Saga Prefecture they're set in, but not in an overly intrusive way. They do provide a foundation the characters are built upon, though, so in that respect the pottery of Arita in one and… what I'm guessing is a famous camphor tree in Takeo play fairly significant roles in shaping the plots and characters both. Although, to be honest, the tree was notable but not nearly as important a part of the story as the pottery in the other. (They even used the name of an actual, famous pottery company.)Characters:While ten to twelve minutes isn't much time to get a good idea of how well characters are written, and certainly not enough time for much of an arc, there was a bit of crossover between the two that I thought added a tiny bit more depth to the heroines of each piece. For the heroes of both, the writer(s?) seemed to be going for quiet strength and determination. Which is fine, I guess, but left me thinking ""Again?"" But the heroines were cute and offered some minor complexity. Especially in their interactions with the supporting characters.Overall, I did enjoy watching both and wouldn't hesitate to watch them again.";Recommended
0;Tenkuu Senki Shurato: Sousei e no Anto;Shura-shurato;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shura-shurato;7;An ok sequel to the original t.v serie´s , not too special i guess but the ova´s miss some things, The good late 80´s adventurous soundtracks, more attention to additional chara., power development , and the VERY FLASHY fights although some of it come´s back at times. The animation is bit improved unlike the t.v show and more colorful as well the armor they are wearing, but the violent stuff and the dark setting is really toned down wich gave me the feeling that the story is somewhat rushed and should put in more potential, especially the dark storysetting. Characters are alright but have been put in a lighter role for the time being until the end of the ova´s! overall it could do way better for my likings, but its a nice atribution to my collection!;Recommended

I recommend anyone who want to see the masterpiece Kindaichi is to watch this episode.It tells of a case that happen in Akechi's past. I always remember this case as it goes beyond a good case,The OST that plays was on spot as Akechi says to Kobayashi before anything or anyone else, he is Akechi Kengo.His morality of justice that was paired with the OST moves me so much. Return justice by going after the enablers.Akechi helped the bookstore lady and the delinquent when nothing would be done, the two people that needed help and justice. It was really sweet,Akechi sees to it that the delinquent understands what he's done and brings him to the bookstore lady. The delinquent cries to make it up to her.I love the bookstore lady who was owed the justice finally gets it, an admission of wrong and for forgiveness from the delinquent and she accepts to work with him to rebuild the store together.It was so nice to see justice come out of this for everyone, I would like to see the bookstore lady and delinquent's smiles together.Akechi's last line on Kindaichi was good ending!;Recommended
0;Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours: Tabi no Hajimari;aaeiou12123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/aaeiou12123;7;I've watched all UtaPri has to offer, and I must say, this is one of the best stuff they've put out in a while.I'd say its best attribute is the fact that Nanami, who is usually the (mild) protagonist in all of the installments, is not there. While that means there is no character to insert oneself in, which might be a big appeal to part of the audience, it also gives a lot of freedom to the STARISH cast. With Nanami being removed from the equation, you see them interact naturally, not being forced to say each (1) line to Nanami, in every scene, in every converasation. Their interactions are cute and if you like the characters, I think you'll enjoy to see their group dynamics unfold.So in summary, if you enjoy the more romantic aspect of UtaPri, I'd say you can pass on this one. It provides a bit of context for the following movie, but I don't think it's vital. On the other hand, if you enjoy the STARISH cast by themselves, I'd say you can give it a try.;Recommended
0;Koi Tsubomi;tsukiko_prpr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tsukiko_prpr;9;"This is my first review, but please bear with me.STORY: 8/10Koi Tsubomi is an animated short that is essentially aimed at a younger audience much like the other Minna no Uta shorts. However, this one in particular utilizes the song ""Koi Tsubomi"" by Oku Hanako, and much like the other Minna no Uta shorts, it focuses on telling the story without too much depth. It's pretty straightforward, and it's about a young girl and a polar bear whom become separated, and their emotional attachment to one another. This short focuses on the thoughts of having to leave a loved one, and although it might be odd to see a child and a polar bear missing each other, the lyrics of the song combined with the overall art style really made this short stick out above some of the other shorts. Personally, I didn't think the story was too deep, and it didn't make me think, but considering that this short is aimed at a younger audience, I think this short did a phenomenal job at explaining the emotions or struggles of leaving another person dear to you.ART: 8/10The art was very cute, and definitely attractive to people of all ages, but it was by no means something that can be thought of as first-class art. That having been said, there are scenes such as the polar bear's growling while shivering due to what I would expect to be sadness, and just the tiny details like those that make this short animation more appealing to the eyes.SOUND: 10/10I'm a fan of Oku Hanako, so that might have something to due with my attachment to the song, but putting my bias aside, the lyrics are extremely deep. There aren't any sound effects since it's essentially just a music video, but the lyrics are what make this song that much more interesting. The words are extremely straightforward much like the art of the video, and Oku Hanako's voice fit extremely well with the mood as well.CHARACTER: 10/10Although you can't normally see that much character development within music videos or animated shorts, this one was different. People might disagree with me when I say that this had an interesting character development, but that's honestly what I personally think. Why? Because within the short amount of time, you could see the characters' attachment to one another, and how both the girl and the polar bear go from hiding their sadness from one another to outright showing their longing for the other later on in the video. Also, although the lyrics speak about ""love"", the animators decided to use a young girl and a bear, and that alone is already quite unique for what you'd call conventional ""love"". The polar bear displayed emotions that normal animals would not show, and that alone makes this an interesting watch.ENJOYMENT: 9/10As you might be able to guess by now, I absolutely loved this particular animated short. I've watched many different Minna no Uta shorts, and other animated shorts as well, but this one in particular made me almost tear up because the combination between the music and the characters, as well as the manner the art was utilized was absolutely phenomenal. If people are to get into animated shorts, this is definitely a must-watch.OVERALL: 9/10The only reason I would not give this a 10/10 is because of multiple things--mainly, the story and the art could definitely be more detailed. That having been said, this is a stunning animated short, and the song is endearing as well. I can watch this over and over and still not get tired of it! I recommend this to people whom are interested in animated shorts overall.";Recommended

It wasn't until the end that i put two and two together. We all take journeys in our life. Events that can leave an impacting stand on, mainly vacations. My take on the message is while you can't live where you want to at the precise moment having been there at least you have memories. As long as you hold onto that sacred bond it will be as if you never left. A true romance and uplifting piece that is told in a somewhat sad tone.Art'bears'(inside joke) a strong resemblance to anime Gambo. Was that intentional or intentional? I will leave to you. Regardless of the verdict art portrayed the right picture. Two different worlds were shown. One world was sunny while the other was cold. One had a big creature, the other a small human. Yet, the connection felt so close to each other.On a different note. I really enjoyed the Japanese subtitles for the lyrics. Not only could one see the words being sung but with the use of a beat note(a guide arrow) made singing along kind of fun.;Mixed Feelings

0;Dokushin Apartment Dokudami-sou;VintageHentai;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VintageHentai;10;I can't believe that this anime hasn't received any reviews yet! This is Ecchi done right! No pointless pantyshots, no questionable breast physics and no feebleprotagonist. This is one of the most mature ecchi anime that I've ever watched and possibly the most underrated anime of all time.Story (8)- A simple yet absorbing story. We follow Hori Yoshio, a working class pervert, as he falls into bizarre situations with beautiful women. The first episode wasn't really worth noting but the final 2 were what made the anime.Characters (10)- What I found most attractive about this anime was the realistic cast of characters. We have Yoshio, a sexually frustrated loner who surprisingly knows how to be normal around women (despite his sex-less life). Though Yoshio's behaviour may be deemed as questionable at times, he still shows a lot of his empathetic side. The women in this anime are well crafted individuals with little to no cliche attributes.Art (10)- For an Anime from the late 80s, the anime carries itself well and is arguably better than contemporary anime. The art is really detailed and gives its characters a natural look. The women are well drawn and are given amazing bodies (them legs).Overall Enjoyment (10)- I never found myself getting bored during the short watch (except from some parts in the first episode lol) and I sincerely hope that this anime reaches a larger audience.;Recommended

0;Hon Ran;GrumpyGumpy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GrumpyGumpy;5;One of the more bizarre OVAs to come out of the 1990s Crimson Wolf may at first glance be more of your standard throwaway nonsense to come out of this era however there is a little bit more to it than that.The plot as one would expect is a contrived blend of mysticism, martial arts and gangsters though looking beyond the superficial silliness there is a deeper underlying political and philosophical message to the whole tale which is actually a fairly delightful layer of depth to the hour or so of your life you may feel you’ve just wasted. Throw in the obligatory cringe worthy sex scenes and you know you’ve got vintage OVA on your hands.The artwork has definitely not aged well and it is hard to escape the feeling that this is pulp produced anime, the soundtrack similarly is your standard mix of synths and orientalism which doesn’t really either add to or detract from the whole experience. Even for someone like me who is a bit of an aficionado for this type of less well known 90s OVA I can’t really describe either as a selling point. The English Dub is laughably bad as one would expect, for some this is simply part of the charm of this era of anime but if you’re actually wanting to watch this in any way aside from as a curiosity then I’d definitely recommend the subbed version if you can find one.In summary this is definitely an OVA for someone who’s interested in watching the more obscure end of the spectrum perhaps even just for that reason. There is definitely something in this however unless you’re really willing to just go with the flow the lacklustre artwork, plot and soundtrack make this something not worth the time to find.;Mixed Feelings
1;Hon Ran;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;6;Rate a 6English dubbedOkay! Is a good sum-up reaction to my stand on the show. A good mixture of Indiana Jones and Charmed(American television show). As the movie progresses i don't think you will find the movie to be easily to anticipate. Which opens a lot of room to surprise and excitement. On some occasions when a movie becomes unpredictable the writer uses easy(cheeky) explanations with the audience. Throwing the general idea of magic, illusion or dream to explain the unexplained. Here when you are surprised you become educated. While the education i can't be certain is 100 percent certain it is at least phrased in a convincing manner. Such example would be the plane scene. Not only does the writer/director keep you interest with curiosity there are a couple moments of misdirection. Perfect if watching with family or friends or playing a bet. Don't you just hate it when someone states out loud what they think to be true only to shortly find out it does. Hate those moments. Probably why i tend to watch movies solo. As for the ending i suppose it is okay. While a true end is not finished it ends in a psychological manner which is good. A true end is where the bad guy loses or wins and the other side moves on. But with a psychological stand for an ending it provokes thoughts and questions. Which in terms opens the possibility for a later on sequel.If i were to state one drawback the movie didn't fully cover each character. It stuck with the ones the audience would care for and said screw it to the rest. Even with one character being just as vital in the show as the main couple.;Mixed Feelings
0;Stairs: Houkago no Album;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;7;"If you're one of the very few who watch hentai for the story then congratulations, ""Stairs: Houkago no Album"" is the hentai for you. For a 30 min. 1 Episode OVA you get a coming of age, love-triangle, melodrama that involves some sex and perhaps little unrequited love. On the other hand, if your looking for ""something to get a good wrist work out to"", Stairs may come as a disappointment.I'll admit, I first decided to pick up this title because of the cover art. It looked good and the fact that it was uncensored was a bonus. I was curious as to what it had to offer. But I felt cheated when I skimmed through it, as I sometimes do when watching hentai, to find that the content was nowhere near as good looking as the cover. The art was so-so, the animation was rather poor, and there wasn't a whole lot of sex scenes. However, seeming how difficult it was to located this obscure title, I decide to give it a try anyways. In many ways I was glad.The story of ""Stairs: Houkago no Album"" is, perhaps, a glimpse back into the past when love was fresh, innocent, and intense. It's a love triangle, a story about not realizing what you've had until you've lost it, and about unrequited love. I'm reminded of that old song by Glenn Frey - The One You Love:""Are gonna stay with the one who loves you? Or are you going back to the one you love? Someone's gonna cry when they know they lost you. Someone's gonna thank the stars above..."" It probably would have made a great ED.The characters were true to life and not some fantasy MOE blob (not that I have anything against fantasy MOE blobs or anything). True characters with real feelings but sometimes not so true to their own feelings. Did that make sense? Well, to be honest, 30mins wasn't enough to portray a story with such depth and character, but the producers were able to wrap it up by the end of the episode. Although it was a bit unsatisfying, I have to say that the story of Stairs was really what brought me through the show. I would have given this title a ""10"" if it weren't for such poor art and animation.Anyways. Bottom line: Great story. Good characters. Poor art and animation. Wished it were longer.";Recommended
0;Stairs: Houkago no Album;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;6;"Overview:Since the mods removed my review of the astoundingly bad hentai Aki Sora (I'll reupload it later), I'll just review another piece of smut. This is the utterly mystifying hentai known only...as Stairs. Why is called that? I have no idea.Background:It's not a secret that I love to write comedy reviews of terrible anime. I've always wanted to be MAl's version of The Cinema Snob or Bennett the Sage. This means that I've sat through some of the worst hentai to ever exist in order to write snarky reviews, which maybe 15 people are ever going to read. Stairs is utterly unlike any hentai I've ever seen before. There is no tentacle rape. There isn't ANY rape. There is no bestiality. Our ""hero"" doesn't sell women into slavery. It's just a high school romance with likeable characters and actually has surprisingly decent writing. This could have been an above average drama/romance anime and for some reason they threw in a few sex scenes and made it a hentai. WHY?! Was it a last minute move to salvage a scrapped project? Even more mysteriously, this king of all hentai has only 1 episode. Consider that Boku no Sexual Harrassment had 4 episodes! The superhero spoof Rapeman had 4-5 episodes. The furry yiffing incest hentai Wordsworth had 5 fucking episodes. This is the only time in my life that a hentai ended and I actually wanted to see what happened next...and it gets just 1 episode. Life's a bitch.Plot:There is actually a plot besides people fucking! A highschool student named Makoto is deeply in love with his childhood friend, but has never had the courage to tell her how she feels. One day, she starts going out with an older guy who dropped out of medical school. As an aside, I found this amusing since that happens to be my own background. Finally Makoto is upset enough to confront his childhood friend and tell her how he feels. However, she says she never knew how he felt and now it is too late. She becomes pregnant and drops out of highschool to be with her new boyfriend, who I'll just name ""Dr. Cocks"". Clearly we all know where this is going. Dr. Cocks is going to abandon her for getting pregnant and our hero is going to beat up Cocks (or try to) and convince her to go back to school while agreeing to take care of the baby. We're going to see a hentai version of Last American Virgin/Lemon Popsicle. Only that's NOT what happens! Instead, it throws a massive curve ball and Dr. Cocks is actually a decent guy! He is overjoyed that she is pregnant and gets a working class job to support his new wife and child! Makoto instead winds up with his crush's girlfriend who has always had feelings for him and never had the courage to say anything. They have sex for the first time, which is awkward and frustrating, but she gently guides him though it in a surprisingly touching scene. Realism in a hentai?! What even ARE you Stairs!? Makoto ends up with the friend and never gets back together with the childhood crush. The hentai ends completely subverting ALL of the audience expectations.Art and sound:I am not able to find what studio produced this. I can't find a single Japanese voice actor listed for this on any site. I can't find who wrote or directed this. Everything about this hentai is a complete and total mystery. I can say more about the Aurora spy plane than I can about the production of Stairs. The animation is pretty damn bad, but that's not surprising considering this is a low budget hentai from 2001. The soundtrack is also nothing great.Overall:Stairs is a hentai that's actually...kind of good. I thought that was an impossible contradiction like a man who is shorter than himself, but here it is. Everything about this 1 episode mystery show goes against expectations. Somebody out there actually made a decent hentai and the world will never know his or her name. Thank you mysterious hentai emperor!";Mixed Feelings
0;Stairs: Houkago no Album;Yalaa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yalaa;3;"Not worth it.Despite the poor animation, bland art style and characters and the same music track being used over And over in a 30 minute ova, Stairs has a somewhat decent plot, for a low budget hentai of course.Horny student Makoto is secretly in love with Une but she already has a boyfriend which Makoto doesn't know about. Une views Makoto as her beta male orbitor who is always around to listen to her problems and cheer her up whenever she needs. She obviously knows that Makoto is into her but she just wants him to listen about her issues. This is the only aspect that makes Makoto a relatable character because guys go through this almost all the time, virgin best friend vs the Chad boyfriend.But that is pretty much the only thing that makes Makoto likeable, he's incredibly boring and doesn't ever do anything about his ""problem"". Nonoka is Makoto's class mate who secretly has a crush on him and knows that he's in love with someone else but she tries to cheer him up anyway. Nonoka is your typical cute and innocent anime girl you root for and you know that she deserves way better than Makoto, but that is what forms this love triangle. Honestly, its what kept me around watching the whole thing after wanting to drop it after maybe 5 to 10 minutes, it's honestly that freaking boring to watch.Then there's Une's boyfriend who adds absolutely nothing to the story other than just to f.ck the shit out of Une, the hentai scenes aren't good by the way. Ironically, this guy is actually even more nerdy than Makoto yet Makoto is the loser of the story lol. The ending is also incredibly dumb and wasted potential. The story starts to up it's pacing so you'd think Makoto would learn a lesson and act like a guy after all of this but Nope, sudden hentai scene kicks in which was totally unnecessary and ruined the whole thing, at least the ending theme is nice.Stairs, I've no idea why it's called that btw, could've been better if it had more than 1 episode.

I don't know what his drug of choice might have been, but judging by all the ""cloud"" imagery and the events of episode 2, I'm guessing it was something you smoke.ANYWAY, 3tsu no Kumo is basically the most bizarre thing I've seen since The Apple Incident (which, by the way, I'd recommend to anyone who likes this kind of surreal, trippy-as-balls animation). The page here says it's 3 episodes at 12 minutes each, but it's actually 3 episodes that add up to a TOTAL of 12 minutes.The story is...uh...bizarre. I don't want to even talk about it, because not only does it make absolutely zero sense anyway, but anything I could really say would spoil the fun of sitting, watching, and saying to yourself, ""what the damn hell is going on?"" ...I gave it a 2, because even though it was probably ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT to Tsuji when he thought it up, I refuse to believe that anybody else can make any real sense of it.The art rocks holes. Like, I've never seen anything like it. Every scene is drawn on the same piece of paper with what looks like a charcoal pencil, erasing each previous frame and drawing the next on the same page. The eraser marks leave an obvious and really cool ghost trail thing behind. I really like unique and interesting art in my anime, especially in shorts like this. I give it a 9.The sound is...odd. Not quite as odd as in The Apple Incident (yeah, making that comparison again), but odd. But then, so is the animation, and so is the whole package, so it works well. And the third episode actually has what I can consider *music*, and it's pretty nice. No real memorable tunes or anything, but it definitely fits the anime. 8 points.The characters are...clouds, and nameless school students, mostly. Nobody ever talks, there's no development, and none of them have any kind of personality to speak of. 2 points, one for each eye on that freaky cloud from episode 2.As for my own enjoyment, I was skeptical at first, but things got weird soon enough, and I like weird. I was making the O.o face basically the entire time, starting at about 2:20 when the first giant cloud boner showed up, but it was a good O.o face. 7 for enjoyment.2 + 9 + 8 + 2 + 7 = 28, 28/5 = 5.6 =~ 6. 6/10 overall. Better than average. I'd recommend checking it out to anyone who appreciates the unique and...weird.";Mixed Feelings
1;3-tsu no Kumo;Ushiojiru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ushiojiru;6;"My friend (she's an art major) told me about this movie a few months ago. She really liked it a lot, but she tends to lean towards weird, surreal, and experimental movies like this. I'm not normally interested; I typically like movies to have a plot and character development. For that reason, I held off on watching it for those few months.I finally decided to watch this movie before bed. Since it was so short, I figured it would be perfect. And, to be honest, it was. This movie has no real plot or anything, it's just three 3-4 minute shorts. Each short is a different, unrelated work of art with the central theme of clouds (obviously). Wordless and abstract, these movies require very little thinking about characters, stories, plots, or anything really. There is a concept to each little episode so it's not completely abstract to the point where it's absolutely nonsensical (but it gets close). The first episode is like looking up at the clouds and imagining shapes in them (only in this movie these shapes get a little sexually explicit). The second and third episodes have actual human-characters and a little more of a plot to them, but still very abstract and surreal. Basically, as I stated earlier, it's a nice thoughtless movie perfect to watch before bed.What made this movie most interesting and very unique was the art. Each scene is drawn on one piece of paper using charcoal. Watching the eraser marks in each frame makes for a very interesting visual effect as it leaves a ghost-like trail of the previous frame. It's by no means a high-quality production, and the lighting could be a little better, but overall the sheer unique-ness of this style made me decide on an ""8"" in this category. I can see why my artsy friend enjoyed this a lot.The music is rather minimalistic and bizarre for the most part. Weird and simple synthesizer sounds put through delay and echo filters add to the surreal quality of the first episode. In the last half of episode 2 and most of 3, simple piano music (reminiscent of maybe Bach or Mozart) gives it an uplifting feel that I enjoyed quite a bit. As with the art, it's not the best quality stuff out there. Yet, it still did the job.Did I enjoy it? Yes, for the most part. It's not a movie I'd recommend watching if you're looking for something psychological, emotional, or story-driven. It's not a movie I'd watch with family or kids (well, at least the sexual images in the first episode). It's not a movie I'd invite a bunch of friends over to watch with (unless your friends like psychedelics- then it may be pretty entertaining). It's a move that's perfect to watch before bed- relaxing and thoughtless. The surreal, dreamlike quality of the art and music helped me forget about my stressful day and allowed me to fall asleep easily.I give this movie a 6. The 4 points were deducted mostly due to the poor-quality production and the fact that it's not a very easily-accessible movie. The duration was perfect, as I would not really want to watch anymore than 12 minutes of this anyway. It's a great before-bedtime movie and it's great if you're into experimental, weird, surreal, simple, abstract, and trippy movies. If you're not, then I'd stay away from this movie (you'll never get those 12 minutes back). Otherwise, give it a shot- just don't expect anything mind-blowing or life changing.";Mixed Feelings

A good intro shows and describes the main character and what is goal will be.-conclusion was a disappointment and mystifying. In the middle of the movie there is a mini battle of sorts. That requires a godly act to end it. Fast forwarding we end with a vast amount of soldiers and an act that isn't got like ends it. Maybe it wouldn't have been so depressing and down putting if there wasn't a meeting held to discuss what actions to take. For in the meeting it was made clear that although there were multiple ways in going about it none seemed to be the best.-The message behind the story was kind. Went with the idea that never give up hope no matter how big the problem is.ArtThis was a mess. While at some points i can agree the change in art style was appreciated for it provided a meaningful flair. Although, the constant jumps in later art styles was not only pointless but confusing. You had stills, then black and white, color, lack of color, old style cartoon and so forth.SoundWhile there was good background music that matched the tempo of the story the animation could have benefited from sound effects.Character-moderate in depth in background- normally i find when a story portrays a certain character from the rest i expect to see that character progress until the end. Instead it was as if the main character died.EnjoymentThis is like a Disney film based on a pro nature perspective.

0;Kyouryuu Shoujo Gauko;LovelyTekki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LovelyTekki;6;Dino Girl Gauko is a series of shorts revolving around a hot-headed girl named Naoko, who will turn into a mean and violent dinosaur girl, Gauko, if pushed to her limit. It is a decent setup that leads to some great comedy, and even some surprisingly touching moments.Don't expect any sort of complex story from these. They are just short little slice of life stories with very little continuity. However, I was sort of annoyed when certain episodes didn't actually reach a resolution, such as when Naoko starts to feel self conscious about eating too many snacks. The episode just sort of ends with the characters laughing it off, and her insecurity about the problem is never addressed. Other episodes, such as the one where Naoko and her mother seem suspicious about Naoko's father, were surprisingly emotional. Overall this series is all over the map in terms of tone.First of all, the artstyle is simple but adorable. It sort of reminds me of Shin-Chan's aesthetic, but also shares OK K.O.!'s style of universe where characters can be humans, moles, fairies, comets, or anything in between. The character designs are simplistic, but each character stands out and brings a lot of style and charm to the show.The characters are really varied in terms of likability as well. Some characters come off as overly cruel, which is a bit annoying, only to be perfectly fine in another episode. In particular I didn't like when characters tried to pressure Naoko until she became Gauko, since it felt manipulative and mean.Overall, I would say that the shorts are fun and cute enough to be worth a look. Each episode is 9 minutes in length, so a binge is very easy. However, you get the idea of the show fairly quickly, so if you don't really like the first few shorts, you'll probably not like the others.;Mixed Feelings
0;Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage” is a shoujo horror that has an intriguing premise, but unfortunately the execution is lacking.This 3-episode OVA based on the manga of the same name centers on twin sisters Ruka and Rumi who both have a crush on the same guy named Katsuyuki. The twins get infected with a mysterious substance from an old burial site that imbues them with powerful psychic abilities whose strength seems to be tied to moon cycles. The infection also causes Rumi to undergo a dramatic personality change, and she becomes ruthless in attempts to kill Ruka so she can have Katsuyuki for herself. Meanwhile, Katsuyuki has confessed his love for Ruka, and is adamant that he wants to be with her and not Rumi. As Rumi infects just about everyone around them and turns them in to virtual zombies bent on capturing Katsuyuki and killing Ruka, can the two protagonists escape her wrath?The beginning of the OVA is promising, but the plot starts to derail quickly as it rides on the protagonists making mind-bogglingly stupid decisions to progress. For instance, after Ruka finds out that her sister killed a classmate, and her sister just attempted to murder her, she acts like it’s a minor inconvenience. She keeps going to school (that her sister also attends) and living at home (where her sister also lives) like everything’s normal. And her would-be boyfriend encourages her to do this. This kind of thing happens repeatedly, to predictable results. They also try to bring Rumi to the doctor so the sisters can be examined, and the doctor proclaims that they’re infected with a bacteria “that may be a virus.” In addition, there’s talk comparing what happened to them to Tutankhamen’s curse, etc. There are inconsistencies in the writing at some points as well.As this OVA is basically made for fans of the manga, it’s incomplete, and ends abruptly. There’s no conclusion, and the characters are barely developed, if at all.Speaking of the characters, Ruka doesn’t have much of a personality; she’s just super gullible and weak. Rumi’s personality is essentially that she’s evil and jealous of her sister. Katsuyuki is really pushy in is insistence on pursuing a relationship with Ruka, to the point that he forces himself on her a couple of times. All other characters are one-dimensional, if even that.As far as technical aspects go, the animation is serviceable, but it’s not that good. The character designs are okay, but not distinctive; they look like the kind of designs you'd find in any other shoujo work. There are some good voice actors in this OVA, but their performances are just average. The ending is just a slideshow of manga images set to a cheap-sounding instrumental track that doesn’t really fit the series. The opening is another generic instrumental piece, and the background music is bland.Regarding objectionable content, there are several graphic and bloody murders, and a couple of attempted rape scenes. There’s also a little bit of stylized nudity during the opening sequence.Overall, in addition to poor technical aspects, “Umi no Yami, Tsuki no Kage” is filled with lots of dumb decisions, bad dialogue, inconsistent writing, characters not acting realistically, and an abrupt ending. While the premise is promising, it’s explored poorly here, and there are anime that do what this OVA was trying to do much better (see the recommendations). I wouldn’t recommend watching this unless you’re absolutely starved for shoujo horror content, or you’re a fan of the original manga.";Not Recommended

It doesn't know which way to go, randomly throws in new elements where they are not needed and tries way too hard to push some kind of message about budhissm, which it later completely invalidates from the sheer absurdism it creates. At some point there are some scenes with the worst CG i've seen in a long time, for some reason it was even worse than initial d: first stage's CG.

This time came to Every day Sunday. Sweet romance, plus an atypical protagonist who is so massive but not fat. I like the heroine, who is not shy about expressing feelings almost and dreams of the hero, like a good girl in love. A lot of comedy and I really laughed at some of the moments. The only thing is, I didn't really like Mi-chan's character, but over time I got used to her too. I looked at sheep in two days, and if I had looked at it 5 years ago, I would have rated it at the highest point and would have rushed with it, but now I still saw a lot of good things without it and rated it lower. This is a great comedic romance, but I missed the point at the end, I would like more stories about heroes. But still, I liked it!;Recommended
0;Transfer;-cream-;https://myanimelist.net/profile/-cream-;8;story: the premise of this video is to show the efforts of a high school girl as she rushes to get to school on time, with increasingly wacky obstacles coming to obstruct her. pretty simple concept executed in a really interesting way.art: the art is what really won me over here. there's a vast array of different animate ion techniques being used to paint the background imagery as she runs to school. to be fair, it seems that the entire budget was poured into the background artwork as the main girl has only 1 walk cycle that is repeated over and over again, but it is a pretty entertaining and well animated one. you don't even notice it the first few times it comes around, but by the fourth time, it becomes pretty clear that the studio spent all their money on the different landscapes she runs through. still a pretty fun to watch.sound: comes down completely to personal preference. I liked the song.character: despite the huge obstacle of having only 1 movement animation cycled over and over again, there's a surprising amount of character imbued in each frame. more in just 6 minute video than a lot of full on shows manage to convey over twelve 22 minute episodes. for that alone, i give it a 10.enjoyment: once again, comes down to taste. if you like more narrative driven music videos with hard hitting emotions and a deep message, this isn't really for you.

0;Majuu Senshi Luna Varga;Skadi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Skadi;6;"Japan has contributed a number of iconic characters to the world's pop culture. Perhaps the most famous being the monster Godzilla, who I would challenge anyone over the age of 10 to tell me that they haven’t heard of. Majuu Senshi Luna Varga combines their love of giant monsters and fan service by putting a naked girl on its head. Wuh?Varga's story begins with the small nation of Rimbell being invaded by the Dunbas Empire. Seriously where do they come up with these names? I kept wanting to refer to it as Dumbass. The Rimbell forces are being lead by tomboyish Princess Luna who leads a losing fight against overwhelmingly superior numbers. Just when all hope is lost, Luna discovers a secret hidden beneath the castle and unleashes the legendary demon monster Varga. But there is a catch, Varga can only been controlled by having someone act as ""the brain"", controlling the monster from rampaging freely on the world. Luna becomes Varga's brain, which involves having her sit naked on the top of his head with her ass stuck to it. She crushes the attacking army; forcing them to retreat but not before her younger sister is kidnapped and taken back to Dunbas.Mostly the story is played for laughs and a lot of it is pretty amusing. The plot is not exceptionally deep and is full of holes and inconsistencies. Much of the beginning of the story revolves around stripping Luna of her clothes and embarrassing her with the lizard tail she has grown when in her human form. Varga looks and fights like a Godzilla rip-off, which is what this series kind of feels like. Each episode, Varga fights with other giant monsters until the climatic fight. Though I found the action for the most part pretty good and entertaining.Luna is pretty fun as a heroine. I enjoyed her character even though there is nothing exceptional about her. There is very little development on any of the cast as the story mainly revolves around action. The most memorable of the supporting cast would be the Dunbas soldier Bato, who is constantly chasing after Luna trying to fight her and calling her a wench.Artistically, I did like the character designs for the most part but the backgrounds were a bit plain and ordinary. Also Varga himself like I said looks like a Godzilla knockoff. Still the action is animated well and it was fun to look at. The musical soundtrack is very dated and both the theme songs are pretty silly. The voice acting is good though, particularly for Luna and Bato.Majuu Senshi Luna Varga overall is a fun show with a lot of action and a few laughs. It’s not a great show but it isn’t bad either. If you liked Godzilla movies as I did as a kid then you might want to give this series a look.";Mixed Feelings

0;Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono;nikolas_dmx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nikolas_dmx;10;Dedicated to probably the most famous character of SNK’s action fighting game Samurai Shodown, Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara Okurimono is in my opinion, an unfinished masterpiece. Based on the action visual novel of the same name, this spin off was supposed to capture a time gap, starting before the events of the first Samurai Shodown game, right until the end of Samurai Shodown II. Unfortunately the show got canceled due lack of financing and ended up with only a single episode released. Of course if you are interested, you can always check out the visual novel, but your Japanese language skills must be good, since the game has not been released out of Japan.The expression that will probably fit best for this show’s story will be “what a loss”. The single episode still manages to give us enough hints about the potential of this anime. And it strikes me as pretty decent - a well build up story, standing on series issues like person’s inner conflict, personal fights and desires, about all the rules we must obey. It really brings this rare debt we see so little of. Perhaps this show was made a bit too personal, excluding many of the other Samurai Shodown characters and a bit too shoujou, but the atmosphere it carries is really great. Of course, if you do not like Nakoruru, or have never played any of the games, you may not be as excited to see it, as I was.Expressing a lot, the art performance of Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara Okurimono has the biggest merit to the anime’s amazing atmosphere. I just loved the whole look of the show – landscapes, designs, they were all extraordinary. The particular innocence of character designs creates an interesting mixture between the teenage looks and the adulthood strokes in the story. Things like all the blood and nudity – they all seem at place. The music was also fine, but nothing memorable.Since I am not familiar with the visual novel, I have no idea whether there are going to be more characters of the franchise appearing later in the story, but as far as the single episode goes, all is focused on Nakoruru and Rera. The other appearing characters are just too much in the background. Even the role of Nakoruru’s younger sister – Rimururu, is minor.Perhaps its unfinished state is what adds a bit more charm to Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara Okurimono, but I think that when a story based on an action fighting game, is made so well and serious, it deserves the check out. Of course, this OVA is another must have addition to the Samurai Shodown fan collector’s items.;Recommended

1;Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso;KaRue33;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KaRue33;10;Few anime are able to touch upon one's heart and soul like Satellite Girl and Milk Cow. In a world of mediocre and ridiculous storytelling, something so refreshing and heartwarming is nothing short of a treasured gift for animation, much less anime.This film has everything, from a speaking roll of cursed anthropomorphic toilet tissue, to a satellite whose struggle with her death and lack of purpose in an ever-evolving technological society, to a broken hearted male whose male cow body can still somehow lactate, it a treat for all. This anime asks the bigger questions in life that no one has an answer to, such as how a powerful wizard was defeated by a walking incinerator.This anime's animation is also exquisite, from the bug eyed character models and the lack of animation between frames. It's beautiful, almost Ghibli-esque. The homages to the masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion were also a fantastic edition to an already dense film full of symbolism and metaphor. This was enhanced by the fantastical music which accompanied each and every scene, especially the one where our brave heroine confronts her own mortality. It was a beautiful eye opener into the struggles of love, and how the bonds of fate tie us together though the beauty of music and male cows who can lactate.This film I cannot recommend to many as it is so complex. Only a few can see it. Primarily those who have no major biases of the world we live in, this typically denotes children. The other audience I would recommend this to are those who appreciate the higher things in life through drink and pill. Even then, this film may be beyond even those.;Recommended
0;Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso;ArcFloof;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArcFloof;6;I saw this one at a local indie theater in Korean so I have not seen the dub (or even know if there is one). Overall, I wanted to enjoy this film but the art was poor at best and the story was all over the place. It seems this is what happens when a studio tries to emulate Ghibli without any of the charm or talent. There wasn't ever a 'wow' moment to really capture my imagination.There were aspects that I found interesting but on the whole, the story felt as if it was written for the sake of being as weird as possible. The character development felt forced and there was so much about the film that wasn't explained.I just couldn't get over the art. Most times, it's rather fine but the backgrounds are often poorly drawn or look like a pixelated JPEG. This is most noticeable toward the end of the film. There are a handful of scenes where the audio isn't synced with the animation and characters mouths continue to move after they'd finished speaking. I get that this isn't a huge production, but any self respecting studio would have cleaned this up.;Mixed Feelings
1;Ulibyeol Ilhowa Eollugso;jaamun100;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jaamun100;6;Overall, this is an interesting venture into the world of anime by a Korean studio. It's not spectacular, but rather just slightly above average. It's got moments of light odd comedy - after all, it is a film where the protagonists are a cow, a satellite, and toilet paper. It is an easy to follow film, and has a happy yet somewhat lazy ending. If it weren't for the lazy resolution, I'd give this film a solid 7 instead of 6.The story is a short, sweet, and simple love story. Love can find strange forms, even between an inanimate object like a satellite and a transmogrified cow human. There is also some deeper messaging about being true to yourself, and how bottled and mixed up emotions are the source of ailments.;Mixed Feelings
0;Goal FH: Field Hunter;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;6;"Esta review también está en español.Football Chronicles, Chapter 1: Goal Field HunterYear: 1994. The World Cup was being held in USA... and again, Japan couldn’t make it to the biggest event. But, the interest in soccer couldn't be bigger: just two years before, the j-league was created (replacing the little amateur league), and with that, things could finally be serious (and it actually happened: from 98, Japan got to every world cup, and is getting better and better every time). And in this big furor was created Goal Field Hunter. And to make things clear, this one is a few months older than Captain Tsubasa J, so this isn't a cheap rip off like a lot of people say. No, GFH has its own style...Story: Hikaru Tatsumura is a japanese teen living in Brazil, and has great talent in football (but a big way to go). Hikaru's a pretty nice guy in general, but he's also a proponent and selfish player, and in the end he's kicked out of his team. And not only that: his ex- club president told the other presidents (and managers, and coaches) to not let him play in other teams, for his discipline problems. Very annoyed for this situation, Hikaru did the opposite way of the legendary Tsubasa: with the (involuntary) advice of his friend Takuya, he decided to go and play in the reserves of the Shimizu S-Pulse. There, he will meet with lot of teammates and other people, but everyone think in the same things: first, win the reserve tournament. Second, play in the first team. And, of course, the final objective: join the Japan national team, and classify to the France World Cup.Animation: Good for its time. It look a bit old now, but the animation is fluid and the characters are well done, and they're different from each other (unlike Captain Tsubasa, which has a maximum of 15 faces in the whole manga xD).Don't expect super special effects, fire shoots, broken nets or impossible physics: here everything happens like in the real world. That's probably the biggest appeal, or at least, the thing that make it different to many other shonen sports. This means, a lot of shoots go outside, the players get tired, no six kilometers courts, etc.).Sound: Sorry folks, I have no idea how this sound in japanese. I watched the Latin-American version (which was pretty good, by the way. Bob Sponge was Hikaru's voice actor xD).Verdict: GFH is an interesting series. Back in the old days, the sports animes weren't too close with the reality (things like Captain Tsubasa were the norm, or at least, those were the series that make it here), and a thing like this one was almost necessary. Yes, there's less spectacular stuff, but more realism: it's impossible to make a shoot (area to area) that destroy the net, shoots can be inefficient, even for the most skilled players, and there's no replete stadium for a reserve match. Yes, there's less emotivity, but there are rules: here, if you hit a rival with a flying kick (a reference from CT's Makoto Soda, and others players too), its foul, and probably red card. To give you an idea, this series is closer to Hungry Heart (this one has a few flashy stuff, but nothing big) and Giant Killing than to Captain Tsubasa or Inazuma Eleven (this one is a utterly ridiculous, the characters only need ki to become Dragon Ball material).The bad thing (in this is similar to Captain Tsubasa J...) is that it has an inconclusive ending... Yet, this is a very recommendable anime for any football fan out there, and also to a sports fan who doesn't like the flashy stuff.--------Crónicas Futbolísticas, Capitulo 1: Goal Field HunterEl año es 1994. Se disputaba la copa del mundo de Estados Unidos, y nuevamente, Japón no podía clasificar. Pero el interés en el futbol no podía ser mayor: solo dos años antes, se inauguraba la J-league, la primera división de futbol japonesa (reemplazando a la liga amateur), y ahora las cosas si podrían hacerse en serio (y así fue: del 98 en adelante, Japón se clasifico siempre a la copa mundial, y su rol va haciéndose cada vez más respetable). Y es en este gran furor futbolístico que se estreno Goal Field Hunter o Goleadores, como la conocimos en Latinoamérica (en España no, la serie que ellos conocieron con ese nombre es Moero! Top Striker). Y para aclarar las cosas, este anime salió antes que Captain Tsubasa J (solo un par de meses), por lo que no es un plagio barato como muchos dicen. No, Goleadores tiene lo suyo...Historia: Icaro (Hikaru Tatsumura), es un joven japonés que vive en Brasil, y que juega al futbol con gran habilidad, aunque le falta mucho camino por recorrer. A pesar de ser un buen tipo en general, Icaro es un bocón agrandado, prepotente y egoísta a la hora de jugar, por lo que termina siendo expulsado de su equipo por el dueño del club. Y no solo eso: este individuo le informa al resto de los presidentes de que no lo acepten en sus equipos. Muy enojado con esta situación, Icaro decide hacer la inversa de Tsubasa: por el consejo (inconsciente) de su amigo Rei (Takuya Miyamoto), termina yendo a Japón a jugar a las reservas del Shimizu S-Pulse. Ahí conocerá a diversos personajes, pero todos piensan en lo mismo: primero, ganar la liga satélite (así le dicen a la reserva). Después, subir a primera. Y obviamente, el objetivo final: jugar para el seleccionado japonés, y clasificarse al mundial de Francia.Animación: Buena para la época, y aunque hoy parezca una serie vieja, la animación es fluida y los personajes están bien hechos, y son unos bien diferentes de otros (a diferencia de CT, donde hay un máximo de 15 caras en todo el manga xD).Acá no esperen súper efectos especiales, tiros de fuego, redes rotas o física imposible: acá todo pasa como en el mundo real. Tal vez ese sea su mayor atractivo, o al menos, lo que la hace diferente de la mayoría de los shonens de deportes: es realista (o sea, muchísimos tiros se van afuera, tiros leves que se desvían en alguien entran, los jugadores se cansan, las canchas no miden seis kilómetros, etc).Sonido: Las voces latinas son más que correctas, con una buena entonación y todo eso. Tal vez reconozcan a Luis Carreño, el seiyu que le dio su vos a Icaro, es también el mismísimo Bob Esponja (la segunda vos). Ni idea de las voces de España. La música no está mal, el opening es pegadizo y no perdona a las excusas ;), y cada vez que Icaro agarra la pelota escuchamos zamba. El punto negro es el audio: hay veces en la que se escucha muy bajo.Veredicto: Goleadores es una serie interesante. Por esos días, los animes deportivos no estaban muy apegados a la realidad (siendo el máximo exponente Oliver y su grupo), y una serie así era casi necesaria. Cierto, acá no hay espectacularidad (que sí, es una palabra), pero hay realismo: es imposible hacer un tiro de área a área que destruya la red, si agarras la pelota de abajo va a salir para arriba y se va a ir muy, muy afuera, y si están jugando dos equipos cualquiera, las tribunas no están repletas como si fuera Real Madrid vs Barcelona. Tal vez allá un poco menos de emotividad, pero hay reglas: acá si le metes una patada voladora a alguien (lo digo por el señor Makoto Soda, de CT, entre muchos otros) es foul, y probablemente roja. Para que se hagan una idea, esta serie es más cercana a Hungry Heart (que tenía sus cosas, pero dentro de todo creíble) y Giant Killing que a Captain Tsubasa o Inazuma Eleven (en esta última se va todo al diablo, los personajes prácticamente tienen ki!). El punto malo (y acá si se parece a Captain Tsubasa J) es que la serie termina prácticamente en la nada... Así y todo, es una serie muy recomendable para los fans del futbol en general, y también para las personas que les gusta el anime deportivo sin mucha parafernalia.";Mixed Feelings
0;Dragoon;Ikusagami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ikusagami;7;"Dragoon, not to be confused with the easier to find Panzer Dragoon, is an anime spin-off of the Japanese Playstation/PC-98 RPG Ryuuki Denshou: Dragoon. As such, this three episode OVA features all the trappings and familiar cliches you'd expect from both a JRPG and a nineties fantasy anime.The story follows Sadie, a young swordsman who finds a naked girl unconscious in the woods. In a completely original twist for the genre, she suffers from amnesia, remembering only her name, Miu, and is therefore completely clueless as to why she's being pursued by an evil empire. Blessedly, Sadie's the strong-willed, chivalrous variety of protagonist (I find the classical genre alternative of strong-willed but dimwitted protagonist to be annoying) so he doesn't hesitate to protect Miu and aid his newfound (and newly clothed) ward in escaping the clutches of their malevolent--and generically faceless--pursuers.The young duo's flight from the Garubado Empire leads them on an exciting journey in which they encounter all the classic genre trademarks of betrayal, imprisonment and escape, ambush, and fighting overwhelming opponents with old family grudges. Along the way they find likeminded allies in the form of a healer, a mage (who doubles as a thief), and a prince, forming the kind of well rounded party you would need for such an epic adventure.Despite the seemingly generic predictability of the show's structure, the character archetypes work for it. I found the interplay between the cast to be charming, and the growing relationship between Miu and Sadie gave it depth, especially as Miu comes to question whether it's really in her best interest to regain her memories.The show bears the mark of its era, as well. As one would expect from a 90s OVA, there's a decent share of needless nudity to set it apart from children's cartoons. Not too much, but enough that some would consider it ecchi by modern standards--every female heroine has at least one scene in the buff.The enigmatic scenes of villains speaking cryptically about their plans really showcase old fantasy trends: evil empires use pauldrons to denote evil like the Catholic Church uses hats to denote holiness--I suspect the reason nefarious villains always know teleportation magic isn't to make them seem enigmatic and omnipresent, but because trying to fit through doorways would be too embarrassing for somebody wider than he is tall.The animation style, likewise, is reminiscent of the times, and really adds a nostalgia factor for those partial to the generation.In fact, while the list of cliches may make this sound like an unfavorable review, the truth is that, as any JRPG fan knows, some cliches are common because they work for the fanbase. All these elements came together to make an enjoyable experience for me, and in the end, while Dragoon certainly isn't on par with Berserk, I quite liked it, and found it a good deal more enjoyable than Record of Lodoss War. . .Except for a single, fatal, flaw.The show is unfinished.The script is not a three episode OVA worth of story; it's a normal length series worth of story of which only three episodes were made. It doesn't even feature an open ended ending, but rather the third episode ends as though fully anticipating more. . . which don't exist.I don't know if this was done to publicize the game, or simply generate a little extra revenue by franchising it, but it will leave viewers unsatisfied with mysteries unanswered, and a quest which is only beginning rather than being brought to a satisfactory conclusion.For those who know the language, I'm sure this serves the intended purpose--I am now even more eager to play the game--but those who can't continue the story elsewhere and want resolution from the anime itself will find themselves even more annoyed, or even angry, the more they enjoy it.In summation: if you like the fantasy genre and nineties anime, Dragoon is a hidden gem. But you must go in knowing beforehand that you -will- be left hanging.";Recommended
0;Dragoon;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;4;Dragoon is a three episode fantasy OVA from the late 90s. It's kind of an obscure one too. I couldn't find much information for it. I'll be honest, the only reason it even caught my eye was because I saw the title and thought of the playstation classic, Legend of the Dragoon, although the two works aren't related in the slightest. This is based off of a different game that I've never played. Still, I like fantasy as a genre. So, let's give it a shot.Story:We open with a battlefield where a naked woman emerges from a dragon machine that bears more than a slight resemblance to Chrono Trigger's Dragon Tank. Don't ask me why she's leaving an armoured machine and making herself vulnerable or why she's piloting a hunk of metal completely starkers. Anyway, that short intro ends and we cut to a different time where the same woman is being transported somewhere. She escapes after being threatened with rape and she's found lying naked in the snow by Sedi, our protagonist. He takes her somewhere safe and warm, but can't be bothered to find her any clothes, and asks why the soldiers are after her. She can't remember because of that old RPG cliché, amnesia. She only knows that her name is Myuu. The pair eventually go on a journey to discover who she is and why the Empire is pursuing her.The biggest issue with the writing in this is just that it's incredibly generic. Every single major plot point: the invading Empire, the amnesiac with a mysterious power, the son of a hero going on a journey to come into his own, the character seeking revenge for their destroyed home, the evil minister who holds the real power in a monarchy... These are all common elements to not only RPGs but fantasy stories in general. And they've all been in works where the execution was vastly superior to this. This one just doesn't do anything new or interesting with them. Rather, it reduces them to their most basic, bog-standard usage. It doesn't help that the OVA also has plenty of moments that are just kind of stupid. The aforementioned dragon tank thing is one. Sedi randomly gaining new abilities because he's given his father's sword is another. No, he doesn't just have them because he's been training with his dad for years. He gains them because his dad levelled up his sword. The prince being unable to do anything even when he has proof that their minister is evil is another big one. Yeah, the minister has the real power but you'd think having proof he was aligned with the enemy would be enough to take that away from him.There are some elements of this series that could have been promising. The mystery surrounding Myuu's identity had promise. The way it mixes magic and machinery has potential. The indirect connection Sedi has with Bashua could have worked. All of this generic stuff has been used to great effect in other works. But using it well requires clever writing, taking some risks and subverting some expectations at times to keep things fresh. None of which are on display here.Characters:As surprising as this may be for an OVA with bland writing, the characters are completely trite. We have the hero, the mysterious girl who will serve as a love interest, the one who's royalty (male variant), the tricky one and so on. There's never a character you look at and think “well, that's different” or even “that's an interesting take.” No, what you get is just boring.Art:The artwork looks more like it was made in the early 90s than the late 90s. What I'm getting at is that it's a bit dated, even for its time. But the big issue is with the fan-service. It's like some knob decided that if they couldn't have interesting characters or writing that was compelling in any conceivable way they'd make up for it by throwing in gratuitous boobs. Which they do a lot. Myuu spends long stretches of time nude. Lilith takes off her clothes at one point for no good reason and has a long bathing scene. We even see statues of topless women. It's like they're afraid that if they don't show some tits every five minutes the audience will all fall asleep. Which may not be unfounded but you fix that by writing something interesting, not adding boobies to your generic schlock.Sound:This is one element I can give the OVA some credit for. They did get some good actors. Our leads are voiced by Ishida Akira & Kouda Mariko both of whom can deliver really good performances. We've also got Koyasu Takehito, Imai Yuka & Ootsuka Akio. All of whom are really good. And their performances in this are perfectly passable, which is about the best you'd expect given what they have to work with. The best part of the music is Imai Yuka's theme tune performance. The rest is, and I know this is super hard to believe given how innovative this series is, pretty standard fare.Ho-yay:There's a scene where Millie randomly gropes Myuu. But there's nothing about their dynamic to indicate it means anything. It's almost like it was just tossed in for fan-service. But would this series really just toss something in for fan-service besides the egregious number of exposed breast scenes and some up-skirt shots and...Final Thoughts:Dragoon is an OVA, and probably based off of a game, that hasn't an original thought in its head. Rather, it tries to make up for it's lack of interesting content and dull characters by throwing in a bunch of tasteless fan-service. Which, ultimately, makes it a below average viewing experience.  The final rating is  a 4/10. Next week I'll review Dirty Pair Flash. Which I'm sure has no fan-service based problems whatsoever. Well... maybe it makes up for them with something good.;Not Recommended

0;Momone;VulgarLife;https://myanimelist.net/profile/VulgarLife;6;A teacher being taken advantage of by their students is as old and well worn as it can get in ero anime. It’s hard to make it stand out so what can Momone, a single episode OVA from 1998 offer to set itself out from the competition?Momone is a teacher who has nightmares of her youth when she was sexually abused by her classmates. After confiscating a porn mag from one of her students another students claims the mag was his. At home and after feeling wet from looking at the mag which conjured up old feelings her student arrives and lets his motive be known forcing Momone into a pleasure she had no idea about.If you’ve seen one teacher and student ero work you’ll likely be familiar with most of this setup. That is not inherently a bad thing but it does make it more predictable, meaning it needs something to stand out which it doesn’t really have.Momone does hide secrets but what she does here is typical when she can’t help herself looking at the confiscated porn mag. Her secret may tie into this but is never really developed. The only other character of note here is Hino the one orchestrating this. He is your generic student wanting to take advantage of the sexy teacher.Being one episode it needs to make good use of its time and it does that as it fits in some nice and varied sex scenes. It is more vanilla than I was expecting given the cover art of Momone in that divine bondage outfit but nothing hardcore comes to pass. Momone is taken in her flat, she is teased and pleasure by her student who then proceeds to have sex with her, forcing her to admit her pleasure before continuing, holding out as she suffers.What proceeds is some nice, if well worn, scenes following the lewd acts Momone is forced into at the behest of Hino. She wears no underwear to school and inadvertently shows off to all the students while revelling in the pleasure before Hino removes and punishes her for not having his permission.It is wonderfully erotic and seeing Momone give in to this pleasure, to really sink to depths for sexual release. Not all of it she wants but she does succumb and her reactions, her response is suitably ideal as the sensory overload just hits. Having her act this way in front of her students brings her newfound and old feelings alike.The overriding feeling I had watching this, other than arousal, was thinking this to be a longer story. The glimpse of Momones past in school and what happened to her sexually, the gradual training elements progressing naturally and the inconclusive ending all made it feel as if it was going to be continued, that there was more to come. One look at the manga it is adapted from tells the story.The manga is four volumes long and follows as Momone falls deeper and deeper into a sexual spiral from which she cannot escape. We see her put into more embarrassing, more humiliating acts, adds more girls and becoming the pet of her students whilst also looking at what happened to her. It is frustrating to see this but not completely unexpected. It acts more as a teaser for the manga to help sell it and it does work as after I wanted to read it but as a standalone episode it does feel disappointing.Visually the show looks its age in the designs from clothing to body types to facial features. Considering this came out in 1998 that is to be expected and there is a certain charm seeing these retro designs again. It still emphasises Momones sexy body as it lingers on her focusing on just the right places though and the bondage outfit she wears is still a thing of beauty despite its simplicity. In terms of animation it’s not bad either. The sex scenes flow well, recycling of scenes and frames is kept small and it does look smooth.Approaching two decades since its release Momone still holds up well, it has a good range of content and progresses. Nothing really stood out though and it feels lacking in areas which to drag it down. Watch it and if you like it go read the manga as that is worth it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Tottoko Hamtarou Movie 4: Hamtaro to Fushigi no Oni no Emon Tou;DanVS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DanVS;8;Story: 10I loved the concept for this story. Hamtaro and his friends are getting really into a picture book that ends too suddenly for them, so they decide to act out the rest of the story.Meanwhile, the author who is frantically trying to finish the story sees them through a portal and decides to enlist their help whether they like it or not.Hamtaro and his friends are thrown into the world of the story and become the character within.Very fast paced and very non-sensical. This is not the kind of story you should go into planning to take seriously. There are times in this movies that it feels like an acid trip. Things go by so fast, some of the most random things you can think of pop up and are gone before you know it.This movie is anything but predictable.It was a joy ride on the dorkiest roller coaster that ever lived.Art: 10The animators did a stellar job making every thing seem so big and grand. The characters are cute, their movements are fluid, the magic done in this world all look big and impressive.I have to imagine the people making this movie had a fun time making this film and it shows through the animation.Character: 7As always Hamtaro is just the best thing ever. I loved every moment with him on screen. I gave a rather low score for character for the last movie I reviewed for this franchise.The rest of the main cast just sort of followed Hamtaro around like a crew of robots with not much personality to them. It was much better in this film and more personalities were able to shine through... Though at the same time I can't help but feel it could have been a bit better for the rest of the cast. Especially when a major theme of this movie was friendship.The new characters were fun. I wonder if they ever show up again because I'd love to see more of them.Enjoyment: 10There wasn't a single point in this movie where I felt bored or thought the movie was dragging. Partly thanks to the fast pacing. I had some laughs, I had some WTF moments.It was an all around good time. Would most certainly watch again.;Recommended

The premise is amusing and the animals are very cute, but the gags really pick up when the ball gets hit out of the park and into the home of clueless forest animals.The very simple line drawings showcase how creativity can thrive even with limited budget and resources. Stark contrast of black & white gives a classic ink-drawing feel that is graphically interesting.This short film is easy to enjoy even if you can't understand the (limited) Japanese narration. The music is a little repetitive but gives a ballpark feeling.I especially love the giant ears on the bunnies. :P It's definitely simple, but worth the watch if you like unusual old animation.;Recommended
0;JaJa Uma! Quartet;Zak22wolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Zak22wolf;3;"JaJa Uma! Quartet, known as Wild Cardz in english, is one of the most boring and pointless series that I have ever seen. The story stars a group of 4 girls, each themed after playing cards, as they protect the card kingdom from a giant chess piece. And that's it. The story never tells us anything important such as, oh, I don't know, maybe why our four protagonists have super powers or how they met, or even why they hold the title Crown Knights, Heroes to the nation. We never learn where the chess piece came from, or even the villain behind the whole thing. As such, its impossible to be invested since we never learn the stakes and have no idea about our character's backstories and why we should care. Of course, there is one character we need to look at extensivly. A chinese character named Chee Chuukai. He is, in my opinion, one of the most offensive characters in any form of media ever. I have only seen the english dub, and that proves extensivly why this character is terrible. He talks in a stupid just off the boat accent and refers to himself as me and speaks in a manner that makes Jar Jar Binks look like the height of cultural sensitivity. To top off the shows crimes, the dub sucks. The only two voices of note in this show are for Joe Diamond and Coco Heartful. Joe is voiced by Debora Rabbi, also known as Angora Deb, who is probably best known as Leina Vance from Queen's Blade and Aika Sumeragi from Agent Aika, and she is God awful here. She voices Joe as if she just read here lines and is trying to do a cute little girl sound during the recording process. As such, if she isn't screeching like crazy, she's talking as if she is a robot who does not understand how ""the human beings children"" talk. But even that pales in comparison to the pain of Apollo Smile as Coco Heartful. If you have seen Bennet the Sage's review, you know Apollo's strange history in Anime, a pop singer turned ""live-action anime girl"" turned voice actress. That doesn't begin to describe how annoying she sounds. Thankfully her character doesn't speak much, but everytime she does, her annoyingly upbeat voices causes cats and dogs to start making noise.Honestly, Wild Cardz is one of the worst shows I have seen in a long time. Bad voice acting, okay art, non-memorable sound, and a story that ends in one of worst, most pointless ways ever, thre is no reason to like it. There is no fan service, which would at least give us a reason to use it in some way, poor action, and it's only funny if you don't mind looking like a giant jerk for laughing at the Chinese. Bottom line, stay as far away as possible from JaJa Uma! Quartet.";Not Recommended

If you listen closely to each one, the lyrics are changed in each movie to reflect the kind of antics that Pero gets up to, and occasionally what he gets up to in the film.

They can really hold candles to today's animation.Design wise, this antiquated movie has better character design than any animes that feature anthropomorphic animals I've seen. It's no wonder why Pero is still used as Toei Animation's mascot.The art can't be compared to today's computer-assisted drawings, but all of the scenes featuring buildings are top notch. In fact, what I think is the weakest part in the movie is the voice. Sometimes it doesn't match what happens in the scene, but it's probably due to the constrain of audio technology of that time.Overall, a very enjoyable family-friendly movie.;Recommended

0;Bosco Daibouken;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;6;Short review.Bosco Daibouken is another anime from Nippon Animation that adapts a western book. An anime focused on children where the focus is just being fun.It starts with Princess Apricot already on a flying ship after being kidnapped, I suppose she escaped from Fountainland to get help, since she escapes from the villains in the beginning and gets help after Speak arrives in a village called Bosco.The anime follows the same formula in basically every episode: The villain comes, tries to get Apri and gets screwed in some comical way and this builds up the adventure of the anime in various locations with various events. It's usually mini-arcs and rarely a single episode with the villains trying to get Apri. It's pretty repetitive, but it's fun.The characters are cool, even more of Bosco.The villains, Hoodman and his henchmen, get dumber and dumber with each episode and this makes for even more funny moments. They get even dumber when Damia, another villain, shows up. And I cannot forget that the comedy in this anime is really good and sometimes a bit cartoonish.The main villain Scorpion has a good motivation, since he is of a race that goes from planet to planet devouring them into nothingness.Bosco Daibouken is an anime that doesn't care about logic and just wants to be fun, and well, it is fun, however it got tiresome as the episodes went by.The animation is pretty consistent and never has a static frame. It's a good production.I don't pay attention to OST, so I don't even remember the songs, except for the opening and ending.As a whole, it is a very nice anime to watch and it has a satisfactory ending and ends the anime well.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ningyou Tsukai;TheAceAttorney;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAceAttorney;9;"This is going to be a controversial review, but I really enjoyed this. I don't rate hentai based on taste, since sex taste is subjective, I rate it on plot. With that being said, this is a really good plot, for a hentai, and I've seen A LOT of hentai. Does it have huge leaps in logic that don't make sense, sure, but it's a hentai; you aren't really watching hentai MOST OF THE TIME for plot reasons.Imagine if Cyberpunk 2077 was a hentai, and had underground mech sex fights. Society has progressed so far, to the point we have VR helmets, which pilots mechs, and are also directly connected to their user. This means that if someone were to, for example, be raped in the mech, their consciousness can feel everything their mech experiences; apart from dying. Still, you got some funny bits in here like the line: ""So, being a woman is your weak point."" And then immediately followed with: ""Being so sensitive is your weak point."" Like the hentai just exudes cheesy early anime vibes sometimes.Rika is affiliated with the gov, who makes these sex bots and is good friends with a girl named Sandy, as well as a professor. She takes up training with Sandy, in order to become a better fighter, to prepare herself for being raped. Sandy gets captured, raped, and mindfucked basically; this leads to Rika trying to investigate her disappearance as well a spy among the gov. I'll stop here, because I do think you should watch this one, even if you don't like hentai.";Recommended
0;Ningyou Tsukai;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;5;"In the distant future, technology has reached the point that humanity was able to create Silhouettes, robots controlled remotely through human thought for the more dangerous but necessary jobs. However, when human thoughts turn to other things, Silhouettes can become very dangerous. Rika and Sandy, two Silhouette scientists, are drawn into the world of sex crime to uncover perpetrators for sex crimes involving Silhouettes.Surprisingly, this is actually a pretty decent premise. If it wasn't stapled on to a sub-par hentai, it could have actually been at least competent if a more talented team was attached to it. It's like the distant cousin of something like Bubblegum Crisis. Hell, even if you wanted to embrace the fact that this is a hentai where you can feel everything your robot feels, and this is used by the bad guys, it could have been used to the hentai's advantage for a niche audience.And while a lot of this hentai tends to miss a lot more than it lands, the fact that I can even point to decent character moments and jokes that actually had some effort put into them is nice. I just wish the whole thing had some more talent behind it. The fact that stuff like Midnight Panther and Spaceship Agga Ruter exists proves that you can have a hentai with some effort behind it.Unfortunately, the OVA ends after one episode, and on a cliffhanger, that means nothing is going to get developed beyond what is in this single episode. And while it's not a classic by any stretch, it certainly had potential, which is more than I could say for most hentai.The only reason to go even consider watching this is if you're really are just that desperate for that mid-90s cyberpunk or sci-fi anime aesthetic. But if you're not willing to have the embarrassment of having to watch a hentai to get it, then maybe avoid this one.However, I still don't know why the distribution company for the English release went with the title ""Sexorcist"". Seems more appropriate for a parody of something featuring spirits or demons than something with robots. The alternate title ""Robosex"" or original Japanese title ""Puppeteer"" seems more appropriate, but I guess that wouldn't stand out in the piles of terrible anime that were being shoveled onto store shelves at the time.";Mixed Feelings
0;Chameleon (OVA);TheMidnightSnack;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheMidnightSnack;7;Chameleon is an anime that gives the viewer moderate expectations that it immediately lives up to, leaving the viewer sad and confused.Story: 7/10The anime immediately throws you into a set of circumstances with no backstory. Eisaku Yazawa is a high schooler that, despite his size and personality, wants to be a feared gang member. There is no true explanation for this. There is little backstory in this anime at all, but with length of this OVA, this prevents character development for characters nobody cares about.Art: 5/10The art in this show is extremely dated, especially for an 1992-1996 release. The animation quality and background drawings are about on par with something from the mid-to-late 1980's. There aren't any noticeable mistakes or flaws in the animation.Sound: 6/10Sound effects and music are very consistent throughout the whole OVA. Nothing in this anime is considered bad from a musical standpoint, but it doesn't stand out very much.Character: 8/10The characters in this show are what saves it from being completely overlooked. The protagonist is a very funny character that can give of many funny lines and expressions. He fumbles around the world of gang violence, but he is viewed by his peers as a real threat by mistake. This dynamic got a lot of laughs out of me.Enjoyment: 7/10Enjoyment of this show is more subjective than anything. Yazawa can be hated or loved depending on how he is viewed, similarly to Mineta in the newer anime Boku no Hero Academia. He is never portrayed as completely rotten, but he is perverted, as protagonists go. People who are fans of the era might find this entertaining.Final Notes:This show isn't great. But it isn't awful. While dated, it can still keep my interest for an extended period of time. The sex and violence isn't awful, but there are still touchy subjects and stereotypes that haven't aged well (Yu), but it can make for an entertaining time.;Recommended
0;Tropical-Rouge! Precure Movie: Yuki no Princess to Kiseki no Yubiwa!;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;7;Not gonna mince words here, I feel Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure is one of the most annoying, frustrating, and disappointing Pretty Cure seasons I've ever seen. While I can understand wanting to make a more comedic, light-hearted season after the more emotionally charged Healin Good Pretty Cure, TroPri had absolutely no interest in fleshing out its characters beyond Manatsu or Laura, it took forever to progress its plot in any real way, its villains and their actions weren't threatening which made the series lack any real tension or urgency, and as a result, the fights were as boring as eating lunch. So when the movie was announced, I initially had zero interest in watching it because of how badly the series turned out...until it was revealed that it was going to be a crossover with Heartcatch Pretty Cure, aka my favorite Precure season ever. But having seen the Healin Good movie previously, I was convinced the Heartcatch girls would be reduced to little more than plot devices that appear in two scenes involving fighting alongside the TroPri girls and do nothing else until the plot deemed it convenient, since that's what the Healin Good movie did. So you can imagine that I wasn't exactly looking forward to watching Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure The Movie: The Snow Princess and the Miraculous Ring based on both the series' failings and what the Healin Good movie did with its crossover characters.I finally got around to watching the movie, and...holy shit, the Tropical Rouge movie actually seemed to go out of its way to not only address most of its parent series' flaws, but the flaws that the Healin Good movie had. How the hell did this movie manage to be better than its own parent series?! The plot isn't even all that groundbreaking if you think about it: The Tropical Club has been invited to a snowy kingdom called Shantia, specifically to attend Princess Sharon's coronation ceremony. Laura has even been invited to sing as part of the festivities, something she's very much looking forward to. While there, the girls tour Shantia and encounter the girls from Heartcatch Pretty Cure, getting acquainted with them before discovering secrets about Sharon and Shantia that put not only their lives, but other townspeople that were invited, in mortal danger. It's up to the Tropical Rouge and Heartcatch girls to put a stop to the evil force that threatens to keep them confined to Shantia for eternity.God, I am absolutely amazed at how much Toei seemed to learn from their mistakes both in regards to TroPri's flaws and the Healin Good movie's problems. As much as I liked the Healin Good movie, its biggest issue is that for all that the marketing empathized it being a crossover with Yes Precure 5, the actual Yes girls only appeared in two scenes, felt more like living Deus Ex Machinas to be brought in to save the day than actual characters, and they never interact with the Healin Good girls outside of battles, so they didn't feel like they were that important to the main plot. You could cut them out of that movie entirely and nothing would be lost. The TroPri movie addressed these problems tenfold, as not only do the TroPri girls interact with the Heartcatch girls both before and during the main plot, they remain integral throughout the entire movie and share just as much screentime as the TroPri girls, both outside of and during battle scenes. It helps that the Heartcatch girls' characterization remains true to their parent series, and for anybody who's worried that Erika was just going to be flanderized into the funny girl who makes cartoony faces, rest assured, that doesn't happen, and she even retains a lot of her maturity from the later parts of Heartcatch, though she does have her funny cartoony moments.Even the villain here is surprisingly a lot more compelling than the trio from the series. Yes, her motivation isn't anything new, and has probably been done lots of times and better in other stuff, but compared to how utterly lazy and bland the villain trio was in the series, her actions are actually legitimately threatening and actually manage to create palpable tension and urgency. Granted, the resolution to her plot at the very end came off as woefully cheesy and mealymouthed, and a lot of things about her backstory don't really make a whole lot of sense from a narrative standpoint, but for what its worth, she's still a better villain than Chongire, Numeri, and Elda could ever hope to be. Granted, I do find it kind of annoying that the movie decided to have Laura be the main focus of the movie and have her be the one to interact with Sharon the most, because God knows the producers just LOVE shilling Laura to high heaven, and I know many people didn't like this about the series. But I do feel that Laura did get some good material out of it, so I don't think it was all bad. The movie does have one flaw it shares with the series: It still doesn't do much with Sango, Minori, and Asuka, because heaven forbid we take the focus away from Manatsu and Laura even for five seconds, but it does make up for this by having Tsubomi and Erika receive just as much time in the limelight, even if it does result in Itsuki and Yuri not doing much.But for as much as the TroPri movie does right, it's not without its own issues. For one...for a movie, the animation is actually kind of cheap-looking. Other than a few key shots, the animation isn't much better than its parent series. It almost feels like the movie was given a TV series budget, and that should not be. Several minutes are dedicated to stock footage of transformation scenes that go uninterrupted, which I'm pretty sure was done to save on costs. The soundtrack isn't much to write home about either, though I do really like that new remix of the Heartcatch Pretty Cure transformation music, so that's a plus right there. Furthermore, near the end of the movie, various shots are edited and cut in a weirdly erratic manner, and parts of them feel like stuff happened off screen without a real explanation for why they happened, such as how a character got from point A to point B without an explanation for how they got there and why when they were occupied with something else.Despite these flaws, I can wholeheartedly say that I honestly found this movie to be far more interesting than the actual Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure series, in that it actually gave a damn about having a compelling storyline, a stronger villain, and rectifying at least some of the series' issues, even if it didn't always succeed. Plus, I'm always down for seeing more of my favorite Heartcatch girls!;Recommended
0;Tropical-Rouge! Precure Movie: Yuki no Princess to Kiseki no Yubiwa!;Melonada;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Melonada;7;When I try to describe this movie, the word 'premature' comes to mind. It has all the right ingredients: characters we know and love, a beautiful setting, and an interesting antagonist. However, the execution is somewhat lacking, as I'll explain.Firstly, the characters were fun to watch and the two Pretty Cure teams actually had some nice interactions - like seeing what they have in common. This is a huge step up from the Healin' Good movie, where the crossover cures only appeared when plot demanded it. Erika got the most focus respectively, but the senpai cures unfortunately didn't bond much. The main character is, perhaps unsurprisingly, Lora - which kind of puts Manatsu to shame. I did like Lora in the movie, though. She starts off as spoiled and kind of annoying but she develops a connection with princess Sharon and gets good development by the end. Princess Sharon actually surprised me - I have certain expectations from movie exclusive characters but she was pretty close to greatness.Unfortunately, the plot was dragging at times, especially at the beginning. The transformations were also really stretched-out. I did like the look of the snow kingdom, I wish we had learned more about it, as I wasn't as attached to it and the princess as I should have been. Another slightly disappointing aspect was the action. We mostly got generic monsters, and while the fight with the HeartCatch cures was awesome, they didn't contribute much to the final showdown.Overall, it's a fun movie and not a bad crossover either. Despite its slow pacing, it has some great moments and surprisingly emotional scenes. However, I do feel that the concept could have been executed better.;Mixed Feelings
1;Tropical-Rouge! Precure Movie: Yuki no Princess to Kiseki no Yubiwa!;RobloxElie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RobloxElie;5;This movie is actually average with flaws. It may be boring at times for some people but it’s more of a lighthearted movie with emotional situation that occurs afterwards. The art-style is a little bad in this movie and the animations are okay. For the fight scenes, there are fight scenes but it’s not as intense as the previous Healin Good movie crossover with Yes 5 Gogo. Although, the animation for the fights are better than the overall series. I was hoping we get another level of Healin good movie fighting scenes only to be let down with a little shorter hand to hand combat fights. It also have a crossover with a past Precure team which is interesting and it seems to focused on them a lot more this time around. For me, it was okay but it wasn’t in the high stand point to the previous Precure fall movie.;Mixed Feelings
0;Chibi Maruko-chan: Watashi no Suki na Uta;Robinne;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Robinne;10;Upon looking further into Masaaki Yuasa’s filmography, I noticed this chibi maruko chan movie, wich caught my eyes because I had seen some animation that reminded me of mind game. It was also greatly recommended by a friend of mine, note that you can watch it blind, as the series is mostly composed of gags and the characters stay very static and relatable without knowing exactly their origins.The movie starts with Sakura momoko also known as maruko-chan learning a new song, Menkoi kouma (beloved foal), she soon gets an assignment : to think of her favorite song and draw the image that comes to mind with that song. While visiting her grandparents in Shizuoka, she meets a street artist and will quickly become friends with her. and decide she could help in creating the best drawing for her song. This movie mainly tackles their growing friendship, how parting can be difficult and also questions our relation with art under the prism of a child.This movie is comprised of a lots of music clips which compose at least a big third of the movie as it is the main focus of the movie and they are also building its narrative.Upon her journey cherishing this song, she will realize that what she learned wasn’t the full version and will learn, with the help of different characters, the rest of the song and its context, giving it a different signification which also echoes with her relationship with the artist. Be it by her interaction with her grandfather who only knows the modified version when he was a child which may seem silly but shows how folk songs were created and transmitted and passed on to a new generation. Later in the movie, it reveals that the song was created in time of war and the horse was taken by the army to become a warhorse sent to a far-away battlefield, destroying the precious and happy image she had at first. It gets further with her boyfriend who is from Hokkaido and his family has a farm there and loved the song because of that, joy of birth, seeing the newborn foals standing up.« To never forget despite being parted. This happens to all of us so many times over the course of our lives… During the course of my life many things were bound to happen. But sensei's word that day, I would never ever forget them »Another major theme of the movie is saying goodbye to the loved ones, and the harsh reality of parting with someone, learn to cherish their memories tightly, and the storyline is simple enough to follow and still be emotional, it relies a lot on the viewer keeping the heart of a child and learn to appreciate all the little wonders in seemingly uninteresting events. Characters are kept simple and archetypal but them being that way doesn’t remove anything, in fact, that is its strength as it allows them to use empathy to its full extent. Maruko smug and naïve attitude, as well as her simplicity and her wild imagination certainly makes her adorable and relatable and her classmate all embodies one type of people we have encountered and are relatable in their own way. The way our two main characters evolve and progress throughout the movie is especially remarkable, it knows how to properly introduce them, how to foreshadow their relationship and just enough substance to make you sob at the end.One of the other highest point of the film is its art and direction, now the normal section use of an improved version of the series, having a beautiful and marvelous pastel art as well as its varied colour palette. Where it really shines though, are the music clips where every bit of care is put to make them as well crafted as possible. Every song has its own themes and atmosphere, be it visually or the music genre it tackles.The main song is presented differently from the clips present in this movie, it first start outs as a chorus sung by the children in the class. Then, you get to hear maruko sing it many times with a very smooth progression in how it is presented, either having it becomes an echo and having the reddish sun set as a background to symbolize nostalgia, or depicting the story of the song directly on screen and conveying the relation of the foal with his mother in a quite endearing way. Even after that, even though it is not sung, its themes and relation to the story never disappears.As for the other songs, they vary greatly in their importance to the story, some are here just for comedic value while some plays an intricate value in the role they have to play, or in their style as it englobes different genres of music, from the dynamic pop song to a ballade but also reggae.It would be very hard for me to talk about all of them but the most memorable for me is “Hoshi wo taberu” by tama.“She was as beautiful as a porcelain doll on that day. Like a bubble, it seemed like she would float away and disappear. So I watched her as often as I could, while pretending to look at the fish”.That’s how the song begins, I consider it to be a perfect symbol of their frienship being immortalized, it acts as a sort of climax for their friendship while being a nice foreshadowing of the end of the movie by the presence of the train of the galactic railroad which is smart considering how they can be close to Giovanni and Campanella.I’d say overall kinda felt close to Fantasia, even though I believe nothing can even come close to that, but the way to tackle the narrative and to be a visual wonder and a treat for the eyes certainly makes it special to me. While I don’t know the degree of involvement of Masaaki Yuasa on this project, it seems pretty clear how it could have affected him and I see it as one of his first step into creating Mind Game.This movie might not be perfect but it did an important job for me on the emotional level with its portrayal of childhood and all its hardships. It captures everything that makes our childhood a great adventure as well as an interesting on the relation of children with with art.If I had to really compare it to another movie to give you an idea of what it’s like, “My neighbors the Yamada” would come to mind as the perfect example of associating a seemingly simple structure and artstyle that finally gets you hard and leaves you an everlasting heartwarming memory when it’s over.;Recommended
0;Chibi Maruko-chan: Watashi no Suki na Uta;Takuza;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Takuza;5;I'd known about the existence of Chibi Maruko-chan for over a decade, but had never seen any of it, so this movie was my first exposure. I believe the draw of this movie to anyone watching it post 2020 would be the Masaki Yuasa directed music segments, which do display his early charms and are fun. Not all of the musical segments are directed by Yuasa and not all of them are good, but they are all interesting enough in their own right, and mix in nicely with the calm, warm, almost nostalgic tone the movie adopts. This is where the film shines in my opinion. Some may say that it's an inferior version of a Takahata (My Neighbor's the Yamada's, Only Yesterday) film, and while I can't really disagree, I think it's not a greatly inferior product and delivers that nice, wholesome family content well.With that said, towards the end of the movie there is a turn that is laughably regressive in its gender politics. This would be easy enough to ignore if they moved past it, but the entire remainder of the film is devoted to this turn and it really tanked my enjoyment immediately.Spoilers: A man who has proposed to his girlfriend tells her that he has decided he wants to move back to the countryside to be a farmer. He says that she should join him. She declines, reminding him both that'd they'd already previously agreed to stay in Tokyo, and that being in the big city is very valuable for her art career.People can change their plans and break up, that's fair. No one needs to be a villain in this scenario, it's perfectly fine. But the man has the audacity to state that she was putting her career before their love (mind you, *he* was the one who *abruptly* changed their plans and decided to move away) and the narrative of the movie has the further audacity to act as if the woman is wrong! Maruko convinces her that she is being selfish so she relents and they get married. This is the central story of the last 20 - 30 minutes of the film. It's inexcusably regressive even for 90s Japan, and I promise I would be willing to look past it if the movie would just *stop focusing on it*. But it refuses to, so I do too.This movie would have been an 8/10 but the sheer maddening, prolonged stupidity it made me endure towards the end drops it to a 5/10 in my book.;Mixed Feelings
0;Mianhada Saranghanda;FancySweetCake;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FancySweetCake;5;I liked this anime, but I recommend everyone to watch the Korean Drama before watching.This anime summarized the plot using overall 30 mins when the Korean Drama is 16 episodes so it might be hard to see/understand what is going on.It indeed skipped a lot of scenes from the original.It has a lot of sadness and overall great music in the story and in the credits. The art is nice so are the characters (if you understand the plot).If you like short anime like this or a shorter story instead of the Korean Drama I do recommend you watching it.

In the introduction there a couple things one could appreciate. Such as the number countdown. It was a great common idea to built anticipation. Although the slight moment of pitch black darkness with just noise did make sense but was kind of odd. What followed was a good premise of basically what the story's plot revolved around.Then the artwork or story becomes tailored to what seems like a personal fashion to the viewer. A real nice merger for connection. Clear indication on enemies reason(s) for ending kirby. What ruined the show for me was basically everything that followed after this moment. What was thought to be a tailored presentation wasn't what one might have thought. The color style shown thus far didn't stay. And as for reasoning for any of the following characters let's just say it was a crap shoot. For example in a non spoiler fashion if i gave you a creature that was showed great promise in destroying with a mind ability. Don't you think if given a change that that same ability would be used if its goal was in its hands? Or, in terms of kirby's special ability how does it go from addition to straight up multiplication? For those not familiar with kirby's ability, let's say he absorbs attacks. So, that fight fire with fire philosophy is commonly used here.Character flaws aside show didn't present good morals for the kids.

0;Kyuukyoku no Sex Adventure Kamasutra;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;Rate a 7English DubbedCensorship:Unclear/open for debate.For this old film went with the approach of not blocking the sex parts but positioning the characters in situation where they would not dangle (show).StoryYoung lovers of the past wish to live their lives. Sadly, it does not work out in the original plan. Although, destiny can be funny by twisting situations for the same if not similar paths to be open again once more. Story follows the ideal of if its true love love will find a way.Art-decent-one minor issue i had was the depiction of the enemy's sidekick. What and why was it what it was? Was that character's story ever explained but was cut out? While the character was indeed random it wont really dawn your attention unless you really focus in on the factor. Personally, i would have preferred a basis for him included in the movie.SoundIt may be a little odd at first but i appreciated the fill-in sounds. What i mean is there will be some brief moments where one might not see some lip movement but will hear some grunts and other non-words sounds.Overall: I enjoyed this show. Just because i did not give this the highest rating doesn't mean this wasn't phenomenal in its own way. For i assure you it is. I am just unfortunately blessed in a more adaptive time era. In further detail, anything whether it be food or common function is improved greatly. There was a time then cord phones were all the rage. Now the rage lies with cordless. My point is while the sex was masked it would have been slightly interesting to see it at some point in the show. Aside from the sex the most amazing aspect was its portion of sex. No, i am not saying the movie was filled with smut. Quite the opposite. The movie blended the idea of sex in a regular comedy adventure story. Perhaps, you may think i am crazy for having such a light stomach per-say in this regard. Although, if that be the case i ask you how can you be pleased with the same ice cream? A little cryptic i know. But sex simply put can be boring. You may change what you can like partner, hair style, position but at the end it is still sex. To have another powerful element in place really keeps you interested in the show. That is why i enjoyed how little the sex played in the plot.;Recommended
0;Kyuukyoku no Sex Adventure Kamasutra;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;1;I have too much time in my hands to be honest.So here I am watching some of Go Nagai works being animated into OVAs and Kamasutra is simply dumb. Once again Nagai tries to pull his edgyness with another series that tries to provoke into the sexual part of his awful writting. BTW This is not even a Hentai, there are sex scenes but barely last like 1 minute each so the sexual interactions are not the principal part of this.This show is about how a Hindu Princess is revived after centuries with the science of Semen and love juice inside a sex cup.... (I have no words) and she comes back to life and somehow she has to have relationships with the grandson of some archaelogists for some reason. (Just roll with it) and for some reason another guy wants her so like that he can have eternal life.The plot is non sensical things happen because they say so. There is a scene where the protagonist and one girl are going to get crushed by walls and their brilliant idea is that they should put the clothes at the walls and that will stop it, I know that there is something called suspension of disbelief but give me a good solid reason on how clothes will stop a wall crushing you, not just for eyecandy of a man and a woman being naked.Characters are dumb and Go Nagai seems to insist in having that dumb caveman and himself in chibi form in all these crappy Ovas and that don't add anything to the plot and are there just to remind us that it is one of his works. The other characters are not even worth talking about because they don't have not even a single trait that I could describe.Art and sound. I really dig the artstyle and animation used in this but again the caveman and chibi Nagai don't blend well at all with the other characters. Although some backgrounds were very amateur. There was nothing much as a sound, the voice actors are good I guess but again it is very standard.Enjoyment. It is boring and stupid. Go Nagai's works are overrated.Well I guess that is it,there nothing much to say besides that this is not a hentai per se if you are looking even for that.Take care and see ya around.;Not Recommended
0;Petting a Dog;InMediasRes;https://myanimelist.net/profile/InMediasRes;10;I don't think I can even begin to describe how amazing this masterpiece is, but I have decided to try, even though words are worthless when compared to this masterpiece.Story 10/10:The story overall was simply put amazing. It starts out a bit slow, like the summer breeze at the beach in the evening. Imagine the sunset in the distance coloring the sky from light blue to crimson red, and the sound of the small waves slowly washing up the shore and the smell of warm seaweed. Not long after, however, the waves begins to get bigger, and soon starts to take your emotions on a ride. Out in the ocean of emotions you will meet playfull dolphins, sad whales, and sharks just below the surface. As the story, and the wave goes on, the wind suddenly stops blowing, with a very surprising end, and a feeling of wanting more, but still being a whole being. Feeling complete and with a sense of bliss.Art 8/10:The art was unique. It gave of a warm feeling, like you where home, and just in time for mothers homecooked meal. It was very dymanic. The colors where in the pink scale, and I found myself feeling the love and compassion that the art projected. The color pink also represents recieving of nuturing, which in my opinion, is the theme of this anime. The art also leaves many questions asked, it's mysterious and takes you in. When you start watching you almost can't stop. The reason I could only give it a 8 was, that the background was kind of empty, which felt far from the original warm feeling I got.Sound 9/10:The sound was relaxing and complimented the story and the art very well. It was well timed. There was, however a little problem where it sounded like the sound came from other sources than the characters, which is also why I am only giving it a 9.Character 10/10:I will mainly describe the dog and its owner in this anime.The owner comes of as a gentle man around 33 years old. He seems like he really loves his dog. He is very playfull and has very kind eyes.The dog, who is the main character, suits its owner perfectly. It enjoys spending time with its owner, and likes being petted. The dynamic between the two characters feels very realistic and most people would be able to relate to the situations.Overall enjoyment 10/10:It made me laugh, it made me cry and now I sit here, writing a review in hope of sharing my feelings and my overall love for this anime, that is simply put, a masterpiece, so other might give it a try.Every component in this journey fitted each other so well, that it was like watching a jigsaw puzzle slowly being put together in the most satisfying way. The final picture is burned on the insides of my eyes for an eternity, and I'm sure it will fill my dreams with tears of both happiness and sadness.That's all from me, thanks for reading :);Recommended

The whole thing is on Vimeo just look up the animators name and you'll find it. In terms of enjoyment per volume I would say this does a pretty great job at entertaining. It's got just enough intrigue to really justify the 16 seconds that it takes up. An animation like this just goes to show that something doesn't have to be long to be worthwhile. So I would say take a minute out of your day to watch this fun little animation you won't regret it.7/10 Good.;Recommended
0;Petting a Dog;Fenjir;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fenjir;5;"""You can't blame gravity for falling in love."" - Albert EinsteinMy life was fulfilled after watching 16 seconds of pure art. In just 16 seconds, Okuda Masaki, has managed to create the most meaningful story of all animes I have ever watched. I cried about fifty times (more times than I cried to SAO) to the amazing way Okuda Masaki showed us the perfect binding between the maincharacter and his dog. It strongly reminded me of the novel ""The Execution of Justice"" by Dürrenmatt, the reasons are self-explanatory. The story takes place in a blank nothing. That lets you concentrate entirely on the plot. In the middle of the scene you see a the maincharacter petting his dog, obviously pointing out the horrendous outcome of the world war 2. The way Okuda Masaki makes you aware of these problems is just flawless.";Mixed Feelings
0;Petting a Dog;DarthInvader;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DarthInvader;2;"TL;DR: There is a dog who is being petted. Need I say more?From the visionary animator Masaki Okuda who directed ONAs such as Count Down, Idea ga Tsukamamaranai and the unfinished project OO1, comes an ONA that’s the shortest he can ever make called “Petting a Dog.” This brilliant MS Paint animation may only be 16 seconds long but it’s definitely the sweet 16 seconds of your life!The story is simple. It didn’t try to make it complex. No added themes or imagery or motifs. Just a simple message of ""loving thy animal"" is portrayed throughout this ONA. You would think from the looks of it there is one main character in the show but the second character’s appearance what really takes it to the next level. You feel so connected with the emotion that not only do you sympathize with the dog, you start empathizing with it. That’s pretty big. Not a lot of directors know how to do that…yet.The art and the sound are in perfectly in sync with the animation style. Okuda really wanted to invoke the traditional MS Paint animation style most animators started off with. This nostalgic feeling paired with the action of petting a dog really hits you home with the coziness one feels experiencing this ONA brilliance!Overall, it will be a crime to not watch this ONA (unless you are allergic to dogs). I can guarantee this ONA has a huge replayability factor to further boost this already boosted ONA. You will surely watch it over and over again as you try to grasp the message behind this ONA savouring the sweet 16 feeling you once felt during your 16th birthday.I hope you found this review as helpful as finding a red dog and petting it!";Not Recommended

It's just about a group of magical girls singing and dancing in 3DCG. However, the choreography is quite good.Art (7/10)Maybe the best part(?). It gives me cute and cheerful feeling. Character models are well-drawn and move smoothly. The background is colorful and detailed.Sound (7/10)The song is ""Ima koko kara"", also used in the full movie of the same name. It's about a girl with the dream to change the world. Very ear-catching tune and easy to understand lyrics.Character (5/10)Because this video itself a music clip, of course there's no character development.

0;Usagi ga Kowai;gabiwave;https://myanimelist.net/profile/gabiwave;5;"So, I read the other reviews and even if I'm not going to comment on them specifically (maybe?) I must say that they're not fair, I don't think this short film is a 1/10 nor a 10/10.It has it's appeal and kept me entertained the whole time thinking what bizarre shit was going to happen next.Someone said ""It feels like a badly produced project a freshman in art school would make"" and that's exactly what it is, if you read the alternative titles it says ""Thinking and Drawing: Japanese Art Animation of the New Millennium"" which is a project where they train young animators by making them doing experimental weird films,Story:So, this short film is about a woman's dream (or nightmare?) about two rabbits. It begins with a quote saying that certain foods can have an influence on one's dreams. And then the DREAM begins, and that's important, that's why it is ""weird"", because it's a dream and yes, there is a plot, it's simple but it's there.Art:So, visually it's actually really weak, but again, it is a experimental animation by some students. It uses really limited animation with charcoal line drawings and some CGI and it adds and I think it's perfect for the film because it really adds to the disturbing feel of the film.The rabbits have been drawn in the style of Shinto statues, meaning that their ears are shorter and more pointed than Dick Bruna's Miffy or Sanrio's My Melody - the two kinds of bunnies currently most dominant in Japanese popular culture. They're one of the kind of rabbits that you would find in a nightmare, some shots of them were really weird.The film has a nostalgic feel to it, not only because of the style of the rabbits, but also due to elements of the mise-en-scene such as the backdrop of a large Japanese-style window and the use of a phonograph in one scene.Adding to the nostalgia is the artist's use of white on black intertitles that feature the two rabbits on either side of a kanji, illustrated in the traditional style often featured on stationery (particularly for the Year of the Rabbit).Sound:There are no music or voices, there is a screeching sound along the whole movie and I think it's totally fair if you hate it for it, it could be really annoying for some people. But, again, for me is one of the things that adds a disturbing and akward feel to it.The sound effects were nothing great, they just where there a little bit out of place but still very realist.Oh, and btw the scene where the rabbit cries over the other rabbit's coffin... I just didn't expect that, and I liked it.Overall:So... I would not say that this film is scary at all, maybe disturbing, maybe just akward or maybe a little depressing.If you're expecting something that makes you shit on your pants, this is not the place for you. And if you're expecting a conventional anime with conventional story and conventional art, what the hell are you doing in this side of MAL? Go watch some popular anime from the current season instead.Again, I liked this film but I can't give it a score higher than 5/10 and wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it's not actually ""good"", I just think it's interesting and somehow entertaining and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that so for me it's not fair to give it 1/10 and complain about how weird and non-sense it is when that's the fucking point.(note: sorry if this review is a mess, I'm not a native english speaker and never studied the language)";Mixed Feelings

Then the movie ends but does it? Up until the very last moment we think it is over but then you find yourself questioning it. No matter how you see it the ending is not exact. It is leaves for opinions.-art was black and white for the most part.-sound. My goodness! that was annoying. You might as well mute your volume for this unless you have a throat/dice fetish. There was nothing really obtained. No vocals. I think it was intentional to make you fear what was to come but my word.Like- I enjoyed the plot. It was scary for me.

0;Scandal;lithiumflower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lithiumflower;5;"""Huh? Where did the school festival go? ...Ah well.""SCANDAL's dozen one minute episodes are by nature quite restrictive, but this is a series that knows how to make the most of what it has! ...is what I would like to say, but unfortunately when the question of how to utilize a handful of 60 second segments was posed, SCANDAL had trouble finding an answer. Luckily, it's not without its charms.SCANDAL's brief duration doesn't give it a lot of room to develop much of a plot, and I came into it with low expectations accordingly. After all, semi-plotlessness can be fun too! Sadly, SCANDAL failed to get within even a stone's throw of my already low expectations. The vignettes are sparse, with very little to connect them and no semblance of segue from one to the next. Just when it seems they've found something to focus on, the episode will end and the next opens with something entirely different; the dawning realization that the new topic introduced will be dropped just as quickly is a frustrating one. The closest SCANDAL has to an overarching storyline is the girls' intent to put together a band so they can perform at their school festival. After the first episode this purpose is touched on only twice in the entire duration of the series: first when one girl comments they need to be sure to return home in time for the school festival, and then the last line in the series, quoted above. The entire purpose is almost immediately lost in the series' ""free association"" style plot, and it's not creative or entertaining. It's simply poor storytelling.This would be much less damning if the series was character-driven, but it falls flat in that respect as well. The girls are not developed; I'm hard pressed to say they're even established to begin with. They are generic to the point of being interchangeable. They're stylish, trendy, allegedly musically talented, and entirely forgettable to the point that I can't even remember their names. At least the one personality they all seem to share is a cute one...SCANDAL doesn't have a lot to brag about aesthetically, but my expectations were low there as well and I'd say they were pretty much met. The cute, oversimplified style works nicely with the sparse plot and characterization but in a substantially less troublesome manner. The animation itself is choppy and somewhat awkward, but again, it just seems to work somehow.The audio aspect is split down the middle, unfortunately, with the half falling flat being the voice work. As the characters are voiced by the girls they represent and these girls are obviously not voice actors I was not expecting much, but they delivered so little I had to wonder if they were even trying. Their collective tendency to slur and mumble becomes grating quickly; even though they are meant to represent themselves, it seems they gave no consideration to the requirements of the animated medium or the benefits of enunciation. Perhaps fittingly, though, the music is pretty good, although the episode lengths limit exposure to it.I think the overall problem with SCANDAL is that it's geared toward existing fans of the band, and I am simply not in that demographic. If you're looking to become a fan and are thinking of this as a place to start, do reconsider. That said, existing fans will probably derive much more enjoyment from these brief, random episodes that I did, so they shouldn't let my criticisms dampen their enthusiasm. And heck, I wouldn't watch the series a second time, but I certainly don't regret watching it through once, and I doubt it would hurt anyone to sacrifice the 12 minutes required to give it a try themselves. After all, it's not without its charms.";Mixed Feelings
1;Scandal;Chinaz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chinaz;5;"Do you hear J-music? Do you even know what it is?Well, the SCANDAL band is here to prove it.It is rare to see nowadays, anime about music, more precisely anime about specific bands. It doesn't mean that there is no anime with musicals or just the content of the song but the goal is always the part that has music in it. This anime is about the band SCANDAL and tries to show this .. but it fails in the execution.Scandal (or in Japanese - スキャンダル) is a group of J-Rock / J-Pop. They are by themselves, the most powerful female group in Japan, Scandal is formed by girls from the Osaka area and the group is very energetic and balanced because there is no particular role for each belonging, there is an equality to share the position of singer. The band was created in 2006 and since then they have been in the active, you probably know the band by playing openings / endings of well-known anime like ""Full Metal Alchemist"", ""Bleach"" or more recently ""Pokémon XY: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction"".Let's move on to the anime now. I'm not saying that you can not see this or that this anime is simply a waste, I'm saying that you only need to see this if you already had it on ""Plan to Watch"" or if you already had it marked in your browser as the next anime to see. The problem of this is, I stress again, execution.The anime ""SCANDAL"" has its charms and it's cute (you can even say it's too girly for boys) but there is no general development of characters, environment or anything. The good / positive things that I can get out of here is that this anime is an opportunity for those who didn't know the band, to actually know it better, to know how a japanese band acts (in this case of j-pop gender), to see that the band when in the acting is completely different from a group of friends who just want to have fun and see that they are classmates in school (and with that come the purposes of the school, one of them playing in the school festival), otherwise the purpose of playing as a group is forgotten because the background of the anime shows more the 'girly' side which in this case turns out to be more advantageous. The purpose in the last episode is forgotten and the anime turns out to be just ""one more anime"" for those who collects series or for those that just like to see short animes.In short: This anime only passes by knowing the group because otherwise, it is a story badly worked and is not creative at all.Including my personal taste for the group that already had before seeing this anime, I think this deserves a reasonable note, the true group sings pretty good and is thoroughly appreciated by japanese fans especially from the Osaka area where the group was created.";Mixed Feelings
2;Scandal;b0b4;https://myanimelist.net/profile/b0b4;6;"Honestly, just a cute compilation of a new teen band trying to navigate through their lives!The anime introduces four high school girls who have decided to create a rock band. Something I particularly found enjoyable was that a few episodes focused on certain characters rather than the whole group. This created some sort of depth while still keeping the whole show lighthearted and artful, in a sense.I think it's really catchy, for lack of a better term, and it is helping me learn Japanese, a trait not many animes have the simplicity to have. It is also based of of a real band, which I think is really neat and adds a different touch to the show. I recommend it for people who want to get... ""used"" to watching anime... if that makes sense(?), without getting into a long plot, and having to put in a grueling amount of devotion.Of course, these kinds of animes aren't for everyone! For example, I don't usually watch these kinds of shorts, as I'm more into the psychological and suspense genre, so I didn't particularly feel at home with the lack of depth in the characters or ""plot"". At the same time, that's okay, because it's not meant to be that kind of anime! It really depends on the watcher, so give it a try if you're looking for something astoundingly short and easy!(This is my first review, I apologize if it's not informative or formal enough.)";Mixed Feelings
0;Emblem Take 2;Maleel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Maleel;9;"This is only anime I can find that actually tackle the Yakuza seriously (That has been translated), and boy is this a good one for that. It's unfortunate that this never really gets off its feet before it ends, but i'm grateful for what I got regardless.Emblem Take 2 really doesn't aim to show the Yakuza in a positive light which is a good thing as far as i'm concerned, they're the Mafia, they shouldn't be glorified. It shows them as cheap, petty, conniving bastards. It shows some of the awful ways Yakuza go about their business, such as when our main character Jouji terrorizes a dirt poor family for their money. But it also shows how a lot of them are only in it because they need the money and have no other option because they fucked up, such as our main character or those university boys who were kicked out after getting drunk. And how they're constantly fighting in a business where only the fittest survive. The one downside to Emblem Take 2's story though is that it doesn't really end conclusively since it's only two OVAs which probably didn't do too well.Visually Emblem Take 2 impresses me since it looks kind of good considering it's a 90's OVA that was bound to fail due to its target audience not existing or being very small in the anime world. It's nothing too spectacular mind you, it's no Cowboy Bebop or Macross that's for sure, but it looks good enough that I thought it might be worth a mention. The animation certainly can be a lot worse than it is. In terms of sound i'm not sure I can say much since i'm not Japanese nor do I know much Japanese, so I don't feel like I can judge Japanese voice actors. But even so, I feel like I can say that the voice actors did in noticeable well in certain scenes such as the opening one with Jouji's getting beat up. The music itself is actually better than I would have expected. Some of the tracks that come on sound very generic 90's, but overall the background music felt very ""mafia"" if that's a word and as a result fit the show.I feel like there's not much to say about the characters other than the fact that they felt very believable, and very natural and the one that mattered most was well written and interesting (Jouji of course, and his lady friend). Most of the characters might not show a lot of depth (Maybe they do in the manga, but I don't think that's translated into English) but I feel like expecting that out of two 40 minute OVAs would be a little too much.Ultimately, Emblem Take 2 is a nice anime and certainly the one i'd pick for most underwatched and underrated out of the anime i've watched. If you are reading this and haven't watched it already, I would 100% recommend it if you want to see an anime about Yakuza or even crime drama about organized crime in general.Final Score: 9/10";Recommended

Yeah they don't explain completely why are they fighting for or the reason for how the world is having these mystical manifestations but again it isn't stupid with what they are showing us.The characters are tropes, you have your easy going girl, your tomboyish girl, your cute and I like everything cute girl and more anime girl cliche characteristics that you can imagine but they do the job. They don't shovel to the face their unidimenstional traits every single time until you get it.With the art sorry to be bias but damn the 90s animation and characters designs are the best for me. They are wonderful to look at, that combination of dark palettes with the bright colors works perfectly. The backgrounds are so well made. This art style is simply great and the animation is smooth and clear in every shot.Sound is okayish in most parts. The tracks used are good but not memorable, they work as they intended but the melodies won't get stuck in your head and the ending song is nice, but again is your cute ending song.My conclusion on Idol Fighter Suchi Pai, it is one of those OVAs of the 90s if you want to see how was the animation back in those days. The story doesn't have any massive plot and makes you say that is outstanding but it is a fun ride that doesn't drag with the themes and ideas they want to share and also I hope that this is NOT one of those cases where the show is bad because of the English Dub.Thanks for taking time in reading this review, Sorry for any english errors I don't speak english as my main language. Take care in whatever you do and see you around.";Recommended
0;Idol Fight Suchie-Pai 2;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;1;"Welcome back to another exciting episode of ""This actually exists""! Back in the 1980s, erotic games or ""Eroge"" on the PC were very popular in Japan. I previously covered this topic in my review of ADV's early comedy Dragon Knight. The Japanese PC-88 model could produce 8 bit graphics like the original NES, but didn't have any qualms about being family friendly. You want want 8 bit lewd lolis? You got 8 bit lewd lolis! Some of the most popular eroge games were strip poker and ESPECIALLY strip mahjong!Idol Fighter was one of these strip mahjong games featuring original character designs from Kenichi Sonoda of Gunsmith Cats fame! If you won a round of Mahjong, you got to see an 8 bit scan of a nude Sonoda drawing. Hooray! In the year 1996, a full 10 years later, this bare bones strip game was made into a single episode OVA. This OVA was then brought over to the United States, recieved an official dub, and was available to purchase on VHS and early DVD!I want people to think about that for a second. The United States is the country where in 2019 we STILL have never recieved a dub of Bakemonogatari. It's one of the most popular anime in the world and yet every US dub studio turned up their noses at it. They all said ""Meh, all this Japanese wordplay won't translate and nobody actually wants to see this shit!"" America never recieved a dub or physical release of Ashita no Joe, Galactic Heroes, Tatami Galaxy, Heidi of the Alps, Anne of Green Gables, or half the series MAL worships. If you live in the US and want to see any of those series, the only thing you can do is pirate them online. Yet SOMEHOW, we recieved a dub and physical release of a strip mahjong game adaptation from 1986!This anime doesn't really have a story. It has a bunch of disjointed scenes where girls fight each other and transform into bunny girls and cat girls. This anime was storyboarded and had pieces loosely pasted together, but I don't think it would be accurate to say this anime was ""written"". Of course the plot of the original game was just Mahjong. What's the plot of Chess? Go? Shogi? There is no plot.Do you want to know what the worst part of all is? There isn't any nudity in this anime! The characters act like they're going to stip, but it never happens! People paid real, actual money for this DVD and it doesn't even serve as the most basic of jerkoff material. I remember going over to a friend's house in 1997 and he was SO proud of this naughty anime picture he found online! It was a shitty Jpeg transfer of a screenshot of the nude bathing scene from MSG: The 8th Mobile Suit Team. It probably took him 30 minutes to download and it looked like pixelated garbage, but you could sort of make out breasts. Even THAT is better than this anime! Fuck this anime and Fuck America!";Not Recommended
1;Idol Fight Suchie-Pai 2;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;4;Idol Fighter Su-Chi-Pai II is apparently based on a Mahjong game series by Jaleco. I've never played the games, so I had no real frame of reference going into this.The plot is thin, but it basically involves the collecting of nine different Mahjong tiles. However, you won't know this until the very end. The storyline throughout the episode itself is slapdash and likes to jump around to different scenes without any real transition or explanation why. It spends most of it's time introducing each new character.The characters weren't terrible, but weren't anything too original, either. The acting for them was done well, and they were fun to watch on screen, but they're all such typical characters that it's hard to find any of them interesting or memorable.Overall, I wouldn't call this good at all, but it had it's moments. The animation was acceptable and on-par with other productions at the time of it's release... and while the characters are stereotypical, they still manage to be written decently enough to have a laugh or two.I give it a 4 out of 10.;Not Recommended
0;Ojamajo Doremi: Owarai Gekijou;Animelover875;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animelover875;7;"Ojamajo Doremi Owarai Gekijou is a comedic style based on the series, with one to two minute shorts. All of these tell a single self-contained story or joke and have little relevance to anything. It's basically cute girls slapped on a screen in a crudely drawn (intentional??) style, and if that's your thing, you'll love this. A lot of the skits are great and quite easy to get through, though the main issue here is consistency of quality; while a majority of them are hilarious, some of them are awkward or don't allow for enough time to even land a joke; several ""episodes"" hang onto a single joke and run with it and if you don't find that funny, the entire skit is pretty much wasted. That said, they're only a minute or two long and at least worth trying out, though there are a lot of continuity-based jokes. You can watch it standalone, but if you watch it in the context of the series like I did, a lot of them will be hilarious, with only some or a few being misses.";Recommended

Sadly, most attractions are one sided. This is why we have restraining orders and the police to aid us during these troubling times. This anime uses this strong desire to show how with enough devoting any human can change to a troubling beast.-Given the strong implied negative it is not a surprise the conclusion would be sad. I am guessing the director was not dissing prayer but saying you can't escape fate or that we are on our alone in life.Art-color-puppet outlook-color isn't what you would expect in certain matters like water.

This is a pretty short anime so the characters don't really get fleshed out. That being said the artwork is great for the time period, I enjoyed the score, and although the plot could have been strengthened with more time and development it is pretty sturdy. If I had watched a typical 12 episode half hour each anime I would be quite disappointed, but for the amount of time allotted, this series it is pretty damn good.

0;Juan Siliang;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;8;"The island of Siliang Recap (minor spoilers)Siliang island is a mythical land surrounded by vast never-ending seas; The inhabitants are stray gods that have been exiled by command of other gods in the heaven realm. On Siliang island, gods succumb to mortal fate by aging or falling ill to sickness while most of their cultivation have been suppressed or wiped completely. They have no way of leaving the island since they dissolve when submerged in sea water; They do however believe of heavenly redemption, an event that occurs every 500 years where representatives of the heaven realm will open a portal and descend on the island where exiled gods can return after passing trials.Among the gods community are several families/factions that have come to a mutual agreement of ruling on the island. Each faction nominates an elder that takes part in diplomatic decisions and rule-enforcement on the island. 10 years prior to the story, the Shang family used a forbidden formation sacrificing children in order to return to the heavenly realm early; After a shred of guilt, Shang wife attempts to fall into the sea while the castor, Shang husband follows. After the unsuccessful attempt of saving the wife and completing the formation Siliang island was in panic as the formation caused rising in sea levels killing many immortals and gods. The Siliang residents assumed the Shang family had been wiped out but under the guise of a powerful elder, the Shang son waits for the moment to discover what truly happened that caused his parent's demise.Story & Characters: 8/10The first 4 episodes feel very empty and uneventful; Most of the details shared this early in the series made no sense and discerning the main character became a confusing task. However, after episode 4 the story begins to take shape and the characters introduced in the beginning start to connect with the story. The island of Siliang takes a mystery adventure approach to cultivation and wuxia elements; We are purposefully fed vague details of events and characters in the beginning to make assumptions and become more engage with the trivial knowledge of SIliang island. The story shows how when stripped of power, the gods think no different than humans by sabotaging each other, failing to recognize their weaknesses and living short lives. The story's antagonist is very confusing and doesn't develop until the end of the season but it allows us to visit every character in depth and familiarize their behavior.I'm really enjoying this series, it has quite a few flaws but the characters are written so detailed - they each have their own struggles which is clearly displayed throughout the series. (Xu Daughter's struggle is arranged inheriting marriage, Xiang Yu/Ji struggle is his family's imprisonment, Tu Li's struggle is her father, Jing Xuan's struggle is his parents and attraction to Tu Li and so forth. In contrast to many mystery anime, this donghua definitely beats it in keeping me engaged most of the time especially with characters that have a lot of conflict with each other and have different connections/relations.Art & Sound: 8/10 & 7/10Since I really enjoyed the story and characters the art and animation was a bonus for me; The visuals were really detailed you could zoom in and see pores, wrinkles and even individual strands of hair movement. I enjoyed how highly detailed the male character designs were but I wished some of the young female characters didn't have the skin glow/blur because it kind of ruins the character details. The elder characters felt realistic even Xu grandma or grandpa Heng's facial design were very real. You can tell that in order to compensate for the detail, the series opted to go the keyframed route for character rigging. It does seem obvious by the way the characters have robotic movement and mouth movements; I really did find Tu Li's lip biting an interesting touch to her character design though.The sound wasn't as extravagant for me as the art and animation but I can tell there was a lot of groundwork for voice actors in the island of Siliang. The ambient world sounds didn't feel as atmospheric as I'd hope but it wasn't as bad considering the visual worldbuilding and atmospheric encapsulation.Overall & Enjoyment: 8/10 & 7/10The story isn't for everyone; The main character is a female 60% of the time and the other 40% is a mix of characters including Jing Xuan son of Shang family patriarch. A lot of round about character development like Tu Li being deceived by Xiang Yu/Ji because she empathizes with 'mortals' despite having the strength of many immortals. I didn't enjoy Jing Xuan's tsundere phase in the show when he follows Tu Li because it just shows his hypocrisy to take responsibility. It does get somewhat progressed in the end but unintentionally. Overall, really interesting watch and least expected it to be a good donghua.";Recommended

Among them, the gods are in charge of the laws governing the world.Siliang Island is a place of exile built by the gods to punish other gods and immortals who have committed terrible sins. Located at the junction of the Divine Realm and the Heavenly Realm, it is sealed off between both realms. After being exiled here, gods and immortals will experience birth, aging, sickness and death same as a mortal. Upon contact with the seawater around the island, they will burn up and vanish from existence.Legend has it that every five hundred years, there will be a ""Heavenly Redemption"", gods, immortals and descendants of those trapped here can leave the island and return to the heavens as long as they pass the test. However, some gods and immortals do not have the patience for that.One day, an immortal man by the name of Shang Zhen sets up a magic formation that involves the sacrifice of children, determined to break through the barrier and escape from Siliang Island. Causing an abrupt rise in the sea levels, flooding parts of the island and causing the lives of many. His wife, overwhelmed by guilt, dies by committing suicide via falling into the sea. The man tries to save his wife, but ends up failing and joining her in death. This leaves their child, Jing Xuan and adopted mortal daughter, Tu Li on the island.After the incident, Jing Xuan and Tu Li got separated from each other. Jing Xuan goes undercover to figure out the truth behind the incident while protecting Tu Li from harm in the shadows. On one of his missions, he discovers that no one has ever been able to leave the island for millennia.That begs the question,""Is the heavenly redemption real?""""How did a mortal girl even end up on an island for exiled gods and immortals?""Source: translated from Baidu and also edited with my own understanding of the show.My actual review:The plot of the story was very intriguing. Not to mention the uniqueness of the world building. Characters are well written, each with their distinct characteristics. THE ANIMATIONS OH GOD YOU GUYS NEED TO GIVE THIS A TRY. LIKE I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE STORY, JUST WATCH LIKE LITERALLY 10 SECONDS OF IT AND YOU'LL SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS. HOLY THE ANIMATORS DID A VERY GOOD JOB AT THIS, SOMEONE GIVE THEM A RAISE. THE WATER ANIMATION LOOKS SO REALISTIC, THE INDIVIDUAL HAIR STRANDS, THE CLOTH MOVEMENTS, EVEN THE CLOSE UPS OF THEIR EYES AND LIPS. MY DAD THOUGHT THE OLD LADY IN THE SHOW WAS A REAL PERSON BECAUSE OF HOW REAL HER WRINKLES LOOKED.I streamed it on discord with my friends 4 times in a day and they all loved it. They didn't get the storyline though since they need to read the subtitles and the animation was just too distracting for them to pay attention to the story. They just watched it for the animation.

This show definitely takes patience to sit through.

If this was a game, I definitely main her. She isn't weak, has an ambitious personality, and all around skilled. The male lead feels a bit of a Mary Sue, but this season barely reveals anything about him, so i will reserve my opinion.I would say the elder dynamic is very interesting. It's a typical story writing to have rival families fight amongst each other in these Chinese anime, but it never gets old. I am definitely on team Elder Feng if you know what I mean!The visuals are honestly stunning and I am pretty sure most people watched the series because of it.

4;Juan Siliang;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;9;"This donghua is one of the most detailed and beautifully animated donghuas I've seen.Brief Summary: Its story takes place on an island of exiled/criminal deities(or immortals), trapped because either they or their ancestors broke some rules in the upper world. Among these exiled deities exists a mortal who arrived at this island around 10 years ago. 10 years ago, not long after her arrival, an incident happened where someone tried to escape the imprisonment and failed. Now 10 years later, a status quo has been established and life has returned mostly to normal, until a new batch of mortals arrives to once again kick off a storm (especially because of what happened 10 years ago after the first batch of mortals arrived).The story is told mostly through eyes of Tu Li, the sole mortal on the island, and Jing Xuan, whose family caused the incident 10 years ago and thought to have died. Tu Li wishes to leave the island because she wants to see the world her father came from and because of the discrimination against her by the local inhabitants; Jing Xuan was rescued by someone in order to help her escape, but he wants to unravel the mysteries behind his parent's failure during the incident 10 years ago. Other families and factions are portrayed quite well, as each individual character has their own unique traits and goals in this donghua.My only complaint about this donghua is its length. We get to see the status quo, and the breaking of the status quo due to the arrival of a new batch of mortals. Now things have been shaken up, and long repressed conflicts are about to break out again, but the show then ends. It certainly leaves a good hook to encourage watching the second season (whenever it comes out), but the cut off seems a bit too abrupt. Despite that, I highly recommend this.";Recommended
0;Sasurai no Taiyou;yokoelf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/yokoelf;8;"Unlike recent anime trends, which is flooded with average, unhappy or frustrated anime protagonists that gets teleported to worlds where their discontents are magically solved, the 70's often feature protagonists that come from below (often poverty) and that have to face and overcome critical adversities by themselves. They usually show an inspiring strength to endure the often exceedingly unfair and blood-boiling situations they are put into, and sincere courage to face difficulties. You see such examples in anime like Ashita no Joe, Attack No.1 and Candy Candy.Sasurai no Taiyou, much to my pleasant surprise, follows this trend as well, featuring the tale of a girl who, being switched from her rich birth family as a baby, ends up living in a very poor house, and the story develops between her dream to become a songstress and the many hardships she faces in her life, which more often than not comes from her plain lack of money. Her ""rival"", and antagonist, Miki, who is the other switched baby, often uses her family's wealth and influence to bribe her way into success, while Nozomi has to face every sort of realistic difficulty.This is an anime that develops a quite grounded story, with most events being authentic and engaging. While the focus is on Nozomi's late-teen professional, family and romantic life, there's also, in parallel, the underlying plot of the babies having been switched at birth, which you know was the secret scheme of a nurse that sometimes appears and influences the episodes - but this story stays unsolved and it keeps you in anticipation of its eventual resolution throughout the anime. And, of course, add to all of this a bit of a seasoning of music, being Nozomi a songstress-to-be.If you liked any of the other 70's anime I mentioned before, it's very likely you will like this one as well. You'll see many similarities here and there, including a strict, ""Mr. Miyagi""-like coach. I recommend giving this anime a chance if you like any of the themes I mentioned, or a different type of main character and story that's becoming more unusual by the day.";Recommended
1;Sasurai no Taiyou;Diogo_Gomes_1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Diogo_Gomes_1995;8;"Well well well... What do we have here? Another obscure anime show from 1971 by Mushi Production. The same people that brought us many of Ozamu Tezuka's anime adaptations and Ashita No Joe?Why yes it is! Sasurai No Taiyou (Also known as Wandering Sun) is an anime show released in the early 70s made by Mushi Production. It's based off the manga of the same name by Keisuke Fujikawa, who was also involved in the anime industry as he worked on multiple anime shows in the 70s such as Mazinger Z and Cutey Honey.Like before, there's not much is known about this anime outside of japan since not that many people talk about this.So what could this anime be all about? Let's find out:First off, the story is the most interesting and the best part of the anime:It tells the story of two girls named ""Nozomi"" and ""Miki"" who were born from two different families. One is a rich family and the other is a very poor one who lived in the slums of the city. However, one individual by the name of ""Michiko Nohara"" secretly switched the two babies from each family due to a very personal grudge.17 years later, Nozomi, now being transfered to the same school as Miki, finally met each others without noticing that they were switched from each of their families. Miki would treat her like crap due to coming from a very poor family and of course being a rich girl she is, while Nozomi tries to get to know better with her without holding any grudge againts her.And yet the one thing that both girls share is a dream to become a singer. So while Miki would do anything she can to become a very popular singer just to make Nozomi miserable, Nozomi would strive and do anything she can to become a singer. Going from bars, to taking a tour and helping others in needs.It's a story of hardships and tribulations of both girls striving to become a singer while not knowing the fact that they were switched from each family by one individual.And man, this story is very interesting! What i love about this story is that not only it tells a very interesting story and episodes of where theses girls trying to become singers, but also highlighting the darkside of the music industry and how becoming a singer is not as glamorous as it sounds.You get to see how Nozomi would be treated when she's involved in many situations. Whether it would be singing in any bars, working at a composer's house to get to learn to be a singer, going to tours without the composer's permission and among others.As the series goes on, things gets pretty dark and serious when awful things happens to Nozomi. Whether it would be her Father's serious injuries that he got from the Yakuza or how Fanny tries to hide her from his true identity.As it goes on, the story starts to get pretty serious and sad as noticed in many episodes.The same thing can be said about the characters themselves. You got two main characters of the show, Nozomi Mine and Miki Koda.Nozomi is a character that i truly admire. Despite coming from a poor family and despite being treated like crap by Miki and despite having many blocks that she has to get through, she does anything she can to become a singer, without giving up on it. From her personality to her looks and the history surrounding her, she's the one who stands out from the others in this anime.Miki on the other hand, serve as Nozomi's rival. She's the reason why Nozomi tries to be careful with her since Miki is not the type of character who would be expected to be nice to others. She always bickers at her and treat her like garbage to the point of doing anything she can to ruin her life and carreer.Both theses two characters are the reason that drive the story to continue to get interesting as it shows a huge rivalry between theses two in a way that it can get quite shocking and interesting as well.As for the rest of the characters, you have some that serve a purpouse to the story. Such as Fanni/Hisashi who would try to hide his identity from Nozomi about who he really is outside of being a friend to her. And also, you have Isao Egawa, the composer, who at first he only cares about Miki since he takes music lessons with her, but does deeply care about Nozomi's carreer as a singer.While others like Nozomi's uncle, Kumagoro, would serve as a supporting character who would do anything he can to help out Nozomi whenever she needs it.Each characters are also very interesting and also another factor why the story is great.The sound is good, too. You have many great musical scores and songs that are played through out the show. Kokoro no Uta is another beautiful song that was worth hearing it multiple times.Same thing the voice acting, they are great and do give life to the characters' voices. This includes the singer Junko Fujiyama as the voice of Nozomi. Who despite sounding pretty old for a very young character, does a nice job portraying the character the way it wants to be.But not all things comes off as great. There are a few flaws that can get pretty distracting.First off, you have the sound effects. Now, i get what they are trying to do with the sound effects. They are trying to give more life and suspense to certain scenes to make it stand out from what it wants to show. But i feel that there are some minor scenes that don't even need the sound effects to be played out all the time. Like for example, when someone finds out something fishy about a certain thing.But by far, the biggest problem with this show is of course the animation itself.*Sigh* Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Nozomi and some other characters' designs. They look fine as they are. But for some reason, the budget for the animation is waaaaaay too limited. And as a result, you're gonna get a few moments where the animation starts to act weird on it's own. Like when there's an extreme close up to Kumagoro, or how the camera shakes for no apparent reason, or how some of the people's character designs look very ugly and weird even by 70s standards.Of course i know that i should not expect anything marvelous about the animation since it was made in 1971. The budget is very limited and the technology just isn't that advanced. But they could, however, take some time to fix them. But instead, it feels very rushed and mediocre that i couldn't give this anime as much higher rating than it deserved.But yeah, even with thoses two issues i had with this anime while having an experience with it, overall, i loved the anime.The story is outstanding, the characters are great, the sound is great (Although mishandled) and the music is absolutely great as well.And for a anime that tackles on the Music industry for the first time in history, it was a nice piece of history to learn about it. I think this might be the first one to do so. Which would later become a plot point for many music animes like Creamy Mami, Wake Up, Girls! and Love Live!.It's also worth noting that the storyboard for this anime is done by Yoshiyuki Tomino. The man behind Mobile Suit Gundam and many other mecha shows that came after it. So it's very interesting to see how this anime turned out to be and it's almost great.Aside of the mediocre animation and some weird uses of sound effects, i had a great time watching this one as well.The anime's already subbed by OldCastle fansubs. So i'd say you'll just have to torrent or watch it somewhere that has the subs for Sasurai No Taiyou like Gogoanime.But yeah, give this anime a shot. It's a wonderful and tragic show that i will not forget until the end of time.Anyway, that's my review of Sasurai No Taiyou (Or Wandering Sun as it's called).

0;Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke;simplereviewer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/simplereviewer;5;Script - A boy learns magic to defeat an evil witch. It's a simplistic black and white tale that only children would appreciate in terms of writing. Historic anachronism isn't something I'm a fan of and the film surely had value for its time, where japanese people were still trying to restore their cultural pride. But it's simply unavoidable to not ignore the silliness in which the plot is based. The protagonist goes after the witch and means to defeat her because she harmed one of his animal friends, but instead of facing a specific struggle, everything is quite easy if you think about it. Apparently, he has the talent, the bravery and intelligence to do as he wants and, at the end, everything is solved without a drop of poignancy whatsoever. It has a way more natural dialogue than its predecessor Hakujaden and the pacing is also faster and will probably not bore one to death, but that also doesn't help beyond it not staying more than necessary. Some stories simply age better, some don't. Time is cruel and simplism is not by far my cup of tea, regardless of period.Cinematography - Considering its predecessor for some reason is more famous and regarded, I must say it's actually better visually than Hakujaden. The faces are thin and sometimes very weird, but overall the care is notable and impressive most of the time. It's a movie and it was surely ambitious technically speaking. The movements are more natural than Hakujaden as well and less idealized. Good stuff.Sound - The voices are ok for its time. They're less annoying and more tuned to the mood of the show. Forced, but not bad for sure. The soundtrack is fine, the sound effects are actually very good, and I was surprised. It's common to hear a lot of buzzes and outplaced tracks here and there, so it's a plus.1234 - I prefer not to nitpick about this, I feel like it's a waste of my time. Whatever I've noticed as flawed or weak is not gonna pass unnoticed by anyone else. However, something that always bugs me and for some reason persists until this very day is the lack of interest in subverting the trope 'ugly bastard'. Seriously, it's impossible to imagine a show from the time doing something out of the rule 'good is pretty, bad is ugly' and honestly, something like that is what could have made this show a lot better. Wanna make a faithful adaptation, cool, but you can change some minor details in order to surprise your viewers as long they make sense. Try it.This is a show you can watch and will probably not be a bad experience, but time has ruined its intent. Its moral values and messages are as poignant as the more mediocre Disney movie ever and besides the aesthetics, there's nothing to it at all. Still, I respect the ambition and understand the intent pretty well. The End.;Mixed Feelings
1;Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke;bennitori;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bennitori;5;"I would like to state first and foremost that this is an extremely important anime historically. This was one of the first theatrically released feature films from Toei Animation. It was also one of the first colored anime features films. The impact that this film had on anime as a whole is huge. That said, this film has not aged very well.Story: 4The story is all over the place. It takes forever for the main conflict to get started. First we follow some woodland creatures until one of them gets killed. Then we follow Sasuke as he goes to train and learn magic. Then there's something about bandits. And then the bandits disappear for a bit. But then by the time Sasuke's done training, you've forgotten why he left in the first place. Then we have to worry about his sister that got kidnapped. The pacing is inconsistent, and conflicts are thrown around until you forget about earlier ones. Also be careful of which subs you watch. Sometimes the subs are flat out wrong. Even with my limited Japanese, I could tell that certain phrases were incorrect. This can lead to further confusion if you can't catch the errors.Art: 7The art on the other hand is the best part of this movie. The character designs suffer from weird anatomy and creepy faces. You could tell they were trying to copy Disney, while still making the film ""Japanese."" However, they hit a slightly uncanny valley in that regard. It's not too bad. But it does take out some of the immersion in some scenes. The animals on the other hand are done very well. The backgrounds are also nice. I absolutely love the way the animation things like fire, teleportation and liquid.Sound: 7Another highlight of the film. Aside from some inconsistent lip sync (which is more an art problem than a sound problem) the sound is integrated very well into the film. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about. But things like whip cracks, lightning and other sound effects are very well done. The soundtrack is appropriate and well done.Character: 3The characters have little to no character whatsoever. Sasuke is a generic determined boy. His sister doesn't even have a name (or at least in the subs I saw she didn't.) The prince and witch are generic as well. Oddly the side characters have more character than most of the main cast. There is a side plot about a girl that won't leave these two bandits alone after they stole her trunk. That plot point gets forgotten about. But the lengths the bandits go to try and make her go away were entertaining. The girl however was annoying as hell. Most of the animals have their own quirks. But it's not enough to carry a whole movie.Enjoyment: 6In spite of this movie's flaws, I did enjoy it a bit. There was a final showdown between the witch and Sasuke that was very well done. The bandits and girl side plot was funny, even if it never got resolved. There was a scene involving a deer trying to follow Sasuke that I liked. There are things to enjoy about this movie. If you are an enthusiast I could see somebody being mildly entertained. The film is also made more fun by trying to point out all of the Snow White and Sleeping Beauty tropes that were probably being borrowed in this film.Overall: 5Like I said before, this film is historically important. If you are a film historian, then this will not be the worst film you've ever seen. However, this movie still has not aged well at all. You could tell a lot of effort was put into this film. And in some areas like animation and sound, that hard work has paid off. I just wish more thought was put into things like pacing, character and story.";Mixed Feelings

3;Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;"Like most other TOEI doga films of the period, Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke or Magic Boy, has a lot of issues. Its major distinguishing factor is that it was the first Japanese animated feature to be exported and dubbed into the US. But when it comes to quality, the story is a leap backwards. Again.The animation quality has regressed from the highs of Hakujaden, a feature film produced by the same studio just a year earlier. While the repeated reuse of frames and tepid background art does not reach the blatant low levels of ""The Littlest Warrior"", it is still far below the standards the studio set for itself with some stellar animation with Hakujaden and Sayuuki.I watched this film two ways. First the original Japanese version with fan made subtitles and secondly the official English language localization made for American audiences in the 60s. I have to say that in this case the English localization was actually superior to the original voice work in Japanese. Neither are particularly good, which in itself points to the half hearted effort made when it came to the original sound design.A lot of scenes feel empty and devoid of life, because there is no music or sound effects to bolster what is happening on screen. The various characters all sound almost the same - often speaking in an inchoate fashion - clearly because the animators couldn't bother animating scenes long enough for suitable dialogue to be used.Once again the imitation of Disney character designs of the animals, which seem to be lifted straight out of the other TOEI doga films without any modifications whatsoever, add little to the plot and serve to bog down the pacing. While the animals and their antics are cute to observe, they fail to add any context to the overall narrative only become impediments in the otherwise rather dark human character stories.The only reason I'm grading this better than the Littlest Warrior is because of the rather dark and psychedelic final battle with the witch and the rudimentary training montages with increased my enjoyment of the film by a notch. The ending battle was the one section of the movie where it felt like the studio was actually experimenting with the medium and taking risks, inserting some horror elements into a children's animated story.";Mixed Feelings
0;Shounen Sarutobi Sasuke;Assthete;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Assthete;4;Following Hakujaden, this picture also begs the question of why the screenwriters couldn't simply mesh what was clearly meant to appeal to children and the actual storyline. These old movies can feel so divided between the gratuitous cuteness and what supposedly matters. I know the moral lesson, whichever it is, can only be absorbed by sticking to the latter, but that takes a lot of potential quality away. Like with Hakujaden, I'd rather spend one hour watching cute animals doing cute stuff than boring main characters fighting over something I don't care about that happens to be constantly discontinued for the sake of pleasing kids, which boils down to one request: make an actual children's movie god damn it! Japanese animators had such attachment to their folklore, but it was only when they started thinking outside the box the problem ceased to be. That could also have been avoided by making Sasuke's journey interesting to begin with, which sadly never happened. It's as boring as you get. The movie is an improvement on its predecessor and far more pleasing to watch given the fact being colored isn't its only concern. Here we also see the first semblance of accurately moving mouths. There really isn't much else to say. At least it's not as bad as Saiyuuki.;Not Recommended
0;Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Picture Drama;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;4;You know it's a travesty when a picture drama is better animated, paced, and sounding than the parent show. And that was no overstatement.It's hard to comprehend how the creators of this show thought that adding a picture drama was a good idea. It's almost as if they were intentionally trying to make the viewer's experience worse. I mean, who in their right mind would want to sit through more of this nonsense? It's like they were trying to see how much punishment their audience could take before completely giving up on the show altogether.And don't even get me started on the fact that these episodes were a minute each. If they were any longer, I would have seriously considered seeking professional help. It's like they were teasing us with just a taste of the unbearable torture that awaited us in the main show.Honestly, even masochism has its limits, and this show definitely pushed me to the brink of my tolerance. If I had to sit through any more of this mind-numbing drivel, I think I would have ended up causing myself some serious harm. So, thank you, creators, of this show, for sparing us a little bit of agony with these one-minute episodes.;Not Recommended

It wasn't distorted like some of the older anime can be, the music was simple riffs that were timed perfectly to go along with situations.Some Characters were rather predictable, Once you figure out what is happening you can basically guess who is who.Overall, I definitely enjoyed this old OVA. The characters were interesting enough, the plot didn't drag on and on, the story knew exactly where it wanted to go.I would personally watch this series again since the first time around the translations were just AWFUL, but I'm not letting that stop me from coming out with a positive attitude.

0;Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshou;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;5;Let's talk about Dragon Quest. For a time, this was the big series of JRPGs competing with Final Fantasy in North America and Japan. It was also possible to get it in Europe, although we had to settle for the North American version since we didn't have an official release until Dragon Quest VIII and the DS remakes. Try being the five year old whose trying to play the original game in a language you don't know a word of. It is actually possible to beat through trial and error but you won't know what the plot is in the slightest. Naturally, a franchise that competed with Final Fantasy in Japan got several anime and manga adaptations including today's film, Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshou. The work for this was handled by Enix, Pony Canyon, Shochiku film and Nippon animation. Let's delve into the movie and see just where they went with it.Story:The story takes place between Dragon Quest III and the original. We open with a young boy named Arus being trained in swordplay by his... mother... sister... guardian... teacher? It never really says who she is to him. There's a problem with his training, however. He seems unwilling or unable to use the sword as she's trying to teach him or the magic that his elderly mentor is trying to teach him. To make things worse for this kid, the other children think he's a coward. This leads to a competition between him and another boy named Kira to go into a potentially dangerous situation.Honestly, the story is not bad but it's not good either. The main plot is a pretty cliché coming of age story. Just in a fantasy setting, which has been done plenty of times. There's nothing specifically wrong with it but it does nothing new. As a result, it's pretty predictable.Characters:The characters in this are kind of bland. We've got the hesitant hero. The abrasive guy who isn't really a bad person but comes across as kind of a jerk. The older mentor figure and so on. The film never bothers to establish anything about them aside from their archetypal traits. Although, to be fair, the film is less than an hour long and Arus's story arc isn't badly handled. Even though he never really develops beyond the trope.Art:The art in this isn't very good. To a degree, it's understandable since this is a film from '96 and they didn't exactly have access to all of the animation technology we do today. However, it isn't even good by the standards of the day. When you compare it to The Slayers, Gundam Wing or Sailor Moon, all of which started earlier but had installments airing at roughly the same time, the art and animation just look lazy. Almost as though they weren't trying.Sound:The vocal cast in this is decent. Everyone does competently, although no one gives their best performance. This is a film with Hiramatsu Akiko, Shiozawa Kaneto and Han Keiko, just to name a few. They all do fine, but they don't really have much emotional range to work with so their performances, though competent, are a bit underwhelming. The music is genuinely good. Beinghandled by Wada Kaoru, who also did the music for 3x3 Eyes, and Arai Akino.Ho-yay:Most of the characters in this are little kids. So, no ho-yay.Final Thoughts:There's not much to say about this one. We have a standard plot with standard characters and standard acting. The movie isn't bad, but it's nothing special or good either. If you don't mind the cliches and you're a huge Dragon Quest fan you might want to consider it. Otherwise, you'll probably just find it dull. My final rating is going to be a 5/10, and I am a fan of the franchise with the 5th game being my favourite. Tomorrow, a different kind of film. In the name of the moon.;Mixed Feelings

0;Monster High: Kowa-ike Girls;Scarlet_Fairy23;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Scarlet_Fairy23;6;The only reason I watched this anime in the first place is because I'm a fan of Monster High, the doll line. I'm a collector of them. And, seeing my beloved characters turned into anime, I have to say it was cool to see. But, as it's meant for kids, I can't say it was... good. Each episode is very short and each one is simply a comedic sort of story.Story: 5, MediocreThere's not much of a story in the first place. Like I stated before, each episode is its own comedic gag, in a sense. An event happens and that's that. Nothing much to it.Art: 4, DecentEh, it's not really... well-animated. At all, in fact. And you can very clearly see this when it comes to the opening.Sound: 3, PoorI feel like they just took free sounds from online and slapped them into the anime. Music is fairly good, I guess, but sound effects really aren't.Character: 6, FairThere's no time for character development in 3-minute episodes of a kids show.Enjoyment: 7, GoodHeh, honestly, I just... really like seeing the characters that I've loved since I was a kid be in an anime, no matter how crappy it is. It's fun.Overall: 6, FairAgain, this is a KIDS show. It's just sorta something to set your kids in front of to keep them entertained. It's hard for me to review something like this critically.Also, as of now there aren't any official subs, only a fan sub on YouTube. It takes less than half an hour to watch the entire series. It's not anything memorable, and it's hardly much of an anime at all, in fact-- heck, I'm the first one to review this and it's been out for over a year now! If you're a Monster High fan, you should watch it. If you're not, then, well... don't waste those 24 minutes it'd take you to watch this.;Mixed Feelings

0;Soap no Moko-chan;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;8;"Ah... My Fair Masseuse! If there ever was an ideal ""masseuse"", Moko-chan would be it. Why? Because she loves her job and everyone loves Moko-chan.At first glance, you'll find the art and animation isn't all that great in comaprasion to today's standards. But you must forgive MFM for it is a pioneer in hentai back in 1996. Even for 90's standards, it breaks the mold for you average hentai animation. But what it lacks in animation it makes up for it in character. And this is what ""My Fair Masseuse"" is all about: Character!You will fall in love with Moko-chan, the protagonist of this hentai. She breaks the stereotype that masseuses are often coerced into the sex trade. In fact Moko-chan breaks most common stereotypes in hentai characters. She's happy when her customers are satisfied and takes great pride in her job at a ""soapland"" hotel. Moko-chan has a healthy attitude when it comes to sex and there are some humorous moments involved. That's what I like particularly about this hentai. She's never lost in lust nor is she neurotic in anyway, but rather cares for her customers in a very nurturing way. Yet Moko-chan is very seductive in her won right. She is comfortable with her own sexuality and isn't shy about expressing it, though there are moments when she's a little embarrassed which makes her all the more lovable and cute. Hmmm... ""moe"" would be the correct term to describe her.""My Fair Masseuse"" plays like a series of good short stories that revolve around Moko-chan and situations she must overcome with her customers. There's a different take with each short story. However, one doesn't feel like separate stories all together, more like separate incidents, which makes the entire hentai rather refreshing. And yes, it's a feel-good hentai. There's no rape, coerced sex, or anything that you'll feel guilty about later. Just good seductive consensual sex.Though I wouldn't say ""My Fair Masseuse"" is exactly fap material, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a hentai. I wish more hentai these days would have characters such as Moko-chan and an enjoyable feel-good themes such as My Fair Masseuse.";Recommended
0;Soap no Moko-chan;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;5;"Moko is a masseuse who gives her males clients a special massage guaranteed to help them release all of their stress. Of all the women in her profession, Moko is one of the most popular. Her secret is simple, she enjoys pleasing the men she gives her special massages to just as much her clients receiving the pleasure.There is no real overarching plot. If anything, ""Soap no Moko-chan"" plays out more like a series of short segments or sketches, all featuring the same characters. It's clear that ""Soap no Moko-chan"" isn't just a straight up porn, but more of a sex comedy, just featuring a lot more explicit sex than the average sex comedy would.But is any of the comedy any good? While it's not terrible, it's not all that great either. Considering some of the hentai and ecchi that I've slogged through, ""Soap no Moko-chan"" looks like gold in comparison, so it's not really saying much. Maybe it's just one of those things that because it was made 25+ years ago, it isn't as good in retrospect, despite being great at the time.Maybe the manga that this was based on was a lot better, but I wouldn't know because I couldn't find any scans of it online, nor could I find any physical copies. And I imagine those would be incredibly expensive even if I could find them, considering the conversion rate and shipping costs.But what about the sex, since that's why anyone would watch this to begin with, is that any good? It's nowhere the worst sex that I've seen in a hentai, but I could easily point to several hentai from the 90s that are several steps up over this. I imagine that the reason anyone would want to watch this to begin with is the comedy part of this, as it seems to focus on that just as much, if not more than the sex.Hilariously enough, the credits for the English version are cocky enough to call this ""Part 1"". Considering that I couldn't find any evidence of a ""Part 2"" ever existing, I doubt that it ever made it to production. Someone higher up involved in the production was really hoping that this did well enough that they could make more, but saw that the sales weren't doing so hot. This was based on a manga, a lot of which obviously went unadapted, so there was plenty to work with.The best way to sum up ""Soap no Moko-chan"" is ""You can do better, you can do worse.""";Mixed Feelings

0;Chou Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru;XKizuha;https://myanimelist.net/profile/XKizuha;7;What happens when you adapt a late 80's action-comedy robot anime inspired by Bikkuriman, NES roleplaying games and 80's pop culture references (with the early 90's sequel) into the late 90's? You get a one with 90's pop culture references, much more serious shonen action and a rather clever social commentary on how the advancement of society has influenced people losing its kind heart to them and the others.The story starts with a slightly older Wataru losing its 'kind heart' due to Ankokudar and starting to act like a junior high delinquent. Shibaraku and Himiko takes Wataru back to Sokaizan, stating that he need to save Sokaizan once again with the rainbow going monochrome again and save the civilliian and his kind heart.Kurama, the former-bad anthro bird guy is absent from this entry (although he was mentioned once) and was replaced by Suzume, a 90's glamorous tomboy girl which rides a different bird Mashin, with a evangelion cockpit. In addtion, an androgenous wooden toy Shoryushi (Toraou) came alive as Seiju also joins the cast to find his master.New evil characters has been introduced, the Donarukami family, who overthrowned Soukaizan. comprising of a Fire demon king, ice-cold queen, Doran the sly drag queen, Dolk the mysterious swordsman voiced by Chisa Yokoyama of Sakura wars fame and Dode, the evil kid which later befriends Toraou. Out of the recurring villains seen in the Wataru series, the Donarukami family breaks the mold of the archetypal villians of the original series and depicted as a serious, empathetic and humane characters with its own development arc and proper explaination on what lead them to team with Ankokudar and steal the 'kind heart'.The animation has been significantly improved from the previous series, and possibly the most visually appealing one within the series. The transformation bank scene always looked great throughout this series, but this one is top-notch.Also, it is noted that in comparison to the original (and 2), which utilised a 'world boss' scheme, Chou introduces a 'stage boss' scheme. To accommodate this, the world building is more dense in Chou, with every location having more variety. Each stages looks established and more 'realistic' and 'believable' in contrary to the absolute wacky, yet linear nature of the original series .In the original series, the bosses did not revert back to good civillians until the world has been cleared. Meanwhle in Chou, the bosses and the 'stage' reverts back to good, after each stage bosses has been defeated.One of the issues which this entry suffers from, is the inability to decide whether it wants to be a sequel, 90's reboot or a remake of the 1st series (although this was purposely done to avoid sequel fatigue) This entry is seemingly a remake with the focus on reverting Soukaizan back to its coloursed state like the original, but is a sequel in the sense that Wataru has already had the previous adventures with Shibaraku, Himiko and Toraou.However, nothing becomes more problematic with the overpowered nature of Sword-King Ryujinmaru, introduced in the MIDWAY of the series, with the ability to cut ANY objects and also allow to CUT DIMENSIONS (the only thing it can't cut is the kind heart). The mere existence of this breaks the latter half of the anime into a repetitive mess, nullifying the essential struggling required in most robot animes to make the battles thrilling. What makes it worse is that the later Ryujinmaru form has been underutilised, despite the anime including a very emotional development arc with Tama, a initially comic relief cat character which joins Wataru and his friends.From the 2020 sequel 'The Seven Spirits Of Ryujinmaru', fan states that it kinda retconned that this entry might not be fully canon and wasn't the entry which the fans of the original series wanted.Still, this is a great robot anime which worth a check, with its emotional themes.

Not clean and cut like most modern pieces are.Voice appeared to be slightly off key from the character's lips. However, it got better towards the end.Character: the back story was decent. Although, i question the fact if the ending was possible. The factor was if friends were made the trade off most likely in theory could not be accomplished. Given what he grew into how is it that friends were not made?All in all it was a nice story. Quite sad on the time gap on the promise. Although the holes in the plot annoyed me.;Mixed Feelings

0;Injuu Nerawareta Hanayome;jsc315;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jsc315;6;This is Hentai with a some what decent story in it. There is not all that much sex with a decent amount of nudity. There is some bondage, S&M and some tentacle stuff so if that isn't your thing stay away from this title. This OVA is only 2 episodes so there isn't to much of an investment here. The music is decent but nothing great. Some of the music sets the mood for some scenes but nothing special. For a title that came out in 1999 the art is pretty poor. It isn't awful but it's pretty uninteresting or detailed.Over all, this short 2 episode OVA has a decent story line for a Hentai title. Nothing great or rememberable. For a Hentai it lacks sex scenes. The second episode barley has any nudity in it. This is the reason your watching this, for the sex and nudity, and it really doesn't deliver much on that.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shinsatsushitsu;NocturnalV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NocturnalV;7;Since this anime is very obscure, I will try to be very fair to this anime.While this anime is very subjective and people will struggle whether or not this can be considered anime, I applaud this short film for being creative and abstract in its storytelling.From what I've gathered from the abstract plot, the story documents a man's recollections of his life and death after being diagnosed with an ambiguous disease.We see an assortment of visuals meant to represent a state of despair and almost, nothing-ness. These visuals vary from bleak to grotesque, and while watching I got a strange sense of unfamiliar feelings and something close to ''fear'', which I think this anime incorporated quite well.The figures are drawn realistically, but deprived of a physical image and identity, which may suggest these memories are distant, or rather the people.We see the main character being diagnosed,a strange scene with a woman, who I presume may be a nurse or his wife inspecting him. We see several children watching outside as the main character reflects on their condition, and the addition of a lone child sitting in the corner, doing nothing.We see this woman overtaken by a strange disease as she is injected with a needle and she seemingly dies.We then see a play, a man with a dog fall and collapse, dying. It is my belief we witness the disease of the main character overtaking and killing him, he is rushed away by the ambulance and seen in the following shot, which parallels the opening.From this strange story, I have gathered one possible conclusion:1) The lone child is the main character's son. The nurse is his partner or wife, she is infected with the same disease, dies and slowly the man collapses and the disease has taken its final form. I have gathered this since the main character in the following ''nurse'' scene is identified by a wound on his right knee, which he scratches at the end. After the ''play'' scene where the audience laughs at his demise and the camera zooms in on his face, we see him cut back to reality, which suggests this story was in head and he is reflecting on his life and the disease that overtook him. It is also possible this disease is spreading, as the same condition on the x-ray scan of our main character is seen on a newspaper, therefore he is not alone.Despite the mystery surrounding this story, I enjoy re-watching it and attempting to form my own interpretations of this obscure tale, though I feel it was too vague to reach a connection with its audience, especially on an emotional level, it deserves a higher score for attempting something original and abstract, its visuals are eerie but effective and I recommend watching, though I understand it is not for the ''average'' viewer.;Recommended

0;Shinsatsushitsu;dragoondev;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dragoondev;5;"I'm only writing a review for this because nobody else has. That being said, let's get to it.There honestly isn't much to review here. It's 8 minutes long and lacks almost all necessary components of a story. The entire time I was watching it, I wasn't confused so much as...uncomfortable. Not in the squeamish sense of being bothered by blood or the even in the sense of not liking the language or subject matter. It felt as though I was watching something that was never meant to be seen; like I had uncovered someone's darkest secret. It didn't do anything poorly, but it didn't do anything well either, except creep me out.STORY: 5It lacks a cohesive story. I interpreted it as his diagnosis either triggering flashbacks(such as his knee injury) or causing him to imagine an entire set of scenarios that don't correlate. None of the scenes connect.ART: 5It was actually a decent art style. A sort of waving, watercolor look that left faces distorted and horrifying. Almost everything was shades of grey, black or white except for a few splashes of muted color here and there. Very simple, yet disturbing.SOUND: 5The limited use of sound works in favor of this movie. It has no dialogue, no music and very few effects. The only ""talking"" consists of a horror villain faced nurse moving her mouth and wet sounds coming out. Sounds like a bull blowing out air underwater, or a toilet burbling back when its clogged. Other than that, there is audience laughter during the play scene but that's it.CHARACTER: 5There is literally no solid character development. Maybe the other scenes are about the nameless man in the doctor's office? Even if they are, all we know is that he has a spot on his brain x-ray and a knee injury. That's all the viewer is given.ENJOYMENT: 3I didn't enjoy this. At all. I was on edge the entire time and it wasn't something I would ever watch again. I'm fine with silent films, strange art and creepy vibes but the bottom line is that I didn't enjoy it.OVERALL: 5It wasn't the worst thing ever but I wouldn't call it good. It was a muted fever dream of possible dementia induced scenarios. I still don't know what was up with the headless obese man spinning and spraying blood(?) on the walls. And I can honestly say I'm okay with not knowing. You might enjoy it. Maybe. If you have absolutely nothing better to watch or want to waste 8 minutes, watch it.";Mixed Feelings

0;Usavich Zero;GleewJoy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GleewJoy;6;"Usavich Zero left me very confused, this anime about Russian rabbits must have some symbolism with a lot of room for theories, but I won't be the one who will find them, every time I try to decipher YouTube animated series I just end up in disappointment, and here it wouldn't be differently.• What is Usavich Zero •Well, this is not so difficult to find out, the titles of the episodes already say what the whole construction of this media refers to, everything that is addressed in Usavich comes from an ""origin"", you just need to know how to interpret which allegory the episode wants you transmit.• My interpretation of Usavich Zero •Everything in the animation seems out of place until you piece together every single piece of information in your head. I could say that Usavich is like the life cycle, no matter if you start it at the end or at the beginning, everything will almost inactively come together in one place, whatever your choices are. It's important to remember in these moments that not making a decision will also be a choice for your future, this kind of represents prisoner Nº 04, who, after readjusting about the basics of life like eating, sleeping and the famous ""play there out"", it ends up that he starts to make his own choices, showing that he is like anyone else in the world, what diverges are the ways he chooses. But in animation this is shown in a not so evident way to keep the air of ""what is this I'm seeing?"", which ends up making everything more interesting for the spectator, and ends up coming another positive side to animation, characters don't express themselves verbally, this makes everything more confusing and pragmatic.In episode 7 of Usavich Zero we meet a similar character more different from Nº 04, they are practically identical if it weren't for their completely different clothes, Nº 04 wears clothes like a prison uniform, while the new character wears a ""dress"" of polka dots, as if he had come to visit someone in prison, and that could even be right, since as soon as the character appears he goes to Nº 04's room and exchanges one of his shoes for his. I don’t know if this makes any sense or not, since all of this is just my vision of what I think Usavich is, but that scene strangely reminded me of the times I went with my mother to a store, and there we picked shoes for both of us. This may seem to be totally scrappy from everything I've ever talked about, but it makes so much sense to me that I can't unsee figure out that possibility in my head anymore.NOTE: The Nº 04 uses tracks that cover your whole body, as if it were a mummy, at the end of the ""last"" episode we see for the first time its semblance without all those bandages. If I were to demystify who #04 is, I would say he’s like a chrysalis process, since all he does in episode 6 is lying in his bed reading his magazine, which may or may not refer to the chrysalis process, it’s an option due to his ""rebirth"" in the last/first episode of animation.After a ""cycle"" passed in prison, we are introduced to the new character, prisoner number 541, and as number 04 he also goes through the basic teachings, with the slight difference of it seem much more ""sociable"" than number 04. Unlike him, Nº 541 does not have such a short fuse, if something bothers the Nº 04 he already begins to destroy everything around him. It is as if the number 04 has won a little brother who does not take his remedies for his ADHD. However, most of the responsibility of this goes to the number 04 who spent most of his childhood ""biting"" their guardians, instead of developing what some call independence, which by knowing how to take care of yourself, will enable you to know how to take care of others. A good example of what adolescent would be the Nº 04, would be those who put on their doors ""forbidden the entrance"", as if said indirectly ""I do not want anyone to come to bother me"".• Conclusion on Usavich Zero •This animation is very strange and I ended up going on her wave without even wanting to. What did Usavich represent to me? I wanted to know that answer. All I know is that this series is conflicting, seeing it, I felt a kind of arrogance inside me, as if the number 04 represented me. Ignoring even my perception of space, just so I don’t get involved in things that I find uninteresting to me, it makes me not realize that there may be someone right next to me suffering to keep me alive at his expense, as is the case with number 541, Only in a much more harmless way. Number 541 is like this, it is always the wronged of history, it does all that inhuman work alone and still receives the same amount of food, while number 04 continues to receive without at least struggling for it. It’s almost like you think you’re doing the job that no one else can, when in reality it’s just the others leaving everything to you. So to me Usavich is like a series of events about to erupt, and I know that, I just act with indifference, so that people around me always have to overcome themselves if they want to continue living, thus proving that the popular saying ""If you aren´t part of the solution you are part of the problem,"" has never been wrong.";Mixed Feelings

0;Growlanser IV: Wayfarer of the Time;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;7;Well look at that another OVA without a review. So let's do one.Growlanser is not something to called magnificent but it is videogame adaptation that at least is enjoyable and really well done to promote the videogame.Story = 6Since MAL hasn't typed the story about this OVA here it is.So the story talks about this commander of an army called Dianna that after a war happened in her continet she decides that there should be a peace treaty among the nations of the continent, but some people of the high hierachy decide that there should be a revolt and like that make another conflict.The story is not that great but does the job. The message of making peace and not have more war is cliche but it doesn't drag too long and you can have some entertainment value out of this. It is not perfect but hey at least is not an Idea Factory OVA.Characters = 5The only some sort of development in this OVA is about Dianna, she is a commander but after experimenting the war and seeing that people have suffered enough. Her character is ok. She is the one giving the speech about the peace treaty but she is good at sword fighting against others and just that.The other characters are tropes, but do the job. The character development is not existent though.Animation = 8The character designs for me are simply beautiful. They have this 90s feel and for being a simple promotion of a videogame that nobody knows, they really show they did care. There aren't any weird frames or some weird 3D animation like many of this videogame promotions tend to do. The only problem is that there aren't many scenes where they show how this continent is. That would have added a big plus to at least get the feel of the setting they are in. Good job from Feels and Zexcs.Sound = 8The music is great. The instumental pieces they chose are fantastic. Honestly is an OST worth to check out. It is very medieval but also melancholic sometimes and it is used at their fullest because for being 30 minutes they used it for all this animation and the ending song is nice too.The voice actors are ok. They do the job. Nothing feels forced or souless and they gave some life to the characters on the show.Enjoyment and Overall.Check it out if you have time. It is an okish OVA and something to watch if you have a half hour.This is everything. Take care in whatever you do and see ya around.;Recommended
0;Charm Point 1: Sister's Rondo;nicoduches;https://myanimelist.net/profile/nicoduches;4;This title focuses on the story, which is your typical lighthearted soap opera: people dealing with their relationships’ highs and lows. As in a lot of other anime about love, characters are awkward or shy in presence of their love interests and don't have much of a personality. But there is nothing innovative or emotionally rich in this one, so the story was rather boring to me.The art in general is not ugly for a 1999 title but isn’t good either. Only breasts I’d say are actually decently drawn and animated.I couldn’t take the English dub seriously because some of the voices sound quite silly. The Japanese dub was okay.A few scenes that feature nudity are void of any sexual context. The sex scenes themselves are brief and involve more foreplay than intercourse.The characters’ genitals are very simply drawn: a handful of pencil lines and skin color.Features consensual and typical sex acts only although one of the couple has more of a master/slave relationship, a few cumshots, a paizuri scene and vibrators.Overall I found Charm Point to be bland and clichéd. I suppose it could be an okay introduction to hentai anime for those who never watched any and who don’t want to see too much focus on sex or extreme fetishes, but it is a forgettable title. I wouldn’t compare it to Sexfriend at all.Story: 3Art: 4Sound: 6Character: 3Enjoyment: 3;Not Recommended

It's supposed to teach a valuable lesson about bullying but it feels like a torture porn.

It must of been one cheapass handbag if it rips because of a girl clocking in 1/10th of a mile per hour . Mc chan then gets thrash dumped on her, her shoes are covered in graffiti and her hair then gets cut apart. She gets the most severe case of disproportionate retribution I've seen in a while.

0;Ijime: Ikenie no Kyoushitsu;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;2;Ever wonder what an anime version of an after school special was like? Well, I admit I haven't seen an after school special, especially those from the 70s and 80s, but if there could be an anime version of one, Ijime would be the closest thing I can picture as resembling one. It'd be one thing if it was good, but after watching it, I declare: it's horrible!! Absolutely, gutwrenchingly horrible in every single way possible! Prepare for riffing, people!So basically this OVA is about bullying. Normally I like stories about bullying, as I've been through some of it myself, but never to the ridiculous extent it's portrayed here. Seriously, some live action shows I've seen portray bullying better than this! Normally if a popular girl hates someone, it's either because she hates the way someone dresses, or maybe someone crossed her in some way like catching a boy's attention or getting better grades, etc., and people can relate to that! I don't mind stories like these if they're done well. But here? The whole thing is played for extreme melodrama, and not very well! All of the events that happen in here are so stupid and so petty that it makes me cringe! So, there's this rich girl named Sera who is the queen of the school, and she and her classmates pick on another girl named Fumika over stupid things. Why you ask? Because Fumika bumped into her and crumpled her shirt sleeve! Okay...what?! That is the most unbelievable and stupid reason ever! Couldn't they just forget about it, because those are NO reason to pick on someone, especially if they go as far as dump trash on her, cut her hair, and kick her around EVEN AS THE TEACHERS ARE WATCHING!!! Good lord, these girls are more melodramatic than the plastics from Mean Girls, and Mean Girls was a heck of a lot better than this piece of garbage!I'm not gonna lie, the animation and character designs are awful. Even the manga's art is creepy! Those eyes! They're too big! The character designs are completely bland and uninspired, the animation is stiff, there's no life or expression to them, their eyes are so big they completely consume their faces, far more so than normal anime eyes, and it relies too much on typical cartoon tropes to get its point across, like chibified characters or random jump cuts. Everybody has the exact same face. If you change their hair and eye colors, they'd all look like clones of each other. The music...I don't remember much. It was uninspired and not the very least bit memorable.The characters are obviously the worst part of this anime, because they pretty much have absolutely no character at all! They're just one-note caricatures who are just there to either punish someone or be victimized for absolutely no reason than cheap, pointless melodrama that could easily be avoided, and none of them even behave in rational ways. Sera's the annoying alpha female cranked up to eleven who victimizes someone just for...bumping into her and crumpling her sleeve, and then the show turns up the angst and expects us to sympathize with her in the end, which doesn't work because we had no reason to care about her, and we still don't! And because none of the other characters have any personality and do nothing but hurt people, they're basically nothing but mouthpieces who are used to move the story and shove the moral down our throats, and people claim MY characters are nothing but mouthpieces! Seriously, I can write a better bullying piece than this, with better characters! Also, no real person behaves the way these characters do, and the characters change their behavior every other scene, and that's not how you write a character or a story. The amateurish, melodramatic voice acting also doesn't help either.It's short length also doesn't do it any favors either. It's one episode of fifteen minutes, and had it been expanded, it could have been a lot better. Sorry. This is just awful. Bad animation, bad characters, bad storytelling, it's basically a really bad, overly preachy after school special, only much worse. Seriously, if I had to chose between this and Lady Lovely Locks, I'd pick LLL, because this is just terrible on every single level. Nothing can salvage it.This is indisputably the worst anime I have ever seen.;Not Recommended
0;Oyayubi Hime Monogatari;Optigisa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Optigisa;7;The eternal dilemma which is always brought up infront of Anime and cartoon lovers, by those who are close minded is “These animations are for children, not for grownups.” As a result, you find a lot of Anime lovers resorting to Anime with evident superficial markings so that they could prove that Anime is not in actuality for children. Some examples of superficial markings is the presence of violence, blood, fatal injuries, or sexual intercourse. This way of looking at things is not accurate, because some Anime on the outset - such as Deadman Wonderland – look like they contain a lot of blood, gore and violence, but their storytelling in general is unoriginal, weak, and most importantly, immature. The Anime Thumbelina: A Magical Story, on the outset, looks very childish and is made for kids, and it lacks any semblance of violence or gore. The surprising thing is that this Anime is more suitable for adults than, let’s say, an Anime that actually entails all kinds of violence in it. So, what is the general rule that is applied to knowing precisely if a work is for children or for adults? Hopefully after describing this Anime, you’ll get a better view.The story is an adaption of the novel by writer Hanz Anderson, by the same name of Thumbelina, and it talks about a princess who is the size of a thumb, who comes out of a flower and faces many who would like her hand at marriage, until she settles in a true and loving relationship. The Anime adapts this in a light manner, and tells the story from a different angle. The main girl, Mia, is a normal human girl, who makes her mother exhausted due to her bad demeanor and shady shenanigans. Due to this trouble that Mia is causing, her mother seeks the advice of an old woman so that she could help her out with her issues. The old woman gives the mother a book by the name of Thumbelina, and the mother takes it before she falls asleep on her rocking chair, and is later picked up by Mia. Unfortunately for Mia, the book imprisons and traps her in it’s fantasy world, and from there on, Mia tries to return to her own world and her mother, and her true size as well, since she became much smaller upon entering the fantasy world. In that book, she will face a lot of enemies and circumstances, and form a lot of friendships as well in each passing episode. This is the body structure of the story, it is classic, and is ready to be filled with well-developed characters and a strong narrative. The script is very well done in the sequence of events and the speed at which they take place in, is intelligent in showing the necessary details. The writer is proficient at writing the script, and he respects the mind of the viewer.The Anime’s beginning is straightforward and spectacular, where the viewer gets to know the titular character Mya and the general goal of the story in a clear manner, and it contributes to sculpting a road for the writer to take later on in the story. The Anime is episodic, and each episode is different from the other, but they are all related in the fact that they have the general goal of adventure. Due to this, some episodes will turn out excellent while some others will turn out to be fairly average, and with that I find that the average mean score for all the episodes is fairly good.The main characters which are reoccurring in most of the episodes have a lightweight depth and are easy to understand, but they are still fairly developed, and that is something which makes it easier for the younger viewers to follow the story and understand the events that are taking place, while the older viewers are not deprived of any depth in the story as well. The most beautiful aspect of the story is that the development of the main characters, and that of the heroine are very concrete, and it begins to show more and more in a logical and natural way over time, and this is a professional achievement when it comes to storytelling.The secondary characters, or the guests of each episode, are complete in their compositions and are fairly developed. The ending is intact and beautiful, although being normal, and it was in dire need of a touch of brilliant directing to make it better, not better writing. There are some light negative points in weaving certain events and reaching their significance, and a lack of excellence in some episodes, and this deprives the storytelling in this Anime from reaching the highest level of writing, but does not deprive it from achieving a high quality nonetheless.All of the camera angles and movements have a significant meaning, and they contribute to the narration and making the Anime more exciting. The visual backgrounds throughout the Anime’s run are beautiful and very well done from a technical standpoint, and are filled with important details, to the point where they reflect on the personality of the characters that live in them, giving off a deep backstory for them, and contributing to making the story highly credible. The drawing of the movements and the characters maintain their quality throughout the Anime’s run, as most of the episodes contain incredible drawings and visuals, and there are episodes which are even greater, especially when those episodes become plot driven in a big way.The character design is imaginative and brilliant, even the secondary minor characters look unique in their own way, since each design reflects on the personality and traits of a character in a correct manner, without the need to make them look as outlandish as possible. The color palette is brilliant, especially when it comes to creating indoor lightning and mixing it in a way that comforts the eye and contributes on making the events more focused. The sound effects are also brilliant, as well as the music, which is harmonious with the events of the story and effectively contribute to aggregation and integration.All in all, this is an Anime that walks a fine line when it comes to writing, creative in showcasing it’s themes and has some of the best pacing in Anime. The characters are all well developed and lovable, appropriate for both young and old audiences. As for the old person, who suffers from the eternal dilemma of Anime being a children’s medium, this one proves otherwise. Don’t let the outer design of something fool you, rather let the essence of something be the most important. Plenty of times do we see something that looks like it was made for adults, but is in fact contextualized for a young audience of little experience in life, and plenty of times do we see a work that looks like it was made for a young audience, but rather becomes apparent through it’s context that it was clearly done for an older one.;Recommended

My mom brought it home when I was about 4-5 and I fell in love with it.The story is very cute and filled with adventures. I loved Hoppy to death.I loved the art style. It's from the 90s and gives off a good vibe.The music was very good. I remember the scene where Hoppy and Mia were running from the snake and that dumb song started playing. It was my favorite for some reason.The characters were very good. Mia was a little bitch the whole time but she was useful sometimes I guess haha. But anyway, the characters were very funny and cute and I liked them.I cannot even tell you how much I enjoyed this as a kid. I think I could consider it one of the best things I watched when I was little. I remember when my sister and I were going to choose what we wanted to watch and I always insisted on watching this. She wasn't as crazy about it as I was.Overall, this anime is good. It teaches a lot of lessons. The characters are amazing and it is quite enjoyable. I could watch this over and over and probably not get tired (I could). It just brings back so many memories when I see it.(Since I haven't seen this since I was a kid, it's probably not as good as I describe it to be. But still, it's a kids show so who the hell cares anyway.);Mixed Feelings
0;TV Yarou Nanaana;Bleeus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bleeus;8;As the first person on MAL to favorite this anime, I will always see it as the hidden gem it is.I found this anime randomly when looking for something to watch for the 2020 Anime Watch Challenge, and I couldn't be happier. The show provides light, unpredictable comedy that works wonders with a brewski. I feel it gives a Robot Chicken kinda vibe with a Japanese take, making it a show I would expect to find on Adult Swim at 2 am.I don't think you can go wrong with watching these Bananas since each episode is super short, so watch the first 7 episodes and decide if it's worth continuing this and the other seasons.;Recommended
1;TV Yarou Nanaana;Anime2947;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anime2947;8;This anime lives up to it's premise in 24 short but sweat episodes. If talking bananas running a Tv show expedition sounds weird to you, that's because it is. The appeal of TV Yarou Nanana is in the outrageous comedy, the endearing low budget style of artwork that makes it feel almost like watching a comic strip, and the fun and memorable characters that work perfectly with both running and new jokes.I would wholeheartly recommend it for any fans of comedy. As each episode is only three minutes, there is little to lose by giving it a try, but a lot to gain.;Recommended

They left a lot of things out and didn't explain much at all, so it kind of lost its spark for me. It was still enjoyable to watch, just... not as much as I'd hoped.";Mixed Feelings

0;Card Wang: Mix Master;JoHou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JoHou;7;"(This is being written from the standpoint of the English Dub)""Destiny is all you need to play."" Probably one of the weirdest phrases I have heard but it will be stuck with you for the entirety of this series. Not much needs to be said about this series besides it is something that honestly never gets talked about or even mentioned. Let us see why that is...Story (6/10): The summary/synopsis to this series pretty much gives you everything you need to know. Not really much else needs to be said. It is your standard child and monster/weird creature anime. Though it focuses more on more of a fusion mechanic, which is what drew me to it initially. You have the chosen one who must save the world from evil and that is about it. Nothing even remotely groundbreaking or new but the story exists and proceeds how you would expect it to.Art(6/10): I wish I could be a bit harder on this show's animation and it definitely has some oddly drawn and animated characters but it can honestly be overlooked. This isn't a show where you come for the art and the unique animation but since it is geared towards kids you have to be pretty forgiving for what it is. Nothing egregious but nothing outstanding either.Sound(7/10): The soundtrack is actually quite good, it captures the mood of the various scenes well. The opening is without a doubt one of the most catchiest songs I have ever heard and even after not watching this show for half a decade I still remember it. The voice acting itself is also quite good for a kids show and I think each voice actor performs their roles quite well. I believe there are only a handful of voice actors in the show but their range of voices is quite wide so it never makes you think ""Hey! Isn't this the same voice as so and so?"". The opening and ending themes are exactly the same, one is just an instrumental version of the other so not much to talk about there.Character(5/10): Now this is less about character development and more about character design. The character development is typical children show progression and not worth mentioning except for maybe Giara and Prince Brad(who is probably the strongest point of the show). For a show centered around collecting monster and making new monsters, it probably has the worst monster designs I have seen in my life. The special monster friends in this are called ""Hench"", which just hits the ear weird and makes it sound like instead of the creatures being friends to the main characters they are ""henchmen"". It is a minor annoyance of mine but I feel like they could have chosen a better name. A vast majority of them are just so lazy and uninspired, like they put the bare minimum in designing them. You might enjoy maybe one or two by the end but even I doubt that. They aren't visually interesting to look at, they have no unique personality quirks, no unique/defining abilities, not even remotely interesting names. Some of their names literally being a description of what they are, ex. Metal Hopper, which is as you would guess a metal grasshopper. However, when it comes to the human, elves and dark elves design the show isn't nearly as terribly. They are all easy to identify and that is good. Prince Brad on the other hand is just a really strong antagonist. Not in terms of ""evilness"" or anything like that but his design, his personality, and mannerisms make the show less of a chore to sit through. He feels like the type of character that honestly doesn't belong in such a show but thinking of any other show where he would fit in is honestly a bit of a task. He is just plain goofy fun and I love it.Enjoyment(8/10): Despite for being such a bland show, it isn't terrible. It never feels too slow nor does it ever feel too fast. Episodes go by quickly and information is given to you in a timely manner. I can't really find it in my heart to hate it even if I don't have high praise for it. It doesn't overstay its welcome and I can appreciate that.Overall(7/10): Is this show worth watching? Eh. If you really need something to watch I guess but you aren't missing out on much. Check it out if you wish and you might just enjoy the little story it has to tell you.";Recommended
0;Heya;hbpix;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hbpix;5;interesting in its own wayAnimation is pure chaos, there are a lot of events going on consecutively which makes you wonder: what is all this about? But if you notice, in the midst of such madness and randomness there are subtle social critiques, such as the cruelty of war.Reality is turned into a joke, as the work plays with it. Continuously there are sound effects that immediately cause a strangeness, but match the moments. Historical moments like World War II are portrayed in the form of bombers and social problems. The body and sensuousness are quite explored and outcropped. In general, you should check this out.;Mixed Feelings

Order is important in my world. I will completely be thrown off if a scene of an airplane comes in and is dropping a bomb(for example). why? what purpose is there for that? maybe if the show was about safety i could possibly see that, but this made no sense since it was not about safety.;Not Recommended
0;Chokin Senshi Cashman;AshitaNoJonas;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AshitaNoJonas;5;This Cashman OVA is based on a short story (3 chapters long) by Akira Toriyama. It's about an alien (who is actually part of Frieza's race!) who happens to crash on earth. He can't go back to his home planet, because he's out of fuel and his spaceship uses gold as fuel. And since gold is insanely expensive on earth, he has to make a lot of money now. Therefore he becomes Cashman, a superhero who charges money for saving the day. He takes over the identity of a policeman he accidentally killed and now he has to deal with strong enemies and an annoying girlfriend. The premise is pretty cool, it's a typical silly Toriyama plot. Too bad this OVA doesn't do the manga justice, they changed too much and cut a lot of stuff out (which is weird, since the manga is already super short). In the manga Cashman has multiple fights, but in the anime, he only fight once. Overall this OVA isn't terrible by any means, but they should have just made it 10-15 minutes longer and just adapt the whole thing. If you like Akira Toriyama's style and you want to see a Frieza-looking dude fight some bad guys, then you might get some enjoyment out of this.;Mixed Feelings
0;Shakotan★Boogie;heroesluk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/heroesluk;7;Okay, to begin withThis is not excatly what you probably expect.Instead of fast cars and cool races, about half of screen-time is filled with REALLY stupid, mostly slapstick humour, sexism, and basically doing stupid things.Okay, if that discouraged you, you can already close the tab with this review, and give up on watching Shakotan BoogieBut if by any chance, you enjoy watching stupid guys, doing rather dumb stuffand on top of that you like JDM culture, i can almost guarantee you that you'll enjoy this show.I mean, this show won't change your life, don't have any really strong points either.It's just really enjoyable comedy, which don't give a damn, about being right.The plot doesnt really exist, we've got a few characters that are introduced during first two episodes, and they're sticking with us till the end.Every episode is separate story, but they still about the same stuff, Cars and Girls.fortunately since the anime is just 5 ep it doesnt really matter.Characters are just good, some of them are generic, some of them have unusal traits, but honestly, they've got literally zero development, they're really simple and exist for most of time just as plot/gag devices.And considering the tone of this anime, and length, it's just fineArt is average, we got really good character designs, girls are looking lovely, and boys look as local deliquents would look.Can't say much about audio, music was forgettable, except for main theme/opening which was greatVoice acting was just fine, generic 80's starter pack i'd say.You won't consider it as masterpiece, you probably won't remember it after five years, but it doesn't really matter since you probably want just to watch a stupid 80's comedy.;Recommended

Everything else was just ok.

0;Muybridge no Ito;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;9;"It's easy to start this Yamamura animation with half-shut eyes, viewed timidly through the cracks of one's palms covering the face, just as a mother might do with a child while watching an R-rated film, as stepping into what looks like a commissioned biopic/historical piece on Eadweard Muybridge could be a bone-dry subject and fall into the routine trappings of a not-very-artistic documentary with sleep-inducing NPR narrators, but that's fortunately not the case, and this is filled to the brim with Yamamura's usual artistic direction, visual storytelling, and animation.Photographic history is mostly of interest as a subset of technological development, from the antiquated large format cameras and laborious wet-plate processing techniques, to what eventually led to the birth of cinema, as well as animation. Muybridge is perhaps the most important early story there is to be told that has some degree of narrative interest, for most of what transpired before him was of a purely technical nature, such as Johann Zahn, Nicéphore Niépce, William Henry Fox Talbot, and the inventions and improvements of processes from various others (Louis Le Prince also has a fascinating story but that's probably better left to someone along the lines of Hitchcock). Muybridge, instead of being most known for studio portraiture, or the more adventurous and difficult landscape photography (though he engaged in this), attempted a more scientific application of photographic equipment—a study of motion, and his sequential technique and patents were obviously an influence on motion-picture projection.It's probably best to do a little bit of reading on Eadweard Muybridge before watching the short, because while this crosses the lines between semi-documentary, semi-biopic, and artistic animation, there's not a lot of context given. Everything made perfect sense to me because of my prior awareness of Muybridge; I'm not sure how digestible it would be for the uninitiated. All we're directly given via text is that Muybridge (1830-1904) was ""One of the most important figures in the development of the motion picture. His invention, the Zoopraxiscope [1880; this is a predecessor of the movie projector, and the device is juxtaposed with Muybridge's revolver], projected moving drawings created from sequential photographs of animals and humans in movement."" We're also presented with several images of Muybridge's photographic plates, and we're given various dates as we jump around in history.For the basic story details of Muybridge, he married his wife, she had a number of affairs, and Muybridge murdered one of her lovers with a revolver. He was acquitted on the grounds of the act being a ""justifiable homicide."" The main disappointment here is that Muybridge didn't apply his technique to the murder! ""Let me introduce you to the great Eadweard Muybridge, the pioneering snuff film director.""As for the photography, Muybridge experimented in various ways, but he's most known for his chronophotography of animal locomotion from 1878 to 1886. His most famous is the galloping sequence of a horse, and many people have probably seen these images somewhere without realizing Muybridge's involvement.His studies allowed for the photographic breakdown of motion that was either difficult or unable to be perceived by the human eye, and that's why the sequence of horse photos was so important. Paintings of horses prior to precise photographic references of this kind, often depicted the horse's gait improperly. He would have to utilize faster camera shutters and more sensitive photographic emulsion to properly capture his images.Yamamura uses a very expressive and symbolic style of animation, and many strings are severed in the process—as in the name Muybridge's Strings. These ""strings"" were wires that were pulled by the horse (or other animal) in locomotion, and the wire would then trigger the shutter of the camera, and by setting up dozens of cameras with wires attached, a photographic sequence of locomotion could be recorded. Then these sequences of images could be projected onto a screen to produce what was effectively a motion-picture, and so it's obvious how important Muybridge was to subsequent cinematography and animation.Instead of switching between Muybridge's personal and professional life alone, we're also presented with many highly abstract and surreal scenes, the relationship between a mother and her child, and even one scene that I believe was meant to be a reference to the Noah's Ark story, effectively connecting all of history and every small and big event to the same indefatigable stride of time—just made a little more relatable via the ""strings,"" and alongside this more relevant symbol, there are also numbers, clocks, representations of infinity, etc. Though we're occasionally presented with more tangible film editing and narrative, the bulk of the animation is depicted with numerous transitions of scenes and frequent transformations into altogether new scenes that perfectly match the ephemeral nature of time, depicted in a non-linear and poetic fashion.";Recommended

Harmonised with the sound of the piano as the background music to add nuances, this animation serves not only as a befitting tribute to Muybridge’s pioneering contribution to motion pictures and his controversial yet tragic personal life, but also encapsulates the intricacies of a mother-child relationship that is slowly growing apart due to time.";Recommended
0;Yagami-kun no Katei no Jijou;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;3;Hey it's me and I am back with review of a show almost no one of you cares about, but there is no review about it so let's do one.Yagami's Family Affairs is a couple OVAs released in the 1990 and it's story is about how our main protagonist Yagami falls in love with his mom because he hasn't seen photos of him as a child with his mom and because his mom looks young. Yep this is the premise of this thing, the good part is that the mother looks at the statement of the main protagonist as a son that loves his mother as a family relation not a sexual one, but still it is creepy.Also there are stories on how the teacher of our main protagonist wants to have a relationship with the mom and also a dumb story on how one of colleagues of our protagonist's dad wants to break the relationship of him so like that Yuuji get alone with his mom. Again it gets creepy.The jokes in this show get stale very quick, like how Yuuji's classmates wants to date his mom and how our protagonists has to say he is in love with his mom.As with many anime from this era, I am sucker of those designs. I love them and I don't care. These OVAs have some decent animation but sometimes it is reused a lot.If you expect music in this show let me tell you that there is no much. Most of the music that you can listen is in the ending because there is not even an opening. The voice actors are good. I really liked them and do the job, mostly Yuuji's mom which is really soft and sweet to listen.In the end just watch this show if you are curious for Production IG previous works before their sports massive hits. But in the end this is not something that special.;Not Recommended
1;Yagami-kun no Katei no Jijou;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;3;"“Yagami-kun no Katei no Jijou” is a 3-episode romantic comedy OVA about a teenage boy who openly has an Oedipus complex, and it features humorous (?) situations in which he tries to keep it in check, as well as other characters who are sexually attracted to him, his mother or his father, and his dealings with them. As this OVA frequently makes jokes about incest, not to mention other decidedly unfunny topics such as *** and adultery, it’s frustrating to watch.The OVA follows Yuuji Yagami, a high schooler whose sexual attraction towards his youthful mother has recently been aroused. When his mother brings him his lunch on the way to school one day, his friends see her and think she’s his girlfriend or sister, but of course she introduces herself as his mother. Later at school, they tell him that maybe she’s not actually his mother, and he denies this until he realizes he has no pictures of her with him as a child. So then he starts to think his mother is not actually his mother (Seriously? Wouldn’t he have memories of her from his childhood?), and she keeps unintentionally putting him in awkward situations which arouse him further. Once this finally gets resolved and he knows for sure that she’s his biological mother, he proudly declares that he’s in love with her.And from there, it gets worse. Soon, a rival appears in the form of his teacher, who also openly declares that he’s in love with Yuuji’s mother, and he’s going to steal her from him — of course, both of them are forgetting that she’s happily married to Yuuji’s father. Later, another crazy person, an office worker named Mitsuko, appears, and she’s in love with the father, who’s her boss at work. After scheming with Yuuji to tear his father and mother apart, she gradually develops feelings for Yuuji himself, and tries to take him to a love hotel. Meanwhile, Yuuji has 3 “friends” who constantly encourage his feelings towards his mother, while also beating him up from time to time. Also, a girl named Mayuki, who’s a bit odd herself, has a crush on Yuuji and is trying to go out with him (but he’s hesitant, because, you know, he’s in love with his mother).The over-the-top, zany and obsessive characters and their wacky hijinks might be a little more enjoyable to watch if there wasn’t incest, *** and adultery involved. The *** in particular comes out of left field and is quite blatant; at one point, the protagonist declares, “Incest is better than being ***!” when he’s afraid he might get Valentine’s Day chocolates from another guy. Largely due to the subject matter, none of the characters are likable, and since this is based off of a gag manga and there are only 3 episodes, there’s no real character development, either.As for technical aspects, the character designs aren’t bad, but they’re rather unoriginal, and Mayuki’s hairstyle is weird. The backgrounds aren’t detailed and can be abstract at times. There are a lot of visual gags throughout the series, and these probably get the best animation — the animation for the most part tends to be choppy, though. The ending theme is an upbeat, cutesy yet forgettable pop song sung by one of the voice actresses, and the end credits feature closeups of manga panels, a hallmark of low budget OVAs. The voice acting is okay, but the actors’ talents are wasted here.Regarding objectionable content, in addition to the strong themes of incest (basically the raison d'être of this OVA), *** and adultery, there are lots of sexual jokes, both visual and in the dialogue, and some of the dialogue is even bleeped out because of how explicit it is. While there are a few bath scenes, there isn’t really any nudity, with the exception of a brief scene of some of the guys using binoculars to peep on an unnamed woman who’s changing her clothes.Overall, there isn’t really anything enjoyable about “Yagami-kun no Katei no Jijou.” It takes every opportunity to shove the incest theme down your throat, and adds ***, adultery and explicit sexual jokes to top it off. What’s more, the art, animation and other technical aspects of this OVA are subpar. Avoid this one.";Not Recommended

0;Manga Sekai Mukashibanashi;Sony-Sama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sony-Sama;7;Another nostalgic late 80s anime to review~The anime follows an episodic style, where each episode is a new story, fable, or a folklore from somewhere in the world.It has both exotic and classic tales told in their brutal reality, and both are entertaining to sit through. I love the classics where a realistic twist is added to the endings (or just being true to the origins).The stories vary from seeming childish to being extremely impropriate for children (Carmen's story, and Cosette's Mother dying looking terrifying which hunted me for quite a while)!There are happy stories, depressing ones, tear jerking ones, and frightening ones. And most if not all have a lesson to learn.The animation is average considering the year of the release and some episodes consist of only a slide show of pictures.While the art is eye-catching considering it changes according to the story, so it's really amusing and solves the problem of having all MCs of tales looking alike in such animes.I believe it's an ageless classic that deserve a try.;Recommended

0;Fuuma no Kojirou: Seiken Sensou-hen;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;5;Esta review también está en español.Seiken Sensou-hen is the second saga of OVA of Fuuma no Kojirou, one of the not so popular stories of Masami Kurumada, the creator of Saint Seiya. This time, once again, we have various fights, flashy techniques, deaths and lots of bleeding foreheads. So let's begin... but, before that, a reminder: this is a sequel, so if you didn't watch the first part, don't read, since, well, there are a few minor spoilers from part one. Ok, now for real:SS-h's story shows us that, almost immediately after the war between the Fuuma and the Yasha, Kojirou clan's leader, and most of the Fuuma members, were killed. The culprits: a group of warriors called Chaos. The reason: they're searching for the sacred swords, the strongest weapons in the world. Unfortunately for the bad guys, the only Fuuma that actually had a sword wasn't at home at the time of the attack. Now Kojirou seeks revenge, and found allies in those who also had sacred swords and oppose Chaos (one of them is Musashi Asuka, the main antagonist of Yasha-hen) triggering, once again, a holy war for the dominance of the swords.From this, one would though that the development will be very similar to Yasha-hen: two factions collide, 1 vs. 1 fights, and everybody dies almost immediately, for the sake of dynamic battles. While this is true, in SS-h the ninja techniques are replaced by sword techniques. In theory it would be more or less the same, but in practice, the battles end up being very repetitive, even by the standards of a classic shonen. They all follow the same pattern, with only a special attack for character, almost the same sequence of attacks (first the bad dude, then the good guy), and the outcome is the same in 90% of the fights (very different from Yasha-hen, where, except for Kojirou, you'll never knew who will survive). That's pretty lame...As for the characters, they're in the same league of the fights: bellow the quality of the first set of OVA. Although in Yasha-hen the character didn't last long, at least the Fuuma members had something similar to a personality, and their crazy ninja skills gave them a special charisma. Now Kirikaze, Ryuho and Shoryu are left completely aside, and only Kojirou and Ryoma do something. The rest of the good guys (I mean, the others that have a sacred sword) hardly have dialogues, and their participation is minimal (This includes Musashi, which all in all, was the most complete character of the previous series). The bad guys are even more one-dimensional, and their leader, Chaos, is only a dark silhouette for five episodes, and when he finally appears he's as uninteresting as his minions.The technical level is more or less the same as in Yasha-hen, although the animation is a little below in terms of quality. Even in that SS-h could keep up (and in Yasha-hen wasn't brilliant to begin with)... but compared to the other issues, there aren't major complaints.So, in case it's not clear yet, Seiken Sensou-hen is bellow what one might expect after seeing Yasha-hen. The plot and technical shortcomings are forgivable, since, to begin with, no one ask that much in those departments, but the harsh reality is that the action (the true soul of this kind of series) takes some time to start, and when it finally does, it's very, very repetitive. That, and that alone, makes the project to suffer, and makes it hard to recommend. However, while obviously inferior to Yasha-hen, this OVA is slightly entertaining if one has no great pretentions, and it's necessary to watch the final incarnation of Fuuma no Kojirou (Fuuma Hanran-hen, a 50 min film, way better than this). Conclusion: only for (extreme) fans of classic shonens that really liked the first part, and want to know how this ends.--------Seiken Sensou-hen (SS-h) es la segunda tanda de OVAS de Fuuma no Kojirou, una de las historias no tan conocidas de Masami Kurumada, el creador de Saint Seiya. En esta oportunidad, tenemos más peleas, más técnicas rimbombantes, más muertes, más frentes que sangran… Veamos más a fondo… pero no sin antes dar una ligera advertencia: esta es una segunda parte, una continuación directa de la primera, así que si no vieron Yasha-hen, no lean, por que podrían encontrarse algún que otro spoiler. Ahora sí:La historia de SS-h nos muestra que, ni bien terminada la guerra entre los Fuuma y los Yasha, el líder del clan de Kojirou, y buena parte de sus miembros, fueron asesinados. Los responsables: un grupo de guerreros llamado Caos. La razón: están buscando las espadas sagradas, las armas más fuertes del mundo. Por desgracia para ellos, el único Fuuma que tenía una no estaba en casa en el momento del ataque. Ahora Kojirou busca venganza, y terminara aliándose con otros portadores de espadas sagradas que se oponen a Caos (entre ellos, Musashi Asuka, el principal antagonista de la saga anterior) desencadenando, una vez mas (porque ya van varias generaciones sin resolución), una guerra santa por el dominio de las espadas.De esto, uno puede intuir que el desarrollo va a parecerse mucho al de las OVAS anteriores: dos bandos chocan, hay peleas de 1 vs 1, y casi todos mueren casi al instante, en pos del dinamismo. Si bien esto es cierto, en SS-h los combates cambian de técnicas ninjas a técnicas de espadas. En teoría seria más o menos lo mismo, pero las batallas terminan siendo muy repetitivas, incluso para los estándares de un shonen clásico. Todas siguen el mismo patrón, con solo una técnica especial por personaje, casi la misma secuencia de ataques (primero el malo, y luego el bueno) y el mismo desenlace en el 90% de los enfrentamientos (a diferencia de en Yasha-hen, donde, excepto por Kojirou, realmente uno no sabía quiénes iban a sobrevivir).En cuanto a los personajes, es similar a lo que sucedía con las peleas: están por debajo de la calidad de las primeras OVAS. Aunque en Yasha-hen los personajes no duraban mucho, al menos los protagonistas del clan Fuuma tenían algo parecido a una personalidad, y sus locas técnicas ninja les daban un carisma muy especial. Ahora, Kirikaze, Ryuho y Shoryu son dejados por completo de lado, siendo solo Kojirou y Ryoma los únicos que hacen algo. El resto de los buenos (o sea, los que tienen espadas) apenas si tienen diálogos, y su participación es ínfima (esto incluye a Musashi, que dentro de todo, era el personaje más completo de la saga anterior). Los malos son todavía más unidimensionales, y su líder, Caos, es una silueta oscura por cinco capítulos, y cuando por fin aparece, no es más interesante que sus subordinados, ni en diseño, discursos o técnicas.A nivel técnico es más o menos igual que en Yasha-hen, aunque hay que decir que está un poco por debajo de ella a nivel animación. Ni siquiera en eso SS-h pudo estar a la altura… pero, comparado con lo demás, no hay grandes quejas.Así que, por si no quedo claro, Seiken Sensou-hen está por debajo de lo que uno podía esperar después de ver Yasha-hen. Las falencias argumentales y técnicas son perdonables, dado que uno no le exige grandeza a este tipo de producción en esos aspectos, pero la dura realidad es que la acción tarda en empezar, y cuando por fin lo hace, es muy, muy repetitiva. Eso, y solo eso, hace que el proyecto sufra, y que sea difícil recomendar. Sin embargo, si bien inferior, estas OVAs son ligeramente entretenidas si uno no tiene grandes pretensiones, además de ser necesarias si uno quiere ver el final de Fuuma no Kojirou (Fuuma Hanran-hen, una película de 50 minutos bastante interesante). Conclusión: solo para muy fans de shonen clásicos (que obviamente son, si vieron la primera parte).;Mixed Feelings
0;Tarou-san no Kisha;karlyn__kei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/karlyn__kei;8;At first, I was thrown off, since it began with actual film and didn't quickly transition into animation. But when the animation began, I was delighted to find that for once, I wasn't the slightest bit creeped out by it. Normally, very old animation scares me a bit, but despite the odd looking faces on some of the animals, the different things done with the very few resources I'm sure were available at the time are outstanding. The story was cute and funny, too, which caused me to really enjoy it. I even laughed a couple of times, which is more than I can say for some of today's intentionally comedic short series/movies. The music is basically a repetitive loop, but there are some breaks in it which are nice. Additionally, the historical aspect is appealing enough for me to recommend any fan of Japanese animation/film/culture to give it a go.;Recommended

Overjoyed, he plays with it long into the night. When it is finally time for bed, Tarou cuddles up next to his new train set, and dreams he is on a train with many funny animals who cause various wacky hijinks.This delightful little silent short combines live action with animation. A novel idea, and it works well. The retro animation lover or silent film nerd will both enjoy it equally. Even if you can't read the Japanese title cards, you can still understand the story.The wacky animals are enjoyable and the story itself is very charming. This is a good start to see where Japanese animation began. Also, seeing the clothes & household of late-1920s Japan is very interesting. It's well worth 15 minutes of your time to see this little piece of history.;Recommended

0;Qin Shi Mingyue: Tian Xing Jiu Ge;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;"This donghua is a historical fantasy, wuxia type donghua. If you have watched Qin's Moon or Qin Shi Ming Yue, then this is the prequel to it. It is set in the 7 Kingdom Era, which is the era that predates the Qin Dynasty, the first dynasty to unite all of China (time period of Qin's Moon). This donghua, as a prequel features many familiar characters from the original series, telling the story of conflict that began the unification.This particular prequel features 2 MCs, Han Feng from the Han Empire and Li Si the future prime minister of the Qin Empire (more focus on Han Feng though). This particular story is about the formation of Quicksand, and Han Feng's ambition to take over the Han Kingdom and fight the be the master of the world (emerge victorious in the unification). This donghua has alot of political maneuvering, action/fights, ""poetic"" exchanges. It also features the signature animation style of Qin's Moon, especially the women, with swaying hips etc for the added sex appeal. This is quite a good watch, but is definitely hard to appreciate if you don't quite understand Chinese culture or history.I still would recommend this. While it is a prequel and features a host of well-known characters, it can stand on it's own and does not require any previous knowledge to enjoy.";Recommended
0;Shimai Ijiri;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;9;"Slave Sisters is a gloomy love tragedy bound by the shackles of debt. It’s one of the few hentai titles out there that focuses on story and character. Through out the two episode series we are thrown into a pensive psychological drama involving two sisters who’ve just lost their parents and must pay off the debt left to them. They are indebted to a secret organization who have politicians and police commissioners in their back pockets. To make matters worse, it seems they have no choice but to become sex slaves in order to pay off their debts. A trainer has been sent by the organization to train the sisters in order to fetch high prices on the black market.The premise sounds like the typical hentai plot I know, but I assure you it is nothing but. The whole story is very psychological and character driven. There are revelations as well as shocking surprises that will leave you stunned. Through out Slave Sisters we not only watch the development of Yukari and her younger sister Miku, but also Shunji, the trainer, as well. What appears to be a straight forward relationship is actually quite complicated underneath. Each character has a façade they need to portray to one another, however, behind the façade is the true reality which they must except if they are to move forward; a relationship analogous to a Russian doll perhaps.At the very center you have Miku, who is still rather young and knows nothing about the debt left to them by her deceased parents. She is rather care-free, happy-go-lucky, and a bit of an airhead. Miku believes that Shunji is her sister’s new fiancé and everything will be fine as they start their new lives in Shunji’s apartment. Then we have Yukari who shields her younger sister from reality and tries to burden everything on her own shoulders. She is mature and well mannered but soon looses herself in lust to Shunji’s skillful ways. Enveloping the two is Shunji who is assign to train the sisters to be sex slaves. He is good at what he does and if all goes well, he’ll be able to retire. But behind his seemingly detached persona we learn that he is quite empathetic towards the two. He gives Yukari a ray of hope and struggles with the demands of the organization. He does what is best for Yukari the only way he knows how. Finally, overshadowing all of them is the secret organization, a soulless dark entity of which there is no escape from. Rich elites show up on TV screens in a dark room, getting head while giving orders which are absolute. Those bastards!Perhaps one of the shortcomings of Slave Sister is its art and animation. Though, for a series that’s more than a decade old, I really can’t complain. The art and animations look rather simple and there is not a lot of detail that goes into the private parts. However, the character design looks good with realistic proportions. The sex scenes aren’t that extensive but do draw you in with character emotions and artistic expressions. They’re not great is what I’m saying, although I did find it entertaining.The first episode focuses on Yukari and her sexual training, while the second episode is about Miku’s “loss of innocence”. There are elements of BDSM, piss, and enema play; but very brief. The bulk of the sex scenes are one-on-one vanilla sex with some dildos involved finishing off with some ménage a trois.The voice acting is an excellent portray of the characters. I recognized the voice of Miku to be none other than Nina, the cat-girl from ""Words Worth"". She has a very cute and pleasing voice. The BG music really accentuates the sullen mood through out and the music score reminded me of something out of “The Godfathers”.Overall, I really enjoyed Slave Sisters. If you like your hentai with psychologically driven stories and character development then Slave Sisters is a must watch. Although you might find it difficult to “workout your wrists” to, it will definitely give you an emotional workout with its bittersweet moments… more bitter than sweet perhaps, but good none-the-less.";Recommended
1;Shimai Ijiri;Yalaa;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yalaa;7;Surprisingly Good!As it's title suggests it's about two sisters forced into sex slavery, once they meet this guy Shinji they are forced to do all kinds of dirty and sexual things as training. Shinji has been doing this for quite some time and never felt good about it but once he's forced to train the sisters is when he starts to doubt his life and career. While he's not necessarily a good guy, he wants the sisters to be free and have a good life but knows resistance is futile, so he tries to make the girls feel comfortable as much as he can.I really like how this ova takes its time to develop the characters and it's story, the art and animation are low budget so average hentai scenes are to be expected. The music is dark and somber and the ending is sad and shocking. Overal very good story but don't expect any great h-scenes or animation!;Recommended

0;Doukyuusei (OVA): Climax;Energetic-Nova;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Energetic-Nova;8;"I would say, this is a very good vanilla hentai if what you are looking for is plot with porn at the end, just like the first in this series.It has, like the first, very romantic ways of moving the camera. And it really does feel like a full classic OVA which just happens to have sex at the end.Unlike many hentai, this series does show the guys' faces when in pleasure. Also the protagonist has a harem but not an open harem. So those who like closed poly relationships, yeah this is possibly for you. The protag is a likeable pervert even if he does seem to want to hit on all the girls.The censorship in this one unlike the last one, avoids ALL mosaic and just goes the route of not showing penis or vagina ever. Which might be a turn off for some people. But the boobs are uncensored, and smaller in size how they were before but ""good hand size"" if you know what I mean. Just that perfect happy medium in my opinion.If you wish to skip to the sex, skip to the last ten minutes of each OVA.I highly rec this to anyone who wants the kind of hentai where people look longingly into each other's eyes a lot and show moany faces and say I love you, over genital focus or any sort of fetish. :)";Recommended
0;Tsubaki Iro no Purijioone;ThatRandomDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatRandomDude;9;"Oh boy... how to start... this film threw me into a really bad loop.I ignored this film for months thinking it was going to be another one of those hentai flicks with a scumbag Mc who rapes and sexually abuses the servants but boy was I wrong!I was told to give it a try that I would not regret it and thankfully i don't....This film feels more like an R-rated suspense/mystery drama than an actual hentai.Porn with plot, anyone?Sure there was a bit of rape and sexual abuse but its justified and is not gruesome or hardcore.Also the Mc is a prick but no obnoxious, he actually has a reason to why he is a prick but things change in later run with his character development.Yes... there was actual character development in a hentai film... surprising isn't it?And the h-scenes are more mild and vanilla than actual rape scenes to be honest.I thought that the main heroine was going to be the maid with glasses since she is in the cover but god damn! the twist that just happened with her throw me off!I guess she was more of a catalyst than a heroine for the following train wreck that soon came forward.And then they kept me on a loop asking myself ""who is the god damn culprit?!""I had my suspects but then there were other twists that made me doubt but at the end I was right.Alright, on the cast we got: An abhorred Mc who is a prick because he hates his father for what he did to his mother.An agent that tries to make him inherit the state and fortune.A butler of the family.A glasses maid who was in love with the Mc's father.A childhood friend maidA long haired maid who wants to be Mc's #1 girlAnd a yandere maid who is completely mind broken.The following I will discuss the story so you will find spoilers. If you dont want to read spoilers you can come back after watching the film or just skip forward to my conclusion.Now lets begin.Saionji, Akitsugu is the main character male lead. He became a grumpy young man and a prick after witnessing the suicide of his mother and blames his father for driving his mother into such action, so he left the mansion to never return.years later his father died and Hayami, Sayo, who claims to be an investigator (and its actually a japanese federal agent in a cover mission), came to him since she was supposedly hired to bring Saionji (the Mc) back to the mansion to inherit everything; thing that he refused but Sayo (the agent) made a deal with him and in the end convinced him.He comes to Japan to deal with the inheritance hassle but was with a bad attitude all the way because of his hatred. There he meets the butler and 4 maids who served under his father in the mansion... and secretly were used for 'special service' (except one of them for reasons soon will be told)After witnessing the the maid with glasses get molested by another maid, he went to speak with the butler. The butler tells him that the maids were used for special night services which is why the behavior but the one most affected by the death of the master was glasses maid who was in love with.Mc bites on the service idea and thinking of trying to break glasses maid and make her loyal to him, requests to be the first one to service him.However, glasses maid actually tried to assassinate Mc before being submitted for [revenge maybe?] because of her love to the master.Mc easily neutralizes her and proceed to sexually molest the maid entering in foreplay as he fingers the maid until she orgasm... alas there was no sign if she later got penetrated or not as the screen fades and scene changes.The next day... PLOT TWIST!! Butler brought Mc to the bathroom because he found glasses maid dead... DEAD!!!! DAFAQ?! What a way to waste a maid, and I liked her too...Anyways, Mc began to think that all this was a plot for him to leave the mansion and forget the inheritance so he took in his hands to look for the culprit. Then he asked butler to hide the body in the basement's freezer.At breakfast the next day, he informs the maids that glasses maid died, long haired maid asked 'who killed her', thing that Mc glares at her saying he never said it was murder and asked her how she knew, which made long hair maid fidget.Out of suspicion, that night she was requested, and it turns out that long haired maid wanted to be Mc's #1 girl so she pretty herself up and wore the best dress and head her way to young master's chambers to get her most waited wish of a lovey dovey passionate night...Boy was she wrong...She ended up in a torture chamber instead as she was submitted to bondage and Mc tortured her to confess that she was the killer.Then proceed to rape her with sex toys trying to make her spill the beans.But she claims she was not the culprit, sure she felt jealous because she wanted to be close to her young master and serve him with all her heart but she did not kill glasses maid.Mc even threw a snake at her but she still claims innocence so he let her go.The next day, his childhood friend maid almost got killed by a falling base and Mc had to calm her down by the scare.That night he requested for childhood maid's services to talk about what she knew and about the incident.She was about to confess something but hold back, then Mc took her for a stroll to reminiscence on past memories and then both got trapped on the green house.Long haired maid knew this, it looks like she was the one who did it which made him think (and us) that she lied when torture and she was the culprit when she suddenly showed up up front of the locked door. Then speaks muted words to the Mc and walks away.Hours later they were found by butler and agent and rescued them, but Akane (childhood maid) suffered from sever fever so they took her for first aid.Then Mc quickly began to look for long haired maid to request for an explanation of her actions but could not find her anywhere. Then he remember the basement and went there to find himself with her corpse... it seems she was trapped and died from bleeding from a stab wound in the stomach; but she had a key in her hand.It seems the long hair maid was innocent and all she did was go back to the mansion to ask for help and find the key to free her beloved young master when the murderer got to her.Loss for words, Mc began to analyses everything and then came to one conclusion.He confront the last maid and demanded her to tell the truth. He claimed that it was her that killed glasses maid, and then tried to kill childhood maid then killed long haired maid.She claimed that she could not be the culprit because the day the vase fell on Akane (childhood maid) she was on the toilet.Then he says that doesn't matter because the bathroom was on the exact same spot...Then the last maid reveals herself to really be a yandere mind broken psychotic maid and does confess that she killed them all because they always brought filth to the house, a house that she is obsessed with and claims to be hers and her only.Then she draws out a knife and tries to stab Mc. Mc brought out a gun given to him by agent earlier but before he could shoot, butler intervened.Yandere maid was then captured and tied up then Mc and butler discuss what to do next as they supposedly found the culprit.Mc requests for butler to tell him why he stopped him; then butler begans to tell a sad tale about a little girl who had problems with the family, was tortured as a child but then was saved by the Mc's father... but then also mind broke her with sexual services... yandere mentally broke down and began having illusions that she was the master's daughter and that she had a right to claim the house.Mc then had a moment of compassion and asked butler to bring her to his chambers, thing that butler opposed.Yandere maid then proceeded that night to his room, with another illusion of daddy/daughter play... yet Mc calmly took her to bed and began treating her kindly and lovely with gentleness and care and proceed to have full sex with.The next day, Mc found yandere girl chocked to death and hanging from the Curtains. It seemed that she was not the culprit in the end but a mind broken child.And Mc was once again at loss.Later on, Akane (childhood friend) thinks about her secret, the thing she wanted to confess... it turns out that the master didnt touch her because she is actually his daughter and Mc's little sister...This is confirmed as the master confesses that if something happens to him, she should look bellow a certain portrait in the house.In that place was a key and a picture with the master, the mother and Akane.Agent and Akane fight over the key, so not to tell Mc about it but he found them fighting and demanded an explanation. Agent and Akane half lied half told the truth about the incident, but Mc is not stupid, after seeing the picture he figured out.So now there are two heirs for the fortune.This didn't stop the Mc and told his now sister maid that he didn't care and kind of knew all along that they were siblings always wanted to get her out of the house. He then tells her to forget everything and to come with him to America, but she rejected him and ran... to have some time alone to think.Soon after, thinking about everything, Mc discovered the secret behind the key and the portrait and took out what was hidden inside.After he met with butler, showed a picture that had him, his mother and the young butler behind and made him confess... Mc asked if he was his real father, thing that butler stopped him on.Then both came back to the topic... why did he killed all the maids...He confessed he did it out of anger because the maids tried to harm him, the heir, for their own reasons, things that should be taboo for a servant to harm the master out of whim or selfishness so he thought that punishment was necessary.Then butler said to take out the bodies and give the report to the police. Mc hesitated at first but Butler told him that he already called the police and was going to give himself in.That night, sister maid came to his room and after a lot of thought... she accepted his request and also made a request of her own to take her. He hesitated but she begs for him to take her as her wish, since she was wishing to be with him all along.They proceed to have a sweet night of passion involving incest to show their love to one another.And the next day they were going to America as promise.However, the next day Akane was nowhere to be found (At this point i was wishing hard for the sister to at least survive, but after seen this scene my heart sank... thankfully i worried for nothing).Mc could not find sister anywhere, then Agent Sayo confronted him and put him at ease. She confessed to be a secret agent working for the government and took Akane into a protection program because since it was discovered that she is a second heir, there was going to be conflict between the nobles and the duke so for her safety she was taken into custody.But Agent Sayo promised that she would try to do what she can to bring her back to him but he had to give her time.One year later, Mc was back in America with his company when he received a Christmas card from Sayo for a surprise.Mc ran quick to the airport and received his beloved childhood friend turned sister slash lover and both embraced tenderly.The film ends with Agent Sayo receiving a new mission and giving her good byes to Saionji, lamenting that they will not meet again.CONCLUSION AND ANALYSISBoy... this film threw me in a loop... after the first plot twist of the glasses maid being murdered, i sat there shocked not wanting to believe creators actually did that. My questions were: ""But wasn't she the main heroine? She is in the cover after all!""And i confess that after that I was hooked. H-scenes be damned I wanted to see the story instead! So i finished this for the story and the H-scenes was just a nice add on the side.Like I mentioned; this film feels more like a drama than a porn flick.But I am really angry... how dare they kill all those maids! That was a pretty bad waste of maids! That really made me disappointed... all those maids wasted... (pun intended).But i have to admit the character development was awesome for being a hentai film.The art was good, but the animation lacked a bit.And the story was one awesome idea that hooks you up!All that time I was screaming in my mind ""Who is the culprit"" over and over again!I am glad i sat down to watch this, the hour and half of this film was not wasted at all.So i am proud to say that this was a masterpiece...However I will give it a 5 on overall because creator killed all the maids >.>And you do not kill the maids!!!!(I have a maid fetish, sue me!)One of the reason i decided to watch this film was because of the maids, specially the cute one with glasses... BUT SHE IS DEAD!!! GOD DAMMIT!!!Anyways... I recommend this film to you all if you want a hentai flick with one awesome plot that would keep you in suspense and then relax you a bit with h-scenes.P.S.Ok, ok! I will give it a 9 for overall! I know i am being unfair with a 5! But I will not give a full 10 because I am still mad for killing off the maids!";Recommended
0;Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: Psycho no Aisatsu;SanaeK10;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SanaeK10;6;Just finished watching this on Bushiroad's Youtube Live.Milky Holmes Finale is a final sendoff to our 4 heroines and it does so in a fairly basic manner. It's similar in quality to the previous anniversary specials, in that most of the episode is just reminding you of the good old days and how funny the series was in the first 2 seasons and the movie.Still, as the finale of the series, it works decently enough. Seeing the Feathers get mercilessly bullied is always a treat (it happens twice here too, thrice counting a newspaper clip from last year's anniversary).And the final scene wraps things up nicely. A nice callback to the first episode when all the Milkies finally graduated (from their attic, bad joke Milky staff). Kind of a cop out, but I'll admit, I teared up when the ED started rollling.Don't be sad because it ended, be glad because it happened.Sayonara, Milky Holmes.And I'll still await the day the Glitter Green girls go on weird wacky adventures in Yokohama.;Mixed Feelings
0;Marvel Future Avengers 2nd Season;dragonsomething1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dragonsomething1;2;This made me throw up tbh.(I need more information to publish, its bad, don't watch it.)This show is so bad, so atrocious in fact that it made me puke on multiple occasions.I hated every second but still watched both seasons, the only plausible reason for this is that I have something inside of me I want to kill. I usually do this with alcohol and sleep deprivation but this time I decided to subject myself to this and it had more long term psychological damage than any and all of my past behavior combined. I actually usually like bad media because I like to laugh at it but this series is so bad I can't even laugh at it. The only reason it is a 2 and not a 1 is that I am impressed at it's ability to butcher eastern and western culture at the same time. This is the most loose product to fit the title of anime I have ever seen. And it's capability to butcher the beloved characters it is based on is something to behold.;Not Recommended
0;Aa Harimanada;Tsuki_215;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsuki_215;5;Story 4The story is the weakest aspect of Aa Harimanada, it doesn't have much of a story line. The plot revolves around Harimanada disregard for Sumo tradition which doesn't go down well with the Sumo sports authority(SSA). Rest of the anime revolves around the tussle between Harimanada and the authority.The story is simplistic and there aren't any/many twist and turns in it. The good thing is that there aren't any fillers .Art 5For a 90's anime the art is okay. One gripe i had was that the faces of many of the antagonists looked similar and i couldn't tell the difference. Also some of the background scene were used repeatedly and in some instance you couldn't tell whether the crowd were upset or happy.Sound 6The background music in this anime was good and enhanced quality of different scenes in the anime. The voice acting was spot on and portrayed the characters pretty well.Character 4The characters in the anime including main character were one dimensional. Neither the protagonist nor the antagonist motivation for what they did were fleshed out. While the anime did make a flimsy attempt at showing why the SSA was upset with Harimanada, but it felt contrived. Nor was any attempt made to explain why Harimanada had such disregard for Sumo traditions and why he started acting up after he became yokuzuna and not before.Enjoyment 6While the story is weak and characters are one dimensional. Harimanada's rebellious nature and overwhelming strength will make you enjoy the show. Even though the story is predictable you will still want to know how Harimanada takes on the Sumo world from the get go.The strongest aspect of the anime is it's fight scene's.There are lot of them and it is not unusual to see 3 fight scene in one episode. Even though some of the fight scene are predictable you still would want to see how the fight goes. Also, some fight are pretty intense.Overall 5Who should watch this anime?People who want simplistic story lie with lot's of fight scene.People who want to see a character who has overwhelming strength and fighting sense.People who want to watch an old anime to get a feel of the art style and sound quality.Who should not watch this anime?People who want to see an anime with deep or a good story line.People who want to know about world of Sumo.If this anime was a cuisine/food you can compare it to Popcorn. Popcorn has no meaningful nutrition value and it wont fill your stomach, but if you want something to eat as a way to pass time than this anime will do.;Mixed Feelings
1;Aa Harimanada;Froban;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Froban;5;So what do you get when you have an anime about a Sumo who declares that he's going to break that he will break Showa Futabayama's record of 69 consecutive wins, and if he ever lost, no matter how sly the means, he would retire then and there? You get an anime with low tension where the main character never grows or progresses, the same Harima from the first episode remains the same in the final episode. So much controversy in the association because the main protagonist, Harima, can't for the life of him take one match off from wearing a mask, even I was getting annoyed along with the hecklers in the anime.So Aah! Harimanada has a simple plot that one can follow easily, though this is because it's absolutely repetitive and too bland for a series like this. There's a good number of wrestlers and most get backstories, you get to see their personalities shine if only for a little bit. They have the same goals (albeit, they all have the same goal) and the risks they'll take to put down the masked annoyance. Is it sad to say that I rooted for Harima's opponents to win since they respect the traditions of Sumo far highly than Harima, but because of the series' premise, it leads to disappointment before matches begin.I do like the character designs, mostly the Sumo wrestlers, I love the thick stroke they have in matches, giving the wrestlers a lot of weight to them. Shame about the animation though because you can tell the studio didn't have the budget to make more dynamic fights: Repeated frames, lack of movement, moments going on for longer than they should, you name it. At the very least, I may have gained some very basic knowledge of Sumo wrestling and that lifestyle too, so that's cool. And some fights were at least decent even though you know the outcome.Aah! Harimanada is quite average but had potential to be so much better. Every character are decent, the sumo wrestlers were very interesting characters apart from Harima, who is a douchebag, I think he's meant to be a heel wrestler, but the anime's pacing is sloppy and the story progression is rather flat. If you want a Sumo anime where you just care about the fights, I'd say watch a few episodes, and if you somehow get hooked into the series, then I'm happy for you, but if you get bored with it after episode 3-4, don't worry, you ain't missing much.;Mixed Feelings
0;Binetsu Shoukougun;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;7;Overall I gave it an 7. Keep in mind this pre 2000 so not bad given the time frame.English DubbedUncensoredIt is a softcore comedy.anime was old school drawn(not realistic)The voice acting did not match my subtitles so i killed off the subtitles. Even then there was voice when there was no character shown. Meaning perhaps 2 percent of each episode had random audio. Aside from that the voice actors were crisp.I enjoyed the sound effectsThe plot definitely seemed real to me.There was no intro (theme song) that i could recall. which was not bad but depending on jingle could have been nice.Oh before i forget their censorship was wack! either keep it or lose it. I am guessing each artist involved had to do their scene their way. you are a team act like it! Despite that frustration you have to admit it was a bit funny.;Recommended
0;Zunda Horizon;bontakunARX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/bontakunARX;7;Plot-wise, this anime is suitable mainly for vocaloid fans and fans of the Tohoku sisters (Kiritan, Zunko, and Itako) specifically. They are at their cutest here. It's a wholesome show where you'll get some side knowledge about gastronomy as related to soybeans as well. That being said the plot is very cheesy, especially during the resolution. You will not find anything particularly ingenious or heart wrenching here. But if the sight of Kiritan finally using those cannons like you always thought she could is enough to make your day, then do watch this.Quality of production is good. The singing synths are used in the actual music, of which there is quite a lot for such a short show. And the art is great, with the Tohoku sisters looking like they should and the other characters having distinctive designs.;Recommended

2;Joshidai: Ecchi Soudanshitsu;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;1;This might be the single worst hentai, let alone anime, that I've ever seen barring something with a reprehensible fetish, and that's quite a feat. There's always something that appeals to someone, but the quality of this leaves so much to be desired that I wonder who would watch this over literally anything else out there.When Madoka goes to her counselor, the man who she has had a crush on, for advice on her classes, she discovers that he was having sex with another student. After confroning him about it, she is seduced by him, and is taken to new places of erotic heights. She soon finds herself embarking on sexual adventures with more people along the way.While that sounds like it could appeal to someone, the rest of the anime is so atrocious that i couldn't see anyone sitting through something this terrible.The animation quality barely qualifies as that of something on Newgrounds circa 2001. The animation of the Meet 'N Fuck flash series is better than this, and that barely moved. If you told me that this was someone's first time handling flash in 2003 while living in their mother's basement, I would have believed you.Listening to the sound is just as annoying. With a generic as fuck soundtrack, along with bland and annoying voice acting and sound effects. I guess someone only had a lunch break to edit this whole thing together, and that included trying to get all of the sound effects.Seeing the whole thing, I refuse to believe that this was pressed to a DVD. There is absouletely no way someone would pay to have this released to the general public. I never thought I would say this, but there was more effort put into Abunai Sisters than this, and that was incredibly hard for me to say.I had to struggle to even find any information on this title. Literally all of my searches led me to streaming sites hosting this, and that's about it. If I hadn't sat through this heap, I'd say that there were only a few images that someone would have posted of their half finished flash project buried deep on some obscure internet forum with only a few posts, all of which were in 2002.Simply putting the Japanese name into into Google only gave me three pages of results. Only three. I thought that was impossible given the vast scope and depth of the awful things the internet had to offer. When I put the english title into Google, it wasn't even a page before it gave me completely unrelated posts.I can't recommend this to anyone. It's so unappealing to look at that I can't imagine anyone jerkin' it to this unless you've literally never seen porn, or even know very little about sex, and this is your first experience to it. With the wealth of high quality hentai out there, or even decent quality, I'd say you should definitely give this a miss. What a waste of my time.;Not Recommended

0;The Embryo Develops into a Fetus;lavratti;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lavratti;5;"I honestly don't know why so many people gave this animation such a low score.Story: 6 - Fair story, for a one-minute-anime.Well, as the title says, the story is about an embryo that develops into a fetus, a alien. It doesn't have a in depth story or a real educational value, but it surely don't have any plot holes as *many* big titles out there.Art: 8 - Actually good animation.The animation is very simple, being also black and white, but the style is very calming and not aggressive at all.

0;CMFU Xueyuan: Shenshi Ji Jijian;Adampk;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Adampk;7;"It was kind of nice sport anime. It a story which focuses on fencing (the is the only anime which exist about proper fencing as of now). Each episode short (8-10 mins) with 24 episodes so its equal to a proper 12 episode anime.Story (6/10)Story is basically about a freshman named Minnie who has joined CMFU fencing club because of her fascination with ""Three Musketeers"". She is quite athletic but she has no experience in fencing. The plot is her journey in the world of fencing as well as Fencing club battles in a Fencing contest especially with their rivels Yunzong Academy. She is trained by president Chu Zhuoran through this ordeal.It had a good story but nothing special which stands out. It is quite realistic portrayal (expect for few high tech gadgets) and gives lot of info about fencing. One of the things I disliked was lack of protagonist's involvement in matches. She barely participated in the contest. In the entire series she only once participated as a substitute in the finale. (That also didn't go so well). But it's understandable since she is a newbie.Art (7/10)Animation was decent. But still way better then average Chinese anime out there. Fencing battles were nice realistic tooSound (6/10)I liked the op. But sound effect were average, nothing special. Ed was okCharacter (7/10)Characters were very likeable.

0;Tian Huang Zhan Shen;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;5;"Tian Huang Recap (Mild Spoilers)Tian Huang is a cultivation xianxia donghua that follows Ji Xiaofa, a once promising young cultivator Jishui village and the son of the village head, It all went wrong when Xiaofa simped for a girl and gave his cultivation base (wheel of life) to the girl and crippling himself as a result; He ended up being used and discarded stooping down to the village's cripple. Young cultivators from Jishui village are scouted by the kingdom to help fight against beasts and blood races. Fed up with the treatment of his son, XIaofa's father went in search for medicine to re-establish his son's wheel of life but goes missing instead all the while Grandpa Hu gave a mysterious relic that helped re-establish XIaofa's cultivation. XIaofa's journey now steered into finding his father and reuniting with his friends as well as destroying enemies.Story: 4/10Tian Huang is basically every other cultivation donghua about a main character who used to be the rising star but turned into trash and after a string of events gains an unfair progression in cultivation. Except, the same main character makes some very questionable decisions that lead to illogical outcomes and a lot of repetitive content. We see Xiaofa constantly fighting enemies that underestimate him, random enemies that keep coming back to him after losing, power abuse of elders and betrayals. There are some donghua that have this style of writing but there's always a twist to at least differentiate it from being the same weak plot. The story is so predictable that you don't even need to watch half the episodes to know what happens; The episodes are full of meaningless encounters with smallfry enemies or some random examination that happens once every three years or some bs like that.Art & Sound: 5/10At this point, Ruo Hong Culture are known to re-use visual and audio assets in their projects to save time on character designs and set design. Nothing wrong with preserving budget but they don't improve on quality with the same assets they've used for years and the character rigging is rough as ever.Character: 4/10Xiaofa is a sheltered and spoiled main character who barely cultivates and is always finding trouble for himself with his weak cultivation. His character is obnoxious and unbearable to watch because of his lazy, over optimistic outlook. The female characters with love interest with him feel superficial and come out of nowhere especially Xiao Douya who has barely any background with Xiaofa in the beginning. His male friends basically exist in the series to suck up to the main character at every encounter.Enjoyment & Overall: 5/10Not a good show. Too predictable and the characters exist to make MC look better. MCs cultivation isn't that special, we still aren't introduced to his mysterious power that the fox beast king mentions earlier with the bird beast king. So much unconcluded details that just doesn't add up despite the first season ending.";Mixed Feelings
0;Tian Huang Zhan Shen;MrHaibo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MrHaibo;2;Tian Huang Zhan Shen is another one of those Chinese anime where the main character starts as the weakest in his village but some how becomes over powered and no one can stand a change against him in a matter of episodes.I don't feel like there's a reason for me to write a full on review so I'll state how I feel. There's no reason for you to waste 6 plus hours on this anime. The writing is lazy, the plot line is so blend that you will probably have a better time watching paint dry and the characters are beyond generic.

4;Attakai, Fuyu Canada;SmugFuck;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SmugFuck;10;"Easily one of the best shonen, isekai to date.Full of many diverse characters that all have well written and expansive back stories, very little filler but enough to give the characters some added depth as well as helping ease tension between the once enemies, and a large focus on the subculture of a Hetalia character. Although it was surprising to see the animation budget put into the SCULPTED ""mountains"" of the female protagonist Can, while her brother Nada's ""snow"" was extremely detailed as well and the gratuitous scenes were violent. Far from being for children but certainly a strong viewing for most audiences! Some compelling scenes include the protagonist fighting on a frozen lake as well as some fan service scenes involving Can having syrup slowly drizzled over her. This was shortly followed by an extremely detailed full penetration scene that lasted about half an hour, also The following point is the targeting of youth. Companies are essentially trying to breed future consumers at a young age, and in doing so multiple companies are creating the same message of self-hate in children that becomes a norm. Although the power is in the consumer it holds very little meaning when they are groomed at a young age to never be satisfied with their skin, their weight, and their fashion. Companies are creating depressed consumers so that they won’t have to worry about a fluctuation in profit, they can sit back and just keep hitting rewind for each new generation and continue hurting their mental and physical health while continuing to profit. One could argue that these companies are solving a financial problem by creating jobs to keep industries alive as well as systems that thrive under late capitalism, there are solving a societal need for gratification even if the consumers never experience it themselves. The functionals perspective works under the belief that cultural trends change to reflect our society, an example of this is listed in the film, the film talks about how Japan used to value varying weight and body types in women because it showed wealth and so on, but in the 1980’s this was changed and women started experiencing things like anorexia and massive amounts as global society crept in and changed how women “should” look. The consistent practices of dieters also goes hand in hand with functionalism, the dieters loose weight but eventually fail and start the cycle anew helping to keep these institutions in business, the current institutions being companies. The companies are actively hoping for customer dissatisfaction and failure so they return and keep their business alive. If most products were truly successful and lasted as long as possible the institutions behind the products would not last as long and would have consistent lows in sales, which in turn would kill the business. Functionalism believe in shifting cultural values is true as well, as with the previously mentioned change in Japanese culture there is noticeable change in other countries and cultural norms as well. This is heavily seen with skin whitening creams in the south and east and in contrast tanning in the west, twenty years ago this wasn’t a cultural focus but the destruction of self-worth has created an opening for these things. One last important point of functionalism is the belief that is the satisfaction of the individual. Although these companies do no actually satisfy long term and actively try and not do this they create a temporary satisfaction once the money leaves the consumers wallet, it doesn’t last and thus the consumer returns, but for a small time they are very satisfied and might even recommend the product to others but eventually the high faulters and they must return to the companies and buy more.As previously stated pop a perc 30 and enjoy!";Recommended

0;Chimera: Target I Datenshi Kourin;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;6;Chimera is one of those hentai that are a little tougher to rate than others due to it delivering pretty well on the story and creating a world but failing pretty bad on delivering decent sex scenes.The story is basically broken up into two stories, the first being a revenge/origin story for Rei, the main character, and the second following an encounter with the victims family after Rei kills their father. Both are pretty interesting and solid stories and would probably work as a decent action anime.The art is good for the time it was made and the animation is also well done. There is very little to nit pick it for unless its style isn't in your taste.The only really big flaw is it fails as a hentai. There are only a couple of sex scenes that are very brief and show relatively nothing outside of implied shots and silhouettes majority of the time. These are really huge drawbacks if your looking for something for fap material.Overall, if you like action, futanari/hermaphordite, and a solid story then you might enjoy Chimera a bit. If you're looking for a good hentai you probably should look elsewhere as this won't deliver enough quality scenes for that.;Mixed Feelings

I'm assuming it's been given the rightful status it deserves in Japan, but it seems to be quite underrated and unheard of apart from there, we should appreciate it more.The structure here is about a magical station that captures the souls and memories of those who pass it and keep them in limbo. Minky Momo and her cousin surrogate cross each other in a symmetrically playful way, the station is in the center of the town and seems to have a metaphysical connection somewhere else. It's interesting and one of the handful incidents in anime where in synchronicity I encounter something I experienced earlier somewhere else. In this case, today I was reading on the Venus eight-year harmonic and the shape it makes in space (just like the shape of the colorful glass dome of the station above the ""lion"" statue, ha!), sacred geometry is everywhere indeed.Please watch this and think of your dearest dreams.";Recommended

Sure it is filled with mistakes but that is what makes it cute and adorable. People with no prior experience showing dedication and commitment to one an other is admirable. The Main character from start of introduction down to conclusion demonstrates this in many ways. Demonstrates loyalty to family by fetching a show for one of his sisters. Courage when aiding a stranger in trouble. Compassion when acknowledging other's fears and other emotions. One can't help but to smile an be proud. Thus in doing so one can connect to the character as well as character's action. Making no problem for the audience to immerse themselves into the show.Only complaint was conclusion. While it was heart warming to see the embracing moment. I would have liked a surprising factor in a comedy fashion. Just to make the film a bit more entertaining.SoundNo complaints only compliments. During some erotic scenes one might here bom chika wowow kind of music and while that can fit the mood it is somewhat degrading. Not here.

0;Hentatsu;triplefox;https://myanimelist.net/profile/triplefox;8;"This is the sort of anime that is obviously a director's indulgence, but Tatsuki ensures that it ""goes somewhere"" and finishes in less time than a single ""full"" TV episode; I would consider Vlad Love a comparable recent series. The difference is, Vlad Love doesn't commit to the bit and meanders between telling a traditional story and just ""doing whatever"" which makes it feel like a huge timesink. Hentatsu is entirely ""doing whatever"" and that works a lot better.The content is a pastiche of previous Tatsuki/Yaoyorozu works, thus we have an animated talk show set in a mysterious post-apocalypse, plus a few flashy action scenes. It doesn't have any overarching message, although there's plenty of meta-commentary. It's really like one big calling card - ""here's more of the thing you liked"" - and there really isn't much to say about it as a story. The animation likewise is of the same style as usual - 2D backgrounds, 3D characters, with most of the focus being on establishing feeling and motion rather than nailing rendering details. Tatsuki's style is unique and authentic, and that's why I like it,";Recommended

I understand that the scene was in a hot environment but it ruins the show the way it was done. Luckily the brightness issue exists mainly in the introduction.Sound- no complaintsCharacter-Main characters are those who you see often in a show. It is kind of disappointing when one of the main characters roles has only a minor role. Plus, the specific character that had the 'minor role' was female. Normally, that would not matter per-say but her parts were mainly if not all beauty centered. For some people this may cause some aggravation. On how there is more to a girl/women than appearances.-another aspect worth noting is the plan of the phonies. Later does one realize the sad truth behind the facade but you would think given their sad story they wouldn't act so rude/ungrateful especially being falsely rewarded. An example worth noting is the wiping of the mouth.OverallThe movie may lack luster, lack in action but is strong in moral/kindness. Although, as kind as that may be it was foolish. Seeing how they are fighters fighting in a hot environment. Which means a lot of energy is being burned off. Without proper replenishment the body will collapse.;Mixed Feelings

0;Calm;Pitzer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pitzer;5;"The world of experimental shorts is generally left unexplored by a large part of the community. And even among the few looking for obscure content, a great many of these shorts will remain ""heard of"" but ultimately untouched, with only a few notable exceptions. This may be because word of mouth and exploring for yourself are really the only ways to find some of the gems hidden in the rubble, or because people aren't all that interested in these experimental but oftentimes meaningless works to begin with.Calm is no different, offering only an ambiguous two-act daydream rather than a fleshed-out narrative and a faceless, nameless girl as the main character. There is no dialogue nor character development to speak of, and thematically it is a barren wasteland. So what does it do different than other shorts and why is it worth watching? The answer lies in the title.One of Calm's greatest strengths is that it is stripped of all pretense: it aims to do nothing but offer a calm atmosphere with a tinge of eeriness, and it does so for all of its seven minute runtime. From the very beginning, the constant light flickering of the images and the yellowing of the screen evoke a sense of nostalgia as the viewer is transported into the girl's daydreams.In the following few minutes, sequences of evolution, the girl turning into a bird creature and flying through the skies, turning into a dolphin and swimming across the ocean, traversing planes of chizzled lines in the short's usual handpainterly smudgy style of animation—generally strange but mesmerizing images create an atmosphere of calm. Meanwhile, the minimalist soundtrack consisting of mainly guitars and a synthesizer put one into a state of trance.But as the day draws to a close, the tone shifts. The sequences of evolution turn into sequences of decay. The once bright colors make way for an overpowering red, as a heavy piano and strange beeping sounds suppress the former minimalist song. Where there once was fantasy there now is an estranging feeling of loneliness. The girl begins to fly once again, but this time over a dark and empty city. The strange noises become ever stronger, creating a growing sense of unease, as finally the sun goes down and the dream fades.In just under seven minutes, Calm manages to evoke a number of feelings effectively and concisely. It does just what it set out to do and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't accomplish any great feat and is far from life-changing, but it is beautiful in its own kind of way. To those of you who are lovers of the experimental and don't mind something being insubstantial so long as it is poignant and unique, I wholeheartedly recommend this short. Those of you who prefer sticking to more conventional works with some sort of takeaway probably won't like this one as much, but feel free to watch it if you will. It's only seven minutes anyway.";Mixed Feelings

For a music video, it works surprisingly well as a comedy. This is achieved not only by the unlikely combination mentioned above, but also by stylishly unique animation style – one that might seem bad at first look, but further inspection reveals it is very much a deliberate artistic choice that enhances the unseriousness of the video. And there’s even a sort of story in the video – again quite funny one.Regarding the music itself, even though it’s not a genre I would listen to voluntarily I can’t deny it’s really catchy and the tune might be stuck in your head for a while.Overall it’s certainly one of the more entertaining music videos MAL database has to offer, so I’d definitely recommend watching it.

Not another accursed Idea Factory anime.I never expected to find an anime worse than Mars of Destruction, let alone two, but Idea Factory delivers yet another puddle of piss in a cardboard box!To start things off the wrong way- Idea Factory takes a steaming runny dump on your eyes with this shit 3D CGI that looks like someone took a picture of a Lego set that had been put in the microwave with a Nokia 3310 potato, printed it out, wiped their ass with it, lit it on fire, scanned it in, and then put it in the slides for this anime.Next, you're slapped with these idiotic mini cartoons that I could vomit more details and color onto.FINALLY, onto the feature.So half the anime is this stupid kid walking back and forth between a guy and a princess talking about things that nobody cares about. These conversations are so inane, they'd put 330a public access television to shame. Some shit about ""I HAVE TO SAVE FREDBARN!"" and ""I HAVE TO BE STRONG!""Fredbarn. The name of the land is called Fredbarn. I can't even begin to describe the profound stupidity of this name, let alone someone in a studio getting this checked off as a good idea and then IMPLEMENTED!So the little bitch boy goes to the princess and tells her he loves her. She tells him she loves him too, and they're going to be together 5eva bby, longa dan 4eva. Then this other guy says ""NO! I'M GOING TO BE WITH THE PRINCESS, YOU CAN'T HAVE HER!"", so the bitch boy tells the princess they're not going to be together any more. (This takes place over the course of five minutes realtime.)So then the other half is made up of some stupid ass training montage, because bitch boy is apparently a soldier... there's some flashback shit that are literally just storyboards drawn in as little detail as possible- as in, they're vaguely human shaped- more like turds.Bitch boy and other guy fight... and other guy slits bitch boy's throat, then bitch boy runs away, the end. By the time this is over, you're wishing it was you with the sword to the throat.There are no characters, story, or enjoyment to be found here. Unless your idea of enjoyment is pain, then you'd still rather be taking forks to your eyes and pouring liquid aluminum inside your ears than watching this shit.Moral of the story kids, stay the fuck away from Generation of Chaos if you value your sanity, and stay even further the fuck away from Idea Factory- they're actually the inventors of torture, and a practiced hand at it.The hits keep rolling.

Again, Idea Factory is reaching absolute highs of anti-adventisement and I'll never understand why they bothered o produce these...If I wanted to find a positive, I could say it at least didn't dilute its time runtime with multiple stories...

0;Happy Happy Clover;zombie_pegasus;https://myanimelist.net/profile/zombie_pegasus;8;The anime is fairly episodic, but the story it does tell is done well. The characters live in a communistic society mainly due to the abundance of resources devaluing goods. Services are not traded for each other but instead the citizens simply feel obligated to contribute in the way they can. In their town a certain job was not being done correctly so the protagonists, whom are children, take it upon themselves to make sure this duty is done well. Through this job they learn more about their world and mature as characters.The art in this anime is quite different from other series. The characters are all animals and are not anthropomorphic, but they use their body parts in humanoid ways. The fantastical plants introduced in the series are modeled well. The background art is decent but not too noteworthy.The voice actors do a good job at portraying their animal characters. You can feel the emotion when it's needed and the bad raps are exactly what you would expect from how the characters react to them. The sounds of nature are done well.The child protagonists were written exactly how children actually act. They may seem clueless or selfish at times, but it's always for good reason. The friendship and romance between the characters is fun to see as well as the pranks they play on each other. The characters are all quite deep and they all have their own role to play. The adults have interesting jobs related to what animal they are and they make good use of their skills. It's one of the most interesting and diverse casts I've seen.Part of the reason why I loved this anime so much is because of its resemblance to TV shows and movies I've seen in my childhood. Not many anime have animal casts and not many TV series with animal casts have them written this well. Their culture is different from our own, but it seems realistic for what they are. It's fun learning new rules about the flora unique to their world and how the inhabitants use them to their advantage. With all of the world building and character development this story could go on for a long time without seeming repetitive, but even with its short run time it manages to do a lot.This anime is fun for kids to watch, but there's also a lot of depth to it. As a kids' series it has some strong role models and shows kids what consequences their actions may have and what the best solutions to certain problems would be. As a fantasy slice of life anime it also does well by showing how the characters interact with their world and what struggles they face in it. Overall it was a great series.;Recommended

0;Koneko no Studio;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;6;"こねこのスタジオ - Koneko no Studio, the little kitten from the film „Koneko no Rakugai“, has come a long way since his first appearance. Two years ago, in 1957, he was drawing with a pencil on a house wall, but today he's making a samurai film. There's no business like show business, and we're looking forward to more colourful antics from the kitten and his mouse friends.Story: More content than its predecessor and with a new message (8/10).The story is much more interesting than its predecessor, as it is more surprising and reflects the bizarre visual content described. The message of the film is as simple as it is topical. It reflects the central theme of the future of filmmaking, or rather a nightmare version of it. Instead of painstaking but loving manual work, the soulless machine has almost completely taken over. It was clear from the start that things would get out of hand in the ultra-modern studio. Eventually, our kitten is forced to realise that only a cold machine can control such a cold environment. Amazingly, even though it was said in 1959, without any knowledge of today's technologies such as CGI (Computer Generated Imagery), this statement still holds true today.Characters: Slightly different from their predecessors (6/10)Compared to their predecessors, the characters have changed slightly. The companions have grown up and changed their habits from childish to more sensible. But in the end, they act as if nothing has changed.Koneko:The kitten ""Koneko"" has become smarter. Instead of complaining, he solved the practical difficulties and built a fully automated studio. Even the actors have been replaced by robots that work better.The two mice:They're smart too, but they don't want to accept what Koneko is doing. Instead, they've started secretly sabotaging modern technology.Visuals: Technically a step forward, but some charm has been lost (6/10).The graphics and animations are interesting again. In fact, there has been a significant technical leap forward in two years. There are now colours instead of black and white. Good, although something like lip-syncing is still missing, but remember, it's 1959! The design of the machines is well modelled. The Analytica engine really does look like the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) from 1946, and there are plenty of nice drawings, backgrounds and tiny details such as cameras. The animations, however, are not as smooth and polished. On the contrary, they are often a little choppy and some of them are repeated too often. It seems that all the charm that Mori, Yasuji, gave to its predecessor has been lost. Instead of experimenting, we are left with a solidly average animated film. It may be technically superior to its predecessor in many ways, and this time there is a story that is quite entertaining and thought-provoking. But the bottom line is that it is not that much fun.Sound: BGM unexceptional, some dialogue added, VA good (6/10).The BGM was arranged by Yamada, Eiichi and does a good job of underlining the scenario, but on the other hand it does not stand out with any special features. The sound, however, has been improved. Some dialogue has been added instead of just background music.There is not a lot of dialogue, but the dubbing by Nakamura, Meiko has been done very well.Although the animation and sound have improved considerably and the story is more mature, the animal characters lack the endearing charm of their predecessors, especially when it comes to Koneko. The series is a remarkable step forward, and the protagonists have a fun and entertaining adventure. In my opinion, however, the rating is lower than for the film ""Koneko no Rakugai"".Thank you for reading and have fun watching!";Mixed Feelings
1;Koneko no Studio;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;5;Toei's short Koneko no Studio is a sequel to its earlier more rudimentary work. the craftwork has significantly improved in this short sequel, especially with the addition of color and some more detail put into the frames beyond just the main characters. The narrative is a relatively simple one speculating on the horrors of robots and futuristic technology. Asimov's anthology of stories on robots had just made a giant splash on the meta narrative scene when it came to speculative fiction of the time. The fear of automation replacing human labor is as old as the luddites themselves and those fears have only grown since the advent of literary science fiction. Overall, I'd say Koneko no Studio is worth a look for the production values, but it isn't particularly deep and its attempts at slapstick humor fall flat.;Mixed Feelings

But the animation was OK it wasn't horrible it was just normal looking.Sound 8/10Originally I gave the sound a 6/10 but I forgot about the english dub. The english dub was AMAZING, the voices were fitting for each character the acting and emotion in the voices were solid and it was amazing in its quality. The good dub aside, I thought the opening and ending songs were good but not great. The the soundtrack was a little forgettable.Character 8/10This is one of the parts that makes me surprised the anime is so unknown because the character cast was one of the most entertaining to watch. I feel like the interactions with each character was great. I liked almost every character. Plus a lot of the characters were really memorable too. But one thing that bothers me is the anime totally ignored introducing the names of the characters sometimes .Enjoyment 7/10Despite all the good things I said i think i enjoyed this less than i thought i would I laughed a lot it was good too. But sometimes I felt like i want enjoying to the most of it because i feel like I grew out of being a big fan of comedy. But something took away my enjoyment that I just don't know. Sorry i can't because I just don't know I could think of a few theories but I cant always be sure.Overall 7/10I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good crazy comedy with a story. I would also say that you should watch it to know you've watched something really underrated but I think overall it was a good series that shouldn't be taken to seriously;Recommended
1;Papuwa;Jirachiman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jirachiman;10;Before I start I will say that you should watch this Dubbed. The Japanese voice actors are good enough, but I feel that you only get the energy that the comedy requires from the American ones. It might also seem silly that I would rate this show a 10 out of 10 too and you would probably be right, because this show doesn't look good, it doesn't have a deep and interesting story, and to be honest the jokes probably wouldn't even be funny half the time if it weren't for the dub. Yet I not only enjoy Papuwa, but I adore it, I adore it enough to put this on my favorites list, and not because the show is as flashy and stylish as something like Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei or Bakemonogatari, not because its as deep as Cowboy Bebop or Serial Experiments Lane, but because it makes me feel good.This anime is fun to watch, and that is what makes this a 10. For starters the characters are all very strange. Not only is the main villain (or what could pass as the main villain as they're isn't really a central villain) a man who's anxiety is so extreme that he practices his lines to a wooden posing doll, but one of the goals of the main character is to become the most beautiful boy in the world. Then there is the variety and admittedly large cast of side characters that each get an ample amount of screen time to give you an idea of what they are like, or at the very least what their gimmick is but that in itself gives them some personality where other anime have characters that have no personality despite their gimmick. Then the large cast of sort-of villains have their own unique quirks that get built upon and give them personality as well.Now before I get too carried away, I will briefly explain the plot: The main character Kotaro suddenly awakens from a deep slumber some time after the events of the first series, and yes it is a sequel series but you don't need to read the first manga series (there is a show but as far as I know it hasn't been subbed at all) to know what has gone on as the show explains at the beginning that Kotaro destroyed the first Papuwa island (where the events of the first series took place) and now through the magic of a blue and red orb a new island was born where the second series takes place. Kotaro then escapes the place where he was being kept and through a series of events lands on the second Papuwa island where he meets Papuwa, a boy who become his best friend and Liquid the man maid, who looks after him. After that the series is fairly episodic and needs to be seen to be believed.Sure, maybe this isn't going to be someone's 10/10, maybe you'll even hate it, but I've watched this series several times over, and I still feel the same about it as when I first saw it. It's a comedy at heart, so the show is only as good as you believe the comedy is, and no amount of explaining is going to help you laugh at them. I've probably talked too much too, and the only reason I unloaded everything like this was because no one saw this, no one, and that's a shame.For those who just skim towards the bottom: It's not deep, it's not beautiful, it may not even be funny to some people, but it has heart, and so does the manga its based on, so watch it please, and read the manga obviously.;Recommended
2;Papuwa;Corniculum;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Corniculum;10;I love this series so much I stole my favourite characters name( Liquid ).In all seriousness, though, I adore Shibata Ami and all of her work because I saw this anime randomly when I was browsing around on the family computer back in 2007 or so. I stumbled across a lot of anime back then, but THIS is the one that stuck with me the most. I consider it a critical part of who I am, not only as a person, but also as a writer.It's your traditional Gag Manga, with an underlying plot. The plot isn't especially well-done or written, but it's fun and it helps amplify the amazingly fun cast of characters. The plot also isn't especially clear in this sequel, and I'd highly suggest to read Nangoku Shounen Papuwa-kun first before watching this. It helps clear up the plot better than the brief synopsis in this anime, especially concerning Kotaro, Shintaro, Kintaro, Jan, (Gion Kamen) Arashiyama, and Liquid.Also, due to the fact the manga for this sequel is untranslated, the full story isn't readily available to english speakers, and you're left with the rushed ending from the anime. And trust me, there's a LOT more to the story that the anime doesn't get the chance to touch upon. Maybe one day.... One day. ( I've been saying 'one day' for over 10 years now )This is a series very near and dear to my heart, and if I could, I'd make a full-blown essay on how great Shibata Ami and her works are. But I'll spare everyone that, and just say, hey! If you like stupid gag anime and manga, then give this a shot! The insanity of Papuwa Island is something every connoisseur of the genre should experience at least once.;Recommended

0;Arabian Night: Sindbad no Bouken;Sesshomaru;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sesshomaru;6;"アラビアンナイト　シンドバッドの冒険 - Arabian Nights: Sinbad's Adventures is one of Toei Animation's early works and already pretty old. Gladly, I'll tell you something about its creation, but in order for you to enjoy the anime as well, I would like to ask you a small favor. Try to get rid of CGI-pampered eyes and the idea that an anime that is well over 50 years old can or should be compared to today's animations.A tip at the beginning, look for a good version of the anime, preferably with a running time of about 81 minutes and in Japanese dub with subtitles. These versions are a bit hard to find, but it's worth the search because the entertainment value is higher.Story: simple, predictable, but to be honest, it's pretty well known, isn’t it? (6/10)The scenario, which was used by the famous manga-ka Tezuka, Osamu and the writer Kita, Morio for the script, is set in the time of the Caliph Hārūn ar-Rashīd. Sinbad (Sindbad) lives in the port city of Basra (southern Iraq on the shores of Shatt al-Arab) and his adventures are most likely inspired by the stories of Arabian sailors dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries. One famous theory is that Sinbad the Sailor was a good nighttime story told by a Scheherazade to entertain her Caliph. Although I like this theory very much as well, unfortunately this story is not included in the oldest Arabian folktale collection, which dates back to the 15th century, and is therefore not documented. Still, I like this theory a lot and it fits in with the story told in this anime.A young man named Sinbad happens to get a map showing the way to a fabulous treasure on a mysterious island. Together with his new friend, the orphan Ali, he wants to find the treasure. Thus the two dreamers board a cargo ship as stowaways and, unaware of the obstacles and dangers that await them, embark on a risky cruise through the seas of the Middle East. On their way they have many fabulous adventures and are later accompanied by the courageous sultan's daughter Samir ...If you have a little patient with the story, the last 20 minutes will bring a sudden surge of tension and compensate for the temporary lack of excitement, giving the end of the adventure a beautiful finale.characters: stereotype, little background information, but fit into their roles (5/10)The characterization of the individual main characters is very equivalent. The characters interact without any special emphasis and the behaviour appears natural as far as it is possible for an adventure story.Sinbad:Of course, the hero of the story gets one or two major appearances, but on the whole he is the typical, handsome hero of a fantasy story. He can sing and is not a fool and full of energy. He doesn't fulfil his role badly at all.Ali:The little orphan is something like a smart cookie, he has a good heart and helps his friends. This character trait allows him a good connection to the animals in the show, which proves to be very helpful.The two sailors:These two characters are really funny and yet immediately reminiscent of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy (Laurel and Hardy were a British-American comedy duo that made successfully more than 100 slapstick comedy films between 1921 and 1951). As a fun duo they take over a big part of the comedy and do it very well, because the characters are not mocked and remain an important part of the movie.Princess Samir:She is a really interesting character, her description is very feminine and on the other hand she knows exactly what she wants and she is not afraid to take it. It's a bit unusual for the archaic time of the fairy tale and also for the 60s when the anime was made. In any case, it is pleasantly realized and fits very well to her role.Grand vizier Torfa:The outward appearance already makes it obvious that he doesn't belong to the nice characters. He has a scheming personality, as it should be for a villain, and is also greedy. We'll see where it leads him.Visuals: aged, technically well-made for the time, a rarity (7/10)Viewed with kindness, and taking into account the fact that some available films/streams look as if they were taken from a faded 16mm narrow film format that has been enlarged to a 35mm film for commercial marketing to be able to use standard cinema projectors. To enjoy the movie more, try to find a better version as described above.The Character sketches are very nice. The faces do not yet have the later character traits (big-eyes style and European appearance) that the aforementioned Mangaka Tezuka Osamu will shape. In addition the animal representations are very realistic and well done. The animal figures remind me a lot of the gorgeous drawings of Mori, Yasuji, in particular the little kitten, but also the little whale, the horses and even the bat drawings are really good. The animation of the sea impresses with a terrific water animation.The animation may not as innovative as the earlier production ""Koneko no Rakugaki"", but it is fluid and enriched with many ideas. For example, it's fun to see the big water vortex and the images of blurry spirits hovering over a shipwreck. The flight attack of the electric jellyfish is also famous. The perspectives are right and the shots put the characters in the right light. For the year 1962, the team of artists and animators created an artistically and experimentally successful, unmistakable rotoscoping design. The anime has a specific and inexplicable, but irresistible charm and is also a small rarity, one notices the influence of the West. A glimpse at Disney classics such as Snow White from 1937 reveals how the directors tried to approach the Western style, but still create something independent. Nevertheless, this should not be judge negatively, because the Disney classics are beautiful and impressive inspirations to derive something for oneself and to develop an independent style. As already mentioned, this is exactly what will happen when Tezuka Osamu founds his own studio (Tezuka Dōga Production and later Mushi Production) and triggers a revolution in the still very young Japanese anime world with anime classics like Astroboy. A chance for the most to discover a probably unknown part of animation history.Music: slightly melancholic but not bad, original japanese VA good (7/10)The music and the songs were composed by Yoneyama, Masao (Lyrics) and Tomita, Isao (Music). The elaborate orchestration supports the narrative structure and reflects the emotional state of the characters and the dramatic situations in which they find themselves. The individual songs like Fushigi na Guitar, Omoi tsumini or Hitoribocchi no Hime sound better in the Japanese original than in the English translation.The same applies to the voice dubbing. For example, the voices of Takiguchi Junpei as Captain Hamdi and Kinoshita Hideo as Sinbad sound more appropriate for their characters than in French or English dubbing.The sound effects of Kimura, Hajime are well done, if not extraordinary, but fitting.The anime is very entertaining and also very informative for an anime fan because it shows a lot about the beginning and development of art and animation. On the other hand, without these good old Toei Animation movies, to name a few ""Hakujaden"", ""Koneko no Rakugaki"" today's animation industry would surely still be sitting in a cave and make fire with flints.Thanks for reading and have fun watching!";Mixed Feelings

Other Sinbad anime titles from the modern era include Arabian Nights: Sindbad no Bouken (TV) in 1975, Magi: Sindbad no Bouken in 2014, and Sindbad: The Flying Princess and the Secret Island in 2015.It's a shame to review such a vintage anime, especially in this day and age; anime wasn't as complex as it is now, at least not for me.*Story*It's too bland, lacks complexity, explanations, and is so random and stupid; a lot of character decisions were irrational, those unreasonable unexplained decisions were just there to advance the plot that only kids will buy it. I'm not sure how to put it; it's an adventure into the unknown.*Characters*Bland; no backstories, no development (except for the predictable romance), and villains were villains for stupid irrational motives or for reasons that were never explained.Sinbad (correct spelling) was the worst sinbad I'd ever seen; he's bland and emotionless. His sole motivation is to travel the sea, which is at the heart of every Sindbad story.*Art*The art is cartoonish, which is to be expected given the age of the anime.*Sound*As annoying as it is (when they call out/scream), this is to be expected from such an ancient anime.*Overall*Despite the fact that the few character developments and the ending were too predictable.

1;Arabian Night: Sindbad no Bouken;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;4;i only managed to find the dub for this one. Sindbad's adventures was a much needed change of pace from the same old character designs TOEI was employing - direct imitation of Disney movies of the time with much poorer production value and quality, unfortunately. You even see some experimentalism make a return here, especially with how some effects for the ocean and the treasure were animated using sand.Unfortunately, the characters continue to remain paper thin and uninteresting. while their designs are quite a detailed improvement from the paper motion humans in the previous TOEI doga films, there is little depth to them. The movies continue to feel like a stitched together tapestry of disparate scenes that are unrelated to each other, rather than fostering a single contiguous narrative. This unfortunate feature continues to undermine the potential of these early age films and the narrative limitations of the artists working in the space at the time.Once again, there are some scenes that would breach the realms of appearing psychedelic, almost approaching the brink of horror - only to pull back into the familiar territory of a figurative children's playground of a perfect world of idealism and adventure. The movie, like others of its ilk often threatens to break out of the mold created for it by its meta realities like its audiences contrasting with the artistic frustration of the creative team.;Not Recommended

What's more, they can be emotionally moving.Yakusoku is one of those emotionally moving songs. Even before I figured about what the song meant, I found myself moved by it. The song and video seem to tell a story of friendship and love that transcends language barriers and they are stunning.The animation is fluid and expressive. The direction conveys its theme and mood with so much impact and momentum. The climax of the song in particular was my favorite part of the sequence.Overall, I love everything about Yakusoku.

0;Tong Zhi Zhe;iamKetranLang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/iamKetranLang;10;It rocks as a Detective/crime anime and even exciting like a thriller. The main character Zhang Dabao, for once with a common Chinese last name Zhang, and last name not Ye LOL which seems to be really common in Chinese anime (looking at both Quanzhis). He follows cases as a detective, but is not a real detective, just a teen in every other regard. He is so cool, and really funny. Nice guy and also really observant, he gets shy, gets sad, gets serious, That just makes him a good main character for this type of setting, very relatable and as from perspective, it is more interesting for it being a teen going rogue into a lot of dangerous situations.The crime is really great horror, assault, and intense. There is no episodic cases, rather the cases become part of a long crime story. Everything that happens goes towards the course of the story. This is what makes it so compelling and impacting as a detective anime. You find a real detective story you can be attracted to. ALL REALISTIC SITUATIONS TOO. It's with this, there are development in the love relationship between Zhang and Tang (the first girl in the case Zhang helped), among the crimes, it tells a really interesting romance story too. And also those that want to seek revenge on Zhang and his partner for what they solved.;Recommended
1;Tong Zhi Zhe;SaikyoSenshi_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SaikyoSenshi_;8;"I've seen quite a few Chinese anime and this is by far one of the best ones. I must say it's pretty underrated. I haven't read the manhua so i dunno if there's any adaptation issues. Oh, and it's definitely not a horror anime because it wasn't in the least bit scary. I'd say more of Action, Adventure, Mystery, Comedy.I recommend this anime to mystery lovers, and I don't mean Conan lovers xD this is a subtle mystery. It's a really short anime which you can finish in an hour and half, with all the episodes even on YouTube.Story (8/10)There are 10 episodes which cover 3 ""cases"", so as to say. The main character is a self proclaimed Jack-of-all-trades but he's mainly a teen detective working with the police. He has this weird idk-how-to-explain ability that triggers unrealistic detective skills that put Sherlock's intuition to shame. There's adultery and gang business involved all around so it gets a bit unreal and badly paced at times. The tragedy grated throughout cases makes every episode better than you'd expect; you won't see some things coming. This needs a season 2, because episode 10 started a new case and many strings are left untied.Art (5/10)Nothing striking, very generic, typical Chinese animation and character design. Background art feels dull and lazy at times. So don't hope for anything spectacular. The MC wears a Captain America shirt that's TOTALLY not noticeable :PMusic (4/10)Can't really say much because Chinese music isn't really to my liking. The BGM during episodes is either non-existent or mediocre. Voice acting is average as well. Sometimes everything seems forced and lifeless but other times things get energetic.Character (7/10)Every character seems bland at first but as you go more into the series, with all their backstories and interactions, you may find yourself ignoring the trivial character aspects, and looking at it as a whole, no character is thaaaat bad. But there could've been a little more work on this. My favourite characters are the main character and his best friend; the rest of them are average and bland, I couldn't get to like any of them. I didn't like a single villain in the entire series; they all were heavily flawed in so many ways.Enjoyment (9/10)I lowered my standards when I saw it because I usually tend to dislike Chinese anime. Of course I saw it muted because I simply can't stand the language (I'm sowwie xD). This one surprisingly piqued my interest. Each episode's last minute gives a sense of suspense so there's your driving factor. There's even a good amount of comedy to balance out the tragedy, all interspersed here and there. While the whole series was riddled with plotholes and flaws, his anime was different from all the other Chinese anime to ever come out. I've seen quite a few but nothing as underrated and worthwhile as this one.Overall (7.5/10)It's definitely not one to take the cake or win anyone's favourites but it's worth a quick watch. I can't wait for season 2!";Recommended
0;Tong Zhi Zhe;RavenYami;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RavenYami;5;"I have got my mind wrapped around writing a review about this Chinese obscurity ever since I've watched it a week ago, since this ONA has been enrolled into the database under some rather misleading tags, probably that's not just my opinion.*Some spoilers ahead in case that anyone cares*Freshly finished, yet not much of it remained in my memory, even the remnants feel like a fever dream; perhaps because my brain refused to acknowledge the fact that I would watch 100 full minutes of a show that starts out with a panty stealing assailant that smears ladies' window with ketchup , all of this attempting to be a horror setting. It would be indeed sort of unsettling if your favorite pair of undies would go missing and your window would be tainted by tomato sauce, but worry not! We have the competent Zhang Dabao on duty, as the synopsis proudly informs us, he is the protagonist and he can solve any job whether or not he has any qualifications, he's the 'Jack of All Trades ' and that makes him more cut out for catching the assailant than an entrie police district. So this mockery of a plot doesn't end here, we need 3 episodes for such a delicate case to be solved. Have I mentioned that the assailant is protecting his identity by wearing his victims pantsu? Nothing really surprising at this point, I know. The very competent Zhang Dabao decides to guard the victim lady's apartment from the outside, but he's knocked out within the first 5 minutes or so and the girl is kidnapped and this is supposed to be a cliffhanger. The panty maniac, in case you haven't figured out until now isn't a gentleman at all and drags the poor girl into the freaking sewer as if the situation wasn't stinky enough. The almighty Zhang Dabao locates the assailant just in time, before he gets to drill the girl, drill like.. for real with the sharp rotating tool, no innuendo intended. The assailant is arrested by the police finally and then we get to know his pathetic reason for assaulting women, ready to hear it ?.....He was being bullied for wearing his mom's freaking bra in adolescence.I think this pretty much sums up the quality in terms of story and characters, getting to the other sections.The animation is pretty standard for Chinese productions, nothing really stands out, it fulfills its role into portraying what's happening good enough, this kind of production doesn't deserve outstanding graphics anyways, it would be frustrating if it would manage to obtain a budget to make for great visuals. It gets a 7/10 in this department.Sound wise I cannot pronounce myself too concretely since I am not in the posture to judge Chinese voice acting, not accustomed to it, as for the soundtracks and themes, they were suitable, but nothing particularly memorable that I would find myself returning to. 6/10In conclusion, you can watch this whether out of sheer curiousity or on a masochistic whim or can stay the hell away from it because you got nothing truly good to lose.My verdict overall would be 4.5/10 cause it was laughable at times and got me mildly intrigued in what's going to happen next, at the very ending it was given a hint for a season 2, but I doubt it will be produced given the weak reception it has got.";Mixed Feelings

0;Pink Mizu Dorobou Ame Dorobou;TheMAM;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheMAM;8;One of Akira Toriyama's lesser known works, this short movie was just epic and downright cute.Pink is a great character with highly relatable and grounded motivations that tie into the movie's plot seamlessly. Her intentions weren't to be a hero, but rather to look out for herself and her friends, and to get what she wants. In doing so, rather than a sense of justice being the catalyst of her good deeds, her personal goals and wants make her a hero, goals and wants which, by the way, are totally adorable! Her friends and the cop are fun characters, too.As for the plot, it's very simple. But there's nothing wrong with that. It's easy to follow and easy to relate to, and the stakes it brings to Pink's adventure will most of the time leave you by the edge of your seat, with exciting action and treacherous, yet wacky enemies.My only complaint would be regarding the animation itself, as it really holds back this movie from being great. Some of the important action and chase scenes suffer from awkward transitional cuts. Sometimes you'd have difficulty figuring out where the characters are going or how they ended up from one place to another. The art looks nice and the backgrounds have good depth to them, but Toei Animation really needed a longer run-time for this movie, cause the rushed scenes left me dumbfounded.Other than that, this is recommend to anyone looking for a short, cute, fun action movie.

0;Flying Luna Clipper;haydenluvsanime;https://myanimelist.net/profile/haydenluvsanime;10;"Flying Luna Clipper is the single greatest thing to ever grace humanity. This movie about a group of fruit & vegetable people will make you laugh, have you in awe, and make yourself question whether it’s actually legal or not to own the movie. Let’s get right into it!This OVA was directed and written by Ikko Ono. Who is that? I have no idea. He was seemingly born just to make this one movie and then blipped off the map completely. I only mention him because there’s a similar sort of mystique to the film itself. It was practically lost to time until someone found the laserdisc of it in a thrift store recently in late 2015 and decided to upload it to YouTube. This gives the film an unusual aura, like a hazy memory of an obscure cartoon or video game you remember seeing as a kid, but you don’t know if it was actually real or just a product of your imagination.Speaking of video games, Flying Luna Clipper uses 2D sprites made on an MSX2 computer instead of the typical cel animation at the time. Fans of Hideo Kojima may recognize the MSX brand for Kojima’s video game debut with the original Metal Gear, which later got an NES port. I honestly have no idea got into Ikko Ono when he made this decision, but oh boy am I glad he did. Flying Luna Clipper represents a lot of the same unrivaled charm found in games from that era. There’s this level of abstraction and dreamlike atmosphere that makes it a mesmerizing viewing experience from start to finish, even if you have no idea what the hell is going on. I was always at the edge of my seat; every time I told myself “There’s no way this can get any weirder!” the movie one-upped itself and continued to blow me away.So is Flying Luna Clipper just style over substance? To some of you it definitely will just be a mismatch of ideas haphazardly thrown together into an incoherent mess, and I won’t blame you at all for thinking that way at all. However, for me the whole concept about going on this fantastical journey to explore dreams invoked a very magical feeling inside of me, like my mind had suddenly been transported into the body of an infant, and I’m experiencing the world all over again in my most impressionable years. Everything seems so fascinating and alien in that stage that you can’t help but to be in complete awe at everything around you. As we grow older, we start to take everything for granted and forget that we even had such a period in our life. Everything starts to blend in and become a bit mundane, which is why I appreciate things like Flying Luna Clipper that can take me by surprise and bring me back to my youth.However, there is one tiny aspect of the film that’s a bit problematic, and it’s got to do with babies… In the Gravity Dance section of the film, there are a couple shots showing naked babies which are completely uncensored. To any western fan, I’m sure these mere seconds of footage alone is enough to turn them off from the film entirely, and while it does make me feel a bit uncomfortable, it’s not enough to ruin the movie for me. Who knows, maybe it’s not as big of a deal over in Japan where they had Goku’s Dragon Balls hanging out on national television, but it’s still something to look out for regardless. Aside from those few shots, the Gravity Dance section is absolutely my favorite part of the film. It conveys this sense of freedom and ecstasy, like you’re being whisked away on a cloud or floating on water. The bit before is starts where they tell you to unfasten your seatbelt was also really funny.In conclusion, Ikko Ono really went above and beyond with Flying Luna Clipper. It is a one of a kind experience unlike anything else I have ever seen, and I am so glad it exists because by all accounts it really shouldn’t. I mean, even for the ‘80s where studios went bonkers on creating experimental OVAs and films, who in their right mind would come up with something like this? They really don’t make ‘em like they used to, and I’m not sure whether that’s a good thing or not… Oh, what am I saying? Flying Luna Clipper is a grace to mankind and I will cherish it with every ounce of my being. Now if only that alleged 2004 sequel film could get uncovered...";Recommended

0;Geragera Boes Monogatari;Haneken2086;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Haneken2086;6;There isn’t really anything too amazing or outstanding about this show. It’s a basic “talking animal” cartoon, where an ox named Ollie keeps a farm going with the mixed help and interference from his fellow animal friends.However, the show is good and solid fun: the jokes are easy to understand and laugh at. And it has a unique multicultural background: it was based on a Dutch comic, animated by a Japanese company (director Hiroshi Sasagawa is the genius behind the classic animes SPEED RACER and VOLTRON) and is dubbed in English by a veteran voice cast from Saban Entertainment (the studio behind POWER RANGERS).On the whole, it’s a good watch for children, and for older viewers it’s enjoyable once in a while.;Mixed Feelings
0;Princess Road: Bara to Dokuro no Monshou;Mister_Roshi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mister_Roshi;7;Erotic Torture Chamber follows the conquering of a kingdom by the Demon Dragon King and his dragon soldiers. For hentai the story is quite good and interesting enough to be fairly entertaining. The only drawback is that it was clearly made to be a two episode hentai, but the second one was never made. This leaves a lot of open ended situations and questions.The art and animation has that nostalgic 90's action anime look, which I enjoy a bit but others might not care for it. All the girls look quite nice and the detail is pretty consistent.The weakest are might be the character depth as few characters are really fleshed out, but this may also be due to the lack of a second episode.Overall, I quite enjoyed this one. The sex scenes are pretty tame and aren't quite explicit enough for it really to be a great hentai, but the story was entertaining and the sex situations (some nice yuri makeout/sex scenes)made me give this one an above average score. As for recommendation, I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys a decent story in a fantasy setting in their hentai.;Recommended
0;Princess Road: Bara to Dokuro no Monshou;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;4;Yurie, the princess of Asronia, is kidnapped on her way to a celebration in the kingdom of Gostaria by the dragon forces of the Demon Dragon King. Yurie's bodyguard, Maya, survives the attack, and has vowed to rescue Yurie no matter the cost. Until then, Yurie must endure the Demon Dragon King's sexual Depravations.When the Demon Dragon King appears, he looks and sounds like the fantasy version of Darth Vader, breathing problems and all. And to top it all off, his helmet has giant blades coming off of it. It's dumb, but awesome. But the real kicker? He's not actually a giant warrior, but a regular sized guy who just happens to walk around in a giant mecha suit. I don't know how he got it or where it came from. Maybe he's a time traveler who came back in time to conquer every kingdom, or he's from a completely different planet, and he's using high advanced technology to take over, or even that this world has the capability to have this technology, but in very limited quantities. I'll never know. Well, that's my head cannon at least.A lot of other things go unexplained too. One of the The princesses guards is a ninja apparently, and can use some form of magic. I don't know if other guards are like her, or if she's just been trained this way specifically because she's the princesses guard. Some characters and plot points are also brought up and just as quickly forgotten. It's like the script writers had ideas, but not enough to fill out a proper plot. I tried my best to see if I could find out of this is based on some old PC-98 game obscure manga, but I couldn't find any evidence of something that this is based on to explain why some plot might not be here.Probably the most memorable character is a sexy dominatrix that works for the Demon Dragon King, not only because she's the only thing that actually stands in terms of character design, but she actually gets some backstory. The only other character that I liked was the super powered ninja guard who tries to save the princess, if only because she had some actual character. Unfortunately, the anime ends before any of the story gets resolved, so all we're left with is some metaphorical blue balls.Would I recommend Erotic Torture Chamber (AKA Princess Road: Bara to Dokuro no Monshou)? It's a bit bland considering some of the hentai we have these days, but in terms of old hentai, it's actually quite amusing.;Not Recommended

0;Zi Chuan;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;7;"Before I start my review, I want to point out that even though this donghua is tagged as action and fantasy, the fantasy elements stop only at the fact that demons and demi-humans exist (with some wuxia/martial art elements mixed in), and the action is good but not a focus. So if you are here purely to see action or heavy fantasy elements, this is not for you.Now onto the review: This review will have some spoilers to this and will evaluate this work as an adaptation of its source material (novel). I will give it an adaptation score based on how closely it follows the novel and a score on how well it tells a story through the medium of donghua.The story of Zichuan follows the life of 3 brothers, Di Lin, Sterling, and Zichuan Xiu (Zichuan Xiu being the main MC of the story), as they fight for the country. The first 1/3 of the story focuses on the attempted coup and its suppression with the help of the three brothers. Because of their philosophies and actions, they are rewarded differently, with 2 rising in power and Zichuan Xiu being ""punished"". The remainder of the covers the wars/battles that are the fallout caused by the attempted coup.The donghua does a good job with its exposition, so that new viewers can get a good general understanding of the plot. However, it is very difficult to understand many of the intricacies and finer details because it is too difficult to show in animated format. This donghua, in my opinion, is so much more enjoyable if you have read the novel. Another criticism of this donghua is that there seems to be misplaced humor and its somewhat disjointed (tangental) stories. This is because some attempt has been made to include the signature comedy that the novel that made it popular, and introduce characters that are important and relevant in future seasons (but not so currently). This results in some awkward moments and can cause confusion. Last but not least, I recommend reading the ""side story"" review and watching the ""side stories"" since they are important, but not required to enjoy this fully.As an adaptation, I think this donghua does a good job. There have been quite a few changes, but the overall story is the same. Unfortunately, the story/plot is too pack, complex, and detailed for it the studio to cram it into 42 episodes, so some sacrifices had to be made. There are also changes to introduce more characters, like Liufeng Shuang who is not that important in this season but is very important later in the story, or to give more importance to others, like Zichuang Ning (a side character whose existence many of the MC's decisions revolve around). The comedic side of the novel has also been simplified and cut, since most of it was immersion-breaking. Overall, despite the changes, I think this adaptation did a good job in telling the story to new viewers (those who have never read the novel before), though there are many details that can be understood only if you've read the novel. Having read the novel will definitely boost enjoyment.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 7/10";Recommended
0;Marriage: Kekkon;Mouse2010;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mouse2010;7;"I bought this DVD on a whim, because I had a chance to get it cheaply, and I thought it looked like it might be a cute romance. This disk contains two short romantic comedies using characters borrowed from previous works. My understanding is that you don't have to have viewed any of the related anime to watch these, and, in fact, the two episodes are really not connected plot-wise. They merely share characters who have the same names and personalities, but not the same situations. (In the first episode, the five friends are coworkers; in the second episode, they are sisters. But they are essentially the same characters.)With those details out of the way, let's talk about the pros and cons of this DVD. First, the art is old-fashioned, so if you are not willing to put up with 90s-style art, give it a pass. Second, because each episode is so short (about 30 minutes), it is not able to do the kind of complicated character development one might like to see. This means that the romances in each episode may seem rushed. The first episode in particular is about the process of finding one's match; we don't actually get to see much interaction between the couple when they do get together.Those are the cons. What about the pros? Well, the episodes do deliver entertaining romantic comedies. The first one is more sweet; the second is more funny. (Personally, I liked the second episode quite a bit more, but the ending of the first one WAS cute.) Both could provide a quick fix for someone longing for a simple rom-com. Plus, the two works have a quirky sense of humor that I wasn't expecting. In the middle of each episode, there is a bizarre interlude that is essentially like an educational film, complete with ""research"" and ""statistics"" (I have to wonder if the numbers are real; they might well be.) The first interlude is all about dating services; the second one is about where to go on dates and what to do for a proposal. These are strange segments, but I found them amusing. It made me wonder if the two works were seriously trying to teach the viewers something about courtship/dating. Interesting idea, even if it seems a bit foreign.My verdict? At first I was going to give this release a 6, but I liked the second episode enough to bump it up into 7. I'd say this is one to rent or borrow rather than buy, but if you can buy it cheaply somewhere, it might be worth a purchase. It's the sort of thing you might watch once and then pass on to a friend. Or, rent it and watch in on a girls' movie night. In any case, ""Marriage"" deserves a little more love from anime fans!";Recommended
0;Marriage: Kekkon;Haneken2086;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Haneken2086;6;"This is the middle instalment of a trilogy of three features, all focusing around a group of five girl friends. The first, GRADUATION, was about the girls leaving school and balancing the end of their childhood with the beginning of their adulthood. The second, MARRIAGE, was about the girls searching for a soulmate to spend their lives with. The third, SAILOR VICTORY, was an outright adventure in the line of giant robots and magical girls.This feature is divided into two tales, both of which deal with finding a good husband to marry and settle down with. The first is about an introverted office worker who is dragged into dating by her friends; the second is about an aloof executive who goes on an arranged date. The stories, to be honest, are painfully bland and standard; there's very little character/plot development and everything just works itself out at the end with no issues at all. The first story is better than the second, but only marginally and that's because it has more likable characters.The artwork and music are pretty and above average, but they can't help with the stories; it's bizarre that the female characters look like grown women, while the male characters look like teenagers. What does help, interestingly, are a series of vignettes that explain Japanese dating protocols. They add an interesting documentary-like feel to the feature; the average Japanese viewer is somewhat prepared for future marriage, and average the non-Japanese viewer gets an interesting insight into Japanese dating culture.Do not expect anything too amazing or revolutionary from this, and you will probably enjoy it for a once-in-a-while watch.

0;Hanhua Riji 3rd Season;YudiYusantoS;https://myanimelist.net/profile/YudiYusantoS;10;Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (10)The story is about a woman who is very lazy but She found herself involved with Godly matters where her parent is actually God. After that, She can see all items and pets are becoming human forms and transforming into other forms too. In this anime, there are a lot of comedy scenes that make me laugh in every episode. This is 3rd season, so it's a continuation of the story where She got an evil dragon egg.Art (10)The art in this anime is great! I love the simplicity that they use to make the animation. Not only that, But I also love the ending animation where they are mixing reality making that. The opening scene that they make are using sketchbook animation which matches their animation art. The animator and editor really should be appreciated since almost every ending is different.Sound (10)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation. They are making custom songs too where adjust to the episode. If the episode is in kung-fu vibes, they adjusted the ending song with a melody that matches the vibes XDCharacter (10)The main and supporter character is very memorable. I remember how hilarious the MC and supporter characters on this anime.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (10)It's recommended to those who love comedy!*This is first Chinese anime that was hidden gems!!Anyway, it's similar to Gintama but a short version.;Recommended

0;Rankou Choukyou: Maid ni Natta Shoujo;Crowniko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Crowniko;5;"Rankou Choukyou is the story of a man who doesn't want to end up like his abusive, rapist father.. is it good?The story:Rankou Choukyou opens up with our MC (who as far as I'm aware doesn't have a name) jacking off to his father molesting the family maid. We then are greeted to a cheesy 2000's transition and we see that our MC is on a nice restaurant date with a girl. He invites her to his house and then.. molests her and tries to rape her to no avail. She kicks his ass, insults rich people in an oddly modern line of dialogue, and says his dick is small. Our MC, now pissed that his manhood has been desecrated, goes on an ""adventure"" at night. For some Godforsaken reason our MC decides to become a huge fucking incel and throw a bottle at the couple making love... for no real reason he just does it and man is it fucking stupid. The next day he runs into a cute girl and gives her directions (expert foreshadowing!). Turns out his father has hired this cute girl he just met as a maid and is now molesting her, this doesn't sit right with incel MC and he has sex with her and then saves her, and himself, from his abusive father. They move in together and she apparently lets him do whatever he wants to her, brilliant right?The art/animation:This is a Five Ways production from 2001, the art is appropriate and looks similar enough to the manga it's based off of. The animation is low budget but it works. I don't really have any complaints with either of these.Sound:Lots of violins, it's alright I guess, though it definitely sounds dated.Overall:Rankou Choukyou is a really, really mediocre title from the guys over at Five Ways under their label Wide Road. Now adays many people don't talk about Five Ways when it comes to hentai but they had quite a big impact on the market and pumped out some quite influential titles back in the day. Most of their shows were also licensed, dubbed, and released by NuTech Digital (before the Ken Groove lawsuit). I assume so many of their titles were licensed because the licensing was cheap as shit but it definitely worked. For whatever reason NuTech released this show under the name ""Orgy Training"" even though this show has nothing to do with that, thanks NuTech! Anyway, I'll give this show a 5/10, the MC was genuinely terrible and so unlikeable no matter how much they tried to make him likeable.";Mixed Feelings
0;Yume kara, Samenai;Sorghaghtani;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sorghaghtani;6;"Very few people seem to have watched this anime. I had to watch it wthout subs because they did not seem available. Either way, this is not an outstanding show; it is pretty short and the story is fairly simple. On the positive side, we get to experience SHAFT before head-tilts and some pretty cheesy 1980s music.I honestly think the anime is too short ot merit a review, but I found it interesting enough to guide people to watch it. It's refreshing to see the changes in anime since the 1980s. Imagine being asked to smell coffee beans in a perfume shop to recalibrate your nostrils to keep discerning between the floral scents the perfumery keeps thrusting at your face. This anime is the coffee beans in the analogy.The characters were your average high-school girl and boy. There are rumours of the girl taking part in AVs however, which is sure to put a strain on any burgeoning relationship between the MCs. We also have the MCs generic best-friend and childhood friend who are hindrances to the blossoming love. Don't get me wrong, the characters are not interesting enough that we are actively rooting for the MCs to get together. We simply know that is the way the anime is supposed to proceed. It is not subtle in its approach at all.The music I liked. As I said, cheesy 1980s music that had me cringing and then laughing along.This anime is at best a 6.

0;Yume kara, Samenai;Fall;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fall;4;"Yume Kara, Samenai is a single-episode OVA, and also a SHAFT work. To be more precise, this is SHAFT's first-ever original work. Despite being founded in 1975, SHAFT didn't get around to actually making their own original anime until Yume Kara, Samenai in 1987, but they did work on animation as a subcontractor in the years preceding Yume Kara's release. This OVA is one of the lesser known SHAFT works, so much so that you've probably never heard of it before you clicked on this page. Suffice it to say, there are no English subtitles for this work. If the synopsis has piqued your interest in this OVA, allow me to apologise, as this OVA is only available in Japanese, unfortunately. It isn't very high-level Japanese, though. If you are still interested in giving Yume Kara a shot, just know that what you see is what you get. The synopsis is so short because there is almost nothing else you can say about this series. It's not lazy writing--it's a concise summary of everything there is to this OVA. If you still want to take up the challenge of watching Yume Kara in Japanese, I must advise that you lower your expectations appropriately. It's not that Yume Kara is particularly bad, because it isn't. It's merely mediocre. If you're interested in SHAFT's roots, you have a green light from me to go ahead and watch Yume Kara right now. At the very least, you'll come out of this venture into the past with a newfound respect for SHAFT's more modern works.SHAFT is the studio behind several commercial hits such as the pretentiously surreal Monogatari series, the cute but callous Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and the cynically comedic Sayounara Zetsubou Sensei. If you've been around in the anime community for a decent amount of time, you've likely heard of at least one of these notable series, if you haven't already sat down to watch them. The one thing all of these series have in common, aside from their vast commercial success and how highly regarded they are, is a distinctive art and narrative style. If you've seen one SHAFT work, you can likely identify another just by taking a look at the front cover. If not by the art, you will be able to tell by the high-octane dialogue, the trademark head-tilts, the constant irritating jump-cuts, and the imaginative but simple symbolism. It is rare to confuse another studio's work for one of SHAFT's. However, on the flip-side, there are a number of SHAFT works that you wouldn't immediately be able to identify as such--Yume Kara takes it a step further and makes it impossible for you to identify it as a SHAFT work unless you were told outright. The artwork is very generic and does nothing but conform to the style of the time. There is nothing that pops in the art, and the animation doesn't fare any better. There is nothing endearing about either the art or the animation, and it's difficult to tell whether this was average or slightly below average for the time. If you are a fan of SHAFT's distinctive cinematography, you will not find it in Yume Kara. While it is hardly surprising, what with it being SHAFT's very first work, it is still disappointing to discover that Yume Kara's art style is completely unremarkable, with none of the visual flare of series such as Monogatari.There isn't a whole lot to say about the sound work, either. The voice acting is mediocre and the voices themselves are immersion-breaking to hear. This was pretty characteristic of anime back then, and once again, Yume Kara completely conforms to the standard of the time. The soundtrack is mostly unmemorable, though serviceable. The actual sounds themselves, such as the crying cicadas, are somewhat grating to listen to almost three decades later. Whether this is a product of the era or simply another case of Yume Kara falling below standard, the sound work is slightly unpleasant to listen to at best. Don't expect anything in this department.Finally, onto the meat of the show: its flimsy narrative and its boring characters. I hesitate to label Yume Kara a character-driven narrative because it doesn't have much character and there isn't much of a narrative either. There is a very basic plotline set up solely for the purpose of having the characters interact with each other. The synopsis effectively articulates everything there is to the narrative: the protagonist is interested in a girl who is rumoured to have starred in pornography. That's all there really is to the first 30 minutes of this OVA, and it only really starts to become somewhat interesting in the final 6 minutes. There is no real conflict in Yume Kara. The students are aware of the rumours surrounding Sao, but the most they do is snicker about it to themselves with her in the room. There isn't any bullying or lecturing. While that means Yume Kara ends up being quite boring, I feel that it is an accurate representation of the class's response if that situation were to occur in real life. Most people wouldn't actually confront Sao about it; they would only use it as a joke to fuel their conversations. Yume Kara is a romance at heart, and the plotline is only really a stage for the characters. Unfortunately, because the plotline is so bland, uninteresting with mediocre execution, it affects the characterisation and development of the characters. There are, fortunately, very few cringeworthy moments. However, there are no hooks in this narrative. It's something you have to slog through. There is nothing that will make you want to keep watching it, aside from reassurance that the OVA is only 36 minutes long. The final 6 minutes of the OVA is what it had been building up to the entire time, but the payoff is mediocre. It's an improvement from mediocre to not-completely-mediocre.The main issue I had with Yume Kara was that it was really, really boring. It was extremely bland all the way through. There isn't actually that much dialogue in this OVA, but what little there is fails to add any character to the archetypes they are in their introduction. Yume Kara does have romance, but it's quite dry. On the upside, the romantic development is actually somewhat subtle, which is something I have to give the OVA props for. This brings me to one of Yume Kara's strong points: everything makes sense. While there are some questionable circumstances, if you look into the subtext, there is a sufficient explanation for the aforementioned circumstances. The characters are flat and mostly uninteresting, but everything they do makes sense. The main leads actually don't have that much chemistry, but I don't mind that. To me, this is a story about a lonely girl who uses love as an attempt to cope with said loneliness. There is nothing to say about our protagonist, except that I would have preferred if Sao was the protagonist. Sao was the only character I found somewhat interesting, but they never delved deep enough into her character for me to care about her. If they did end up working on her character, and her motivations surrounding her involvement with AV, she might have even made a compelling character. Hell, that alone would have made this OVA an interesting commentary that delves into the thoughts and feelings of Japanese high school girls that end up participating in AVs. But Yume Kara didn't do that. In reality, Sao is a character that is never really fleshed out despite having some mildly interesting traits. The narrative, along with the characters that propel it, feels very dry and very bland.Yume Kara is a slog. It is a dry romance with generic, one-dimensional characters that are never properly characterised. However, there is some decent subtle character development for the female lead throughout. Yume Kara has a generic art style with subpar animation and grating sound work. Aside from the technical aspects, there is one word that perfectly encapsulates everything wrong with Yume Kara's narrative: inoffensive. Yume Kara is incredibly inoffensive. Despite having a somewhat interesting premise, it only superficially explores it in the most boring, predictable way possible. There is no depth to the narrative. Everything about Yume Kara feels stock or worse. The writing is consistently mediocre throughout. Yume Kara is not the genre-breaking, standard-deviating work that you might expect from SHAFT. It is an uninspired, conformist OVA. What annoys me most about Yume Kara is that it completely destroys any potential the initial premise has with its subpar narrative. And worst of all: it's boring.I do not recommend Yume Kara if you are seeking enjoyment--there isn't anything in Yume Kara to enjoy. The narrative is boring and uninspired, the characters are bland and uninteresting and the art could not be more generic if it tried. In spite of all of its flaws, I do recommend Yume Kara if you are seeking something of a historical piece. Ignoring all of its missteps, Yume Kara is SHAFT's first ever original work. If you want to see just how far they've come since the late '80s, then Yume Kara is the way to go. Yume Kara is a work to appreciate, not enjoy.{Recommendations}~Other SHAFT Works~-Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica-Bakemonogatari-Sayounara Zetsubou Sensei~Romance Genre~-Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun-Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou";Not Recommended
0;Dragon Fist;A_Lam_Ma_El;https://myanimelist.net/profile/A_Lam_Ma_El;1;"By some twist of fate you have stumbled across this old and obscure anime called Dragon Fist that less than 300 people scored on MAL. You are now perhaps wondering if you should watch this OVA or not. Do not worry; I'm here to save your time by telling you not to watch it. Seriously don't, unless you really want to see a truly bad anime. I have watched a lot of anime before this and Dragon Fist is still one of the worst I have seen. Let me explain why.First off I should clarify that Dragon Fist is an OVA, which is important because OVA's generally imply higher budget and higher budget implies better animation/art than a regular anime series, but unfortunately that is not the case with Dragon Fist. This anime simply looks inferior, it does not even have a 90’s series level of quality, much less of a 90’s OVA level of quality. Dragon Fist noticeably uses a lot of budget saving measures such as still frames and only showing the backs of the characters when they are talking. The latter half of the OVA also has lots of fuck ups, especially in the facial department; you will know what I'm talking about if you watch it. The Artstyle of the anime itself is pretty much generic 90's shounen art, think Yu Yu Hakusho and the like. If you want to watch some neat 90’s high quality OVA action anime, then you are in the wrong place.Second important thing that I must mention is the fact this anime is an adaptation of a manga by the same name, and while I have not read the original manga (it isn't even translated) it really shows that it is an adaptation. Why you ask? Because the story does not make sense, the characters do not make sense, and because the plot is all over the place and is extremely rushed in terms of pacing. I could easily see a less experienced anime watcher being confused by what is going on in this anime, so I will briefly summarize the story to help those confused viewers.The Synopsis of this anime is deceptive since it talks about dragons and the protagonist being a kind of half dragon half human, so viewers would naturally think this is a fantasy anime, right? They would be wrong, because this OVA is actually about cloning and has nothing to do with dragons and fantasy, other than the protagonist being one. So the basic setup is already a mess given that it is some weird mix of fantasy and SCI-FI without any natural cohesion, but it gets only worse. We have 4 named characters in this anime, they are as follows: Fei-Long Ling - The Dragon Boy, Katano Fuyuka - Female lead and Clone, Kaga Naoki - Another Clone, and finally Sugiura - the Villain. All of them are students at the same school; Naoki and Sugiura are the masterminds behind the cloning. And that is really all there is to their characters.We start with some expositional narrating about the Dragon Clan that lasts for a few minutes, there is really no point to it given the fact that the anime does not deal with the dragons at all, so it counts as wasted screen time in my book. After that we are immediately thrown into a Japanese high-school (because of course), where our Chinese dragon protagonist is being bullied by his Japanese classmates. Why is he being bullied? Who knows. It never comes up again in the OVA, so it is simply inserted there to evoke some kind of pity for the protagonist, but it fails to even do that because it comes out of nowhere and ends abruptly, like every other plot point in this anime.After the bullying scene we are greeted with a rooftop scene where our dragon protagonist decided to angst and be a loner, coincidentally this causes him to witness 3 nameless goons trying to kidnap Katano Fuyuka, the clone girl. He being the hero of the story obviously threatens the goons to stop, who despite outnumbering Ling; decide to leave with a classic ""I'll not forget this."" This event obviously causes our male protagonist and our female lead to be introduced to each other. Fuyuka immediately reveals to Ling that she is a clone and that she escaped from a facility (and for some reason escaped into a school), Ling does not really react or give a fuck about this revelation, he just takes it naturally, because this is the character quality in this anime. Anyway Ling promises to Fuyuka that he will protect her no matter what, despite only knowing her for about 5 minutes.Hilariously 1 second after making that proclamation, Ling leaves Fuyuka alone, who is immediately ambushed by Naoki first and then by the 3 same goons from before. This was so hilarious that I couldn't help but laugh. This anime kind of functions as an unintentional comedy given how terribly constructed it is. Anyway the 3 goons kidnap Fuyuka and bring her back to the cloning facility; Ling who was doing god knows what notices the absence of Fuyuka and heads after her. This is where I'll stop summarizing the story and start talking about the important matters.This is easily one of the most rushed anime I have seen, it goes through what seems to be like a few episodes worth of anime material in the span of 40 minutes, which goes horribly with the fact that the anime tries to be very melodramatic in its drama. For example Fuyuka goes from wanting to live to wanting to die in 5 minutes then wanting to live again in another 5 minutes, because reasons. The characters also pretend to have known each other for a longer period of time, despite having only met each other for a day. Fuyuka for example admires Ling and has feelings for him despite only meeting him that day and speaking with him for less than 5 minutes. Naoki and Sugiura also know of Ling despite never meeting him before, because properly introducing the villains to the protagonist is for good anime only. Dragon Fist is also full of ""dramatic revelations"" that come out of nowhere, except they don't have any dramatic effects because of how incredibly rushed everything is.Ling despite being a powerful dragon is somehow able to be pushed around and almost beaten by the 3 nameless human goons, until of course he decides to transform in traditional shounen fashion into his dragon form and beat everyone. Naoki only exists as a plot device character who can stall for time by sacrificing his own life, so that Ling can rescue Fuyuka from the villain, which also makes little sense seeing Ling in his dragon form was super fast yet it still took him minutes to catch up to Fuyuka and Sugiura.While we are on the note of Sugiura, let's talk about him and his motivations as a villain. Like everything else in this OVA, he too makes zero sense. It is revealed that the reason Sugiura conducted the cloning experiment was so he could clone his mother who was suffering from heart problems. Both Naoki and Fuyuka were successful clones albeit with defects, Fuyuka escapes the facility and he wastes time trying to recapture her, even though he has no reason to do so. Once he has captured her, Sugiura tortures Fuyuka by revealing the fact that her lifespan is limited, even though he has no reason to torture her. Then when Ling rescues Fuyuka, Sugiura heads after them in order to kill Fuyuka, even though he has no reason to do so, because Fuyuka will die in a couple more minutes even if he doesn't do anything. As a whole the villain makes zero sense, he just wants to kill the other 3 characters because he is retarded.The music for Dragon Fist was made by Kenji Kawai, who is one of my favourite Japanese composers, his instrumental performance in Dragon Fist is pretty solid and arguably the only decent aspect of the anime, but I must unfortunately mention the fact that is only true for the instrumental music in this anime. Dragon Fist plays 2 really awkward vocal songs during its run time and they simply feel awkward because they do not fit into their respective scenes and come out of nowhere, further ruining the already messed up tone of the anime.Who would I recommend this OVA to? Nobody.As I said the only reason to watch this mess is if you want to see some truly bad anime or if you want to treat it as an unintentional comedy.";Not Recommended
1;Dragon Fist;satyrelfheim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/satyrelfheim;3;"Dragon Fist is a misleading OVA that doesn't deliver.The story starts out like the synopsis here, though there is no mention of the main character, Fei Long, killing anyone. He goes to Japan and attends a school where a strange cloning situation is occurring. There's a few twists and turns in the plot, but there's a ton of info thrust onto the viewer in a few minutes, the entire story being around 40 minutes total, and everything plays out like a soap opera.The acting is very cheesy and so are the characters. The art is often distorted, characters looking odd in weird angles with limited animation. The actual designs are okay, though not particularly memorable; you've seen these characters playing these roles before.The two things I did like were the colors used, a nice cool purple theme, and the awesome musick. The sound effects are mediocre, but the songs are great! There are quite a few lyrical numbers too, making this play out almost like a musical (making it even weirder to be honest). But seriously, I enjoyed all of the musick quite a bit and would potentially buy a soundtrack.I can't give much praise to the rest of this. It's worth watching to see how strange this story is and how poorly it's executed, ""so bad it's good"" style.";Not Recommended
0;Ecchies;CatSoul;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CatSoul;6;"When it comes to hentai, Ecchies is a weird but kinda good surprise that screams 90s: they don't make hentai like this anymore.Since MAL lacks a proper description for this hentai, I feel like I'm obligated to give just a bit of background: a young girl, crushing on a boy and starting to become curious about sex, asks her parents if she can watch them have sex one night. Rather than getting her ass in therapy, they let her do so, which completely awakens her hormones to the concept of sex, to the point where her previously wholesome fantasies about her crush are now dominated by sex. She now wants nothing more than for this boy to not only notice her but to have sex with her as well.However, once she finally gets her wish, will her crush - and the sex - be all she's fantasized about them being in her head?The thing that really makes this OVA unique is that, except for the sex, everything about it screams ""shoujo romance/dramedy."" The cover art is wholesome enough that if they ever released it in the US the ""ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN"" label would have to be massive to keep clueless parents from buying it for little girls. There are some comedic bits accompanying the sexual part of the story that I enjoyed.Oh, yeah, there's a bit of drama here too. I'm not going to spoil anything, but if you're just looking to get off, you might not want to watch the second episode.The sex scenes are all pretty vanilla; however, they're uncensored. I don't know how, considering the OVAs were never released outside of Japan, but hey, I'm not complaining. It's kind of nice to see penises and vaginas without the modern-day nasty X-ray shots.The only thing that seriously bothers me about this OVA is the parents. Not only do they let their daughter watch them have sex after she asks, she asks them to watch her masturbate while thinking about her crush. THEY OBLIGE. And the dad looks oddly feminine/is probably banging dudes behind the mom's back. I guess some people might be into this aspect of the OVA, but it's not for me.";Mixed Feelings
0;Carol;azizsahar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/azizsahar;5;"Haha this is so messy it's almost worthwhile. Japanese intuition is intriguing, even with bad examples like these. Here we have the Alice in Wonderland template, dissected and thrown against several unripe narratives, mainly evolving around an ""album"" that works as a portal to another world, though it's partly causing the music from the first world to disappear, pun is seriously not indented lol, that's how it really is, it's actually written based on a real band and album. The premise is engaging indeed, but it feels like a surreal aesthetic mix of ""post-punk"" from the 80s and dungeon myths, it's even weirder than that if you pay close attention to all the details, plenty of mainstream references too.To add more to the strangeness, the heroine is named Carol while her mean friend is the one named Alice, though the former has the prototype Alice look, she even meets a rabbit in the other world who helps her. This is the part most fascinating to me, as I follow the evolution of the Alice narrative in general. I like though that they turned around the princess saved by a knight stereotype into the complete opposite, the princess is the one who saves the knight, and finally they join to defeat the monster.I wouldn't recommend it, unless watched while on magic shrooms.";Mixed Feelings
0;Carol;RobdeFR;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RobdeFR;4;"The music of the world is starting to disappear, even the sounds of the Big Ben are not heard anymore. We start this OVA with a girl named Carol, your decent teenager and pretty much average like anyone else at her age. Her father is a famous classical music composer and he's having problems doing music at the time. Sometimes she hears a voice calling her name but she doesn't know what it is until she is suddenly transported to another world. It happens that some guys there wanted her help to rescue a friend of theirs that was captive at the foes lair and then to destroy the huge beast that was consuming all the music in the world and would eventually consume all the sounds of th4e universe.The premise wasn't that bad, yes, reading the stuff above, makes the imagination travel and think that it may turn into something interesting eventually. There's two ways from here, or we'll have a great oldie watching session with a overall good production or we'll have a old anime crap time. It could have turned out into something memorable or something forgettable, unfortunately it was for the later case. The animation was not the best, could easily been made in '85 without any effort, but there were some major flaws in this title that went beyond the animation field and that pushed it to the land of obscurity. The story had major holes that could have been easily fixed if it had a proper care. Questions like, ""Why did they do this?"" ""Why did they do that"" in certain scenes keeps popping out, "" why did they show this here?"", etc...The story wraps in a bad way and leaves stuff unexplained and there even were some parts that even though it had it's sort of explanation, you just couldn't understand.The end of the story reserves no surprise and it is a ultra forced happy ending.As you can see, this is an OVA of 59 min, it's hard to make a character growth in due time, but they tried to do it here, they failed horribly, so the characters came out being pretty weak, especially the lead role, Carol.All in all, it was an entertaining watch for the laughs and the WTF moments that weren't' suppose to be WTF moments, especially the ""cool sunglasses elf"", must be seen to be believed.It deserves well the honour of ""so bad it's good"" title.Rate: 4:5/10";Not Recommended
1;Carol;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;When I read the brief description of the story, I was sure this was probably some kid's story with a morality lesson or something. As in, something for six year olds. It's a the type of plot you might expect from super magical girl show (a la PreCure) or something.But nope, turns out it's more of a shoujo story aimed at young teen girls (I think the protagonist is fifteen). And the story is played out seriously, at that. Once you strip away the seemingly childish elements from the story description, it does boil down to a pretty standard shoujo story type. Just like, say, Harukanaru or Twelve Kingdoms or Fushigi Yugi.And that is, ordinary teenage girl from the modern day ends up travelling to a fantasy world, gets surrounded by a bevy of pretty-boys who help her along the way, and she has some special position or power that could SAVE THE WORLD!Eh, it's not a terrible story, but it's well-trodden territory, which has been done with much more panache by other anime, than this 60-minute story. And setting aside the story, the artwork is...okay...and the animation is...almost okay. Just give this one a pass, there's other anime out there that does this story better.;Not Recommended
2;Carol;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;The 1-episode OVA “Carol” is the anime portion of a music-themed mixed media project spearheaded by members of the pop-rock band TM NETWORK, featuring character designs by Yun Koga (“Earthian”).The story is based on a novel by one of the band members, which itself is inspired by a concept album the band put out before that. Most of the music in “Carol” is from this album, and the three main male characters are modeled after the band’s members. One of them is even voiced by a band member (and you can tell because of how wooden his performance is compared to the rest).So, is the story any good? Well, the premise itself is okay, but it’s executed poorly. Concepts are not defined well enough to maintain plot coherency. The gist of the plot is that music suddenly disappears from the world, and an average girl, Carol, is summoned to another world to defeat the demon that’s the cause of this. Right away, we run into a number of problems. Is the demon just stealing music, or all sounds? What is the definition of music here? It’s shown taking the sound of Big Ben’s chime, of all things, which I don’t think necessarily constitutes “music.” It’s later shown doing the same to a babbling brook, birds chirping and people laughing. Since that’s the case, wouldn’t it make more sense to say it’s taking all “sound” from the world instead of “music”? Then again, it doesn’t take away every sound, because people can still talk to each other, etc. after these phenomena occur.Other questions that don’t get answered adequately or at all include why Carol is chosen to defeat the demon in the first place, what the antagonists’ motivations are for stealing music, why those other guys get captured by the antagonists, why that one human-looking guy is helping the antagonists, and why Carol hates sweets so much (a recurring theme throughout the OVA). Furthermore, the ending is jarring and confusing, making you wonder if any of the events in the anime actually happened.The whole thing has an “Alice and Wonderland” meets “The Neverending Story” feel, with hints of “Labyrinth” mixed in, but the end product is not as good as any of those titles.None of the characters are likable. Carol, in particular, is rude to just about everyone for no good reason, and she acts like a spoiled brat most of the time. The three main guys range from bland to weird, and don’t really have any distinct personality traits. The human antagonist just seems to be there to fill a role, and doesn’t have much of a personality, either. The demon is a giant ugly one-eyed blob that wakes up, sashays into the main room (it looks like a stage for a dinner show), steals music somehow, and then exits the stage. Then we have some fantasy-type characters like a talking rabbit, a talking tree, and a giant flying dog with a speakerphone jewel on its forehead.Characters tend to do things that make no sense, and say things that no person would actually say in real life. Every interaction in “Carol” thus feels forced and artificial.The majority of the technical aspects are average. The music, which is supposed to be the highlight of this OVA, is just okay, with the ending theme being the piece that stands out the most. There are a number of insert songs throughout the OVA, but their presence isn’t emphasized, so they’re easily forgotten. All of the voice actors are good, with the aforementioned exception of the person voicing Flash, who is the lead singer of TM NETWORK and not a professional voice actor. The animation is fluid, but there are some recycled frames and scenes where characters speak but their lips don’t move. The art is rather plain, especially the backgrounds. The characters were designed by the creator of “Earthian,” so the guys in particular have an otherworldly “pretty-boy” look. Meanwhile, Carol herself doesn’t look that unique. The designs of the monsters/creatures are also generic, perhaps with the exception of the flying dog/phone thing.There’s not much that could be considered objectionable content in this OVA. Some characters die (but you probably won’t feel anything because they weren’t given time to develop), there’s a little bit of human vs. monster violence (the monsters just turn into light and disappear when killed), and that’s about it. There’s a flashing light sequence around a quarter of the way through the OVA, so you may want to watch out for that if you’re photosensitive.Overall, “Carol” had a standard premise that could have been interesting if developed properly, but it ended up like an aimless fever dream instead. This OVA is not particularly enjoyable to watch, either, and I would only recommend it if you’re a fan of TM NETWORK or Yun Koga.;Not Recommended
0;Pikmin Short Movies;TK8878;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TK8878;5;Review in brief:Pikmin Short Movies will be familiar to anyone who has played the Pikmin series of games (especially Pikmin 2) but non-fans won't get the full experience. I'd only consider watching it if you're a fan of the series already, and even then it's not really recommendable. It isn't bad, but it can't be said to be as clever or whimsical as the games themselves.Review in full:This is a collection of 3 plot-independent stories involving the titular Pikmin and (to a lesser extent) Captain Olimar. It's suggested that this takes place sometime during the events of Pikmin 2, given the types of Pikmin featured and the presence of the research pod from that game.Apparently Shigeru Miyamoto came up with the idea to make these shorts to explore the game's characters in ways that would be difficult in an actual game. Despite this Olimar isn't given any character outside of being the guy directing the Pikmin sometimes. Aside from a couple of enemies and the research pod (who also don't do anything besides the basic role they have in the game) the only characters we're left with are the Pikmin themselves.So the exploration is with the Pikmin, right? You could say that, and the shorts definitely focus on them, but there isn't a whole lot of character exploration with them either. After watching you'd be able to make a few bullet points regarding the base characteristics of the Pikmin as a whole, but hardly anything could be said about the individual types. Their basic abilities are shown (and the white Pikmin can spit corrosive acid for some reason) but there isn't any character behind it. A blue Pikmin could wake up as a yellow Pikmin one day and it wouldn't act any different than it had before the change, or at least we'd be led to believe that after watching this. If building characters beyond the games was the purpose of this, then it didn't achieve its goal in the slightest.That being said the plots of the episodes themselves, while not amazing, are still enjoyable at a base level. The humor is usually decent and the stories themselves generally make sense (though it's not exactly like the games). There's even a few things that may catch you off guard. It's still nothing worth coming back to though. It also makes references to, specifically, Pikmin 2. If you haven't played that game then these shorts will not resonate fully with you.The animation and art quality is pretty good. It's what you'd expect from something Nintendo was involved with and there's some nice touches of detail (like individual Pikmin reactions) if you look hard enough. The music is whimsical but isn't recognizable from the games (which is a shame since they have nice music). The sound consists of a lot of clips straight out of the games, which sometimes fits and sometimes feels low-quality compared to the rest of the presentation.Verdict:It's a standard series of computerized shorts, containing some of the quirks from the games and some oddities of its own. Nostalgia aside it isn't really special and fails to be anything other than simple humor. As a fan of Pikmin I could enjoy it somewhat, but I don't see a non-fan easily getting as much (or more pessimistically, as little) out of it as I did.;Mixed Feelings

0;MaMa;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;4;"MaMa is two separate stories with completely different characters in each of the two episodes. Both focus on mother/son sexual relations. This series is from 1997 and the graphics do not hold up at all, in fact I felt like I was watching an animated comic strip rather than an anime.Story one is about a guy named Yuichi who's father passes away and he goes to live with his father's ex-wife, who is not related to the Yuichi in any way. While packing he finds a video tape of his new mother-to-be, Yukiko, having sex with a strange man. When he gets to his new house he is greeted by his new sister, a college age girl name Mika, who is the adopted daughter of Yukiko (Mama). It turns out that Mika has been in love with Yuichi for a long time, and when she hears him watching the video tape of Mama having sex she makes a move on him, only the be turned away. In her anger Mika goes and grabs several other video tapes of Mama having sex with multiple partners and throws them into his room. After watching tape after tape of Mama engaged in all forms of sexual play he goes to bed. Mama soon joins him and has sex with him. As they finish Mika comes in and explains that she has been having sex with Mama to relieve Mama's sexual frustration and to keep he away from seedy men. She then joins in the group, they all have sex together, and live happily ever after.Story two starts out with a car crash in which the father is killed and the mother is left in a wheel chair and with missing memories. Yuichi, the son (not the same Yuichi as in story one), survives the crash without any injuries. Yuichi is not Mama's real son, he was adopted after her real child died, and she cannot remember who he is after the crash. They are cared for in their mansion by a live in maid named Rika. One day Yuichi catches Mama and Rika having sex while taking a bath. Shortly after Yuichi is left to care for Mama himself and has to give her a bath after she falls and spills food all over her self. During the bath Mama tries to seduce Yuichi, but he resists the temptation. Rika comes to comfort the confused Yuichi and explains that he is now the master of the mansion and that she and Mama are now his sex slaves just as his adopted father was before him. Yuichi finally gives into temptation and lives on happily ever after by being the master of Rika and Mama.Neither story was very good, and I felt that both Yuichi characters were extremely wishy-washy and annoying. The overall animation style really annoyed me; it felt like someone took a comic strip and ran it through Photoshop and just had their way with the texture filters. The colors were too bold and saturated and the whole look of the anime was unnatural. Nothing stood out as particularly good and to me the only memorable thing about the series was just how bad the graphics are.";Not Recommended

0;Heisei Harenchi Gakuen;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;2;"Before starting the review, I decided to watch all Go Nagai's OVA Anime and maybe some shows that aren't too long. I hated Devilman Crybaby but I blame that mostly to Masaaki Yuasa's direction but since Nagai is considered one of the oldest manga writers and a very respected figure in the anime/manga world but seeing that he has some of these shows being hentais I decided to start by that and I will make this clear I don't like hentai but that doesn't make me hate a show because it is hentai content, this is the same mentality I have with most Isekais done from 2010s, they are simply not my thing. Are we ok with that? Ok. I hope you don't mind spoilers for a Hentai.If I can resume you in a TL/DRHeisei Harenchi Gakuen sucks ass!The story about this awful OVA is about 2 new teachers that got hired in an only girls school. But these 2 idiots are also happy because they want to score with some girls there and they sure did.They enter to their respective classrooms and they are assaulted by some of the most urgent girls with the biggest desire to have sex in a class schedule that icludes Physical Examination and Physical Education with convoluted scenes where women jump into our main protagonists.Then there is another scene where they go to the examination room and look if they don't have anything wrong with their bodies and it becomes a scene where these 2 poopy heads have another convoluted scene with all the teachers.For reasons like this I don't like hentai. They try to put some ""story"" and ""Plot"" progression to make me feel some attachment to these characters when they are jackasses. But in the end there is a serious story in this crapfest which involves the school principal who is a caveman guy that is part of Nagai's trademark and punishes all the girls of one of the doofus' class and tortures them so he can make porn movies and sells them in VHS until the day is saved by another female teacher.This story comes out as a cringefest in which I just wonder why just not draw sex scenes and call them ""Teachers inserting it to Schoolgirls"" or some bullshit like that and that's what I am starting to notice with Nagai's works. He just wants to pull his edgyness to the extreme since he was releasing them in an era that was too tame but with the influence of things like playboy. But pushing the boundaries of what was the norm in a medium doesn't make a good story. One thing is to use those themes to tell a story and another is just inserting those themes because you just came up with them.The characters are retarded drawings that I didn't care to remember their names in this 40 minute video. If you want to have some reference of some sorts, the protagonist that isn't the chubby one tries to act like crappy Onizuka but without the charm of making him a great teacher but Heisei Harenchi Gakuen is older than GTO so I cannot say that, but that is the comparison I can give you so you can have an idea.Then his chubby sidekick is just another retarded idiot that scores with all the women around him and it is just a pathetic fool, the caveman is just a perv and the girls are just sex objects that have a desire of milk but when they are forced to it by the caveman they don't like it. THEY ARE JUST FUCKING STUPID.The artstyle is something I got to give praise. It is good and has an amazing character design with those textures that very recognizable from the 1990s which I am a big sucker of. But one of the things that I always hated about Nagai and even when I used to watch some episodes of Mazinger Z 70s version when I was young with my mom is that some characters don't look well when they blend with their main characters. This includes the caveman and his sidekicks which look cartoony and when they interact with the other characters, it looks awful because they contain a design that doesn't look correct.There was no music that I remember and the voice actors did well. But again faking sex sounds it is easy to convey.Overall it sucks. I will never understand the praise of Go Nagai honestly and this is just the second one of his works that I watch. If you are into the Hentai Genre maybe you would find it good but in the end even the story is just a morronic series of events in animation form. Next thing I will review of this guy is the other hentai which will bd another hard task to endure.Hope all of you take care, thanks for reading and see you around.";Not Recommended
0;Choujuu Kishin Dancougar: Ushinawareta Mono-tachi e no Requiem;TalkUltraman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TalkUltraman;7;"Now, as I mentioned in my review on the Dancougar series page, I had trouble enjoying the show. The series drags at times, and can sometimes feel more repetitive than it really is. Most of my issues for the show do seem to come from overhype and expectations. However, I am starting to believe most of the hype is due to the OVAs, and SRW appearances.Also, like in my review for the series, this OVA is a good starting point for viewers having trouble watching the show. This OVA tries to nicely condense 38-episodes into an hour then give longtime fans the closure they deserved in the final 30 minutes. Yet, since the new footage is nearly 30 minutes, it makes me question why there could not have been 39-episodes.Anyway, the new footage goes to embrace its Super Robot roots by busting out a sword and letting Obari show off! Also, the Emperor dies like a vintage Super Sentai villain, as he is super strong but gets killed easily. In addition, there is a neat hidden message during the final explosion on alien homeworld that reads ""Thank You for Buying the Video!"" Finally, the ending is still a cliffhanger, but it feels more rewarding than questioning on if the CBF won like the show did.Overall, I enjoyed this OVA more than the series. I actually look forward to watching the other OVAs sometime soon. I hear the next ones range from typical ""heroes return"" side-story to awesome wrap-up epilogue. So, I am hoping it will wash the bad taste out of mouth.";Recommended

It's disappointing that the length of this ending (when the recap is subtracted) amounts to a mere ~30 minutes. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth that Ashi Productions are saying that they could've had the series go on for a meager two more episodes and wrapped it up just as well.The Death Gaia fight also takes up more screen time than the Zorbados emperor himself, which is just bizarre, and when the battle is settled in one blow it's... have I said ""disappointing"" too many times yet?There are some positives: Ashi Productions didn't screw around with the budget this time and the only reused frames I saw were character faces, and the frame rate is much improved, as is the art style in general even though things mostly look the same there's more detail with the shading.My favorite part about this OVA was Shinobu passing Dancougar's controls to Ryo, a thing we haven't seen before that helped make Dancougar feel more like teamwork rather than only Shinobu being at the helm.Anyway, this is an acceptable conclusion to a good anime, and I'm happy to see a resolution with characters I really like, and suitably there's a real theatrical atmosphere to the whole thing with the lack of background music.

After that, She can see all items and pets are becoming human forms and transforming into other forms too. In this anime, there is a lot of comedy scenes that make me laugh in every episode. This is 2nd season, so it's a continuation of the story where her brother are coming to earth.Art (10)The art in this anime is great! I love the simplicity that they use to make the animation. Not only that, But I also love the ending animation where they are mixing reality making that. The opening scene that they make are using sketchbook animation which matches their animation art. The animator and editor really should be appreciated since almost every ending is different.Sound (10)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation. They are making custom songs too where adjust to the episode. If the episode is in kung-fu vibes, they adjusted the ending song with a melody that matches the vibes XDCharacter (10)The main and supporter character is very memorable. I remember how hilarious the MC and supporter characters on this anime.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (10)It's recommended to those who love comedy!*This is first Chinese anime that was hidden gems!!;Recommended
0;Momoko;trashonthecurb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/trashonthecurb;8;"MoMoKo is a fantastic little love story, but I’m not sure if it’s sufficiently erotic. There’s a sort of music video and Hollywood film sexuality and lust to it, but that leads it away from showing the disgusting and lewd side of fucking–never a cock or a clit to be seen. It’s the same problem I had with Tenkousei, and I just as conflict here as I was there.The difference between live action porn and “artistic” renditions of sex in Hollywood films is the vague nature. Hentai combines the two so perfectly and erotically–it’s one of it’s true and distinct strengths. MoMoKo is stuck in the Hollywood film version of sex. It uses really pointed and sensual imagery, the vivid light of entry is much more tasteful and subtle than the x-ray of anatomy of current hentai, and a very “music video” imaginary of a rushing waterfall for cumming, but I can’t shake the feeling that it lacks the needed filth of pornography.Other than that, it’s fun and sexy, that sort of a lighthearted fantasy seduction that one would call love-making unironically, although it does have a rather out of place ""rape as comedy"" bit for a side character. It's the story of a sweet aspiring actress who has no qualms about her sexuality, and thinks of herself as the Japanese Marilyn Monroe, as she attaches herself to and ends up falling in love with a salaryman. The animation and art design are pleasant and competent, but it’s age is definitely visible.For me, it works as a romance with sex, but I’m not sure if it works as porn. I do highly recommend it though.Review on my blog: https://trashonthecurb.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/momoko-a-pornographic-adult-anime-review/";Recommended
0;Momoko;autosimp;https://myanimelist.net/profile/autosimp;6;(Tiny bit of spoilers ahead, I think.)Momoko is one of those hentais that I found surprisingly enjoyable not for its erotic action, but for its laid-back slice of life feel to it despite being hentai. While the art sometimes seems wacky, thus not really giving any charm to the erotic scenes, for me personally the elegant music that played with it was soothing enough for me to look past it. The story itself may seem a bit rushed (For example in the second episode with the chief suddenly being horny), but I enjoyed the characters and the chemistry they had (Well, in this case only between Kentaro and Momoko). I was a tad bit confused at the ending whether it was good or bad but either way, overall it definitely wasn't terrible.;Mixed Feelings
0;Chikyuu ga Ugoita Hi;lisnoire;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lisnoire;8;Chikyuu Ga Ugoita Hi centers around the 1995 Kobe earthquake and its aftermath and is a great look at the positive aspect of the collective conscious that holds the Japanese people together in times of crisis. While not on the same level as Grave of the Fireflies, or Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, it is well worth watching, especially in relation to the recent earthquakes and tsunami in northern Japan as itBackground art is pretty good but the character designs and animation are nothing special. Sound must have been average because I didn't notice it either way. Just set some of the technical esthetics aside and focus on what is important about the story.The action and drama revolves around a 6th grade boy, his family, classmates, and teacher. We get a look at their reactions to the trauma of loss, how it changes their take on the important things in life, and how they continue to live and grow even under the weight of unimaginable devastation.Some of the supporting characters are quite memorable, particularly one venerable old woman in the group shelter who taught the kids the true meaning of survival. A few of the volunteer workers were quite endearing as well.Even though it isn't perfect and a bit dated, don't hesitate to give this movie an hour+, but be advised, if you are a bit of a softy, you will shed a tear or two.;Recommended

Tsuyoshi Takahashi, a 6th grader, lived in eastern Kobe with his parents and younger brother. Tsuyoshi was very ambitious and hoped to enter a prestigious private school, so his days were filled with study. Whenever asked by anyone for a favor, Tsuyoshi resented having to give up his free time.In the early morning hours of January 17, 1995, a massive earthquake rocked Kobe City. Tsuyoshi and his family managed to escape from their shattered home and evacuated to his school. The problems of communal living and rationing, as well as the selfless example of the many volunteers, are lessons the children are soon to learn. it is based on the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe. It was Japan's worst earthquake in the 20th century after the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake. it shows that the many lives and family's and friends were lost during the 1995 great hanshin earthquake in japan. it shows us how precious one's life is and that we should care about them before its too late. it's a very lovely and warm story about family and the power of friendship during the earthquake friends and family helping each other to rebuild their life after the earthquake.;Recommended
0;Monkey Turn;Kosourbites;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kosourbites;7;Sorry if my review is choppy, I'm not used to writing them. But here is my review for this anime.Story: 7/10. I think that this story was really like any other sport animes though this was about boat racing instead. About a guy who quits baseball and is introduce to boat racing by his baseball coach. He then starts to get into it and makes a statement saying he will be the number 1 in japan on it. Then there is the regular anime guy meets friends and improve in the sport they do and become better at it. In the beginning, it was really hard to follow up as sometimes they go back into the past and there are some choppy parts but then it doesnt take away the overall story behind it.Art: 7/10.The art was okay, wasn't too flashy nor plain for an older anime. I really like how the boats, scenary, and racing was drawn out. Really interesting. One problem was in the beginning, I literally LOL because I couldn't tell who was the main character just because all of the hair looked the same. But then it gets better later.Sound:9/10.One of the best thing in this anime. The opening and ending is constantly still being played in my head over some time now. It also gets you hooked. The music comes in during the right time, especially when the main character does something cool.Character:7/10Then main character does not really have a 'badass' character but quite likable. He's hardworking and always try his best. Also, is quite baka and cheerful type of guy. Then there is Dokuchi the rival guy. I feel that the rival between the two guys didn't show up much until later on the episode but then we were given a piece of his story, he didn't get any character development nor any significance of his part though. Then there were probably 2 girls who liked Hatano. There is also his faithful girlfriend, Sumi who always wish the best for him, cheers him on and stuff. I felt that the character Sumi should have more guts, would've been serve a purpose in the anime. Most of the characters that shined the most in the anime are the older/veteran racers.Enjoyment:8/10 I really enjoyed this anime quite actually. Beginning was quite slow for me but then the pace picks up after a while, it just becomes interesting. & you'll start to see more of the racing.Overall: 7/10.This anime is really realistic. As the main character doesn't win all the time in his races but tries hard for his goal. This is an anime that should not be overlooked though.;Recommended
0;Shin-Men;Hypeantonio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hypeantonio;5;"""Crayon Shin-Chan"" is a great anime series about all the troubles slice of life genre doesn't often exhibit.The anime series has a truly strong potential to generate an incredible spin-off with all the elements of the original anime/manga. It's well-known that Crayon Shin-Chan is a ""seinen"" genre anime when you realise all the things the series criticize using a kid as a main character, a kid who takes the adult's worst side and makes their words and behaviors look ""innocent"", but it isn't far from reality, kids are continuously learning thanks to their parents, their teachers... but they are not always the best example for the own children, so they are what they see from adult people.Now let's talk about ""Shin-Men"". As I have said, Crayon Shin Chan is an anime series which has a powerful seinen potential, due to its clever plot, but this particular spin-off lacks absolutely the main esence of the original series. ""Shin-Men"" works really well as a ""shounen"" anime, but not as a Crayon Shin Chan spin-off. The main themes from Crayon Shin-Chan are not present in Shin-Men, this one works in a different way and miss the Yoshito Usui's burlesque and acid way of expressing ideas. I think it was a wrong idea to create new Crayon Shin-Chan stuff without considering the original autor's work at all. I also missed the original roles of the main characters, and didn't like the art too much, I get some weird feeling from it. Only the red Shin-Men takes the original Shinnosuke Nohara's personality. The other characters are not bad, but they absolutely don't work well as Crayon Shin-Chan characters. The problem is that Shin-Men forgot the original anime and manga's roots, because Yoshito Usui (the original manga creator) was already dead back then. Crayon Shin-Chan needn't a spin-off like this one, because it doesn't seem like from the anime series.In conclusion, you may find interesting ""Shin-Men"" if you consider it as a shounen anime, but you shouldn't expect to see the original source material of the manga and the early anime, or at least to do a clever use of Crayon Shin-Chan's jokes more than just showing them.The best way to find a meaningful purpose in ""Shin-Men"" is estimating that the story, in some way, comes from a child's mind, the childish and most creative part of Shinnosuke Nohara.";Mixed Feelings

There is a 7 minute and a 9 minute. The 9 minute has a tad bit more in ending and is more cleaner with art. The 7 minute has no pause breaks(you know when black ground with text showing on screen) and has animation sounds and voices. Which is why i went with the a rate of 6. When i saw the 7 minute version i gave it a 5. But when i saw the 9 minute i was more pleased and gave it a 7. Which lead to a middle answer of 6.StoryNot really focused on the letter as one might think given the synopsis. Instead it is more about the adventure from one place to another, the journey. In addition to the reward that took place on the way there. Which made the introduction slightly confusing. As for the conclusion it was okay. It did seem a touch unrealistic at the very end, right before the credits.Art-poor to fair depending on what version seen.-black and white on both versionsSound-In terms of the only version that had audio(7 minute) the vocals were slightly soft and a tad muffled.-although, the animation sounds blended in nicely.EnjoymentWatch both versions before you rate or give up on this movie.;Mixed Feelings
0;Mini Skirt Gakuen;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;1;A few months ago, my boy Kenny Lauderdale uncovered an anime called Twinkle Nora Rock Me. It has now gained widespread infamy for its total lack of in-between frames and in general being one of the worst looking anime ever made.Is there a level of suck even beyond Nora? I decided to go on a quest and enlist the aid of some of my offline friends. After a few months of vigorous searching, I believe we have discovered that anime.Girl's Locker Room Lust is an anime with animation as limited as Nora. However, it has character art resembling the original Higurashi sprites from the first edition of the light novel. Combine this with Dingo Pictures movement and you have one of the least appealing hentai ever created. This eyesore is mercifully short and only runs for 19 minutes, which is rather short even for hentai standards.The real kicker is that unlike Nora, this was released on DVD. Nora never made it outside Japan and was exclusively on laser disk. Girl's Locker Room Lust received a full United States release and is widely available at anime cons to this day. The Arab world got Galactic Heroes, Ashita no Joe, Anneof Green Gables, and Heidi. America never got releases of shit like that, but we got this masterpiece!

It's all about their mutual love and attraction, you don't get to experience fear, depression or unease as the usual case with Hentai.The show has a more-than-usual focus on drama, even the sex scenes exists with character or story development intentions.Another thing special I found here was how much the show supported monogamous relationships and there's almost no sexual relations other than between the two leads.To me, it felt like the much desired ""Hentai for girls"", in the sense that the girl has a big role in the story and the situations are mostly there for her pleasure.I would also say that the art, characters and jokes reminded me of shoujo shows more than shounen - mainly Fushigi Yuugi and Puchi Puri Yuushi.Highly Recommended.";Recommended
0;Kibun Kibun;necrio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/necrio;4;First review, bare with me!This anime was decent at best. It was a Hentai, but with all the censoring, it didn't even feel like that.Story: About a girl that is with a guy that doesn't know how to satisfy a girl properly..

I thought this story could have gone somewhere, but it didnt.Art: I hated it so much! Might as well been watching hentai from the 80s, it was poorly done.. and the animation? There was barely any movement.. and when the climax came... and he wanted to cum.. he just stood there... no face, no sounds.. She was the whole story I guess.Sound: Best part about this, you really hear some Liquidy sounds.Characters: Guy is unlikable, he is dumb, dense, and doesnt learn...Girl is something that can be enjoyed.Enjoyment: I did not like this anime at all, i honestly fought tooth and nail to keep watching these two episodes.Overall: Dont watch...I am sure you can find something better.;Not Recommended

0;Shigeru;Kikoman589;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kikoman589;10;One day, I randomly stumbled upon this divine specimen by sheer luck. Little did I know that within this short amount of time, someone could create something perfect.Story: 10/10The story follows an unknown man and an unknown deformed woman travelling across a plain. On their journey they discover various different things about life while teaching the audience different lessons, such as appearances being deceiving, the meaning of dreams, the right path towards a bright future and so on. The story is very compact but has a lot of impact. It is truly the definition of quality over quantity.Art & Animation: 10/10While the art may be bizarre, one gets used to it very quickly. The characters are drawn in a quirky way and the colors are also strange, but mix together flawlessly. The art might not be good on its own but as a compliment to the story, it serves its purpose wonderfully. The animation is also very fluid, with excruciating detail. Just one frame is enough to make you have faith once again.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack only consists of a single music track. Despite this, the track itself is wonderfully crafted and is an important part of Shigeru. It describes the tone, setting and characters all the way through to the end. The composer knew what Shigeru was and made the most appropriate track. The sound effects are also top-notch. The voice acting was also exceptional. The actors really put a lot of emotion into it and the sound is engineered brilliantly.Characters: 10/10I cannot describe the characters in enough detail without spoilers. There are two characters: an unknown man and a deformed woman with strange proportions. The reasons for their personalities, why the deformed woman looks the way she does and their life struggles are all fleshed out. Considering the amount of time this lasts, the character development is exceptional. You could start to sympathize with them even within the first few seconds. They are that good.Enjoyment: 10/10My enjoyment was very high. There is nothing quite like this. This breath of fresh air reinvigorated my spirit and even made me analyse some of the characters' actions when it was over, in philosophical detail. Truly something that can be enjoyed by everyone.Overall: 10/10In conclusion, I feel that Shigeru is the work of a mastermind and that it is a masterpiece of animation. Despite the shortness of it, it manages to have an interesting story, extremely fitting art, an amazing single-track music piece and very well-developed characters. Give it a try and you'll be sure to love it!;Recommended

1;Shigeru;immortalis_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/immortalis_;2;Shigeru is one of the many ONA shorts created by animator Sawako Kabuki.

While it is clear she knows what she’s doing and has skill in animation, this particular short doesn’t show that off. This short feels more like a joke or a meme, rather than being anything serious with an underlying meaning, so there’s nothing more to really uncover or understand, it just is what it is.

0;Rejuvenation;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;6;I went into this hentai with low expectations, as I normally do with most of the hentai that I watch, but unexpectedly, Kaishun (AKA 'Sacrilege' or 'Rejuvenation') ended up being actually pretty decent hentai.The plot follows a carnal cult that uses illicit drugs to transform men into sex-crazed monsters by selling them as health drugs through the internet as to not arouse suspicion. Police partners and lesbian lovers Atsuko and Kei are investigating a shady drug deal when they stumble upon the shocking truth.A lot of Kaishun is actually really good. The art and animation is top notch, all of the characters are decent, both in design and as actual characters, and the plot is actually alright for a hentai. Even the English dub is OK, if that's what you want from your hentai. But unfortunately, the whole thing ends up being a bit of a mixed bag.As far as sex scenes go, they range from OK to pretty good. With lesbians, tentacles, and monsters (not necessarily all at once), there is some good variety here to help get your rocks off. But they're too short and too far and few between. If there is one thing you don't want lacking in a hentai, it's the amount of sex scenes.When it comes to the plot, Kaishun has some weird choices when it comes to some scenes were edited. For example, one scene started out of nowhere, without a proper introduction as to whats going on, but then cut back to just before the stuff we just we just watch, showing what happened leading up to what we've just seen. Why not just have the scene play out normally? All this does is make the events happening, and the plot in general, more confusing.If most of your hentai is going to be more plot than sex, then the least you could do is not make it confusing to watch. It's porn, it doesn't need some artsy fartsy editing or new and profound way of telling a story. I just want to do my business.When it comes down to it, Kaishun is a recommendation from me. It might not exactly be a ringing endorsement, but it's a recommendation nonetheless. Not only is the sex actually good for a hentai from when it was released, but the rest of it is good enough that it makes for a neat bonus for those who are looking for some plot with their porn.;Mixed Feelings
0;Chu^2;literaturenerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/literaturenerd;1;Overview:A few years ago I reviewed a HORRIBLE anime called Virgin Fleet. It was made by the little known Beam Studio and was seemingly funded by conservative parents in Japan to promote abstinence until marriage. The plot involved virgin witches because only virgins can use magical powers...which then became kind of a running joke and eventually a meme in Japan.Well it seems Studio Beam batted for both teams. Chu^2 is a hentai made by Beam and I must say this one is BAD, even by the low standards of hentai.Plot?This hentai is only 30 minutes long, but is divided into 3 completely separate and random sketches with different characters. I have honestly no idea why they thought this would be a good format.Part 1:A Japanese salaryman and a high school girl rent a hotel and they fuck...and fuck....and fuck, for about 10 minutes. Then it reveals that they are father and daughter. The end.Part 2:A TV turns on and plays a god awful parody of bad anime cliches that devolves into fucking. It's sort of like a porn within a porn. I think the father and daughter are supposed to be watching this show. I'm honestly lost at this point and I've stopped caring.Part 3: smash cut to a completely different girl and her vanilla orgy with some random dude and other chick. The end.Audio:This might be the worst English dub I've ever heard for a hentai. I've seen a Love Hina hentai where every character sounds like they walked off the set of Peaky Blinders. This was 1,000 times worse.Art:There is a reason Studio Beam never managed to become anything.Overall:I didn't go into this with high hopes. I watched this because it was a hentai made by the same assholes who made the worst PSA cartoon I've ever seen. This was STILL disappointing. It's not even amusingly bad. Boku no Sexual Harrassment is amusingly bad. The fake English subs for Rape Man make it amusingly bad. This is just pure shit.

1;Chu^2;Kazard;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kazard;2;"Okay, this'll be brief and to the point.Obviously this is hentai, and typically you'd watch hentai, because it hits on a few of your fetishes, not for the dialog, story, characters, etc... It feels like someone forgot to tell that to the folks who made this....Checking the handy H Genre List, you see that this show contains: -anal sex -bondage -bukkake -dark skin -double penetration -enemas -fantasy -furries -incest -large breasts -nakadashi -older women -paizuri -piercings -public sex/nudity -teachers -tentacles -transformation -tribadism -watersports -yuri.While I may not be a fan of watersports, a large number of those other categories were fairly tempting. So now you know why I ended up watching this thing.Scene 1:I skipped past the fairly vanilla first portion, (because like I said, it was vanilla, and it also happened to be the portion containing the watersports), though what portions I did see of it, were fairly decently animated, with okay art. The dubbed voice acting was far worse than any abomination I've seen 4kids pull, from what little I heard of it, while skipping through. Overall, this first portion might have been worth a 3 or 4 overall, assuming the original voice work was better than the dubbed version, that is.Scene 2: This was the portion that caught my interest, and led to my being suckered into wasting my time with this anime. I was promised things like: Furry, tentacles, transformation (girl to guy, and back again), fantasy, large breasts, etc. While all these things were technically present, they really end up being ignored... Most of the entire segment are still frames being moved about and voiced, cheesy sound effects. When it comes time to move into the actual ""action"" of the scene, most of it ends up being more still frames, and half of them are of the character's faces...Scene 3: By this point, the my main reason for wanting to watch this show, at all, was gone. So I ended up just stopping there...Overall, if you like vanilla sex, with some watersports, enemas, cheating, terrible voice acting, and such, you might enjoy the first third of this anime. If you were thinking you'll find some hopefully passable depictions of some of the more deviant stuff, particularly from the second third of the show, then don't even bother.Sure most hentai is relatively poor overall, but this was so bad, it was literally not watchable in my opinion... The only reason I don't mark it a 1 in my review, is because the first scene is halfway not a piece of excrement...So yes, overall, a 2.";Not Recommended

It's boss, the ruthless Tojo, has an un-quenchable thirst for violence, sex and power. When he meets Rei-Lan, his sexual prowess takes her beyond her wildest fantasies. Four years later, they meet again as enemies. Will Rei-Lan extract her revenge on Tojo, or will their sexual bond prove too potent to resist?Surprisingly, the art and animation is pretty decent for a low budget hentai from the 90s. Not quite as good as something like Word's Worth, or the hentai version of Mezzo Forte, but still pretty solid.Thankfully, Orchid Emblem has enough foresight to only be 45 minutes long. I can't imagine how much they would have stretched out the bare thin plot to the length of a movie or have multiple episodes. It would have stretched out the budget even thinner, and probably would have made the sex look awful. And I doubt that they would have filled that length with more sex scenes when they would probably have just used still shots of people talking where the animators wouldn't have to animate anything.As usual, the English dub isn't too crash hot. Everyone sounds bored, and everything they say is in a monotone drone. Although, the script still manages to get in a few good cheesy one-liners, like ""So, this is the end.... the end for you.""Orchid Emblem reminds me of all of those late night softcore porn that aired on Skinemax or HBO during the 90s, filled with awful plots, even worse acting, and were filled to the brim with some of the highest quality sleaze that those channels could offer.At one point, the evil boss is having a threesome with two women in front of his butler, all while watching a sports event from his exclusive seating that is hiding him away from the view of everyone else in attendance. If you're going to be sleaze, at least be entertaining sleaze.If you're looking for some older hentai to jerk it too, Orchid Emblem is a decent choice. If you're looking for some cheesy sleaze that's filled with one-lines, action scenes, and a laughably dumb plot, you could do a lot worse.

I'm scared of anime thats been animated in flash or CGI. It looks bad. It looks good at first maybe. Somehow it feels like they over animated the show. There is Flash Movement and it looks awkward. So the animation is bad.Story is bland. Its a typical educational show. The main character tells us about farming in Japan with a spirit. Then the shows equivalent of Team Rocket (I'm not kidding. They blast off like Team Rocket when they lose and build robots). The main character and the spirit combine to make Baraki. And they save the day. Repetitive until the last episode. The story doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat.This show is really meant for Japanese Kids learning about farming. I wouldn't recommend it.;Mixed Feelings
0;Doukyuusei 2 (OVA) Special: Sotsugyousei;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;5;This review contains spoiler (nobody cares, nobody is going to see this anime, much less read this review).This OVA had a little potential to be a little better.I don't know if it is basically all kind of vague because I have not seen the hentai. But this OVA presents us with plot of some characters that is not continuity from the other OVA that is hentai, from the looks of it.Basically the characters have their romances and dramas, but it's all vague because I don't know most of the characters well.Yui likes a guy who lives with her (why does he live with her? When did he move in with her? This is not even explained), she likes him, but it is not reciprocated. Well, out of nowhere, for some reason he kisses her in the last episode. And this guy doesn't even speak every time he appears.Sanshirou went after a woman he once saw playing the piano and supposedly fell in love with. She has a background in the anime, but that's it. They start to like each other, there is some drama, the woman (who I don't even remember the name, but it is this short blonde on the cover) settles down with herself, and the anime ends. Basically, we won't know what happened between them after that.Well, at least something that I was and doubt was explained. There was a little girl dressed as a cat, and she was always giving advice to the others, but out of nowhere she disappeared.In the last episode, Yui mentions that there is a God in this town who helps people who fall in love.One thing that bothered me about this OVA was the fact that it was a bit censored. Seriously, this is a continuation of hentai (but it is not a hentai), and they usually tried to hide the breasts of the characters, but always put the focus on the panties.I went at least wanting to see some ecchi, nothing too much, just a lot of breasts appearing on the screen, but unfortunately there was very little.This OVA has 3 episodes of 30 minutes, many characters that have a background but are not so well explored.I think this OVA should have been only between Sanshirou and the blonde woman with short hair. It could have developed something much better, instead of putting too many characters without much plot that complements something.I didn't think it was bad. It is another potential that was wasted.;Mixed Feelings
0;Scrap Diary;Nordaviento;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nordaviento;9;Many times I wonder what would be of Japan's art if drugs were easy to come by and its use/possession wasn't so harshly punished.This could be thought more as a music video. Great acid ambient techno accompanying nicely drawn and animated surreal imagery. I can already picture this being used as visuals for some rave music set.The first thing that strikes the viewer when the short begins is the simple charcoal on paper approach, which I feel adds a warm touch and feels closer to the viewer.I feel like people over here are being quite close minded to these kinda experimental things. Why bother watching and giving such ratings to things that clearly don't fit your tastes?;Recommended
0;Scrap Diary;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;6;I'm not entirely sure why the superimposition of traditional anime is made on literal experimental shorts. It is logic like that which really intrigues me since what we are looking at here is no ordinary anime, more so the origin of the word anime (if you feel the need to stay traditional).This is raw Japanese animation, which is somehow very different to anime but that is a topic for another time. This wacky short, intentionally made in an obscure fashion. The messages it draws? I've yet to know. But one thing is certain, the unorthodox behaviour is simply nothing to brush over. Take this as an expression, some psychedelic expression with a means to show the viewer a new concept and idea in a daring and frenzied pattern. It is simply wild. Maybe it is a meta-reference? Maybe this was just rando drawings you'd expect to see in the first stage of development in a project, and Tanaami just thought to make a movie out of it. Who knows.But it is decent stuff tho. So 6/10.;Mixed Feelings
0;Scrap Diary;Jackmastr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jackmastr;1;The best part about Scrap Diary is that it's only a few minutes long. I stumbled upon it randomly and didn't know what to expect, but was disappointed nonetheless. It's a bunch of random (and sometimes almost disturbing) sketches that transition into on another with an even more disheartening soundtrack. Now to some, I'm sure, this is quite a work of art. I don't mean to claim this view is fundamentally wrong (although I disagree with it), however this is almost certainly not what you'd be looking for in an 'anime' (and I use this term reluctantly).I find it hard to believe there are two sequels to this, yet, then again, it does not seem like it would cost a lot to produce these (whether we consider actual money, or man hours, or both). Then again, I wouldn't be to surprised if my curiosity led me eventually to see them unfortunately. Well, I suppose you may expect another review if that is the case.;Not Recommended

The main concept of this artwork going by the title as evidence is work pieces that were junk scraps. Rather than tossing them out the artist compiled all of them and put in a movie. Normally, i would applaud that idea if was properly presented. However, none of these look remotely close to each other.-There is pointless doubling of certain scenes.- why the decision to input a scene with a blend of realism(finger moment)?-black and white while was tame at best. Was a good call for it there was color used i don't think it would improve this at all.SoundWhile the sound choice was loop based i think other sound choices would be better. I am all for abstract art. After all i find that is what makes up the art that is dementia. However, how am i supposed to be a relaxed viewer if a good portion if not all is music scraps as well? By music scraps i am referring to poor tempo pieces. Such as the sound of a record skipping. While that sound can be looped i don't think most people like sounds that hurt their ears. Which is why i feel a decision of classical music would be a better call.;Not Recommended
0;Meijyou;Muffed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Muffed;6;"My fellow degenerates,Today I bring you Meijyou or as I knew it by Infatuation Meijyou.This is actually a Chinese hentai, which I never considered even existing until I watched this. For some reason, the synopsis is WAY more plot-driven than anything in the OVA. 99% of the synopsis is not able to be gathered from the actual show, which is wild.Art: Mixed thoughts. A lot of the animation is very choppy and somewhat jarring. It's clearly not a high-budget OVA. The actual character designs are decent and look what a Chinese anime would have. What little money there was went into H scenes thankfully and there's some undeniably decent animation in some of the shots. There's gross CGI for the bookcases for whatever reason.Sound: VA work is pretty good. Music doesn't fit what is happening in the show at all. The girl is essentially blackmailed into getting raped and there's coffee shop music playing lol. ED is pleasant on the ears. Moans are of fair quality. Although, when the guy is licking her ass and stuff it's so fucking slurpy that it sounds like he's slamming back a gallon of clams.Character: Rich Fuckboi and determined woman (heroine?) and neither have development. Fuckboi is an asshole as most rich fuckbois are. Heroine is very strong-willed and determined.Story: Heroine was getting raped by generic hentai trash and boyfriend got beat the fuck up. Rich Fuckboi drives up in his Lambo and ""saves"" them. He then blackmails her into following his commands for a week. And, if he had brains he would do something useful like ordering her to do his homework or assassinate someone, but instead, he decides to fuck. So they do. PLOT TWIST, PLOT TWIST. She had a camera recording them having sex, to I assume, blackmail him. It's blackmailception O_O.Enjoyment: Ehhh.... It was interesting to watch a Chinese hentai. It had some nice H scene animation on certain shots, but nothing mind-blowing. I've never heard such vigorous slurping before, so that was cool. I'm intrigued to what they made that man slurp to record the sounds *wink* Also, in the beginning, I thought the dialogue was hinting at the heroine surrendering their dick and becoming a female. Sadly that wasn't the case.With love, Muffed :3";Mixed Feelings
0;Akuma no Kimuraa-hen;AdvonKoulthar;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AdvonKoulthar;10;An extremely well done piece of art that will be remembered for many years. The story is short, but is an enthralling tale of taking risks and meddling with dark forces to fulfill one's desires. As opposed to many other works, Akuma no Kimuraa-hen has a darker tone and fully embraces the use of demonic summoning and empowerment. The art is likewise captivating, the energy in the picture resonates with the music with what I would call one of the 'most hype' OSTs of the season. Unfortunately, it tried to be a little too experimental with a lack of dialogue which hurt the development of the characters. The art and story does help carry them to some extent, but the characters and their personalities are probably the weakest aspect. All in all, this was a highly enjoyable release.;Recommended

Forget Jojo’s “BORING” adventure, and strap yourself in for noodle-laden mayhem.This duck is fed-up with the status quo of modern society, and why shouldn’t he be? Waiting two minutes to cook your noodles is a frickin’ outrage! “Ain’t Nobody Got Time for That.” Seriously! “Ain’t Nobody Got Time for That.” Thus, using his powers of persuasion, Nissin’s duck integrates himself into the society of, “No More Waiting Two Minutes for Noodles, Inc.” You’d be hard-pressed to find an anime staff willing to completely change a character from a lovable protagonist to a misunderstood, anti-hero with moral qualms about the current norms of society — but they did it! Completely changing my perception of what’s possible in the medium.Overal: 8/10It’s a fantastic anime, don’t get me wrong, one of my personal favorites, but the anime staff got too preachy with their own philosophies.

Therefore, this film is an original story that goes (somewhat) with the Yokai Watch series. Instead of being enterally an anime film or live-action film it both put together by a semi-issekai plot.This is probably my lest favorite of the Yokai Watch films. Not to say it a bad film. I still enjoyed it immensely. It's just not as good as the first two films (or the main series). I mean, if Yokai Watch takes place in another world, then why is there a Japan? A USA? Why does the Japan of this world still have yokai, chopsticks, school uniforms? Why does the USA of this world still have a president, a Hollywood? Not to mention, live-action Jinmenken is kinda creepy. On the other hand, live-action Enma and Nurarihyon were sorta hot.;Recommended
0;Private Emotion;fatmacman;https://myanimelist.net/profile/fatmacman;2;Yet another really bad hentai title. Two word review: don't bother. Let's get right to the problems with this story. First, the animation is bad, choppy, and uninteresting. The animators must have had a very small budget since it felt like they only animated about half of the frames. Second, the story is lame and they tried to fill in the lameness with pointless and poorly written dialogue. Third, the character designs just sucked. I wanted to smash on of the male character's head against the wall so that it would take on a proper shape.I have watched a lot of hentai, and when i say this is bad, you can take my word for it. Let's face it, you watch hentai for one very specific reason, and if that part of the series is bad, then what point is there for watching it. This is a hentai where people stare at each other a lot and do random things to try to fill space. The first real bits of hentai do not occur until fourteen minutes into the first episode, and what you get is half-ass and uninteresting. Everyone in the show seems to be deep in thought most of the time and it takes a long time before anything really interesting happens. Another annoying point is that the primary sex scene at the end uses the super-annoying rapid camera moment technique to indicate motion... and I assume that the lines flying past the edges of the screen are there to represent how fast the sex is supposed to be happening... in reality there is very little animation and it is extremely boring hentai content.If you are looking for hentai, you can find hundreds of titles that are better than this one. The only reason anyone should watch this is so that they can write a better review than I just did.;Not Recommended
0;Seton Doubutsuki: Risu no Banner;ProxyLain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProxyLain;6;"Seton Doubutsuki: Risu no Banner is another anime from Nippon Animation that adapts a western book. Directed by Yoshio Kuroda, director of one of my favorite anime, Flanders no Inu.The story of Seton Doubutsuki: Risu no Banner is simple and functional. Basically the protagonist, Banner, is raised by a cat that he calls his mother. One day, where they live, there is a fire and they have to separate, and this is when ""it all starts. Banner goes to the woods, a place totally unknown to him, and he ends up making friends with an owl that doesn't eat him because of his different way of being, and he is treated as a stranger by the others. If I remember correctly, I believe that until episode 9 he is trying to get the others to trust and believe him so that he can get along with the other squirrels. Quite a bit happens until everyone trusts Banner.Banner is interesting in that at first he really thinks he is a cat and acts like a cat. In time he gets used to being a real squirrel, learning to eat what squirrels eat, and even learning to fly. All this when he meets Sue.The anime is mostly episodic, with Banner's adventures in the woods with his friends.Generally the comedy is good and the drama is well used.As an example of comedy, there is the episode where Banner eats a mushroom and gets extremely stoned (it is so funny to see a squirrel stoned). And there is also an episode where he gets stoned on wine when he goes to the city.There is only one episode that I didn't like, and that is an episode where Sue ""sees the future by looking at the stars"". This is totally clueless and unnecessary, even considering that she is a squirrel.I mentioned that he goes to the city, well he goes along with all the other squirrels. This occurs when unfortunately humans make a point of destroying the woods, and before that even the Owl who was Banner's friend ends up being killed, which I found unexpected coming from a children's anime.The final cut of the anime is pretty good, as much as the rest of the anime is cool. Basically the squirrels go off in search of another forest, and go through various things until they find one. Banner also finds his mother cat, but he leaves because of his friends. His mother cat tells him where there is food, but they accidentally end up being taken to a train where they end up going to a very far place, where they get off the train and go through an adventure in the snow until they find a forest to live in.The last two episodes are pretty cool. It's basically them stabilizing themselves in the new woods. The last episode is so cute. It's basically Banner asking Sue to marry him, and at the end there is a time-skip that shows them older and with 3 kids.It's a fun and functional children's anime, with its ups and downs. The characters are nice and there are many situations between them.When it comes to animation, there is nothing to complain about. The animation is simple, but good and functional. There are no static frames and whenever it needs fluid animation, it has it.It was nice to watch, even though there was one very pointless episode that prevented me from enjoying it even more.";Mixed Feelings
0;Lunatic Night;osukebei;https://myanimelist.net/profile/osukebei;7;"Lunatic Night is an epic parody with ridiculous comedy and an outrageous plot. Sure, it might not be something to spank your monkey to, but it will certainly choke some naughty laughs out of your chicken. ""Bok... bok... bokcock!""Although the story of Lunatic Night is epic, don't try to follow it. Because it will only make your head spin. No. Just kidding. There is no story. But it is epic, and it will make your head spin.It starts with a very cliche mundane plot then throws you into ""epicness"" while flashing you with some ecchi scenes and slaps you across the face with parodies. World Wars, pyramids, lost civilizations, biblical references, floating castles, cat girls, Amazon women, fighting mecha robots with shooting vaginas. Yes. It's just that type of hentai. Insane, silly, hilarious, and nonsensical. But watch it with your doors locked because it is explicit with in-your-face sexual connotations that you just can't ignore.With a mish-mash of slap-stick characters, Lunatic Nights tends to throw the viewers off. At the center is your average Joe protagonist, a blonde haired high school student who reads manga. Through the introduction of his friend (or foe) He is suddenly surrounded by a harem of females: cat girl, traditional Japanese maiden, and a tomboy with wings, all of them with unexpected transformations. They suddenly embark on a journey to either rule or destroy the world. Then you have your antagonist who is ambiguously portrayed as either friend or foe. His face is always hidden behind a smiling mask and his motives, unclear. He has his own harem as well. The two factions battle each other with silliness as different worlds collided and chaos reigns. In additions to the two opposing factions, there are a number of side characters who make brief appearances who are just as crazy and hilarious.Even with so much hilarity, art and animation is one of its short-comings. The 3 episode OVA was made in the late nineties, so you'll have to forgives its simplicity. As you can expect, there are not a lot of details that went into the private areas, the animation is not smooth, and there are a lot of abnormalities in the art. So it really doesn't make it that much greater even if it is uncensored. But that is okay, because it is a comedy first, hentai second.Character voicing was rather good. Each character was befitting of its voice. The music wasn't anything memorable. The sounds and FX are dated and sometimes rather odd and off cue, but that just adds to the humor that is Lunatic Nights.Overall, if your looking for some naughty cheap laughs, then watch Lunatic Nights. It'll have you going ""WTF?!"" in a humorous way. I certainly found it hilarious.";Recommended
0;Onna Senshi Efe & Jira: Gude no Monshou;Marcus_Kane;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Marcus_Kane;7;This 1990 OVA about two warrior women is in my opinion pretty alright. What initially drew me to it was that it had two female MC's that looked pretty badass on the cover art, I'm a guy who loves strong women so i was all for that.Story: lets start with the story. In my opinion the story is confusing. we are given some exposition at the beginning but for me it didnt help much. We the viewers learn the story at the same time as the two main characters. I would sat that its a typical convoluted fantasy story. Whether its good or bad might depend on the viewer, for me it was alright. There is one thing I liked but that might have to do with the time in which the anime was released and not the anime itself. Even though its an adventure story and not an overly dark narrative people die, children die and there's blood when people get cut down. Its different than in anime today where the only time you will see this sort of impact of death is in very dark anime.Art: The art was decently good, i do believe this was originally VHS so that kind of affects the quality of what we see. But all in all the art is typical of early 90's anime.Characters: Now this is the one thing that i believe makes this anime worth watching and its for sure what got me interested in it. This anime most definitely passes the bechdel test, even though i think that test is B.S it has some merit. The two main characters Efe and Jira are two sword wielding princesses away from their homeland. The two have a partnership and feel developed as characters. Efe uses her magic to supplement her swordplay and outwit her opponents or distract them while Jira uses her masterful swordsmanship coupled with her great strength to break through her opponents guard. Theres also the three siblings which Efe and Jira help. The siblings are the driving point behind the story and I felt their hardships and loss along with them.In the end this is a neat little adventure anime spawned from the 90's. I enjoyed it, though I wish i could see more of the princesses adventures hinted at in the opening. I give this Anime a solid 7!;Recommended
1;Onna Senshi Efe & Jira: Gude no Monshou;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;7;"Okay, so today's film is from JC Staff and aired in 1990. I have a mixed history with JC. They've made some absolute rubbish like Sakurasou no pet na kanojo or Puni Puni Poemii. They've also made generic boring stuff like Toradora and Hachimitsu no Clover. But then they occasionally come out with something amazing like Slayers or Flying Witch. They're a studio that's so prolific and varies so widely in quality that I can't even predict what we're going to get from them.Story:Our narrative is set in a fantasy world where the warrior princess Jiliora and her mage partner Effera are captured and put on a slave ship. The pair escape along with another prisoner but the lad is mortally wounded, prompting them to return the jewel he left behind to his siblings. This results in them being dragged into a major adventure.There's one major flaw with this story. It relies on a lot of exposition. We start with three minutes of a narrator telling us background for the world. Because natural world building is too hard. There's also a sequence where Efe and Jira are given information that ""everyone knows"" except them, apparently. Here's the thing that bothers me about that. It would have been so easy for the old man who gives them the information to say that it's being kept under wraps but he heard it from a contact instead of having our main cast be the only ones around who don't know for some inexplicable reason.That being said, I appreciate the writing aesthetic in this. It's like a cross between Dirty Pair and Slayers. With the somewhat more serious but still comedic tone of Dirty Pair, along with focusing on a dynamic dame duo but the fantasy setting of Slayers along with action sequences that are more reminiscent of it. Although I should add that this came out before Slayers and the light novel it was based off of came out slightly before the Slayers light novel. In terms of story-telling it's a fun little adventure that manages to stay compelling and provides some funny moments.Characters:Efe and Jira are both pretty interesting characters. The problem kind of lies in the supporting and antagonistic characters. We have a young man who barely speaks and just sort of meekly helps the pair without getting involved in the fights. We have the siblings who they get involved with helping. And the antagonists are just kind of religious zealots, a monstrous tree lady and a creepy dude who pulls the whole ""someday she will be mine"" thing towards Jira.Art:Onna Senshi Efe & Jira: Gude no Monshou definitely has that early 90s art and animation style. Including the motion lines and repeated frames as a shortcut to save on the animation budget. That being said, it still holds up pretty decently. The character designs are good and the action sequences look pretty nice.Sound:Matsui Naoko and Ikura Kazue are both really good in this. The rest of the cast is good enough. It's one of those situations where their character underdevelopment does somewhat affect the performances but they still do well. The music s pretty good.Ho-yay:Jira and Efe definitely come across as more than friends. There's a part where the guy who's creepy towards Jira says that he tolerates her ""partnership"" with Efe because Efe is sharp and he says it in a way that makes it sound like they're partners in more ways than one.Areas of Improvement:1. Do your world building by showing it, not by having an exposition dump. Literally no one has ever watched a film or tv show and said ""I really want someone to explain how the world works to me while nothing interesting happens on screen.""2. The supporting characters could us a bit more depth.3. Think through things a little more. What I mean by this is that if something is common knowledge, our protagonists should know it. And there are ways to get around that and still explain it to the audience. You could have it not be common knowledge or they could have to explain it to the phasing boy.Final Thoughts:I quite enjoyed this film. It reminds me of two anime franchises that I rather enjoyed and loved respectively. That being said, I definitely don't think it's on the same level as Slayers. It's an entertaining little film with plenty to like about it though. As such, I'll give it a solid 7/10.";Recommended
0;Youkai Watch Movie 5: Forever Friends;Chrismas95;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chrismas95;2;"The main thought i had after watching Forever Friends was ""What was the point?"" Given it features a new protagonist (to the point of being a whole third of Yokai Watch 4), I was obviously wondering what different direction and tone LEVEL-5 would take to make it stand out from the goofy Keita era and the gritty Shadowside era. The answer: it's just more Shadowside. And if you're like me and hate all of the ""Enma stuff"" (which is all of the ""cool anime guy"" characters and swords and stuff) that's been defining the series for ages now, you're going to hate this.The movie starts off promising. The plot works, the initial conflict is humble, and the three protagonists are all likable. However, it's shoved aside halfway through in favor of powerful men/spirit/demons fighting and getting more and more powerful just for the sake of spectacle. At least, when Shadowside did all of this, it was new and experimental. However, this movie is just more of the same (sometimes literally reused ideas) to the point where I wonder why it's separate from Shadowside. The focus being pushed away form Shin in the second half doesn't do it any favors for anyone hoping to learn more about the Yokai Watch 4 protagonist, either.I feel like the point of Yokai Watch is the many yokai that inspirit people with their quirky traits, but the series has since pushed them to the wayside for ideas that aren't nearly as unique. This movie is no exception, and your enjoyment of it will depend on how you feel about the Enma stuff.";Not Recommended
0;Mahoutsukai Tai! vs. Shamanic Princess;BandDog_Onymou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BandDog_Onymou;8;"So, for those of you who happened to stumble upon this page, I'm sure you're wondering what this 1 episode OAV even is!Well, it's a gag crossover special of the two 1996 OVA ""Magic Users Club"" and ""Shamanic Princess."" For those of you who haven't seen those two OVAs I highly recommend watching them.Shamanic Princess is a deceptively cutesy looking magical girl show that is actually dark, violent and intense. The main magical girl Tiara and her ""best friend"" turn into demons and trying to choke each other, and cry blood out their eyes, it's metal as heck!! It is one of my favorite series of all time and that's why I absolutely had to see this OVA so that I could say I consumed everything Shamanic Princess.Magic Users Club is also good, it was the more successful series of the two, it starts out as a cute ecchi comedy series about a club of witches, but it gets deceptively dark later. For those of you who watch the series and think it looks a lot like Princess Tutu, you'd be correct both series were made by Junichi Sato and both have similiar staff. Both Tutu and that show are about clumsy yet cute red headed girls who are trying to learn magic and both of them have moments of the main characters meeting horrifying creatures and standing up against impossible odds. They're both pretty good, although the original Ova of Magic Users Club is particularity great for its amazing animation. The TV series isn't quite as good visually, at least.Anyway, both series in full are on Crunchyroll and Shamanic Princess is on even more streaming services including the app Tubi!So with that out of the way, what exactly does this special include? Well it's basically a short epilogue to these two amazing shows, and also filled with some jokes of the characters from both shows crossing over and meeting each other.This is really cool for multiple reasons. One is that these series were created by two entirely different people, Shamanic Princess being a product of Studio CLAMP (Cardcaptor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayerarth) and Magic Users Club like I said once again was created by Juninho Sato.Shamanic Princess is so incredibly violent, dark and intense (It definetely has the most gore of any CLAMP magical girl series that I've seen) so seeing the characters be happy in this special was so so great.So yeah, If you're a fan of this series this short will give you those good vibes. Watch the show on a site like Nyaa and hope that someday an Hd version gets uploaded to Crunchyroll in order to really finish out all the other Shamanic Princess and Magic Users Club content that they have";Recommended
0;Sasurai no Shoujo Nell;Diogo_Gomes_1995;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Diogo_Gomes_1995;8;"I'm surprised that nobody has made a review on this underrated gem, here! I guess i'll just make one for this show by myself.Sasurai no Shoujo Nell (Wandering Girl Nell in english) is a anime show made as far back as 1979. The show is part of the progmming block called ""Kirin Meikyoku Roman Gekijou"". Sadly, not much is known about the programming block other than, assumingly, to be a rival to Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theatre.There's only four shows made for the programming block. And unlike the other three where they are somewhat original, this one is based off the series of novel known as The Old Curiosity Shop by british author, Charles Dickens.So what does this anime has to offer? Here's what i know:The story takes place in London, England. Where lives a girl named Nell who lives with Mr. Trent, her grandfather and works at his shop.One day, she receives a visit from a greedy bastard named Kilp, who wants Mr. Trent to pay a loan that he made. The problem, however, is that Mr. Trent barely has any money and spends alot of his money onto gambling. Because of this, Kilp warns her and Mr. Trent that if he doesn't pay the entire loan, Kilp will be taking away his shop by buying it and kicking Mr. Trent out of business. And what's worse is that since Nell had no family other than her grandfather, she would be forced to marry Brass, Kilp's assistant, who so happens to be waaaaay older in his own age compared to Nell's age (I know this sounds wrongg, but it's a Charles Dickens adaption. What do you expect?).Of course, she and Mr. Trent don't want to do it. And to avoid his plan to ever happen, they decided to leave the shop and london itself. As time would go one, Nell starts wondering if her mother is still alive and tries to convince her grandfather to go see her. But Mr. Trent is doubtful of ever seeing Nell's mother. But then he holds his grudge againts her and tries to settle with her to go see her mother if she's still alive in Paradise. A location where people lives.Kit, Nell''s friend who worked at Mr. Trent's shop, was concerned about her disappearance and settled on going after her. Along the way he meets a mysterious man who's also looking for Nell and Mr. Trent as well so he can unveil the truth about Nell's mother.Meanwhile, Kilp, much to his dismay, found out that she and Mr. Trent left london and also decided to go after them as well. Alongside with his assistant Brass and his minions.It's a story of a one big journey where they will encounter many people around them and many locations they go in search of Paradise and Nell's mother.It's a very wonderful, sad and touching show that builds alot on world-building and many characters that we meet upon each episodes. Each episodes can sometimes be a joy to watch or pretty depressing to watch as there will be some things that are tackled throughout the show. Such as death for example.The anime really knows how to give out lots of episodes that keeps me interested into watching it and so do you. The more you get invested into the show's story and it's characters, the more better it gets.And speaking of the characters, that's also the highlight of the show as well. Many of the characters are very memorable and really great to watch. You have, of course, Nell. The main protagonist of the anime. I find her a really wonderful character because i love how she has a will to help people out in certain situations.You also have Mr. Trent who may not be the best character in the entire show, but does serve a purpouse to help and protect her granddaughter whenever a certain danger or situation happens. He can be a bit grumpy and sometimes a little bit violent at times, but we need to keep in mind that he is an old man who has gone through lots of crazy stuff in his lifehood.There are also characters that also help the story keep going. Like Kit, who's always concerned about Nell and willing to help her out to find her mother, the mysterious man who wants to find Nell and help her find Paradise. As well as showing her the truth about her mother and his identity.And then you have Kilp, Brass and their minions, who are the villains throughout the show. Kilp is one greedy bastard who always wants money and make people's lives miserable by taking away their shops from them, Brass who's a goofball but also a kind of creepy guy who always has a crush on Nell, to the point of wanting to marry her and then you have Kilp's minions who serve as the enemies that Nell and Mr. Trent keep on avoiding.Each character does alot through out the show and does help the show keep up as a breath of fresh air compared to others Charles Dickens' adaptions. And many of them are just as enjoyable and memorable as Nell.The animation is done by DAX Productions. Although they are not that famous of a studio as something like Nippon Animation, they are the same studio that also produced other anime shows like Sword Art Online and Assassination Classroom. So it's a interesting piece of history to learn something about theses shows in common.The art looks pretty good even for 1979. You have lots of beautiful background animations that looks straight out of a novel book. And while the animation can be limited at best and the character designs aren't that special, they do get the job well done.The sound is also pretty good, too. The sure there are a few episodes where the audio can have some hiccups, but for the most part, it's all good.The music is also very wonderful to listen. It gives the show a pretty nice and sad mood whenever a scene happens.And the voice acting is also great as well. Seiyuus like Harumi Ichiryuusai, Eken Mine, Yoshiko Oota and even GeGeGe No Kitaro's singer himself, Kazuo Kumakura do an amazing job to voice the characters. They put alot of love to the characters. Which makes me love the characters even more!But not all things are perfect. There are a few episodes that i find it weak. Like for example, there's an episode about Nell trying to babysit a baby while the baby's mother leaves. Which i find it a waste of time because i thought the mother was so stupid to let her child go around the village all by himself. Which is too dangerous for a baby to go there. And with Nell having to do the job for them is just stupid in my opinion. But at the very least it did had a decent ending to that episode. And the moral is: Don't freaking let a child go to any places without their permission. ESPECIALLY IF A BABY IS LIKE WHAT? 2? 3 YEARS OLD!?Anyway, other than that stupid instance, overall, i had a great time watching this wonderful show.The story is great, the art is pretty darn good, the sound is great, the characters are very enjoyable, my enjoyment to the show is pretty good and overall, i had a great time with it. This is easily one of my favourite anime shows from my top 100 favourite animes and it's a really really REALLY underrated gem that needs to be seen.Go check out the anime if you have the time.Anyways, my name is Diogo, and it's been my review on Sasurai no Shoujo Nell (Or Wandering Girl Nell).

The idea of a train was a wonder concept choice seeing how its job is to repeat and repeat some more. Sadly, nothing was answered from season 1 or 2. In fact it brought on more questions.ArtSame computer generated art style as in the first two seasons. Art was realistic looking for the horror bit while at the same time being comical for the comedy aspect.

The horrendous CGI on the spaceship, the quality, and the animation all seem way older than when it came out. I am rating this a 6 overall, but that's being really nice considering nostalgic value. Other than that this show really isn't anything.This show is basically this generic shounen kid that happens to have this special power due to being a descendent of this old race, and he and his group of friends adventure to find these symbols to be the best and stop being oppressed pretty much. Like I remember when card-based anime were the shit back then, so I would assume this was decently popular a really long time ago. There really isn't anything else to say, it's just the typical shounen tropes and a really badly aged anime.;Mixed Feelings
0;The Bathroom;KiingMentality;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KiingMentality;10;Allow me to enlighten you.....The Bathroom is a masterpiece. hear me out.I consider myself to be a man well versed in the world and culture of anime. Iv'e seen a few great anime that are considered to be modern masterpieces, but I have been searching long and hard, far and long for a piece of work that truly represented what a work of art should be. because the medium has grown exponentially in the past decade, there has been and influx in the different genres of anime resulting in fans developing different tastes, and interest in various anime categories. Because of this, there have been fewer and fewer anime shows and movies that are able to satisfy larger communities. As a result, we have adopted a branch like system where you have a group of fans that stick solely to their genre and don't give a second thought to trying out another.The Bathroom shatters this status quo completely by smashing it with a rasengan, blowing it to oblivion, shooting it into space and calling Team Dai Gurren to come finish it offThis one episode animation covers every conceivable category interest with virtually anything and everything a fan of anime could ask for. There is something for everybody here, they have action, shounen, slice of life, romance, comedy, animals, horror, physiological, suspense, history, sci-fi, isekai, plot, and PLOT....This collage of genres is thrown at you at 100mph and sends you on a thrill ride that will have you laughing, screaming, crying, depressed, hyped and in an existential crisis at the end. ALL IN 10 MINUTES.I wont write any spoilers, but if you haven't already decided to watch this masterpiece I beg you.....dedicate less than 10mins to experience the beauty and masterfully crafted piece art that is The Bathroom.10/10 - would recommend.;Recommended

The cover art is that of a cartoon. Yes, there are cartoon images but more than half of the show is backdrop-ed with real live scenes with cartoons of course added. So, don't expect a full cartoon. The title implies a bathroom. Yes, there are bathroom references but combine it with everything else shown does not fully explain the wacky madness that unfolds.

0;Shouwa Monogatari (Movie);Deli24;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deli24;9;Such a great yet simple slice-of-life movie! The character development of the Yamazaki family is the best part. From the daughter's struggles with first love to the simple experiences of boyhood through the son's perspective, Shouwa Monogatari emphasizes the bond between a loving but dysfunctional family. Surprisingly, the father gets decent screen time and proper character development (which is not often in anime movies). I loved watching this movie! Watched this movie when the 2020 Tokyo Olympics had to be postponed to 2021 caused COVID-19 and this movie made me appreciate the Olympic Games more and the hardworking people of Japan.;Recommended
0;Shouwa Monogatari (Movie);karuhigamiDURV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/karuhigamiDURV;4;This is a simple movie. There’s really nothing big going on in this anime. It’s a straight forward movie about the Yamazaki family during the 39th Showa Era or 1964. This was a significant year for Japan because this was the year Japan hosted the summer Olympics. This was a big thing for Japan because this was more than just the Olympics. It was also a way to reintroduce themselves to the world after cutting themselves off during WWII. The setting of the anime isn’t really that important and only subtle 1964 references are thrown here and there. I wish they did add more though because the movie is too plain and too straightforward.The anime is about the family dynamic of the Yamazaki’s. It’s a laid back story full of typical family problems. It has the over protective dad, the rebellious children, the caring mother and every other typical family issues. There’s nothing grand in the way of the story and nothing really remarkable happen. It just nicely painted how a typical family interacts daily and it shows just how much they love each other. If I’d break the story to bits though, there’d be two plot points to the movie.The first one, and the one that had more focus, is about the daughter of the family going through her rebellious phase. It’s nothing remarkable. Yuuko Yamazaki, seventeen years old, is in love with this guy and she goes out with him without telling her family. They started worrying when she would say “I’ll go to the library” and then come home late into the night. Given the era, it’s natural that her parents would be mad because seventeen year old girls should be proper ladies and girls shouldn’t date so young. It’s pretty understandable for her age though to act out against her parents and do things she isn’t allowed to do. Nothing blows your parents top than your daughter dating an older guy.The Yamazaki family is patriarchal household and the father heavily scolds his daughter. The mother keep things calm and the daughter would just brush her parents off. Like I said, nothing awesome happens and the plot is pretty predictable.The second plot point is the changing times and the father’s craft work being threatened by change. His son insists to move on with the times but the father doesn’t budge. I guess this is where the 1964 setting is more prominent as well. Aside from the Olympics, the rise of western culture (the Beatles and the Ivy League fashion movement) and the introduction of bullet trains were among the changes happening during those times. The traditional era is slowly being invaded by technology and global culture. The lives of the Yamazaki family are being affected by this monumental change.The 1964 reference is pretty small though. This was a missed opportunity because this was a nice way to spice the anime up a bit. 1960s was also the decade Sakamachi no Apollon is set in and it was able to use it to give the anime some personality. It featured Christianity, foreigners walking the street and the heavy influence of the western culture. In Shouwa Monogatari, everything is pretty unspectacular. Sure it had bullet trains, the Olympics and western influences but it doesn’t really transport you to the era. It’s most just there as a backdrop for the story to function in. It’s such a shame because anime movies need to separate itself from regular airing series and they do so by being grand and awesomely conceived. This movie had none and it felt I’m watching a low budget anime series from 2002.The story made a nice comeback in the end though and the theme of family togetherness is nicely displayed. It doesn’t matter if your parents yell at you or if your daughters are turning into a grade A slut. At the end of the day, they’re family and family stick together and weather any storm. The story was sweet and I appreciate the subtle approach to something so simple and very relatable. That’s the main strength of the anime as well. The way you can relate to the characters and the family dynamic makes it a treat to watch the anime. It also proves just how strong a family bond is that viewers can relate to a 1960s family.4/10 “It’s plain and plain comes off as weak and weak is not really something you’d want to watch.”;Not Recommended

A story is told while not as mystery presents a mystery. For it forces to the viewer to question what he/she just watched. From there try and decipher each character's role and presence. While coming to an end with what they interpreted as the underlining message.My take was a tale of the downfall to one's on going riches. For money generally comes from others hard work. If one keep draining from the source with out providing some back the source will dry out in time. Once it drys out you no longer have a safety net. If the time comes where you need the extra cash you don't have you are out of luck. Going towards the moral of treat others kindly with respect.Sadly, this retrospect or life moral is not always acknowledged. Industries no matter where you look are still on a for profit regard. Whether it is a drug establishment or insurance. They are bleeding us dry. When we dry who will they bleed? Themselves?ArtShown in a black and white outlook. Now, you can see that as early production for it kind of is(late 1900's). Although, the artist here choose it to demonstrate suffering, horror, and lack of hope.

0;Kairaku Satsujin Chousakan Kouji;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;4;"There is a monster out for blood, and the only one that can stop it is the man-demon Koji. Aided by a morbid psychic, he follows the grisly trail of victims to a lonely woman. But Koji soon qustions if his powers are enough to stop this devastating threat.I'm going to just get this quickly out of the way. The sex is too middling and short to be really enjoyed. I guess if you're looking for something very specific, you might get something out this, but in the decades since the release of this hentai, there has a wide selection of well animated tiddies to come out that are much better than this. It's not even the best from around the time that it was released. And I doubt many people want to combine sex and gore in their hentai.The reason that I had to get that out of the way was due to everything else about this hentai. This is one of those anime that within 5 minutes of the first episode, you're bombarded with several dumb and baffling thing at once, and you have to pause it for half an hour just to take a proper breather.Somehow, this anime simultaneously doesn't slow down to introduce anything or smoothly transition from one scene to another, and yet it's constantly filled with clumsy lines of exposition to try and introduce characters and what they're supposed to be doing in any given situation. The whole thing is coming at you a million miles a second, and you don't have time to properly digest any of what's going on before it just moves onto the next scene. One scene has a character say that she can't come, only for this scene to be followed by the guy she was talking to making her come.And the English dub is truly something to behold. All of the actors are clearly enthused to be voicing some dumb hentai or are rushing through it to just the whole thing over and done with. I know hentai doesn't exactly have high standards when it comes to voice acting, but it's still hilariously hearing some of the best worst acting I've seen come out of a hentai in a while. It's bordering on Garzey's Wing Territory.On top of that, some of the voices have been digitally pitched lowered, and it's blatantly obvious. I don't know if that's because some voice actors didn't want their voices to be recognized, sheer incompetence, or the fact that the anime might have run out of actors to voice all of their characters, re-used some of them, and then tried to cover them up with shitty editing.Even the music has problems. Aside from the fact a lot of the music doesn't even match what's happening on screen, I'm pretty sure that most, if not all, of it either came from a generic music library meant for temporary music, or a Casio keyboard pre-set. It ranges from sounding like it would have appeared in a mull as generic Muzak, or just flat out sounds like someone is playing a bunch of random note with no coercion whatsoever. It sounds like the infamous ""Mansion Basement"" track from the Director's Cut of the original PS1 version of Resident Evil.I have never heard a combination of bad mixing, bad sound effects, and bad voice acting quite like I've heard here. And all of this came from the first episode alone. There are two more episodes, for a total of three episodes, and the entire thing is peppered with more bizarre choices.The second episode starts with a recap that's censored with mosaics, which makes me think that it's either reused footage from a censored version of the hentai because it was the easiest footage to find for the edit, or an advertisement for the hentai that editor was already editing together, and they just slapped it onto this anime to either fill time for an episode, or they didn't want to waste more energy on editing, or it was already a low paying job. Either way, the rest of the episode is uncensored, so it doesn't make sense why this footage is censored.The way that they censor it isn't even consistent from episode to episode, with the second episode using a mosaic and the third episode using just a regular blur. I don't know how you fuck up the continuity of a censor blur.Despite the fact that I've been shitting all over this hentai, there are a couple of good things that I can say about it, even if it's a complete reach. Even if the whole thing comes across as edgy and try hard, there was an attempt at being dark and moody, even if it veers off into being edgy and tryhard. The animation is actually OK, and it actually has some decent monster designs, unique looking locations, and animation. I even liked the song from the credits for what thats worth. It does feel like there was some actual mild effort put into it. The story goes in a weird bizarre nonsense direction, and is almost worth watching just because of it.Would I recommend Demon Warrior Koji for a wank? Not really. Would I recommend it for it's so-bad-its-good English dub? Sure. Get a couple of beers, and have a couple of laughs. Although, once you watch the first episode, you get the gist of it.";Not Recommended
0;Be-yond;xbsquirrel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/xbsquirrel;8;"This is one of those series you find yourself just staring at, wondering ""is this even worth my time?"", when you're looking for something to be ""entertained"" by. Well, in that sense it isn't worth it. The H scenes are very soft, really short, and don't show much. That being said it's still a very entertaining watch. ""Why?"" you ask?To start out, you have the main character, the 'Dark Devil', the being said to herald the end of everything, the destroyer of time and space itself, acting like a good, decent, human being. He even says ""It's the human thing to do"" several times. The charm to the character is that while he does indeed have the power to end it all, he has empathy towards other (especially women) and he acts more like an actual good guy rather than the devil he's supposed to be.After that you have the other cast members, which are the girls of the series our 'devil' gets his due from. Yes, they're somewhat stereotypical (klutz space cop, inept bounty hunter, emotionless doll, and pure-hearted maiden) and they don't bring much beyond the usual jokes. Their character designs are a bit plain due to how often we've seen their character types before but are still memorable. They all help work as foils to our protagonist and help make the show more enjoyable and that's all that is really needed out of them. By having what they have, the interaction between the devil and the world they're set in makes it an enjoyable watch, while the humor can be summed up as the ridiculousness of the situation created by the devil having empathy.The sound for the series isn't much to be impressed about but it isn't bad or anything that makes you want to gouge your ears out. At best it's easily forgettable and lets you keep on moving through the show.The art is the nice cell shaded/painted stuff that we got to see before everything went digital, so there's nothing to complain about the art besides that most of the designs are, again, stereotypical. The people (extras), vehicles, and buildings are forgettable because we've all seen them a million times before. The best part about the designs, in my opinion, is that remind me of the Tenchi OVAs, seeing as it came out a few years afterwards and the setting feels like it could be in the same cannon thanks to said designs.The voice acting was fine and there were no voices that felt out of place or mishandled but, again, you'll probably be able to forget them after you finish watching because while they do a good job, there's nothing overly special about them.The only REAL problem this series has is that it's too short. It ends is a way that makes you want to see more. Though if you think about it, since it was based off of a video game, having it this short would in theory make you want to go out and buy the game so you could play it yourself. *sigh*Overall, the characters, art and sound are all okay, but it's the story and the humor that the plot generates that really help make this series worth the watch. If anything, I wish they'd either cut out/alluded to/shorted the sex scenes so it was age appropriate and made this a full 12 to 24 episode series. Hell, even six episodes would have been better.Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you found it helpful.";Recommended
0;Ninja Bugei-chou;Arsene_Lucifer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Arsene_Lucifer;4;"Band of Ninja is a 1967 manga film from experimental live action film director Nagisa Oshima. It’s not a mistake I didn’t say animated since there is not a single moving image in the film. Oshima filmed manga stills attempting to give the illusion of animation through basic filming techniques like quick cuts and plain cinematography. Resulting in failure from its own execution from attempting to cover a large story without the proper length to accomplish it being rushed consistently in the story department.Band of Ninja immediately piles up the plot in its first thirty minutes. The story begins in 1560 during a prolonged time of great upheaval in Japan known as the Sengoku Period (c.1467 - c.1573). The central characters are Kagemaru (Rokko Toura), a dashing but mysterious ninja who seems to have the ability to magically appear and save the day when a situation seems impossible; Jūtaro Yūki (Kei Yamamoto), who seeks to avenge the slaughter of his father and restore himself as master of Fushikage Castle; Akemi (Akiko Koyama), Jūtaro’s love interest and secret sister of Kagemaru; and the baddie, Oda Nobunaga (Fumio Watanabe), the evil daimyō and nemesis of Kagemaru, who seeks to unify Japan through violence and oppression. In two hours this film tells all of these stories, and a couple subplots jumping between them leisurely. Try to imagine around twenty manga volumes worth of material badly condensed into a two hour film and you’ll understand the feeling of seeing Band of Ninja.It’s non-stop storytelling doesn’t allow the viewer to catch their breath on anything. Whenever it switches between characters it further diminishes attachment towards them over time. Regularly going to a completely random character, characterizing them, and then ignoring them going onto another character. You’ll be left scratching your head wondering how a simple story about revenge ended up with a scene where a large number of rats are eating people or another scene where Kagemaru talks to a king with his decapitated head. Simply expecting you accept all the odd occurrences without earning it. Sorting out the different anthology stories, some of which don’t connect becomes a chore as it keeps them piling up. Together, these several different storylines don’t create a cohesive narrative, let alone a compelling story.Some of the material is delivered well. There is a small subplot that focuses on a warrior being raised in the woods by animals and adjusting to the way of civilize living. How it’s handled is through a montage chronicling his growth into adulthood being one of the few moments where justice is done to the source material. Developing the character, showing his conflict, and overcoming it on his own come across clearly. However, such moments can’t make up for the often left lingering plot threads before eventually getting to them sporadically. They lose value in their quality when not given the proper focus. Which instead of being an exception it's the rule.On the technical side, the direction is alright since the camera only captures the stills of the Ninja bugeicho manga. It never feels like the camera cuts off any panels drawn by Noboru Okamoto (know by his pen name Sanpeo Shirato) so nothing becomes lost in the way Okamoto art is shown. Okamoto artwork is preserved as he originally drew them. For example, speed lines function to signify the speed or velocity of a moving object or character within the motionless panel of comics. Shirato's original drawings for Ninja bugeicho are filled with speed lines, and Oshima faithfully preserves instead of erasing and replacing them with animated movements. Another example of faithfulness to Okamoto’s artwork is in a scene depicting a pivotal duel between the ninja character Hotarubi and the samurai character Jutaro, the speed lines fill the space within a panel. The film retains these lines as it cuts between the tightly framed close-ups that depict the swift sword of Hotarubi mercilessly amputating Jutaro left arm. The resulting impressions of velocity and conflict emanate from the graphic of densities and compositions, rather than from the actual movements of characters and objects.The simplest technique like panning across a manga panel makes a still image visually interesting. Almost as if the camera is sweeping across a nicely drawn landscape. Added with some top tier sound effect (ranging from wind blowing, clashing swords, fire burning, etc.) and the atmosphere in the drawing comes to life. There were even certain moments in the film where the editing shine; in particular a sword through precisely time editing imitated animation for a brief moment.These minor visual flair lose their effect after an hour. While the way the camera shows an environment changes, characters will remain still at all time. Limited by its own execution it eventually runs out of techniques to implement. This is actually where voice acting hurts the experimental film. More than half of the film have characters speaking through various emotions, but cuts corners by not changing characters facial expressions to match the voice actors' performances. In retrospect hurting the connection between the images and the delivery from the voice actor.Voice acting is top notch in general and only viewable through English subtitles. With so many characters in the film it’s amazing not a single actor gives a bad performance. Shoichi Ozawa narration brings allot of life into the film as well being an emotive storyteller. His vocal performance creates the right atmosphere when entering or exiting a scene. There’s plenty of voice actors in the film each of whom do a good job delivering the material than how the film director chose to tell it.The music is composed by Hikaru Hayashi and his score is average. There’s Japanese choir singing, mellow violin, bombastic trumpets, flutes, and orchestral pieces. With the exception of the main theme use to open the film the music is forgettable. Most of the tracks are stuck in the moment, which has no variation how a musical piece is played ending up with simplistic music. However, they do liven up the film series of stills whenever use.Band of Ninja isn’t a film I would recommend seeing even if the material was animated in the shape it is. The experiment of filming manga stills isn’t captivating here due to the large scope story being undermined by a rush pacing. Neglecting time to properly develop hurting its own desire to tell a compelling story being noticeable, but gets bored shifting to another character leisurely. For a film whose entire existence is a risk the only noteworthy aspect about this film is this is the closest director live action film director Nagisa Oshima came to entering the field of animation and the way it was made. Losing substance when translating the manga onto film. Instead of being an achievement in experimental filmmaking in the field of animation, Band of Ninja is instead a small footnote in the vast history of animation.";Not Recommended

0;Explorer Woman Ray;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;5;Explorer Woman Ray is an OVA from AIC, the same studio behind Bubblegum Crisis, Vampire Princess Miyu, Battle Athletes, Blue Gender, Sasameki Koto and the terrible OreImo. just to name a few I've reviewed. Based on a manga by Okazaki Takeshi. Although this one is far less known than any of those, but being a “hipster” I just have to dreg up obscure titles just so that I can say I've seen them and you haven't. Actually, the truth is that I picked twenty super short anime that looked kind of interesting, assigned them numerical values and rolled a d20 to determine which one to look at. Incidentally, they had to be super short because I've been sitting on this Gintama request for months and something really short gives me more time to work on it. So let's look at Explorer Woman Ray and find out if it's an obscure gem or if I should have left it buried in the desert.Story:Our tale opens with some twin sisters riding a bus when they see a truck pull alongside it covered in tarp. The tarp gets removed to reveal a group of men with guns who board the bus to chase the twins. The twins manage to escape in a pretty good action sequence and they make their way to the archaeologist, Kazuki Reina, our titular Ray. They deliver an artifact to her and witness an altercation between her and another archaeologist, Rieg. In the morning she gets a call that the mirror was stolen by a pair of girls and she finds the twins gone, along with the mirror. Although they were kind enough to leave a note saying that they'll return it once they find the treasure. She goes after them but Rieg and his group of ruffians are after the mirror too.Let's begin with the negative things about the series. First off, this is one of those action-oriented series where archaeology is basically about running through ruins for adventure and fending off thugs who are after the same discoveries as you are. Instead of excavating ancient artifacts through long and arduous labour for science. Don't expect an accurate depiction of the field. Now, that doesn't really other me since it's a pretty common choice for fictional media but what does bother me is that we see our heroine destroy ancient artifacts and scientific data that's been gathered because she's worried about how it'll be used. Why is she even in a scientific field if she's so damn skittish about knowledge? It's also a bit head scratching that they visit ruins that they've been to before and yet they've still got intricate traps armed and ready. No one else bothered going through them and disarming those so that the ruin could be explored safely?Now I will give the series some credit as well. I do like that the antagonist's minions are portrayed as individuals and not mindless followers. They do question his orders, even pondering whether or not to obey him at one point. I also do like Ray's character arc and the way she faces her own inner conflict. It's not fully realised and they could have done a lot more with it, but given the time constraints it's pretty well done.Characters:Most of the characters in this are pretty archetypical. Ray is the experienced adventurer. Rieg is the villainous scientist motivated by greed. His minions are a slight improvement over regular minion characters since they do have some agency but they aren't very far above them. Mami and Mai act as Ray's sidekicks. With Mami being the more timid sidekick type and Mai being the more active and headstrong variety. I honestly can't fault the OVA for using the ad hoc archetypes, since it is only two episodes and they're more action focused than character driven but it doesn't really make for a compelling or memorable cast.Art:The artwork and animation are pretty dated. For the late 80s it's pretty typical but by today's standards it doesn't look very good. The backgrounds are pretty plain and there are some art errors peppered throughout. I will say that the action sequences are pretty nicely done and they hold up pretty well. You can tell that AIC was really putting their focus on them.Sound:The vocal cast is pretty good. Ray is voiced by Doi Mika, probably best known for her work as Queen Serenity in the original Sailor Moon anime. The twins are voiced by Itou Miki (Jessie Gartland) and Takayama Minami (Griffith.) They do well, but expect to hear them yell “Ray” a lot. Hori Katsunosuke (we got to hear him play Professor X in that terrible X-men anime) does make for a pretty decent villain. The music is kind of generic, but serviceable.Ho-yay:There really isn't any. I suppose that you could say that the only reason for Mai and Mami to stay with Ray after the first episode is that one, or both, is/are attracted to her but I kind of doubt that that's the reason that was intended since there's really nothing to support the idea. It's more likely that Okazaki just couldn't be bothered to give them a reason for sticking around or that AIC didn't feel it important to share that reason with the viewers.Final Thoughts:Explorer Woman Ray is not a bad OVA. It's kind of standard for an archaeologists are action heroes type of narrative. If that's your type of thing you'll probably enjoy it well enough. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. Next week, Shigofumi: Letters from the departed. Yeah, Gintama is still a ways away.;Mixed Feelings
0;Patalliro! Stardust Keikaku;horridhendy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/horridhendy;9;I felt like this anime needed another review. I'll try to keep my fanboying down to a minimum but bear in mind that I love this show.It's hard to describe Patalliro to those who haven't seen it. It was absolutely ground-breaking for its time for being the first ever shounen-ai on Japanese TV. I would say it's a psychedelic adventure involving a Japanese, gay James Bond and a wacky, time-travelling ‘Scrappy-Doo type’ prankster dictator who solve apocalyptic diamond theft mysteries. It is very Japanese, there is a lot of surreal humour involving puns that you likely won't get unless you speak the language but even if you don't, the antics are often entertaining.The movie Patalliro Stardust Keikaku is actually a great installment of this franchise. Given the score of the film being so low, I expected it to be like a bad episode but I would say this is one of the stronger episodes of Patalliro for several reasons:1. “Junior” is a great antagonist. Partly because he’s pretty fabulous - He has poison lipstick and he throws a rose before he tries to kill you, which is a bit of a giveaway but very stylish. But also, he’s a catalyst for friction between Bancoran and Maraich, which means the film is more focused on their relationship - which I love.2. All the main characters are great and have fantastic chemistry. I love Bancoran, his bishounen-killer ways and his almost violent but playful disdain for Patalliro is really funny to me. We also get to see some inner conflict for him in this film. Maraich’s jealous love for him is entertaining. Patalliro is a very acquired taste. I used to find him annoying but now I find his antics fun and silly (one reason why it’s probably best to watch the TV show first).3. My favourite thing about this film is the ending, which I won’t spoil but it was rather beautifully melancholic. The stardust and diamond aesthetic was gorgeous to look at. Don’t get me wrong, it’s wacky and the “space science” doesn’t really make sense but the villain’s plan to end the world through the falling frozen diamond satellite causing mass extreme hail was really interesting.4. The plot felt tight in the best way. I'm pretty astounded that some people have found this movie to have no plot mostly because the plot is very evident, it’s totally wacky but it’s also totally there. If anything, there’s too much plot because a lot happens in this short runtime. There’s just enough comedic relief. The romance is well-woven in so that it’s pertinent to the story line. The denouement right at the end was honestly pretty unexpected.Here’s one caveat: I personally think you need to have seen the TV show to really appreciate it. It’s similar to the Revolutionary Girl Utena movie in that it’s intended to be standalone but if you know the characters, their motives and the basic set-up for the plot then it definitely helps. I would imagine that I would have been completely bewildered by several moments in the film if I hadn’t seen the TV show.For me, one of the main reasons for watching this is the art. This is very subjective, I would imagine that most people will hate the art style because it’s very unique and very dated but in a way that’s endlessly charming rather than jarring in my opinion. The backgrounds are stunning and the psychedelic colour scheme is so vibrant. It’s very stylised. It looks graphic and ornate and it reminds me of an Aubrey Beardsley painting or an Erte fashion drawing. I love the art style but it’s probably not for most people.The sound might be called cheesy or dated by some and it is but it’s also perfectly suited to the style of the show. It reminds me of those old seventies detective shows like Charlie’s Angels or classic Bond films. I think it’s fun, vintage and charming. For those fans of the show, much of the OST is reused (you’ll be pleased to know that the “Who Killed Cock Robin?” song makes an appearance) but there are also some fun new additions.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think it’s really fun, weird and a great watch. I also think it’s unique and original with a great art style. That said, I’m not sure if I would recommend it to most people, it has so many things about it that people dislike, for example: it’s old, it’s shounen-ai, it’s very weird, it’s full of very japanese references and the animation is dated. If you can get past all that then you’ll probably love this film but it’s certainly not for everyone.;Recommended
0;Patalliro! Stardust Keikaku;Tsubakiaka;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Tsubakiaka;6;Hmm. I really needed a second review on this damn movie. Where can you start with the absurdness that is thePatalliro anime? In a flurry of quick hitting gags and 70s gay (?) drama you realize one thing-If you are not Japanese, you will never be able to pin down half the cultural references. And an interesting relationship with Nazi imagery can ruin the series for some. For sure a movie for the seasoned anime viewer and being familiar with who the characters are, I'd say not seeing the whole TV show won't take away from seeing this uh...48 minute special.Will you forget the opening scene half way through reminding you that there was some type of space setting? yes. Will the theme song make you pause the movie just so you can go and look it up? Yes. Will it be confusing because you remeber oh yeah Maraich gets PREGNANT in the source material? Maybe, thats up to you. If you are bored, and willing to be a little brain dead for an hour, then honestly it isn't the worst. Plus the Hair makes up for the lack of story (wait, did Patalliro ever have one)?;Mixed Feelings
0;Sotsugyou: Graduation;Saint-Sheepy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Saint-Sheepy;7;"""Do something that you can do...before you try to find something you can do...""Graduation, or Sotsugyou: Graduation, is a partially obscure two part OVA series based on a teaching simulator of the same name, which was released in 1993, whilst the OVA was made in January-February 1995, but it oddly was never released in the US. The game was about five schoolgirls named Reiko, Shizuka, Mami, Mika, and Kiyomi graduating from the Seika Girls' High School. The player played the role of a male high school teacher, where they'd have to try to raise statistics for each girl and be careful to make sure that they had a good balance between work and free time and that they don't flunk out, whilst also featuring stuff like the girls performing in plays and such. It apparently was successful as it spawned sequels, spin-offs, and of course an anime adaptation, which is what we'll be looking at here (Only its sequel, Marriage and a spinoff, Sailor Victory were released here, so only those who saw those two might want to see this).Story:Graduation is split into two episodes, both with different stories. In the first episode, the five girls, finished with their exams and currently on their post exam break, decide to spend it at a hot spring. On the way however, Mami, who seems very sad about something, gets lost and the others have to find her. Will the other girls find Mami and help her out, and what exactly is bothering the green haired goof?In the second episode, round about the time of graduation, the girls feel something is wrong with Reiko, which turns out to be that her businessman father wants her to marry a man from another business, and whilst Mika, Kiyomi, Mami and Shizuka have decided what they want to do in the future, Reiko has not and is stressed about it. What will happen when she meets the man, will her friends help her out, and will she be able to set her future, the step after graduating from high school?Both episodes are simple, slice of life stories, nothing spectacular, but still enjoyable. with decent pacing and use of subplots in between that hint at what the characters want to do (Mika for example wants to step up and become head of her father's cafe but had already sent in an application to be a physical education teacher), but the biggest flaws with this series is that they're only half an hour and this show is only two episodes. Why not make more? It would have helped with certain other flaws (which I'll mention below), and to be frank, if they could make so many Graduation games, why not make a Graduation anime series? We could see how the girls met, what their home lives are like, how they interact in school, and what they do when their time's off, going on vacation, celebrating holidays...It's a flaw I find with OVAs like this, why not make more than two episodes? These feel like the conclusion to an anime that was never aired. Despite that though, I enjoyed the stories, it might not have meant to be a deep, epic, exciting story like you'd see in anime like Sailor Moon, or Spirited Away, for example, just a simple story about students graduating.I also loved that ""Jurassic Parlor"" place Mami mentioned, I'm sure we all know what they were thinking...Art/Animation:The art and animation are 90's anime art, and may be considered dated by some people. However, it is actually beautiful, matching on par of what OVAs tend to look like (having higher budgets than TV show anime). The backgrounds are very pretty, detailed, brightly colored and a treat for the eyes, I especially liked the motorcyclist poster in Kiyomi's garage. The characters are also well drawn, sharp, and all have their own unique hairstyles and look good (though Kiyomi kinda looks like Rei/Sailor Mars from Sailor Moon) and the animation is fluid and smooth.Warning to some people who don't like fanservice, at the end of the first episode there is some partially graphic nudity with the girls in the hot springs.Sound/Music:(This was seen in Japanese with English subtitles as despite an English dub being mentioned, it is practically impossible to find)The voice acting in here was excellent, with each voice actor putting in great emotion for each character. Some famous seiyuu also took the spotlight here, with Hiromi Tsuru (Chameleon June/Mermaid Thetis from Saint Seiya, Bulma from the Dragon Ball franchise) as Kiyomi, Yumi Touma (En from Sailor Moon R and the Kisenian from the Sailor Moon R Movie) as Reiko, and especially Aya Hisakawa (Ami Mizuno/Sailor Mercury from the Sailor Moon franchise, Kero from Cardcaptor Sakura) as Shizuka (whose dream of being a vet is interesting considering Ami wanted to be a doctor).The music was good, beautiful, catchy, heartwarming, but felt a bit bittersweet, as graduating and having to leave your friends is a very conflicting time, it is good to move on your own path and achieve your goals, but it is very sad to leave your friends, and it may be hard for you to meet them again or come in contact with them...The ending song used here was nice, as all five girls sing about graduating, though it would have been nice to hear the original song from the original video game this is based on.Also the sound quality was pretty good. It was clear, not muffled or garbled.Characters:The characterization is more simple compared to other anime like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Saint Seiya, or Yu-Gi-Oh!, but it is easy to tell what the characters' personalities are like and they do have characters. Kiyomi is sly, a bit cold, more reserved, and not interested in school, going so far as to skip it once. Shizuka is quiet and kind. Reiko is lady-like and tries to make things suit what she believes fit her. Mika is happy-go-lucky and always tries to help her friends, and Mami is an adorable goofball who refers to herself in third-person. The minor characters also have a bit of character; the fathers we see here are strict but want the best for their daughters.The problem with the characters though, is the writers chose to make this anime rely on plot over characters, so most of the characters don't undergo any development (which is the problem with the two episode format). The only character who really seemed to have any development here was Reiko as she talks about her problems with Takei, the guy she was asked to marry, and is then able to solve her problem. Shizuka unfortunately seemed to feel the least developed out of all of them, but she and Kiyomi did eventually develop and we saw more of what they were like in Marriage, the sequel to this OVA.And once again, I must bring this up, whilst the characters are entertaining here, why not just make a Graduation anime series, which would develop the characters, and then maybe place the two episodes at the end?Overall:Graduation is a decent, enjoyable anime and I liked it, though there are better anime out there with better stories and characters. With that said, I can only recommend this anime to certain anime fans: those who know what graduation is like, those who like schoolgirls, and those who like simple slice of life anime or OVAs like this.If you're interested in any of those types of anime or you came here after hearing of/seeing Sailor Victory or Marriage, then I'd recommend giving this a shot, otherwise, stay far, far away.""A separation will come to everyone, and there will be many more in the future. But the important thing is to remember the feelings of the moment, isn't it?""";Recommended
0;Ore wa Teppei;EternityOfPain;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EternityOfPain;8;"Ore wa Teppei is a fantastic series about Teppei and his journey as a kid who grow up in the mountain followed by his interactions with school, family, and society as a whole. The first quarter of the series (up to around episode 12) focuses more on Teppei and his father and his life on the mountain and with the local school.The last 16 episodes (from episode 12 on) focus more on his kendo training and his interactions with the kendo club members. Its interesting to note that Teppei has a natural ability to being able to play any sport very well. This is most likely due to the fact that he was raised on a mountain.I did feel the series was cut short, the ending is solid, but this series could have easily been twice as long. This series should not be taken seriously, and those who are looking for &quot;real&quot; kendo with a serious plot, I highly recommend you checking out musashi no ken for a better depiction of kendo life. This has some real aspects of kendo, but there are alot of things that simply dont happen in real life.The series as a whole is very enjoyable seeing Teppei and the crazy stunts he pulls on various people throughout the show. So if your in the mood for a comedy series, that revolves around kendo, definitely check this series out.";Recommended
0;DušaN;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;8;I’m really baffled by the very low score of this one, to the point that I do not understand at all why would someone think it deserves such a low rating. It’s because DušaN is one of the best music video-type anime I’ve seen.First, there is direction and animation by Kousuke Sugimoto, who again created an experimental animation that is just bliss to look at, and a welcomed break from generic style and character design that more ordinary anime tend to have. The surreal visuals greatly accompany the story, for reasons that would be a spoiler.It is exactly the story at which DušaN excels above most music videos – as most music videos don’t even have something that could be fully considered a story. DušaN on the other hand manages to deliver idea, story and a plot twist that is better what some tv anime do with full-length tv episodes. I would certainly suggest watching this with subtitles (which do exist).Lastly, the music by Saténové ruky (which is practically also what stands behind the story of this music video) is catchy and even now I still hum it from time to time, although if you really dislike the genre I can not guarantee you will enjoy the song the same as me.Overall, since it’s just few minutes long just go and watch it.;Recommended
0;Onyankopon;Chesed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Chesed;1;"Let me start out by saying that I'm not one to default to being biased towards children's media or 3D animation. One of my favorite shows of all time is children's media that utilizes 3D animation.However, there is a certain bar of quality one needs to hit. Either the 3D animation needs to be actually good, or at least passable, or the story needs to be good enough to make up for the animation. Onyankopon fails on all fronts in this regard. And unfortunately, when your show is shorts, that tends to kill it, badly.On top of the generally hideous, poorly done animation that involves such delights as the hair clipping upwards randomly when connecting too much with a character's arm, content actually gets reused. In fact, one of the running gags of the series is just to repeat the same thing over and over again to attempted humorous effect. Sadly, it doesn't make it enjoyable. Somehow, hearing the same four girls yell the same thing out multiple times in a row doesn't make me laugh.I get it. Not everything that a kid would find funny is something I, as an adult, can find funny. But that's where another issue comes in. This show is clearly aimed at young children, but the jokes are aimed at tweens-younger teens, who are not going to laugh at these jokes or waste their time on the series in the first place. Children aren't going to think these jokes are funny because they'll likely go over their head. The jokes that aren't obviously aimed at tweens come off as boring and crude at best.About the only thing that's remotely enjoyable about the show is the random music number thrown in near the end of each episode, as the background music for some of the songs is quite nice. This is again, ruined by repetition, because the characters can't stop singing ""Onyankopon."" The lyrics that aren't the name of the main character/show are nonsense lyrics about what the writers clearly think young girls think about, which they don't. Nobody does. None of the problems presented are real.Speaking of characters, I remember the name of exactly one character. Can you guess who? Surely not the character who gets his name said at least twenty times an episode, half of which by himself. The four girls that are in this show probably had names. I've already forgotten, and I'm writing this review right after watching the show. If they were meant to be memorable, they weren't. They don't even have different personalities beyond the girl wearing glasses kind of appearing to be the ""smart and calm"" stereotype. The other three just blend.I can't even recommend this in the sense of ""it's so bad it's funny,"" because it's not. It's just incredibly dull, unfunny, and badly animated to the point of being insulting. Huge avoid. This isn't even something to throw on for the children to watch.";Not Recommended
1;Onyankopon;Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;4;"If you're ever thought to scroll past the popular shows of each season to look at the lower scored offerings nobody watched; chances are you'll see at least one weird looking CGI or Flash animated show that makes you rapidly ask “Why is this?” A small cottage industry of sorts has sprung up in the last decade or so, producing a small but fairly regular number of these mostly ONAs; mostly about girls doing things. While it would be wrong to claim there was one starting point or one man responsible; if you trace the links back far enough from many of them you'll find the 2011 show Gdgd Fairies & its director Souta Sugahara.Seeing Souta's name attached to Onyakopon explains a lot. In it, a cat god, allegedly from West Africa, sort of but doesn't really help a group of Japanese high school girls with their girl problems. Each episode mostly follows a set routine of something happening in the god world; something similar happens in the girl world; they do a musical number that sort of relates to the issue; then the issue resolves itself. It looks like a low budget, short edutainment show for young children; & the involvement of Toonz Entertainment (part of the animation outsourcing monolith that, among many things, churns out a some of those seemingly computer generated cartoons for babies flooding Youtube) only furthers the impression that this is meant to be a cheap attempt at a Japanese Octonauts, or something similar.But like many of these shows, one is left more with the impression that this is a parody of children's TV made by & for men who, for various reasons, have to plan their travels to avoid being near schools. The subjects of each episode & the general way the characters converse all leave the impression that the writer's main source of information about high school girls is Lucky Star. Indeed, one of the background tracks sounds rather similar to the one that plays in the back of a lot of that shows conversations. The songs only add to the impression that this some weird experiment to see what men think girls are like, with themes like: “Please, god, don't make my face look fat!” & “I need the toilet; come with?”Yet there's an appeal to a lot of these types of shows that Onyankopon is lacking. A key feature of Gdgd Fairies & its ilk is that the actresses will eventually go off-script &/or break character; which is where a lot of the humour comes from. The scripted conversations in this one are pretty dull & there's no time for things to get weird or go wrong. Nor does the short runtime & regimented, episodic structure leave any space for anything like a narrative or plot line to be developed; or for characters to form something one might confuse for individual personalities. In a weird way, the show is also too well produced for its own good, lacking the amateurishness that somehow adds to the charm of a lot of these shows.In short, Onyankopon is just kinda boring. Some moments, like when a black guy's head suddenly appears in one episode to comment on what the girls are doing, liven it up a bit; & I'm sure the singers who voice the girls & do the end song will appreciate the exposure; but I struggle to see what the point of this all was. If it's meant to be one of those parody series, there are plenty of better ones out there (Tesagure! Bukatsumono is probably the best of them). If it really was sincerely meant for children, then the gods' have punished us with something much worse than a fat head.";Not Recommended

1;Yuki;towelgirl21;https://myanimelist.net/profile/towelgirl21;7;"""Yuki: Snow Fairy"" is a movie I stumbled on by accident. I liked the poster, so I watched it.The story is simple: a 13-year-old snow maiden gets sent down from heaven by her grandparents to go help a village with its problems, namely bandits, war, and everything else that comes with being peasants in feudal Japan. She has one year to fix this mess or else she'll turn into ""a dark wind without form who spends all eternity wailing"". What unfolds after she goes to earth is very much like a fairytale, and is a ""good vs. evil story"" with a big climax.I was continuously in awe of the art. It has that classic 80's style, but is very high-quality and consistent. Horses are notoriously hard to animate, and ""Yuki"" does it very well. Since Yuki's snow white steed Fubuki is a prominent part of the action, that's very important. ""Yuki"" looks like it cost a fortune to make.The sound could be better, mainly the soundtrack. I would have played more dramatic music during some scenes to amp up the tension. The final few battles had a good score behind them, and there are one or two nice inset songs about Yuki.As for characters, Yuki herself is nearly static, but she takes action near the end. She's mainly a source of inspiration for the beggars and villagers she befriends. They're likable characters, and it doesn't take long to start rooting for them.I enjoyed the movie, but it took a while to get through. It didn't hold my attention that well, so I watched it in parts over several days.Overall, I give ""Yuki: Snow Fairy"" a 7/10, well worth watching if you want to see some classic animation where good guys fight bad guys with a really nice climax.There's some bloody violence (people get stabbed, a few even die) but it's meant for a family audience.";Recommended
0;Rinkaku;ProfaneValkyrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProfaneValkyrie;6;"This is a review of an AMV with the song Rinkaku made by the band Dir En Grey (an experimental Japanese metal band).I consider this AMV being one which compliments the song and not the other way around therefore i will not focuse on the lack of ""plot"" and other things otherwise if it had been the other way around.This one is kind of special, it is made purely by traditional pencil work which gives it a very special artistic feel to it and which contributes to the dark feeling of this song. The song itself when translated is a bittersweet somewhat dark song which has a nice melancholy feel to it without being too much. The video itself does not have that much of an plot but being a symbol of the meaning of the song.You might not like it for its experimental metal music and also the artistic use of pencil.

Indofood itself is the largest instant noodle producer in the world with 16 factories. Over 15 billion packets of Indomie are produced annually. Indomie is also exported to more than 90 countries around the world.Instant noodles were introduced into the Indonesian market in 1969.[5] Indofood is one of Indonesia's largest pre-packaged food companies which was founded in 1982 by Sudono Salim, an Indonesian tycoon who also owned Bogasari Flour Mills.The Indomie instant noodle brand was first produced in 1972[6] by PT Sanmaru Food Manufacturing Co. Ltd. with the Indomie Kuah Rasa Kaldu Ayam (chicken stock) flavour and followed by the Indomie Kuah Rasa Kari Ayam (chicken curry) flavour in 1980. In 1982, PT Sanmaru Food launched its first dry variant (served without soup), Indomie Mi Goreng, which quickly became popular in the Indonesian market.[5]In 1984, PT Sanmaru Food was acquired by PT Sarimi Asli Jaya, which was owned by Bogasari flour mills, before they merged into PT Indofood Sukses Makmur Tbk in 1994. Indomie accounted for around 70 per cent of the instant noodle market in Indonesia in 2010.[7]Indomie won several awards including the Lausanne Index Prize (L.I.P.), Indonesia Best Brand Award (IBBA), the Most Effective Ad award, the Indonesia Consumer Satisfaction Award (ICSA), and the Indonesia Best Packaging Award;Recommended
0;Melody;starshinesMonet;https://myanimelist.net/profile/starshinesMonet;6;"I thought the mechanics of this short were nicely done, notably the use of the projection to denote precious memories and the idea that time has run out. I am rather keen on old things, so Yamamoto's decision to give this anime the feel of old film really worked its magic on me.I especially liked filtering of the light and lines on grainy film aspects, as well as the fading memory at the piano with the transistion to an empty village square (to be extremely honest AND picky I thought the transistion itself was a little clunky, but I liked the thought behind it) and Tamamoto's favourite faceless crowds. With all these rabbits and faceless crowds, I wonder if Yamamoto-san isn't quietly enduring some pain of his own as it seems to be a reoccurring theme.I actually became somewhat bored by this film after the first five minutes, because Yamamoto seems to be pretty much a one trick pony. His music doesn't inspire me and neither does the animation, however the art work is nice and the mechanics used are sometimes rather lovely.I wanted to give him a 7 for the effort and the nice aged filmy bits, but then the story just went on and on and it wasn't told in a markedly unique way nor did I find it touching. I suspect this was due to the music, which as with Anemone, was nice but not in the truly pleasant way, just in a ""it was nice/ok/blah"" way. I know that sounds harsh and I hope he keeps working at it because he has some good ideas and clever mechanics which have the potential to become something great; I just don't feel this is it.";Mixed Feelings

0;Yuukai Anna;oppligerfj;https://myanimelist.net/profile/oppligerfj;7;Independent animator Kaichi Sato & Studio Deen’s CG short film Yuukai Anna will inevitably polarize viewers depending partially on viewers’ familiarity with cinema nostalgia. The movie contains several references to the 1967 classic film The Graduate but moreover is inspired by the French New Wave. The movie seeks to condense and elevate a chic, aloof, existential coolness that directors including Truffaut, Godard, and Chabrol propagated. The entire point of the short film is cinema for the sake of cinema. Shots are deliberately composed with an emphasis on visual appearance and costume design, on color theme, and editing. The narrative is abstract, revolving around the uncertainty of the nature and longevity of love and loneliness. Like the films of the French New Wave, the movie is meant to be taken as an atmospheric and aesthetic experience more than as a literal, realistic narrative. The use of CG further elevates the film into the realm of stylistic abstraction in which order and sameness, represented by the ex-girlfriends, the police, and the blind, is contrasted with rebellion and revolution in the form of Anna. And the two forces are manipulated by the Professor who visually appears uniform with the former group but psychologically sides with the later forces.;Recommended
0;Yuukai Anna;BiggRed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BiggRed;1;"I wouldn't normally write a review warning others not to watch an anime, but this twenty-six minute ""movie"" got me so worked up I was yelling at my computer, appalled at the incoherent mess in front of me.If you can get past the bland, colorless world and poor animation, you will soon find that Yuukai Anna's appearance is far from the worst thing about it.Our protagonist, Anna, is a notorious kidnapper and the anime opens with her on her motorcycle busting through a stained glass window high above the altar of a packed church as a man and woman are about to seal the deal. This is where the red flags started going up for me as shards of glass are flying everywhere and nobody suffers so much as a scratch. Immediately she's riding out the church front door with the groom's hands bound on the back of her bike. The congregation meanwhile is screaming and running outside in fear EVEN THOUGH ANNA JUST LEFT as though the church were on fire (which it's not).We're supposed to believe Anna was able to land safely, park her bike, get off, overpower the groom, bind his hands, force him somehow to sit down and stay still long enough for her to get back on the bike and ride out of the church all without the bride or a single attendee attempting to stop her. At any time the groom could just hop off and run away before the bike gained too much speed, foiling the whole premise of this show.The rest of the show is just as baffling as the intro. The story makes no sense, the art is hard to look at when it's not comedically bad. There is some pleasant jazz but most of the show does nothing interesting audibly.The characters and their motivations are entirely incoherent, and there is no joy to be gained from watching this except from 9:32 where Anna makes a really funny facial expression.1/10 since MAL can't go lower.";Not Recommended
1;Yuukai Anna;ktsumagari;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktsumagari;4;It's a rather short yet baffling movie. If you can get past it being CGI (which can make or break it for you, if you can take it it's fine, but it's more than understandable if you find it ugly, I feel the faces make it work for me, more because of taste since they're also not very expressive), it has some nice palettes throughout, with very lush lighting in some segments that is the reason why the CGI field is so promising in the first place, it's a short, a little bit spicy and confusing ride of an unlikely couple. The characters have some potential were they to be explored outside of this movie, but it ends in what's possibly the most what in the goddamn way imaginable. I won't spoil it, but I honestly have no idea what kinda payoff they wanted us to have coming out of it.I didn't hate it, it's not the worst thing ever and it could've had a lot of potential, but instead it's just a confusing little piece. Probably wouldn't recommend it unless you're a bored completionist like me.;Not Recommended
2;Yuukai Anna;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;1;"Yuukai Anna is an original short film from Studio Deen. It was released in 2018, so a pretty recent offering from them. Deen is one of those studios that's difficult to predict the quality of, because their output is so varied in terms of quality. So, let's just jump into it.Story: We open with a wedding. It's quickly interrupted by a woman crashing in on her motorcycle and taking the groom away. We learn that this is Anna, a woman known for doing kidnappings for people. First off, why hasn't she been arrested? The authorities know what she looks like. She, apparently, does this all the time. She in no way disguises herself and she's open to the point where she did a television interview. You might think that egregious lack of logic is the worst part of the film. It's not. Most of the film follows Anna as she converses with this bloke she's kidnapped. And the pair of them talk like they're idiots who are trying to sound smart and just wind up spewing bollocks. If I wanted to watch a moron spewing bollocks while trying to look smart, I'd watch select political speeches. The film also features a ""big moment"" where the kidnap victim is confronted by his past that spits in the face of logic just as badly as Anna being free. The ending is complete bullshit. To the point where I yelled something that best translates to ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" when I got to that part. Characters:The characters are ceaselessly obnoxious and their dynamic is complete rubbish. Even limiting themselves to two characters who actually matter and putting a huge spotlight on them apparently wasn't enough for them to make characters who were complex, interesting or endearing to any degree.I mean, I've seen other anime that can manage at least a degree of that in twenty minutes, this one just fails. Art:The art can be summed up as exceptionally low quality, no effort rubbish CG art. You can never quite tell what emotional state they're trying to express. Honestly, there are Flash animations that look much better than this and were made by a thirteen year old after school just because they were bored. The backgrounds are lacklustre. The driving sequences are visually unappealing and uninteresting. It's just awful. Sound: If you want to hear Takeda Anna and Morikawa Toshiyuki put in zero effort and generally provide all the energy and emotion of reading a phone book out loud, you'll be happy with the acting in this. Also, why would you ever want that?Frankly, these two are too good for their performances here. We have the voice of Sephiroth and... Deneve from Claymore. Yes, even the more inexperienced actor who doesn't have all that many roles to choose from is still far too good for this. The music is the best part of the film because it's just weak and not outright rubbish. Ho-yay:I would prefer if people who can't write character relationships well just stay away from ho-yay, which they did here. At least that's something. Areas of Improvement:1. if you're going to base an entire short film on discussing a topic like love, have something complex or at the very least a bit interesting to say about it. Don't just drop a load of rubbish dialogue that's roughly equivalent to audible diarrhoea. 2. Have something going for your characters. Anna and the Professor have no complexity, no interesting characteristics and no redeeming qualities whatsoever. 3.Have some basic logic. Because in twenty six minutes, this film has three huge, nonsensical points. If you just want the dialogue without worrying about thinking or writing a coherent plot, you can just have them stand by a tree or something.Final Thoughts:This is easily among the worst films I've reviewed. The plot is nonsense. The dialogue is imbecilic. The characters are rubbish. The art is terrible. The acting is zero effort. We had a good run of quality with this year's films, but this one is clearly an exception. I'm giving it a 1/10. If you like listening to conversations between dumb people who are trying to sound deep and philosophical, this one is for you. For anyone else, I can't recommend it. ";Not Recommended
0;Fantasista Stella;ShadowJackal35;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShadowJackal35;7;There aren't any reviews for this anime and I honestly enjoyed it a lot, so I guess I'll give my brief opinion.Fantastisa Stella is a 3 episode sports anime featuring soccer (or football if you aren't American) and it has all the basic elements to make a sports anime, but it didn't have the time. There are only 3 episodes so ~60 minutes to get a whole tournament and if you know anything about anything about sports anime, it's this: one tournament usually equals about 5-6 episodes. 3 minimum if they're really trying to be fast. (laugh) So unfortunately, FS did not have this luxury and the competition is cut short to just the bare bone.Despite this however, I really enjoyed watching it. I thought the music was great, the cast was likable, and there's that element of un-realism that most sports anime possess that is somehow really enjoyable, and I would have liked to see these characters more because I thought there was a lot of potential. There was a good dynamic, all things aside, and it's too bad despite its low score.I dunno, man. I shit talk a lot, but I really have nothing against the show.Story - 7 (Good)Art - 7 (Good)Sound - 8 (Very Good)Character - 7 (Good)Enjoyment - 8 (Very Good)Overall - 7.5 (Good);Recommended

0;Jiu Tian Xuan Di Jue;drinfantom;https://myanimelist.net/profile/drinfantom;8;I think this anime should really get some more attention. The animation could use some work, the fight scenes really aren't that great. Some of the character's lines and animations were hilariously awkward.Despite all of that, I really enjoyed the anime. This anime started off kinda rocky but the storyline turned out to be pretty engaging. The MC's effort to disguise himself but still put on displays of his total mental and martial dominance carry on throughout the whole season. He casually crushes martial geniuses like they are newborn babes. He casually just utters words of wisdom that change the whole situation on the battlefield or answers questions that were almost rhetorical because most people wouldn't possibly know the answer. I think the studio maybe rushed the storyline a little bit but it doesn't even matter because the MC is so charismatic and unassuming but inclined to demonstrate his dominance when it counts that I can look right past it.Overall this anime definitely could have been better but at the same time I would absolutely recommend giving it a watch.;Recommended
0;Jiu Tian Xuan Di Jue;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;4;"The success of Empyrean Xuan Emperor is a story where Wang Fan, a commoner student at Yuan Wen Liao Academy encounters the Empyrean Xuan Emperor's Knack after investigating his older brother's death. It is said, the holder of this Emperor's Knack will become the successor to Empyrean Xuan Emperor. The Knack increases cultivation levels which allows Wang Fan to break the human barrier of cultivation (Golden Martial God Stage 5) Currently, at 16-19 years old Wang Fan reaches Peak Stage 2 or even Early Stage 3 but hides his powers to catch his brother's killer. Wang Fan makes an incognito persona called Silver Tiger King to investigate his brother's death. His brother's killer is found and executed along with the killer's family which puts Wang Fan's mind at ease but the different races are now involved with the human race and the Silver Tiger King. Furthermore, the more the story progresses the more willing other clans are to join hands with the demons and warmonger races to fight the humans and Silver Tiger King which pressures Wang Fan to cultivate peerlessly.Story: 4/10This story is just aimless. None of the events hold real meaning in this story, all we as a viewer needs to know is that Silver Tiger King is more powerful than the demons and warmongers and other smaller clans and the more the story progresses the more impossible it is to take down Wang Fan. The entire premise of this story is for the characters to underestimate Wang Fan's ability and what is set aside as progress is just characters from the demon race or other clans dying left and right because they underestimated Wang Fan's plot armor. Every few episodes, it feels like we are briefly introduced to a new character that wants to fight Silver Tiger King because of some random grudge in the past but when they get to fighting they change their minds and another person intervenes in the fights to fight Silver Tiger King. It's an endless cycle of circle jerking antagonists. Especially toward the end of each so-called 'arc' where Wang Fan leaves the Academy/City/Pavilion to explore the next location without a established goal, this series is bad because it lacks purpose after the Academy arc.Art & Sound: 5/10Poorly timed background music and poorly rigged character animation, it's no wonder this series hasn't reached 500 users after it's completion. Even with the best character design, animation and suspenseful sound design it would be hard for this series to get more users interested with the atrocious story and characters.Character: 4/10The characters in this series lack motivation and personalities; Many of them especially antagonists exist for Wang Fan's cheap character development and aren't focused on when they leave the frame. In the case an antagonist isn't eliminated, they usually are saved by their masters which further delays the story and when it happens several times in the span of this short season, it can be very frustrating to watch. When Wang Fan isn't fighting his enemies, he usually just lets them loiter in the background waiting to catch him off-guard and when they do, there's no suspense or meaningful development since the antagonists are likely small-fry dispensable characters. We also see a lot of running scenes where Wang Fan flees from danger only to discover something more dangerous and flee from that (the bloodthirsty bats, the goat that walks on water and literally all the smaller demon clans in the forest he's in during that arc)One of the worst aspects in character occurs when the characters somehow don't suspect Wang Fan to be the mysterious Silver Tiger King despite practicing spear-play, being the proxy and grinding his cultivation in seclusion - Only 1 character managed to piece his hidden personality and they were forgotten after Wang Fan left the Academy. This characters feel very vaguely introduced and have 1 dimensional, superficial personalities.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10This was one of the worst series to be adapted in the Donghua industry for 2021. Not only did the story lack any milestone goals but it also had some very empty characters. The series is getting heavy praise by eastern audiences from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam etc. but I just don't see eye to eye with their experience of the show.

While a future will exist no matter what we do why doesn't always have to be so futuristic. I often what at time how many people like myself exist. Who care wholeheartedly about the past in some retrospects. Sure certain advancements can be made like computers but in the end is it really worth it? I have heard entire buildings torn down over a single design flaw. Or restaurants close over not meeting a new code. Is the future meant to help us or hurt us.That is why i enjoyed this anime. The name they went is a perfect depiction of those feelings of love of the old and dislike by others. While the building is fictitious along with all other elements the amount of passion this main character feels towards keeping the structure alive is amazing. So, amazing that i felt the same feelings burn with in me.Sure one could create a nice clean cut show or spend a lot of money but if you can have a show make an emotional connection to the viewer that is a show worth watching.Unfortunately some drawbacks here are the show was short. Also, the show missed out the chance to provide some background for the other characters.

An old building on the school grounds is scheduled to be demolished, and the boys are hired to clean it out beforehand. They discover that a group of spirits led by a fairy named Saki is living in, and essentially tied to, the building. This is where the OVA gets its title -- the fairies are the ""heart"" of the ""antique"" building. If the building gets demolished, they disappear. The club members decide to start a petition to prevent the building's demolition, and the story continues to unfold from there. There is a nice 10-minute interview between the director and the mangaka afterwards, where we also see some behind the scenes with the voice actors, etc.The animation wasn't that great, but serviceable. The designs for the main characters in particular were nice, though most of the other characters looked rather generic. The music is OK, but not memorable. Voices aren't bad, but there are some awkward pauses in conversations sometimes. As I said, the plot was straightforward, and wrapped up cleanly enough, but the runtime was so short that a lot of the development felt rushed. Not to mention that we don't get to learn much of anything about the main characters' background, personalities, etc. This feels like the pilot to a TV series that never got greenlit.A decent watch, but don't expect anything profound out of it.

0;Kawa no Hikari;novahyou;https://myanimelist.net/profile/novahyou;10;"Note: This review was written by me both on my blog and in an anime-related forum. So if you see this somewhere else, it's actually me trying to make this film more well-known.This last weekend I had the opportunity to watch the tv movie Kawa no Hikari. In a nutshell, the story is about rats that live near a river and must find a new home cause the current one is threatened by a construction site.......if ANYONE is still reading this after that synopsis and is able to deal with watching a show about talking animals in a serious mood, it's a WONDERFUL story. I mean, almost EVERY minute in this movie is relevant to some kind of reflection upon life: what it's like to yearn for something, how ""home"" is not a physical place but something that is part of you and no matter how good you feel in another place, you can never forget that; how you should rarely judge a book by its cover (interestingly enough, it is done both ways: there are ppl that may seem the same as you on the outside but you cannot put your trust in them); the fact that when you're a parent you're willing to do any stunt or sacrifice to assure your chirldren's well-being, how being different or weak is not a bad thing if you have the right ppl around you; how we should not feel so afraid of death but more willing to actually live; how you should not quit from pursuing your goals, etc etc. It even has some very poetic lines regarding the title (the light of the river); I think a lot of it (the story) works as a metaphor or analogy of many ideas, and even when most of it is pretty simple, or precisely because it doesn't try to feel complex, it works and makes you care as long as you do not have a heart made of stone or require highly realistic stories. With this one, I did some research and it turns out the original author teaches in an University in Tokyo and has a degree in French Literature. IMO I think it shows in the screenplay.I should clarify that I'm an adult and can be quite skeptical or even cynical regarding some movies; I didn't enjoy some of Miyazaki's works (probably because in a couple of cases he tries too hard to hamfist his love for nature into his stories) and I'm not precisely a huge fan of Disney or fables with morals.Having said that, I dunno why this beautiful yet apparently simple story did it for me while others didn't. Maybe it was because I felt a connection with Glenn's (a character) personality ( that notion of ""knowing that there is more to life than what you're doing but you weren't born with the right mindset to achieve it""), maybe because sometimes I need a story about nice human values and I want a break from all the sci-fi, seinen, shonen or whatever...maybe it's because I like animals...I can't pinpoint just one reason.But if I can make at least ONE person to give it a try (while knowing that indeed it's aimed at all ages and it doesn't feature big action sequences, moe or gore) and LIKE IT (or GASP, even making a thread about it or recommend it to someone), I would honestly feel happy. In the end, I guess I decided to make such a long post about Kawa no Hikari because I feel that if I don't, no one will.I don't have kids yet...but if I did, this is one of those movies I would want to see with them (specially to make up for the fact of forcing them to see the gundam movie trilogym, the rebuild of eva movies or many more). I don't want to make it sound like it's the best thing I've ever seen, but I do prefer to overrate it than not mentioning it at all.Thanks in advance to anyone that manages to read through all of my rambling.";Recommended
0;Yami Shibai: Furuido;MoonSpider;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MoonSpider;6;"So... this is pretty odd.First and foremost, this special is at a disadvantage compared to reviews of the series for each individual season. When you review a show like this season by season, it is more often than not just about the general vibe from popcorn-watching these shorts, just binging a full hour or more with this anthology. If one story doesn't appeal to you, then you can see if the next one in a couple minutes is more your speed. If all of them were just ok and none stood out to you, then you could just cozy up with the vibes and start playing the next season. At least, that's how I've approached this show until now.This individual special was something of a chore to find, too. I did way too much deep-diving amongst the more""alternative"" methods of streaming before realizing that it was wedged in the middle of last season on Crunchyroll, lol. Thanks, guys. OVA or specials like this don't warrant a different category? Anyway...The story was mid. Was ok. Not great, not awful. Somewhat reminiscent of the Ring. What I found most distracting was the video format, as its aspect ratio is, in my mind's eye, somewhat similar to that of a TikTok video. Or a webtoon. Just very vertical-oriented, in contrast to the typical format for the rest of the series.I don't know if there are any other concrete reasons behind this choice, though I admit I can kind of see from an artistic standpoint how the more elongated view parallels that of the well, but... the internet ruined such a format, in my opinion, to be anything but a manner or vertical recording, as that's how my mind seems determined to interpret it. The effect is somewhat lost and just sadly becomes more jarring, and not in the good way.Other than that though, well... another Yami Shibai episode.";Mixed Feelings
0;Mahoutsukai Sally 2;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;I assume everyone is already familiar with the series, premise and characters and what makes them great when it comes to Mahoutsukai Sally as this is the reboot/sequel series. So I'll be talking about what stands out when compared to the original series.Firstly the most noticeable difference is the art, the original series had the 60s art and animation where the movement was emphasised at points. This series on the other hand shares the 80s darker visual atmosphere with softer character design and overall strokes are smoother. I'd say that the darker visual atmosphere is visually better looking though the characters have different emphasis when compared to original. I wouldn't call that bad or good necessarily its just different.Now the voice acting definitely is not as good as it was in the original Sally in particular feeling lot more soft and matured as far as her voice is concerned, the cheeky vibe is also toned down and her voice has this kind vibe instead. I enjoyed the og interpretation of her character more personally but the new one is not bad necessarily it's just different. Same kind of changes can be observed from other characters too though those changes didn't impact me as much.It is not just the voice that was toned down feels like Sally as a character was kinda toned down, her magic was not as all powerful as in og some new rules were introduced in this series which I think made the concept of magic that was interesting in the original series not as interesting in this series. Though overall I'd say that it didn't impact my enjoyment much as the interaction between characters and the character dynamics that made the original series one of my favorites didn't change that much considering that Sally and some others felt bit toned down.Overall ompared to the original series I'd say that it is visually impressive series with great visual atmosphere doing those aspects arguably better than the original, but falling bit short on some other areas.;Recommended

As for the main story it is unclear. What is clear is that there are 5 main characters. Three of which seem to be used as mere transition in bringing forwards a new story. As for the other two there purpose is unclear. If i did not know any better i would say the terminator with the popular, ""i will be back"" saying is bases for this show. Now, the terminator like character does not say the saying but it sure does look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in cartoon form. The main difference between this and the terminator franchise is that this is more of sex action vs gun action. Sounds like a neat idea. Although, it's portrayal could have been improved greatly.Art-refering back to censorship. You will note watching that there are some side viewed sex action that is blurred although even if it was unblured you would not see anything worth while. Mainly because the camera is shooting the scene from the side not from the front or back. Now, i am unsure if it was intended as a joke but the censorship was pointless. You may think i am refering back to what i am saying but i am not, mostly. There were far more background, 'background' moments that had more sexual substance than the sex scenes shown. Not only that but they were uncensored. How is that for ironic? I am guessing it was art form of an F' you to japan's censorship law. If that was the case well done(claps).-Some art choice styles they did had some flaws. Such as the fast forward icon that you would see on a remote control. Which kind of makes you wonder if you are seeing the entire movie at the right speed or the film in its entirety. Aside from that fear it was a interesting idea. Then there was a close up block out in the introduction on the first technology shown. Meaning mostly the background that was not technology related was blocked out like someone passing you by in the movie theaters as you are trying to watch the movie. Lastly. was the moment towards the end where they did a multiple copy and paste segment that had no purpose.Sound- no issuescharacters-unclear to what their purpose was for some of them. As for the ones that you could figure out like the scientist their action choices were bizarre. Such as magical disrobing after any creation.Overall: interesting spin on terminator with sex action play but too confusing to follow. Not only that but this particular style seems very similar to another hentai anime called hooligan for its use in wacky symbolic censorship.";Mixed Feelings
0;Singles;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;6;God bless the aesthetic of early 90s OVAs which are lucky to survive as digital transfers of the VHS tape.This anime one-shot is a touch slow, but it's a complete story that's affecting if you're into 90s-era shoujo at all. Most of the episode is structured around one-on-one conversations about the characters' feelings and there's not too much of a conflict because the problem at hand is the main character's *perception* of a conflict. She doesn't want to be selfish, but there's nothing actually standing in her way because the problematic relationship is already over. Understanding that things do not necessarily last forever is an important part of growing up, and I liked the ways the characters came to realizations of that effect.It's not deep or lavishly animated. It's not complex or notable. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable.;Mixed Feelings

0;Tanpen Unico: Kuroi Kumo to Shiroi Hane;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;6;Leave it to the Japanese to balance out joy with sorrow, almost comparable to some Greek tragedy (which is only fitting given the origin of the character). Poor little Unico is forever cursed. He has the mysterious power to magically make people happy, yet as soon as he starts to use his powers, he is whisked away to another place and another time, his memories lost.Set in a town that is terrorized by the fallout of a belching black cloud of death that hangs over it from the nearby factory, Unico is befriended by a bedridden little girl, and it is up to him to save the day. There is a very heavy-handed environmental message here (really beats you over the head with it), but that is somewhat par for the course for the time.While today environmentalism is primarily concerned with global warming and carbon emissions, in the Seventies it was more about the growing threat of runaway pollution. This was the age of Three Mile Island, and of acid rain, and of Superfund cleanup sites, and the Cuyahoga River catching fire (yes, it really did). This was the age of the Lorax and speaking for the trees, and the birth of Earth Day, and the EPA, as people started to speak up. Not only in America, but worldwide. And Unico was part of that, with Tezuka and Sanrio helping to spread the message of the dangers of pollution.Clean, crisp artwork and animation, with an interesting mixture of the cute (Unico and characters) against a depressing background (polluted city). At 25 minutes, it's a short story, and if you like what you see, you can move on to the longer Unico movies after this.;Mixed Feelings

Time to find another member of the MAL bottom 100 and review it! Fortunately, this super obscure hentai doesn't have any reviews yet! I just love being a pioneer!Sexy Esper Manami is about a girl with psychic powers who uses them to see ghosts...and then fuck them. Very poorly drawn ghosts that look like a purple version of Slimer from Ghostbusters. I definitely couldn't watch this shit sober, so I needed to determine the appropriate amount of alcohol for this task. 2 cans Bud? Hell no! A few glasses of wine? Not even close. 3 ounces of Uncle Nearest 1884 recipe, 92 proof whiskey? Perfect.So Manami is stuck in detention for being a dumbass, but there's no teacher in this detention or any other students. That's because the budget for this shit is so low they refused to draw more than 2 characters in the entire hentai. One girl with a character design better fit for a cheap advertisement and our purple blob ghost. Purple ghost rips off his dick and throws it at Manami, but it transforms into an army of Ekans which proceed to lick her all over. That's...interesting I guess. Then the ghost fucks her until she goes insane and bashes her head against the wall until she's knocked out. Then the principal briefly steps in to yell at the ghost and the hentai ends abruptly on this attempt at humor.Since this is a VERY low quality hentai, it never received a dub because even Media Blasters wouldn't touch it. That speaks volumes if you've seen some of the trash those guys licensed. The only entertainment value was thanks to whoever was responsible for the fansubs. I have a good feeling this wasn't an accurate translation. At one point the purple ghost speaks 3 lengthy sentences in Japanese and the English subs simply say ""Woof"" which stays on screen for about 10 seconds.The animation is so bad it actually clicks and drags characters across the screen at several points. It's too cheap to use action lines like a normal low budget anime. That's because this hentai was produced by the same studio that made Girl's Locker Room Lust, which I stated last year was the worst animated hentai I've ever seen. Girl's Locker Room is also in direct competition with Twinkle Nora Rock Me for the worst animated thing I've ever seen period! Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, Manami never reaches a level quite that bad. It's still horse shit, just not 3 frames per second bad.After watching this one, I can honestly say it deserves its place among the bottom 100 worst rated things on MAL. I deeply regret watching it.

But I am not criticizing their dance moves. Absolutely not. I have all the grace and style of a stampeding elephant.

0;Yong Sheng;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;7;Cultivation donghua is dominated by isekai tropes with an arrogant protagonist carrying out a revenge fantasy. So it's a breath of fresh air when we get one with humble origins, who is cautious and has the modicum of self-awareness to stay low profile when the situation demands. Fang Han is a generational slave for the Fang family, tasked to feed and train horses, but sneaks out to watch and imitate the martial artists training in his spare time. He is caught and beat, but he has no time for revenge, since his father impressed upon him at an early age that his only goal should be to buy himself out of slavery. One day while training out in the woods, he runs into a cultivator from a demonic sect who was injured, and seeing than Fang Han is an honest person, with his dying breath the cultivator passes some basic cultivation ability to Fang Han, teaches him how to train, and gives him two legendary artifacts that would help him become strong. He then passes Fang Han his will.Note that moral ambiguity is a common theme in Chinese historic martial arts fantasies, and that demon sects are really just people with unorthodox beliefs labeled by the so-called righteous sects. They are not necessarily demonic, nor evil, just as you could probably imagine, not everyone in a righteous sect is good.While the set up is pretty standard, the strength is in the execution. Being a slave and relying on his wits rather than unlimited knowledge from a previous life makes Fang Han relatable. He does not have ego problems where he has to dominate all his enemies, and while he is a bit naive at first, Fang Han bites his tongue and stands down at times because he knows relying on purely guts and willpower would get him killed -- something that sets him apart from his shounen contemporaries. These are some of the qualities that made A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality (Fanren Xiu Xian Chuan) among the top cultivation donghua, its protagonist was also of modest origins, having been sold as a child to a clan to help feed his parents and sister. Like this other show, Yong Sheng also features a balanced cast of nuanced characters, including the Fang family's eldest prodigious daughter who treats Fang Han like a slave, but at the same time recognizes his talent and gives him opportunities. And also the, of compatriots that Fang Han meets along the way, there are honest ones like potential love interest Hongyi, and also others who would no quicker stab him in the back.It's no secret that cultivation donghua are replete with repetitive tropes, but a good execution helps masks some of the patterns. Some doghua move along the arcs in predictable succession: hunting beasts, an alchemist auction, a contest to see who can hunt more, a tournament arc, rinse and repeat... Shows like Yong Sheng and Mortal's Journey has many of these same tropes, but spends more time in between building the characters and relationships, developing the personalities and elaborating on the social dynamics.It helps that they have superior budget, excellently choreographed fight scenes that don't just look like projectile spamming, and realistic character models and facial expressions. And it's capped off by a moving ballad by Zhu Sang (stage name Tacke) with an old school Chinese vibe that really lends to the show's potential to be a classic.;Recommended
1;Yong Sheng;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"While this donghua is an adaptation of a novel, I have never read the actual source (I've read the manhua which is also an adaptation of the novel), so I will not speak to how well of an adaptation this work is.General Plot: Fang Han, a generational serf of the Fang Clan, wants to fulfill his father's dream of becoming a free person. In order to do this, he secretly watches the clan disciples practice during his free time and trains at night, hoping to establish a strong enough cultivation to break free of his serfdom. During one of his secret nighttime practices, he encounters a dying man (attacked by Fang Qingxue, the eldest young mistress of the Fang Clan for his treasures) who decides to entrust a cultivation pill and demon artifact to him and requests him to rise up and eventually kill Fang Qing Xue. This pill allows him to quickly strengthen his cultivation, attracting Fang QingXue's attention, allowng him to join the sect and beginning his true cultivation journey.One of the main differences this donghua has from most other cultivation donghua is that does not have an OP MC, reincarnator MC, or time-regressor MC; he is an ordinary in-universe person. He is naive and his knowledge on the world matches his background. His character and development are consistant with someone of his status, which is quite unique (for now, also no OP teacher). While this could be considered a rather normal cultivation story with similar goals, his progression, attitude and character make it unique. The only drawback of this is that the season is abit short. The character models, and animations are fluid so that is a huge plus; the action/fighting scenes could use a bit of work though.PS (and possible spoiler): do you really think Hongyi is dead? Yeah right, everything shown after her ""death"" implies she didn't die.";Recommended

0;Na Bbeun Sang Sa;whither;https://myanimelist.net/profile/whither;4;"This is basically a formulaic K-drama with some sex scenes. The plot threads and character cliches fall squarely into all the typical K-drama tropes. You can watch this without knowing any Korean, and still understand the entire plot. In an optimistic sense, this could be a sign of good visual storytelling. In a pessimistic sense, this could just be because everything is incredibly predictable and cliched.I think the main appeal of this movie would be that it's hentai with an attractive male lead. And although he's an absolute asshole, he doesn't rape anyone and can even be romantic at times (even if it's for the sake of manipulation). He's ""tortured"" and promiscuous, and he seduces women who seem pretty happy to have a fling with him. The bar is really on the floor when it comes to female-oriented sex media, or as Bad Boss calls itself, ""femtai"".The movie is also rather plot-heavy - nearly 2 hours long. The sex scenes are quite minor in comparison to just how much plot is crammed in, actually. It's just that every part of the plot can be seen from a mile away, to the point I was wishing they'd just drop the pretense and get in bed already.The first thing I noticed about this movie was the soundtrack. It was so bad I think whoever put it together must have had a laugh. The movie opens on a club scene and the music sounded like royalty free audio for a flash game or something. It doesn't get any better for the rest of the film. Sometimes characters are crying and the music is just conveying a completely different mood, it's bizarre.The quality of the art is so-so. The character designs are fine but the art goes off-model a lot. Faces look pretty janky at times. Having the main guy be pretty and not an ugly bastard or NPC-level bland dude is a HUGE bonus. Because, say it with me... ""The bar is on the floor.""Despite being a hentai, this movie doesn't show any genitals at all. You'll see the chest area and some bare bottoms. You'll see fondling and thrusting. The shots do not go below the belt at the front. I'll be honest, I wanted to see his dick, ok? God dammit.The K-drama character cliches are exactly what's written on the package:1. Son-Kyu / Kwon Seung-gyu (male protagonist)Boss with dark past who does mean shit but is ultimately redeemable. You know he's redeemable because he's so pretty.2. Kim Min (male antagonist)Rival guy who gets fucked over but then whose reactions go overboard so the audience know who the true villain is, thus making the mean boss look good in comparison.3. Chae Young-jo (female protagonist)The young woman the boss and the rival fight over. She is just very innocent and loving and sweet and doesn't have any agency of her own. She's essentially a plot device for the two men to duke over. If this weren't hentai and she was a kitten they were fighting over, the story would amount to the same thing. There are TWO instances of her stepping into traffic without looking and getting saved. Then there's TWO OTHER instances of her IN the car and nearly getting into an accident. What is this, Final Destination?She also goes through the typical ""nerd makeover"" as the movie goes on. She starts off with glasses and frumpy hair, then changes up her appearance to be sexier for Son-Kyu, then eventually gets a completely new haircut, contact lenses, and wardrobe. That's the extent of ""character growth"" for our main girl.4. Baek Hye-mi (female antagonist)An older woman from the boss's past who comes back to haunt him. She raped him back when he was young and vulnerable, and has evidence on hand to shame him for it. She threatens to ruin everything he's been building up. She's in the femdom scene, has male sex slaves, and is depicted as obsessively insane.See? The ABCs of bland K-drama. This movie just adds a veneer of sex on top.Son-Kyu the handsome successful charismatic playboy whose trauma turned him into an asshole? Kim Min the rival who seems nice at first then quickly becomes a disgusting piece of shit? Chae Young-Jo the helpless young lady just being yanked around? Baek Hye-mi the older woman who is, of course, a horrible evil bitch? Quintessential K-drama.I don't know if there will be subs for this movie anytime soon, if ever, so here's a plot introduction to get you on track if you're curious about this movie and don't speak Korean (because the MAL synopsis is... strangely worded)Son-Kyu is a manager at a large advertising company called NEONA. He has a secret traumatic past. When he was strapped for cash in his university days, he worked as a host. Look up ""host bar"" if you're not familiar with this concept. He was raped by an older woman, Baek Hye-mi, and this gave him PTSD. He deals with his trauma in the present by sleeping around and using women carelessly, but has frequent nightmares of what he had to endure at Baek Hye-mi's hands. This comes in the form of brief PTSD flashbacks to BDSM scenes where he's tied up in front of onlookers. These short scenes are not representative of the sex that actually happens in the movie, which is all very vanilla. Now, vanilla might be right up your alley, but I felt like I got a heaping serving of false advertising.Within the first few minutes of the movie we see Son-Kyu with a ball gag and blindfolded on a table without much context and I thought, ""oh shit???? real shit????"" But no. Because of those little flashbacks I expected A LOT MORE from Son-Kyu's shenanigans. I think he sleeps with 4 different women this entire movie, all in VERY vanilla scenes. The only ""fun"" stuff is the PTSD BDSM flashbacks where he's being toyed with. I wish there could be HEALTHY depictions of BDSM and men who CHOOSE to take on a submissive role during sex. Again, the bar is on the floor.Kim Min is a guy from Son-Kyu's university days that fucked Son-Kyu over morally, financially, you name it. Kim Min starts working under Son-Kyu at NEONA, and Son-Kyu sees his chance for revenge - playing nice until he can spring his trap. His plan? Steal Kim Min's girl, Chae Young-jo, who also works under him.The following goes beyond premise and into SPOILER TERRITORY:Since Son-Kyu's such a lady’s man, Chae Young-jo falls head over heels for him in no time. Whereas Son-Kyu is just using her as a pawn to get back at Kim Min, Chae Young-jo genuinely cares for him, making gifts for him that he carelessly throws away. Talking lovingly to him on the phone, not knowing that he's literally getting head from another woman as they speak.So yeah, Son-Kyu is a fucking asshole, but this is a K-drama, and he is the male lead, and by the power of toxic romance cliches, he will be redeemed god dammit.Son-Kyu rubs his sexual dominance of Chae Young-jo in Kim Min's face at every chance. He also ruins Kim Min's career up by assigning him tasks that he already knows Kim Min will fail at, and then berating him for his failures mercilessly. Kim-Min loses his composure, sexually assaulting Chae Young-jo in an attempt to ""reclaim"" her, only for Son-Kyu to show up and rescue her, therefore further establishing Son-Kyu as the good guy. Kim Min then assaults Son-Kyu openly in the office, getting himself fired. Son-Kyu performs his coup de grâce by personally delivering Kim Min's belongings to his house. Kim Min completely loses it and tries to stab Son-Kyu, only for Son-Kyu to trip him and kick him while he's down.As he spends time with Chae Young-jo, Son Kyu begins to develop actual feelings beyond just using her. Her endless selfless acts of love finally... gasp.... change him! Can I get an ""AH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN"" for the horrible unhealthy romance tropes?!?!?! Wow!!! He's about to take on a new path of in life and not be a toxic bastard, but we're only half way through the drama, babyyyyyKim Min is now on his own path of revenge. He digs up dirt on Son Kyu's past, and finds Baek Hye-mi. Baek Hye-mi is still obsessed with Son Kyu after all these years. She's willing to get her hands dirty to have him under her thumb again. Kim Min helps her kidnap and drug Son Kyu. She has an entourage of body guards and a sex slave who are all loyal to her, and they corner Son Kyu with no escape. In his desperation, Son Kyu pulls a ""YOU'LL NEVER HAVE ME!!!"" and stabs himself. Baek Hye-mi panics, then is drugged by her sex slave who was jealous of Son Kyu this whole time. Son Kyu makes his escape, all the while bleeding out from his self-inflicted wound.Meanwhile, Kim Min has kidnapped Chae Young-jo. He has completely gone over the edge, and wants to prove his love for her by raping her. Son Kyu shows up just in the nick of time to delay him, and the two men fight. Son Kyu is too weak from blood loss, and Chae Young-jo convinces Kim Min to spare him by pretending to offer herself willingly, only to hit Kim Min in the head with a lamp while his guard is down. This is arguably the only ""active role"" she takes during this whole story. Congratulations.With Kim Min incapacitated, Chae Young-jo rushes to Son Kyu's side. Obviously, Kim Min isn't completely down. He rushes at the couple again. Son Kyu sacrifices himself by pushing Kim Min out the window and the two fall to their supposed deaths.Sometime later, we see Chae Young-jo visiting a grave. This is revealed to be a total red herring because it turns out it's just her parents' grave. She goes to a cafe, where unbeknownst to her, Son Kyu is working. Through flashbacks we see how he got there. He couldn't face her after all that happened and escaped from his hospital bed to build up a new life. Chae Young-jo doesn't see him and leaves the cafe. Son Kyu runs after her. The two of them make eye contact across the street. The end.This movie had so many near misses with traffic accidents I wondered if she was going to run out into the street and nearly get run over again.My enjoyment of this bad movie is shockingly high because I watched it with a friend and we could not stop laughing. If I watched this wholeheartedly, I would have dropped it only a few minutes in. It is too bland to be a good hentai and too predictable to be a good drama.The credits were rolling but I was still laughing because I remembered the climatic fight scene. Son Kyu is holding a chain necklace when he gets punched and there's a slow motion scene where he's falling back and the loose golden rings of the chain are slowly tumbling through the air. My friend said ""Oh my god he's Sonic"" and then we both broke down laughing to the point of tears. We were so tired after this movie that our brains were melting. That scene was surreal.";Not Recommended

0;Baguda-jou no Touzoku;aniMayor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/aniMayor;4;"""This is Dangobei, the laziest man in Baghdad""This is one of (if not *the*) earliest cut-out-animation films from Japan.As far as mid-1920s cut-out animation goes, the animation quality is decent but nothing spectacular. I appreciated the effective usage of some cinematography effects, namely the fades, spotlight cut-outs and that unusual wreath-blossoming-spoitlight effect. I especially liked how many of the spotlight cut-outs had certain pieces intentionally sticking out of the spotlight, such as the antlers of Dangobei's helmet.In terms of story and writing, there are some excellent gags in this short film. I especially laughed at the angry tree and the soldiers' over-the-top siege tactics. However, the main story itself is a let-down. The story's execution is confusing, particularly in the middle with the snow fairy. Most grievous of all, the twice-repeated ""moral"" of the story - that happiness should be earned by oneself - seems to be rather undermined by the magic stone that gives Dangobei everything he wants. The real moral of the story seems to be ""happiness should be earned by finding a magic stone that solves all your problems"".";Not Recommended
1;Baguda-jou no Touzoku;Alaroki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alaroki;4;"""Baguda-jou no Touzoku"" or the ""Burglars of 'Baghdad' Castle"" is a silent animation made in 1926. Overall I can form a concrete paragraph of what I think about this anime so, I shall split it in bits (story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, overall):The story is mediocre and is about taking action in order to fulfill your own dreams or in the literal words of the show ""One's happiness ought to be earned by oneself"". However the show does a poor job executing this, showing actions that are quite literally the opposite of the message.the art uses the style of Chiyogami, or cut-outs of things like decorative paper and overall is done well. As an artist I can only imagine how hard it was to constantly move the paper to make the animations move.Sound: N/A Its a silent film after allThe characters of this anime were just not good. We are told that the main character, Dangobei, a thief is a lazy man, but overall we are shown no sign of this.Enjoyment: MediocreOverall: DecentIf you want to watch this anime I recommend going to: https://animation.filmarchives.jp/en/works/view/15479.Small Spoiler Ahead with a bit of repeated information:The Burglars of ""Baghdad"" Castle is an innovation to the animation scene as a whole and is the first step for the famous pioneer Noburo Ofuji animations, Chiyogami( cutout animations), as well as animation as a whole. But overall the anime is pretty underwhelming (at least for me). This is mostly because of the static and bad story. The whole anime is about using your own power to get what you want but this man throughout his short journey uses the power of a magic rock to get what he wants. Like seriously? The writing overall is based off of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1924) which isnt an animation but I recommend you to watch as from the few clips I have watched is quite interesting.";Not Recommended

It's so terribly bad that can be radioactive. I'm not joking!The mess starts with it's story, which should be, in my conception, the core of someone's enjoyment in a narrative work. If you don't have a at least decent story, you don't have a good product, not mattering if the animation or sound design are stuning. And this story is completely poor. The events doesn't seems to have any good justification to happen, the characters are shallow and their motivations are boring...I remember staring at the screen waiting for something interesting to happen. Well, the only interesting things that did happen were the spectacular animation errors. Weird facial expressions and BIZARRE perspectives appear all the time sometimes taking all the almost null emotional depth of some scenes, but at least creating good laughs. Sadly, a lot of these errors weren't funny at all, like the static scenes, for example.Also, not only the animation is bad, but all of it's art direction. The scenarios look like something from a bad and cheap Nintendo 64 game, although being made in 2003. I guess even in that time this kind of visuals would be considered weird and ugly.The sound design is the best part of the anime, being almost decent with mediocre voice actors and a easy forgettable soundtrack. That part isn't exactlu bad, but isn't good either. It's just meh.Finally,the enjoyment of the anime can't be more far from the lowest level of what can be considered ""ok"".

2;Generation of Chaos III: Toki no Fuuin;Plk_Lesiak;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Plk_Lesiak;4;Honestly, from of the horrible trainwrecks of Idea Factory's early output this one is the most serviceable. It's still quite ugly and cheaply put together, wasting time with pointless stills and recaps, but at the very least, it's a decent prologue story for the game it's meant to promote.It's quite true that the longer I watch these OVAs, the less I feel like checking out Idea Factory's games from this era is a good idea. The Neverland setting, shared between Spectral Force and Generation of Chaos games, seems bland and populated by mostly kitsch and unappealing characters. Stories are extremely important for my enjoyment of RPGs, and if there's one thing I took from these anime tie-ins is that they must be crap. This OVA though, even if by a small margin, is an exception. It's focused on setting up a high stakes conflict, a few lead characters I don't hate and a goal they'll be clearly pursuing in the game. It's not a great experience, but a solid piece of advertisement – kudos for Satou Yoshiteru for not f**** up that part for once. As for watching it...

After joining the poorest sect of the 4 great sects,Shi Jiang's journey into the fairy city begins.Story: 7/10The story is a bit exaggerated, in the first scene alone it looks horrendous. half naked men with pig masksand bats storming an elementary school where an older looking boy and very young looking girlare friends. It is a very nice foundation for misunderstandings. The story isn't that lackluster,the main narrative seems to be the power of friendship which is fair but does seem repetititve andShi Jiang character is too trusting of friends but it does make sense since he is biologicallymeant to be 7 years old. And despite his aging body, he still dislikes adults in general. Also,Shi Jiang gets betrayed a second time when the immortal medicine world gets sabotaged which iskind of annoying watching progress get reverted instantly and having to watch longer to seethe progress get reinstated.Art & Sound: 6/10The art style reminds me of a disney movie, the style is kind of bearable but it would have beennice if Shi Jiang didn't look so skinny. He's literally a tall, slim stick and his outfit afterjoining the sect looks terribly edgy.Shi Jiang's first character design before getting sent into the fairy world should have been hismain outfit in that world, there could have been more effort in him keeping modern materialsand selling the secrets of the modern world in the fairy world. But instead, his character designsuccumbs to the ancient, handmade woven dyed leather.Character: 4/10The characters lack personality, the only thing they progress is how many times they get targetedby the Zhou family. It seems the only big antagonist are the Zhou family and heads of the other3 sects apart from that the characters are only there to be used and disposed of.Shi Jiang's personal development is also very slow in the first season. We don't know anything aboutthis mysterious Lord Guangling until after the fairy exam and that's already cutting into the middlesegment of the season.Overall: 7/10If it wasn't for the modern inventions, I wouldn't rate this that highly.

Perhaps due to to the slightly poor artwork. Take the introduction for example. It was riddled with cutouts which ruins the 3d dimension outlook. If that wasn't bad enough every now and then you have some odd ball woman. In other words you have women that radiate beauty to some degree while those rare few look like they were done in a hastily fashion. Perhaps a reflection on life on how there is a balance of beauty? While i like the idea it just ruins the film.Or maybe the ecchi was ruined due to poor plot-lines. From bizarre to overdone plot can be found here. For example in one scene they depict a dating venture. Ah the joys of youth and the first girl to accompany the male character. What wonders or misfortunes await him? Someway of another he will mess this up to due inexperience. At first it comes off as normal with a normal problem but then takes a turn for the bizarre. Rather than going for the prize of a romantic gesture he goes ahead for the wipe? I just don't get it. Granted that good just be a fetish i don't share but here is another example. Settled in a different environment. The pretext to why one is there is gone or quite vague. Rather than having any female mention the male character is asked questions bringing an end to that particular short story. Yes, i think that is why the ecchi genre failed. Even with the fact of having a bonus story in the credits the directors couldn't agree to as what direction or point they want to go with. Which in turn led to a cluster of nonsense. Sure, it was nice to see but why? Why did i watch this? Wasn't for the ecchi for it had none. As for comedy it was quite tame or low leveled.

0;1-gatsu ni wa Christmas;sorcery;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sorcery;7;"It is always tricky to find a balanced Christmas themed production to approach, all mediums taken together. For an amazing one such as ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" there are plenty of atrocities creeping in the shadows like ""Santa with Muscle"" or ""Santa & the Martians"", which would make the tales of this shamelessly eggnog guzzling uncle of yours sound perfectly grounded...There are many trends under which these belong to, split into two categories: firstly, the Western ones. They mainly attach importance to what is commonly branded as the ""spirit of Christmas"". They are either Family or Romance shows revolving around hackneyed themes such as the need to observe the act of contrition, greet forgiveness in own heart, the belief in miracles, self-realization and the acceptance of differences. They tend to be sickeningly goody-two-shoes given how overly preachy they tend to be... It is as if they are family footage, but screenplayed in a professional way in order to be adapted into the little screen. It lives to be experienced and forgotten at the end of the year. The second is the category occupying us here: the Eastern one. Japanese openly consider Christmas like a commercial great event with an added gimmicky charm, unconcerned they are by traditional christian values. As such, in animation, this time of the year translates as being plotline's flavor rather than a pivotal element of the narrative. While Christmas Specials of established franchises are not uncommon (much like as an episode setting, as widespread as the local festival or Tanabata), Standalone movies and OAVs are. The ubiquitous recommendation I get when asking what to watch is ""Tokyo Godfathers"". ""Ichigatsu ni wa Christmas"" does not exactly compete in the same category, yet, it is worth of consideration, to the point you may recommend it without blushing to anyone who has already completed Kon's movie.InwC (abbreviated as such for the need of this review) is the infant of another Satoshi, Satoshi Dezaki. I know, it is difficult to take the figure seriously, taking into account he directed a series about a gigantic cop screwing prostitutes and downright acting as their pimp while his colleague is in the middle of a stakeout. Yet, Satoshi drives the Magic Bus at the right station: when it has to be consistently serious, it is. Straightaway, InwC stands out thanks to a short apostrophe tinged with sarcastic affection:- Would you come at the Christmas party?I have invited you every year but you have refused to come every time;""I can't suffer it, these celebrations, I detest the December month and particularly Christmas""You hate a lot of thingsI would love to see you at one Christmas partySo that I'd strive to make it as boring as possibleFor you, who find funny things distasteful.But what is it serious about it, would you ask? Romance? On the contrary to what the official genre indexation on Myanimelist suggests, InwC doesn't really dwell on it. It is more of a red herring. Indeed, early on, Fujioka and Seiko are established as a couple. The love triangle is mostly employed as a thread to explore Mizuki's facets. The OAV only becomes interesting when you renounce to anything resembling shipping mentality. Mizuki's infatuation is simply doomed to not happen as nobody could be loved back out of pity. On the other hand, you start to realize how witty InwC is, broken apart as a Fuzokuga. One obvious instance of it is in the opening scene on the shoes store as Fujioka ponders about what lead young maidens to be so keen on pulling pranks, trying on all the footwear to choose nothing... It is indeed a seemingly mundane situation any salesman faced at least once. Another is the dialogue ensuing after Fujioka ensures that the neighbor house is not scouted by a burglar, thus being culprit of a misconduct himself. It comes off as ironic, in answer to the common preconception. However, Mizuki's seemingly sassy nature dissimulates her true colors, which are those of the winter scenery. Much like the official poster shown in this profile page, a part of her opted to fade away from the reality as the snowdrift melting at the end of January. This is one of the numerous instances of play of parallelism outlined by Satoshi Dezaki. Another obvious one is the teddy bear. In the hospital scene, one shot alternates with another as a cinematographic metaphor for arrested development of the girl. The bittersweet end offers a realistic cope out, ultimately reflecting the will of a childlike maiden giving up on an ill-fated love. An intellectually honest direction to branch for, mostly in a production lasting less than 45 minutes...Overall, the spice of InwC is its characterization put in relief by the competent presentation. The art isn't particularly remarkable; it is in the average of most of the Shoujo-ish designs of the era. The animation does not benefit from a high budget as evidenced by the copious use of panning and recycled animations. It is not a main concern for a production of this type, anyway. The soundtrack manages to sound eerily forlorn and merry at the same time, rendering well the discrepancy between the tragic backdrop of the heroine and the festive atmosphere experienced by everyone else. It is particularly surprising that this OAV has ended to become so obscure, given the participation of one of the most notorious seiyuu/singer of all time: Megumi Hayashibara. It was certainly her presence in the cast which decided Onion no Fansub to complete the subs in the fist place. She delivers here a powerful performance which is likely to please her fans. All in all, InwC is a reminder that you should always give a second chance to directors like Satoshi Dezaki. He may not be Osamu but he remains a strongly capable worker when given a solid framework to weave around. Thank you, Magic Bus. Thank you, Iwadate Mariko, for writing such a spiritual Christmas tale.Praise be unto Sacred Geometry~..| Colophon |..This section is dedicated to content indication in order to inform audience in a practical way.

0;1-gatsu ni wa Christmas;TheAngryNerd;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheAngryNerd;6;"Hey all! Merry Christmas everyone! Today on this lovely holiday I have taken it upon myself to review an anime that has something to do with Christmas, so here it is!Story/Plot - 6 - It feels like your typical shoujo story, and surprisingly, despite Christmas being in the title, the story doesn't really have anything to do with Christmas, as it doesn't use it as the foundation or main driving force for its narrative but rather something extra for the plotline. It's more so centered around romance, like your typical shoujo. However, what's interesting here is that even if it is themed as being a romance story, it actually doesn't really dive deeply into it nor does it bide in it. I mean, Fujioka and Seiko become an established couple before the halfway point, so the romance can't go anywhere from there at that point. It feels more like the romance theme and the love triangle is used as a device to explore Mizuki's character, which I find clever, which brings me to the next section.Characters - 6 - This is where things get pretty good, but it's also where my thoughts are rather conflicted. First of all, the character development was very well done and neatly balanced despite the short time span. The use of characterization through clever... how should I say this? Symbolism? Well, anyways, this is something very noteworthy of this anime. Mizuki is often characterized and represented through things such as snow, or should I say, winter; or in this anime's case, perhaps even Christmas. This is where my main gripes begin though. Mizuki, in my opinion, is an awfully unlikable character. Whatever sympathy for her that the story tried to make the audience feel throughout this OVA, especially nearing the end, fell flat for me. Mizuki's reasoning for her actions and her personality is explained, and she is aware of how unlikable she is, however that doesn't make her character more likeable. She's almost a complete brat up until the end. Other than that, the other characters are nothing to write home about. Fujioka has a nice semi-detailed personality so that's nice as well.Visuals - 5 - Very standard shoujo-styled art from its era. The animation is also average and sometimes lacking in some parts. However, good animation isn't needed for a story such as this one, for it can convey and execute everything it needs to without high quality animation.Audio - 7 - The voice acting was pretty good! Especially Mizuki's voice actress, she did a really good job! The music set the tone for the scenes pretty well, and I found it to be good.Overall: I think this OVA is good. It's lacking in a few areas but pretty well done in others. If you're looking for something Christmas-themed to watch that isn't overly preachy like the massive amount of mediocre to jarringly bad specials or films released in the west, this is something you may or may not consider watching. I personally recommend it if you're tired of that crap and just want to watch something that feels like it had actual effort put into it.

0;Yoru no Hi;Please_Send_Help;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Please_Send_Help;7;"I first went into this expecting it to be the typical shounen anime, with an OP MC focusing more on tropes such as friendship instead of actual character development. I was disappointed to find that I was right. Despite the unusual art style, DO NOT BE FOOLED. Art is a good thing, but not all is as innocent as fans would have others believe. The movie focuses on the image of a moth, which according to my extensive research symbolizes unsettling things such as Shadows and Otherworldliness. Our overpowered main character (who we will refer to as ""The Old Man"") is slowly corrupted by the moth. Initially swatting it away, the man slowly succumbs to temptation, putting the moth to his face in ritualistic worship.The Old Man begins the movie depicted as ghaustly and rotting. Upon seeing the devil-moth give his blessing on The Child (who is symbolic of the anti-Christ), The Old Man is filled with jealousy of The Child's fortune and youth. Desiring this upon himself, he grasps the moth and forces the ritual to happen. However, there cannot be two anti-Christs. The moth rejects him, flys away and burns up by a streetlamp.However, DO NOT BE FOOLED by this intentional misdirection. Not only does this movie corrupt the minds of children and convince them to be full-blown Satanists, but this movie is Bourgeoisie propaganda. This movie is ACTUALLY designed to sell trading cards. So what if it's only four (The Moth, The Old Man, The Child, and The Woman)? Four will become eight will become sixteen will become thirty-two will become sixty-four will become one hundred twenty-eight will become two hundred fifty-six will become five hundred twelve will become one thousand twenty four will become two thousand forty eight will become four thousand ninety six will become eight thousand one hundred ninty two will become sixteen thousand three hundred eighty four trading cards.No one will be able to remember all the names if that happens. Not to mention that The Old Man would be put on the banlist before the game even got released. What's the point in buying something that you can't even use?Despite this, I may or may not recommend this anime.";Recommended

0;Yoru no Hi;Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;6;Another Shiroki Saori oil painting on glass short, this one being the shortest available on MAL and perhaps the simplest. It's more of a vignette than a story—an interesting, even somewhat ordinary scene, portrayed with nightmarish aesthetics and atmosphere. This is like a ghastly horror film in sound and image, but nothing horrible happens. I suppose Saori just has a knack for darker moods. The technique is, again, beautiful, and the scene is strongly executed. The moth flying around, its shadow cast, reflected in the eyes, and the harsh light is all wonderful. The stark chiaroscuro of the scene and the minimal lighting render this highly textural, and more pristine. Other Saori shorts have a very visible streak effect when the characters move, but the low lighting masks these artifacts—for better or worse, yet I'd say it's for the better.There's an old man, a baby, and a moth featured as the most prominent characters. And they're all really creepy. The baby looks dead (it's not), and I'm not even sure if the old man has eye balls. The actual events are irrelevant other than the moth landing or being placed over the eyes—the eye pattern of the moth becoming the eyes. There's some sense of wonder and awe, maybe even something spiritual (OR MKULTRA EXPERIMENTS PROJECT MONARCH OMG).Probably the most interesting moment is when the moth lands on a lamp and it burns out, the scene fading to black—a nice way to end, but it also implies a greater significance to the moth and its touch.;Mixed Feelings

Aside from that there was no spoken words or subtitles.Story/artUnclear. Going from the art you see no color aside from black and white. Which one might dismiss to be an old film but they would be wrong. Instead the black and white concept was used in effort to produce a gloomy outlook. As for the art style it was mostly uncut drawings back to back. I say uncut because you can in a way see eraser marks. As to why that approach was chosen i am not sure. I am guessing it added a certain statement on constant changes. So, one could say with this information thus far that the story was a depressing tale but on what remains a mystery. My theory is that the message was masked emotions are found in infants. While we want to construct them in the best way we can we can't for what they want won't be clear until they have grown up. Or simply put the madness of the young-lings.SoundClearly off tempo. Also, there were opportunities missed where sound could have been added such as the intro, the child, and the fireworks.Overall: this film would be best appreciated if you liked films that plot were left unclear or unknown. Or if you are an art lover and would like to see a different type of artwork expression(style).;Not Recommended
0;Sekai Meisaku Douwa: Aladdin to Mahou no Lamp;Rubi-Jah;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Rubi-Jah;9;"First of all, let me start off by saying that this was the first anime that I have ever watched. Though at the time, I didn't know it was an anime. I think I was 5 years old when this movie came on T.V. but I wasn't home to watch it and my mom seeing a commercial earlier for an Aladdin movie on T.V., she decided to record it. Unfortunately, the VHS that she had, only had room for about 30 minutes of taping. Even though I had only watched 30 minutes of this movie, the images would always stay in my mind.The movie was made in 1982 so keep in my mind the technology they had for graphics and sound. The movie stayed very true to the original Aladdin story in my opinion (much more so than the Disney version). Even the Japanese opening song was in an Arabic tune to make things seem more authentic. The Scenery and drawings in the movie were very well done for its time. The details in everything from the shining fruit in the underground gave to the Arabic city streets lined with pots and clothes and food stalls...everything was very well drawn. The effect the animation style had on me even as a child was something amazing because I remember being scared for Aladdin when the sorcerer trapped him in the cave. Overall, for its time, the animation was amazing.Now for the sound, I only watched the dub, however even with the dub, I felt like the characters were well portrayed and that their voices did not deter from enjoying the stories. The music was nothing special but it stayed true to the Arabic theme. The only thing I found annoying was maybe Princess Badral's voice and the fact that they recycled the ""busy street people"" sounds in the background, but again, this doesn't deter from enjoying the story.For those that have only watched the Disney version, be prepared...because this version seems more authentic (less modernized). This is not a bad thing though because the story is different and interesting and I felt like I was watching something new even though I knew the story of Aladdin. For example, Aladdin gets married to Badral even though he's only a kid. If you can keep an open mind, these concepts will intrigue you more than turn you away from the movie. The pacing of the story changes half way through the film, I don't know if it's because I'm biased because I only watched the second half recently, but I felt as though the first half took its time to let the watchers to introduce Aladdin and his life. The second half where he meets Badral, everything seems to go faster...even how fast him and Badral fall in love and get married and how soon the Sorcerer manages to steal Aladdin's lamp. The fast pacing near the end kind of threw me off but I still enjoyed the story none the less.This movie really was the epitome of my childhood and for those that don't mind a little outdated animation, I think it's definitely a good watch.";Recommended
0;Sekai Meisaku Douwa: Aladdin to Mahou no Lamp;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;Up nest for this year's film festival week, we have a film from 1982 based on the story of Aladdin. For you youngsters out there, this has nothing to do with the Disney version aside from the fact that they both drew inspiration from the same public domain story. In fact, this came out a decade before Disney's version. You see, Disney loves to base their films off of public domain stories while hypocritically fucking over the concept of the public domain. But that's a conversation for another time. Let's jump into Toei's version of Aladdin.Story:Aladdin is a poor beggar boy who, along with his friends, steals food to keep his belly full only going home to his poor old mother at night. One day, he's approached by a wizard who offers him a pouch of silver coins in exchange for doing a task for him. This task involves going into a mystical cavern that wizards can't enter and retrieving an old lamp. Which we all know turns out to be a magic lamp with a djinn in it. Aladdin uses the djinn's power to become a prince and woo the sultan's daughter which draws the ire of the wizard.Let's start with the problems with the film. The first thing that bothers me is that Aladdin steals so that he and his friends can have little treats to snack on but he never takes anything home to his poor mother Which makes him come across as a bit unlikeable. The second thing that bothers me is that the film leaves out a lot of the wizard's duplicity. In the original story, he gains Aladdin's trust by pretending to be a relative of his father's. In this he just shows up looking very suspicious and Aladdin just follows him with very little hesitation. Which does weaken the narrative a little bit.On the positive side, the film does get most of the original story's plot pretty much nailed. Including the exact trick the wizard uses to get the lamp and the lesser djinn of the ring. The film also has its fun moments, a lot of which revolve around a little desert rat that Aladdin picks up. I also kind of like the story arc about Aladdin trying to leave his former life behind and become more virtuous.Characters:The characters are pretty much the very basic, simplified variety that you get in old morality tales like Aladdin. They work perfectly fine but don't have much in terms of complexity. I will say, my favourite character was the little dessert rat, which doesn't have a name but I'm going to call Squeakers. It just has so much fun whenever its on screen and saves the day at least twice during the climax. Squeakers is the hero this story needed.Art:I will give this film credit in that it's not dated in a way that doesn't hold up that well, unlike some older works I've reviewed. That being said, there are a few things that bother me. The first is that Aladdin and the Princess are both drawn in such a way that they look to be around thirteen but then they get married and she's also being pursued by the old wizard and the grand vizier's son. I know that historically some young girls have been married off, including to much older men, but that's not a historical factoid that makes for good entertainment. The second thing that bothers me is that none of the major characters actually look like they're from that region. Both Aladdin and the princess have the brightest of bright blue eyes. The princess is also literally as pale as me and I'm a very pale white guy who barely goes outside. Aladdin has a slight tan, at least.Sound:The acting is pretty well done. Kimaya Kazuo, Suzuka Keiko & Kaneuchi Kikuo all perform well. The music is fine. It's not anything special that you'd listen to outside of the film, but it's fine.Ho-yay:There's none to be found.Areas of Improvement:1. Include the part of the story where the antagonist actually tricks Aladdin. Look, this film is barely over an hour. You could take an extra five minutes to build the whole thing up a bit and have much better execution.2. The characters could definitely use some depth.3. Make the characters look less white and older.Final Thoughts:Sekai Meisaku Douwa: Aladdin to Mahou no Lamp isn't a bad adaptation of the classic tale. It's pretty faithful to the original but doesn't really add much aside from little Squeakers the desert rat. I'll give it a 6/10 because it does have some enjoyable moments but it's also not the best version of the story out there.;Mixed Feelings

1;Gakuentoshi Varanoir Joukan;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;1;Before reading I deleted this review because I had to find if some things I wrote were correct and they were but it was hard to find some veracity on this thing but with the research I had now everything is fine.Honestly why I am hurting myself with watching bad anime? What am I gaining? All that time wasted. Why are we still here just to suffer? I hope you don't mind spoilers for something like this.You thought Mars of Destruction or Skelter Heaven were bad anime. I researched so much for a a treasure with lots of poop inside. I will review Gakuentoshi Varanoir Joukan, the lost sister of both series mentioned above. Also note this anime is only Raw state.One thing before starting, no Myanimelist, this series is not 25 minutes each episode. The first episode is 50 minutes long and the second is 43 minutes long. Yeah in total this is Idea Factory's longest running crapfest of the OVAs they have made. 1 hour and 33 minutes of my life gone. It seems that MAL is basing this lenght because there is a torrent that divides the first episode in 2 parts but it is still the same episode.Let's begin with the obvious the art and story. The artstyle and animation are the best in trying to insert the most awful animation and artstyle you can come up with.The show begins with horrible pictures made in paint and with a grandpa having a sexual affection for his grandaughter. Yes it is one of those. Then after the girl finishes dressing she goes to the school she got accepted and they show this abhorrent background and they shove to the face everytime they can. Also this series incorporates a horrible and shitty Haohmaru from Samurai Showdown copy that fights the main protagonist for some reason. But she has the power of luck because everytime she looks down there is money and she defeats her enemies like that.So what other bad type of animation is found here. What if I told you that the producers are so crazy and so retarded that when our protagonist presents herself to the class and all her classmates and literally all her classmates are just the same 2 characters copy and pasted and with the same expression.They are so cheap and take the viewers as a fool is over beyond and you want to know something. The first episode is being sold on Amazon Japan for over 100$. If anyone wants to have that turd in their collection go ahead but they should be giving those copies for free.In episode 2.They start with a food competition where our protagonist and her rival compete and other cheap way to solve animation issues is that the assholes grab frames of the animation. Put it in Stop and then they just start zooming into the faces of the characters whenever they feel like it.Later the protagonist and her rival go to a horrible cave for some reason. The focus on that escenario takes almost 1/3 of the 43 minutes. It also seems to look that at some point in the production of the show.The backgrounds didn't render at all. So they decided to put the characters into focus boxes while leaving the whole background black. (Do I even have to continue with how repugnant this show is?)Some parts on that cave, the animation is so bad that it looks like if you go to Vegas and you start moving pictures like those shitpost videos on youtube.Also there is a subplot of the grandpa talking to a man, and all of the suddent they throw a Generation of Chaos (another Idea Factory Anime) flashback? and I am like, was Idea Factory trying to make their own cinematic universe back in 2002, even before Marvel had that idea?So to not make this long because with this show you could do a thesis how bad an anime can be. The director of the school they are going becomes evil and has thunder powers for some reason and evolves but the main protagonist arrives to the scene and she defeats him by hitting his hand, the impact of the hit is so hard that even destroys the school and the reality in it because the deepest part of the background becomes black. Honestly I will stop here with this review. Trying to put thought and criticial thinking will make my brain explote of trying to get logic out of the most intolerable animation that I could come across.Story, Sound, Character are non existent, they just put things going along, the voice actors are horrible and the characters are so stupid and lifeless beyond believe.Enjoyment and overalll.Go watch it if you want to laugh at it and it is simply hilarious that Idea Factory was doing this tactic to sell more of their crappy games and win some extra cash before their hit series Neptunia came. Honestly with this sort of magnificent turd, I would not give my money at all for those games they were producing for the Playstation 2.This is everything from my part take care in whatever you do and see you next time.;Not Recommended

My guess, 30 was a nice round up number.Story-Introduction was a bit confusing of a start. While we did get an idea of the character's backstory it wasn't really sufficient. How can the audience root for someone they don't really know? Then again one could argue it goes along with the police's database of knowing basically nothing. Although, the past was himself, for he had his own name. His current and possible future lies in the hands of another. So, while the police background concept is an argumentative it only focuses on the current. Therefore, having the main character pre-background setting wouldn't hurt anything. For frankly based on the little known information it his hinted to have been based on word choice but there could have been a just or good explanation for it. In which case the main character was nothing but good but society made a mistake with him.-Rest of the story could be grasped easily. Nothing big of importance was left out. You had relationship, you had other character's backgrounds. You had motives.-Ending was comical and not plot based which was a shame. Mostly because the comedy level wasn't that high. Some examples used were over use of jokes, nonsensical actions like the digging scene when a battle had already started. The positive side to not have the ending focused on the plot is that it opens up the idea of a sequel. Although, i don't think there was enough information or material to make one.ArtNo complaints. I was happy with the use of the credits. Credits can be boring with just words but here they included pictures of the show. Which normally, could have been equaling as boring but instead the pictures you were not from the show but from what i take to be hints on how the story progressed.

Anyways I basically had this deadly pair of K Swiss shoes that were black but with 5 rainbow coloured lines down the side. They sound tacky as but hey were great, the only problem being that they weren't sewn onto the shoe and were more sorta stuff down so after awhile they started to peel off. It was a shame if I could get the same shoes and I could have the piece of mind that they wouldn't get wrecked I'd leap at the chance. Aside from this the only other anime with cool shoes is probably Initial D when he wears the new balance gutties.Anyways the only other K Swiss ad I remember enjoying as much was the ad with Kenny Powers from Eastbound and Down I'd say it's a toss up between White Fantasy and those ads for which is better.;Recommended

There was a telephone device that would work on the audio signals and then you would press a button to answer the questions the tape would ask of you. This is an interesting little relic of it's time but nothing more.The animation is ok and matches the style used in the Mario mangas of the time. It's not very polished but that's ok. The voices fit the respective characters and the story is a loose narrative based around the events of Super Mario World.Though what really bogs this down is the phone device, at first it isn't too annoying but as the video goes on Mario and pals use it more and more often. The questions are fine, if at any point you think to yourself ""these questions are too obvious"" remember that this device was aimed at toddler aged children. Though the frequency of the ""calls"" is a bit much, especially after the first third of the video and I could see even a little kid getting annoyed with this fast. So as both something for kids at the time and for people watching it now, I wouldn't recommend it beyond historical curiosity.";Mixed Feelings
1;Super Mario World: Mario to Yoshi no Bouken Land;FrisktheRookie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FrisktheRookie;6;"I don't remember the last time I've seen an actual Mario cartoon, but I stumbled upon this anime that works with the Terebikko phone. First of all, I believe this video came from a VHS tape and second, I never had a Terebikko phone because they don't have it here in America. While I was watching this (with English subtitles) I noticed that there are two responses for the right and wrong answers (the voice actors imitate the noises with *Ding ding ding* or *Behh* rather than putting in the actual sound effect). Also, when a character picks up the phone (either Mario, Luigi, or Yoshi) you'll hear a strange ringing noise from offscreen while they stare at you and wait for you to pick up the phone. When I first saw this, I thought the Terebikko had microphone access to the VHS but that would be impossible to add in. Instead, you have to push the buttons for the multiple-choice questions. I also don't remember Yoshi, Dry Bones, and Wiggler speaking sentences in the series (they don't talk in the actual Mario games).Overall, 6/10; because this was archived from a VHS and it was aimed at children then you would think, as an adult watching, that it's easy mode (except for the similar keyhole one).";Mixed Feelings
0;Super Mario World: Mario to Yoshi no Bouken Land;RoyalRapids;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RoyalRapids;3;Since, somebody never really made a review on this I might as well. There's one thing I can use to describe this anime and it's RING RING, because that's all that happens. This I presume was an interactive DVD of sorts targeted at young children. It sort of follows Super Mario World's plot, but with some slight changes. The main part of the story is Mario, Luigi, or even Yoshi randomly picking up a phone and asking the viewer to give a solution to what's going on.Story 1/10It's a watered down Super Mario World condensed into 40 minutes, what more can I sayArt 4/10It was solid for it's time and still gave a Mario-ish feel.Sound 1/10Holy crud that RING RING was so annoyingEnjoyment 4/10I watched this on simulcast with some others and I had fun criticizing it.

1;Super Mario World: Mario to Yoshi no Bouken Land;Thedude3445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thedude3445;3;This was originally part of some VHS phone peripheral thing, and also it's made for five year olds who can't count. But because it's obscure Mario lore I had to watch it and see how it ended up... except that it interrupts the story every thirty seconds with a new math quiz, so you don't even get the chance to take in the very low production values.The big selling point for this one is Iggy Koopa's voice. When I heard it I cracked up laughing, for like two straight minutes. Seriously, please watch this for Iggy alone.

It was in narrative form. Also, the main characters were introduced.-Conclusion was a bit disappointing. Sure, a result from the battle took place but what of the plot and message? Was the director trying to say raiding is the way? Think how you will i don't really find there to be a kind underlining message.Art-black and white-characters in certain moments jumped off the pages so to speak. Meaning alignment was not always there. Still confused? Imagine my characters(letters) were characters(people). Note how they are all nice and neatly in a line. It not only looks nice but it is easy to follow. If one character should be raised higher or lowered than the rest it looks bad.-art is mostly too bright.-Certain things were repeated. Such as the command for fish.Sound-one voice(female) is provided for all characters. Great we get some vocals but any one gender playing both gender roles and multiple characters can not be confusing but can ruin the story. For example you might forget the main character is a boy not a girl.-There was no animation sound.Character-would have been nice to know the fruit came to be.OverallNot worth watching giving all the flaws. A modern remake would be highly recommended.;Not Recommended
0;Ganbare Goemon;A2ZOMG;https://myanimelist.net/profile/A2ZOMG;8;"Ganbare Goemon, known in the USA as Legend of the Mystical Ninja is a pretty nice example of a video game series that transitioned well into an anime adaptation. Granted, the video game series itself is not well known in the USA and likewise, it's understandable why this gem from the past has mostly faded into obscurity for the English speaking world. If you're a person like me who is lucky enough to have experienced playing Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES or any related titles in the series, you will definitely appreciate what this anime has to offer.Starting with the story, it mostly progresses in an episodic fashion as Tsukasa, Goemon, and friends thwart the evil efforts of the villains from the game world. Each episode usually has a mini-plot focusing on one particular aspect of daily life in Japan, an idea from the villains as to how they can mess up that aspect of life to harass innocent bystanders, and a finale featuring a mecha-style battle between Goemon Impact (Goemon's trusty friend and super robot) and a different themed robot that the villains summon based on the type of rage they collect from the people of Japan. While this particular structure can't exactly be called original, the way this show explores and pokes fun at various parts of Japanese daily life and culture is something fresh and entertaining almost every episode. Through the course of 23 episodes, a wide variety of ideas ranging from video games, the Edo period, amusement parks, Christmas, Valentines Day, the magnet train, and even space exploration are covered. Given that, this show manages to cover a lot of interesting ideas.While one may have suspicions from the fact that this show is G-rated, I don't think this really detracts from the entertainment of this show unless you're expecting fights with blood spilling everywhere. Ganbare Goemon captures a more lighthearted, heartwarming, and sometimes even educational tone. The show is usually amusing, although the good guys, including the young protagonist Tsukasa have their personal character flaws, and almost every episode, a happy solution is achieved where the good guys overcome a personal problem or insecurity which leads to a happy ending each episode. While this is obviously a good appeal for children, I'm a 20 year old college student and I consider this good storytelling. I'm not calling it the best plot ever, but I do believe the show generally carries a good message that everyone can get something out of.Which brings me to the characters. These aren't the most complete and developed characters you have ever seen, but all of them are enjoyable in their own right and serve a purpose. Tsukasa is an ordinary boy in grade school who by chance ends up becoming friends with Goemon and company. He has a romantic interest by the name of Asuka, and a rich, confident, and snobby rival named Nobouru. A common recurring device in Ganbare Goemon is Nobouru trying to win over the innocent Asuka with his wealth and connections, while trying to demean Tsukasa, who of course becomes jealous, but then Tsukasa makes more progress in winning Asuka back when Nobouru chickens out in the presence of villains from the game world. While the constant use of this device can be considered somewhat annoying, Ganbare Goemon actually does manage to develop this relationship pretty well and expand on the flaws of jealousy in general.The characters in Goemon's group include Goemon himself, an idealistic and confident sort of character, fat and somewhat lazy Ebisumaru, strong and uptight kunoichi Yae, Goemon's girlfriend Omitsu who easily becomes jealous, perverted but creative inventor old man Monishiri (who happens to be Omitsu's grandfather), and Monishiri's robot Sasuke who is strongly righteous and devoted to completing whatever missions he's assigned. While again these aren't exactly the most complete and developed characters ever seen, most of them (except Yae, who is pretty consistently a ""perfect"" character) exhibit some kind of flaw or insecurity that gets addressed at some point during the show when the villains cause the citizens of Japan to become upset over the very thing that each character is insecure with. In this way, most of the characters in this show exhibit good quality development. Except for the villains who obviously are meant to be evil and general douchebags.Given that this show aired before the beginning of the recent millennium, the art style can be called old, or dated if you will. But as a fan of Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES, I found the art style very appropriate and true to my expectations of what the characters should actually look like. The animation isn't truly spectacular, but the drawings are always consistent and clear and well colored. Generally speaking the art quality is aesthetically pleasing, and does what it's supposed to do. Not once did I feel the art quality dropped during any of the episodes, even as they introduced new ideas and themes to work around.The sound effects aren't the most varied in the universe. However the voice acting in my opinion was exceptional. Especially the English voice acting. After watching this show both English subbed and dubbed, I believe the English voice acting is more clear, concise, fitting, and gets across the general idea of the show very effectively. All the voice actors generally fit their role perfectly, and never once did I ever find the voice acting dull or unbearable to listen to. If only for the sake of watching a good English dub, Legend of the Mystical Ninja does not disappoint here.As a fun adventure, reflection of culture, insight into common flaws and insecurities we can see in our own lives, and a tribute to an underrated but amazing video game series, Legend of the Mystical Ninja does its job very well. All in all, this is a show that both children and grownups alike should find decent enjoyment in.Please check out this show or any of the related Ganbare Goemon video games. If you haven't already gotten into this wonderful series made by Konami, you've missed out on a lot, but it's not too late to get started!";Recommended

The film is mainly for kids, although I think it can also be fun for adults. I think most people wouldn't find it boring, knowing what you're about to watch.The characters are something that existed before the film (from gachas in Japan), so not much to say here. If you haven't ever seen them before and don't find them adorable, then this film is not made for you.The music and sound was great, loved the songs on the special moments.The art design is very simplistic, which is understandable since it's what the character designs rely on, plus it makes the art cuter.The story was actually interesting, very simple of course since it's made for kids, but still interesting.Now, on my personal opinion. I have a very special attachment to these characters for personal reasons, and I was not expecting this outcome at all. I thought it would be just fun to watch, maybe even boring and drop it after a few minutes in. I couldn't be more wrong.This film gave me some of the purest feelings I've ever experienced. It will sound sad to say this, but I'm on my mid-twenties, and these feelings haven't crossed my life for a long time. It made me remember those feelings of pure and innocent joy, happiness and sadness. I had to hold myself from crying three times, however on the last one, when the credits rolled, it was too much, too many emotions I am not used to control. It wasn't sadness, it was simply an overflow of emotions, pure emotions.And for that, I now have even more attachment to them, even though I am fully aware that this was just a long promotion for their product. I can already tell I will remember this film for ever, and when that happens for a good reason, it means it has been an excellent film.";Recommended

This is acting solely to offer a gist beyond that, for those still on the fence whether to waste so much as 10 minutes skimming through these two episodes as I had. The first 5 minutes are truly that big an indicator!)...:CONFLICT:.FL’s father wanted her to marry into his friend’s family. This was said on the man’s deathbed and so there’s room for misinterpretation. In any case, the family friend believes he wants FL to marry his son; the two are the same age and were already friends. But instead of giving a head’s up about this, he left for Poland with his kid. FL didn’t know, her brothers didn’t know, and all the while, the family friend was raising his son *solely* to become FL’s husband. He flat-out admitted it.In any case, the family friend has decided the kids need to marry the moment FL turns 16 and then return to Poland with them. And thus begins the actual conflict of this arrangement...:CAST:.FL has been skilled at Judo since childhood, to the point of becoming her fiancé’s inspiration and first love. She has no friends outside her Judo buddies who all lust after her and a piano playing boy. Out of all of them, her only love interests were the two pretty boys. And then her fiancé once he shows back up.In regards to love, she simply wants someone willing to tell her he loves her. But she knows she’s not ready for marriage just yet so she doesn’t go along with her fiancé’s father’s whims. She is very wishy-washy in regards to whether she puts her foot down or waits for someone to save her.Love Interest #1 is a fellow Judo member and is the type to act and never think. The writing hints him to be the eventual ML, but he was used largely as an excuse for FL to not marry and leave for Poland before she was ready. He acts as a barrier between FL and the creepy Judo member, but whenever he shows intimacy towards her, her brothers finally show up.Love Interest #2 plays the piano and is a natural tactician. He’s who FL goes to for support or even a second opinion, and she trusts him enough to be all alone in the music room with him. However, he refuses to express his feelings and even denies them when directly confronted. He’s the only reason #1 won.Love Interest #3 is the fiancé. He grew up mostly in Poland with his father and there appears to be a LOT of manipulation at play in his upbringing. The boy is smart and knows how to use his good looks that mask his natural clumsiness. His impulsiveness is only ever in regard to FL.Overall, all love interests are scum. Fiancé is harder to brush aside given the OVA itself shows only that, but the OP hints the other two are no better. They simply don’t have a time limit or sus father who throws her family into drama.For the rest, FL has three older brothers. No real personalities aside from their unconditional love for their sole sister, and the eldest is the acting Head. He’s also the one who reminds them that it’s FL’s choice to make, not theirs, not the family friend’s, and not even their departed father’s.Unfortunately, their downside is they’re short-sighted simps. They don’t push back against the family friend even to reject a marriage until FL is an adult; back then, that was 20 years of age both legally and culturally. While they could consent and allow her to marry at 16, they could just as easily use her finishing high school and preparing to emigrate to keep her there for 2-4 years longer.The family friend, all the while, is just sus. His not telling anyone about the engagement plans is easily chalked-up to the usual lazy writing Japanese stories show, wherein the shock factor makes up for everything. But because he’s forcing the marriage the second it’s technically legal and having admitted to raising his son solely to be FL’s husband? That’s a character description, not merely bad writing. He is sus – it should’ve been him, not FL’s father!!.Honestly, they should’ve just written FL’s fiancé as a returnee, even if only temporarily, rather than a visitor there to take her back to Poland. Instead of such desperation tactics for shock value, they’d have just as easy a time for cultural differences acting as such...";Not Recommended

If you have extra time on your hands, go ahead and watch it.Midori no Neko is one of the most mediocre OVAs I’ve ever seen. It’s not what I would call “bad”, but it’s not good either. The characters were pretty boring, with the old PI being the only one I could kind of relate to. The plot had several holes in it, seeming to change as the story required, and the art and music was just dreadful, although this could be justified since it’s from 1983.The story revolves around this old man who’s name I forgot (he was that unmemorable). He’s trying to find his friend’s son who was possessed by this green cat who’s actually an alien but actually a god who gives you good fortune all the time. If that sentence made no sense, well, you and I are in the same boat. Most of the story is told in flashback from the perspective of the old man and his journey to find his friend’s son. It’s a pretty good idea for a story, especially when it’s just an OVA and not a 13+ episode series. There’s a few major twists in the series.*SPOILERS*The first is that the green cat in the story is an alien from outer space and it only LOOKS like a cat to humans. It’s “true form” is a purple, anorexic-looking alien cat. The second twist is that the greenness or the cat is because of chlorophyll. You know, that stuff that plants use to collect sunlight and carbon-dioxide. You’d think that this would mean that the cat needed sunlight in order to live/grow, but nope. I guess it’s a special kind of chlorophyll that only needs carbon dioxide but not sunlight, since the cat spends a lot of time indoors. Also, it was stated earlier that the greenness was just a disguise and the true form of it was a purple alien cat. See what I mean when I say there are major plot holes in the story?*END SPOILERS*As for animation and sound, it’s nothing special. It looks and sounds like any other anime from that era. The voice acting was pretty bad and the sound effects were pretty bad, but this was from Astro Boy era, so yeah. Overall, the anime was okay. As I said before, not very good, but not terrible either.

0;Ba La La Xiao Mo Xian: Caihong Xin Shi;cureglitter;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cureglitter;7;"This series is a solid, all-round 7 of a show if there ever was one.It's important to note that this is China's take on the magical girl genre and is often (mistakenly) given the label as a Precure rip-off. Now, I'll link a post explaining why that's not the case at the end, but for now, just take my word for it.STORY: 7This series carries on the wummer after the live-action debut season ends. The waht now? You're thinking. But don't worry, you absolutely DO NOT need to watch that one (in fact, in canon, it's series 0, with this one being series 1, making it more of a prequel.)The series premise is that the potential future fairy queen has run away to Earth to find her ""real"" family, and the team of girls from the previous series must help her - all while battling evil forces that wish to overthrow the fairy kingdom. It's simply stuff, mostly featuring monsters of the week or, more often, magic mistakes of the week, and is pretty lightweight stuff even for mahou shoujo series. But it makes up for that with tons of slapstick-styled comedy, a surprising amount of character growth, and just being plain fun.CHARACTER: 7Again, there's a surprising amount of character growth throughout the series, as the fairies adjust to the human world and vice versa. Each quite literally grows up througout the series.What I most appreciated was how they tackled tropes. In this series, Shirley is the yellow, 18-year-old group leader. She's clumsy as a human, but still mature, smart, and brave - quite different from the usual awkward pink lead we're used to seeing.The human twins are wonderfully awkward and independent despite being so young, while the very young princess manages to be extremely intellegent but also lacking in social skills and still very childish. All three improve on their flaws across the series.SOUND: 7Look, it's an old series made by a ,low-budget Chinese studio. It's at times tinny and the VAs are obviously very young, but they do their darned best! The songs are cute and very appropriate, and surprisingly catchy, especially the OP.ART: 7Okay, the mix of 3d animated backgrounds and 2d foregrounds is a bit janky and can be difficult to get used to, but it' very much a product of its era (it's very much like a Chinese version of early Winx Club!) But the character designs are absolutely gorgeous and the transformations are just as fun and funky as you'd expect from any Precure season.Overall, this series does more than enough to earn it's place in the magical girl genre. If you'd like to read how it compares to precure, here's an article explaining the differences:https://mahoushoujofiles.tumblr.com/post/619573668924784640/balala-vs-pretty-cure";Recommended
0;Bouken Shite mo Ii Koro;delta5;https://myanimelist.net/profile/delta5;3;"My primary purpose in writing this review is to convince you that Bouken Shite mo Ii Koro is a waste of your time. Don't bother watching this junk. While it's billed as a comedy, the OVA series is basically a hentai. It's poorly animated, dreadfully written, and relies on sexual assault, coerced sex, and rape for titillation. All of this is presented in a light-hearted manner as if it's the most normal, healthy thing in the world.What's unfortunate is that, in the hands of anyone with a modicum of talent, things could have been very different. A sex comedy about an underdog porn studio trying to make it big has a lot of potential for an ecchi anime. In fact, there's one really clever sequence where they're trying to film a scene on public transportation (illegally, of course) and have to flee the scene when they get busted. If they'd focused more on that kind of material then this could have been a somewhat decent show at any rate. Instead, the focus on creepy sex scenarios and juvenile ""humor"" render it practically without worth. If you're looking for comedy or actually sexy content, save yourself the 135 minutes I wasted and see something else.";Not Recommended

I'm sure there are subtleties and jokes in Mameneko that I missed completely, but one of the nice things about the series is it manages to be simple enough that most of it can be grasped between the animation and knowing a few basic Japanese phrases.Anyways, Mameneko is a charming little short series about cats being cats, and is the most realistic of the three cat-related short series we got this season. Nothing really insane happens in this series; it's just a relaxing romp about silly cats being silly cats. If you enjoy watching cats, you'll like it. If the average cat video on Youtube bores you to tears, you won't find much of interest here.All in all, the show is fine for what it does, although there's nothing about it that really makes it stick out from the horde of cat-related shorts that exist. In the end, it was a fun - if forgettable - little series to spend 3 minutes a week on.";Mixed Feelings

1;Oscar's Oasis;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;10;What.The.Hell.When I found out Oscar's Oasis was indeed an anime on myanimelist.net, I HAD to make a review for this childhood kino. It genuinely is quite surprising to hear that this is part Korean. I thought it was fully French, what a diverse world we live in.So I watched most of the series back in the day, but I have vivid memories of some events that took place, with it usually being the same thing over and over, I don't think I am missing out on a lot of stuff to talk about because ultimately, Oscar's Oasis is really just fun and games.It's an episodic series, filled with funny characters, funny moments, funny situations, and generally everything needed to make for a good kids anime. 3D animation is the entire thing, but it has a good nostalgia call to it, even without, it's fine regardless, fits the theme well and there is seriously nothing jarring about it. The same goes for the sound here, pretty memorable soundtracks, some OST stick to me even today. Lack of actual dialogue but that just means this can be universally enjoyed.I remember talking rubbish about some of the logic here back when I was like 9 or 10 or something like that. Despite its lack of consistency (Oscar's tongue CAN go 50 meters and sprint 70 mph if he wanted to smh), I thought it was fun on the whole, even if sometimes very dumb. I'd watch this with the mindset as a child would, look for the dumb funny nonsense, and don't be a pseudointellectual like I was looking for the chef-d'œuvre in the form of artistic representation of Newton's Gravitation Law of Motion.10/10 for being a great kids anime.

0;One Piece: Otoshidama Special - Tokubetsu Hou Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan no Himitsu!;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;6;I think this is probably the best One Piece recap there is, what makes it that is the sheer amount of content it covers and the fact that it keeps the nostalgic flair as strong and lively as ever. I could only make it through with a runny nose and teary eyes, unbelievably nostalgic and true to its root.The recap starts with a cover-story-like skit before it delves into the snippets of each of the Straw Hat arcs, snipping from here and there with a charming Manga promo in between every transition. One Piece really changed throughout the years and this feels more like a documentary than a recap.There was also a weirdly placed promo for the Karakuri Castle movie (movie 7) before the Alabasta Robin part, but okay, probably a reminder that I should rewatch the One Piece movies for God knows what time now.;Recommended
0;One Piece: Otoshidama Special - Tokubetsu Hou Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan no Himitsu!;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;5;Another One Piece recap, one of the older ones. Unlike the newly produced ones, this one doesn’t remake the animation. It’s a classic cut and paste style of recap.So a classic question regarding recaps comes into mind – why even watch it? For this one, if you want to rewatch the origins of straw piece, some of the very first arcs, but also don’t want to just straight out rewatch the episodes, here’s some best of moments for that. Sure, plenty of these are great, but they also require the context of the story to fully appreciate. The moments being great also doesn’t make the recap great, as recap is not the origin of the stories.I haven't noticed any added content, so either there wasn't any or it was really minor, easy to overlook.This isn’t a recap movie for which watching it might work as a substitute for watching the series, this is basically a clip exhibition to reminiscent about. So, as usual for recaps, don’t watch it if you don’t know the full story, and no need to watch it unless you want to refresh your memory of some moments. Or you’re a completionist.;Mixed Feelings
0;Feng Yu Zhou;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;7;"One could tell from the comedic timing, the nutty humor, the occasional breaking out into a musical rhythm before just as whimsically aborting, that they studied Dreamworks Studios. You know, movies like Kung Fu Panda and Happy Feet. The formulaic spontaneity really works to good effect here, keeping us comfortable without feeling too in the pocket. These moments are timed to a Hollywood influence, where funny moments are juxtaposed to touching ones, where the characters connect, separate, and then connect again, just like their summer romcom predecessors.The story is simple and done to death. A generic evil villain conjures a plot to revive a monstrous beast, and it's up to the heroes representing the five elements to save the world. Whether that sounds like Power Rangers or Avatar to you -- whatever. The twist here is that the protagonist blind like Kung Fu Panda is fat, and that's the gimmick that wins our empathy for the unlikely underdog. I say gimmick in a technical sense. Aside from some children crying in key moments when they're about to get smashed in the skull, the drama is done really well and keeps the story flowing at a good pace. There are a lot of comedic interruptions but they never dwell. Think Marvel movies with witty lines, and maybe Iron Man or the Hulk or Thor would get into some friendly spats to establish comedic camaraderie, but those scenes never stick for more than a few seconds. Japanese anime often does the same thing, but have the characters argue with each other over and over and over again, until it becomes just pathetic and lame. It never feels that way here; whether comedy or melodrama, it moves right along.The characters are also well done. Not as naive and idealistic as a shounen, but not incredibly deep. Probably at a good level analogous to the many American animated films aimed at a general audience. It's the interactions that shine, particularly between the protagonist and his gambling mother, and the evil girl that prompts his journey. The moment when we see why she's gambling so much was so moving, particularly as we realize what would happen next. There was a running joke in one part of the movie where the protagonist has some magical constipation, so he carries it around like he's pregnant, with his captor girl playing the husband. The jokes are amusing because they don't fit neatly into common anime tropes. They don't involve anyone yelling out the obvious like a manzai straight man. They don't involve anyone calling each other petty names about the shape their faces. They don't involve a guy picking his nose and flicking it. I'm so done with generic anime humor, just miss me with that.Honestly, if you've seen martial arts comedies like Kung Fu Hustle or Kung Fu Panda, you have a good idea of what's going to happen. The Wind Guardians is a great addition to that mixed genre. It's funny and serious when it needs to be. Although the action is well done, the protagonist runs more often than he fights. For most of the movie, he's not really a badass. Don't expect it to be packed with fights, and don't expect it to take itself too seriously, and you won't be disappointed!";Recommended
0;Eiyuu Gaiden Mozaicka;simex909;https://myanimelist.net/profile/simex909;7;"Hi. I'm not a super serious anime reviewer, but I saw that this one didn't have any reviews, so I thought I'd try to give you the gist of it.First, if you don't like fantasy, there's nothing here for you. The eery alien world is the true main character, and it is not character driven, though there are some good characters. The plot plays out like a chapter from an alien bible. I love it, but I know most people who watch anime like heavily character driven things. I mean, generally with OVAs you'll find little character development, but this one is particularly mythological in its style. Big things transpire in an alien world.The art is good for the time. There's no 5 tone shading, and I've seen better action sequences, but the character designs and the atmosphere are top notch. Like I said before, the world is the main character, and it comes through in the variety of characters as well as the mysterious and alien backdrops. The ""demons"" are very creative and striking in their design, and were a highlight for me.The sound is fairly crappy by today's standards. No surprise there. The ending theme however is really cool and funky-- check it out.I really liked this because I like old OVAs, and I like plot driven anime that transport me to another world. The art was good enough. The designs themselves were great. It was generally trippy and alien, and kept me interested. If that sounds good to you, give it a shot.";Recommended
0;Good-by Elvis and USA;slamDuncan52;https://myanimelist.net/profile/slamDuncan52;7;Keiichi Tanami had an interesting place in the pop art scene of the late 60s/early 70s (also known as the late 60s). Good-by Elvis and USA shows a thoughtful extravaganza of a world now under assault by images for the first time. His imagery is abstract, frenetic, and jarring, as a signifier toward the breakdown of celebrity as human, production as craft, and culture as organic. It's a fond farewell to the days of Elvis and his meaning as a human musician, and a look around at the image that the man had become.If you're interested in psychedelic video, or artsy thought-pieces discussing the creation of mass pop culture and the production of symbolic late capitalism, then this and Tanaami's other short films of the era are an excellent addition to your study.;Recommended

This is the most bizzare piece of anime or thing in general I've ever experienced and probably will ever experience. It has no consistency cutting abruptly from one surreal piece of image to the next. And almost having nothing to do with Elvis besides occasionally flashing his face. Music wise it consists of bizzare sounds that kinda fit with the almost nightmareish vibe of the whole thing. The art consist of pop art and cut outs of Elvis, americana, and bizzare erotica. Overall this is feels like a weird nightmare or bad acid trip the guy had and he decided to animate it. I truly think it's is something to be seen to believed. If you really want to watch an anime made by the same dude you should probably watch Oh Yoko! which was made two years later.

0;Shiawasette Naani;Bagadonuts;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bagadonuts;5;Shiawasette Naani is a short OVA of some historical interest. It is one of the earliest Kyoto Animation works, and the directorial debut of Ishihara Tatsuya, who went on to direct a huge chunk of the KyoAni corpus. It is also the first in a series of anime commissioned by, and based on the writings of, cult leader Ookawa Ryuuhou.It is clear that the production values here are not high. The animation is somewhat stiff and choppy. I didn't like the sound design, which combines plenty of awkward silence with some weird, overly-loud effects. The extent to which the voiceovers don't match the characters' mouths is truly egregious.As for the story, though, I don't dislike it. Unlike later works associated with Ryuuhou, Shiawasette Naani isn't overtly sectarian propaganda, but comes across as more of a general-purpose parable. I think its message is basically a good one: that remaining cheerful in spite of minor setbacks helps to make life more bearable for everyone around oneself. A simple, bite-sized moral that seems about right for a 15-minute OVA.By far the most enjoyable part of this, for me, was simply the opportunity to see the humble roots of a director and a studio which I know and love.

0;Xanadu Dragonslayer Densetsu;Voivodian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Voivodian;7;Xanadu is based on one of the earlier jrpg franchises out there and thus feels like a part of a bigger universe. Its premise is extremely interesting, with a futuristic ai assisted combat tripod being isekai-ed into a world of magic and mind baffling schizo tech. On top of that, there is a world destroying dragon of legend present in the story. There is an exciting promise of an epic showdown between these extreme destructive powers from two very different worlds.But just look at that run time! At little over 50 minutes, we all know how this will turn out. Like other fantasy ovas such as Gude Crest or Wizardry, the hype built up for this great evil force is for naught and the role played by the isekai elements eventually takes a back seat to story elements from the rpg games instead.Despite the squandered potential of a cool premise, the anime still has plenty of wackiness to offer as one would expect from an obscure old ova. Some of my favorites are:-Combined arms attacks with howitzers and, sword wielding men at arms?-mech pilots being torn apart by bugs, these anime always pull their goriest tricks too early-on the topic of gore, the bizarre contrast of indiscriminate civilian slaughter and then a comedic skit not even a minute later-loli airship captain!-its a fantasy setting but there are advanced magitec aircraft, guns (which are never used in actual battles) and radios!-tentacles!Sadly this anime isn't a Gasaraki meets Dunbine classic. What we get is decidely mediocre. A must watch if you've actually played the original Xanadu series of games. Fans of nonsensical oldschool fantasy anime will also get a kick out of this. The rest of you, bump down that score to 5 or 6 and watch a seasonal isekai instead.;Recommended
0;Xanadu Dragonslayer Densetsu;triela-chan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/triela-chan;1;"This show is bad in almost every regard. The pacing is absolutely awful, with no sense of flow. The dialogue often has this strange pace because of how quickly some characters respond to each other. The plot is basically a generic JRPG quest with some mecha randomly thown in. And deus ex machina is everywhere.The characters include a generic annoying protagatist, useless damsel-in-distress love interest, forgettable supporting characters, and comically evil villians. The music is mediocre at best, but only if considered on its own. When put in the context of the film, the music sometimes feels out of place. One of the major battle scenes was probably supposed to be full of tension, but it had this relaxed, almost cheerful music that didn't fit at all.Also, the ecchi scenes are just really unnecessary. There's already the perverted bishop, who's essentially a generic dirty old man. But then you also have the main villian and villainess, who are basically lolicons. No, I am not throwing that word around offhandedly. She literally calls him that, says she's ""interested"" too, and then they just laugh it off together. Even if the film lampshades it, it really doesn't makes it any better.The only things that aren't absolutely awful about this film are the art, which is fairly average compared to other shows from the era, and the fact that the film shows you some mercy by keeping its runtime under an hour.";Not Recommended
0;Juliet;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;2;"My First review of 2020 for an OVA of 1999. You know the deal I love digging this site for things that are not talked about at all so here it is Juliet. This will be short.The first thing to point out, No MAL this is not a Hentai, It features the girl on the cover naked a couple times but there are no sexual scenes at all. So if any MAL editor or worker or whatever is reading this, make a better research on the info for the entries in this database.So what is this non so hentai about? It is about a rich girl called Juliet that wants to leave her home because her brother doesn't let her go out and they have it all since they are rich after both parents died. When I say everything is everything cause they are so rich that they afford to bring Disneyland to their backyard and I am not kidding when I said Disneyland. So some delivery guys come to their house and they give her a cat that was wondering around but she escapes with them in the back of the truck but her brother finds out and rescues her until they die in a robbery, but somehow Juliet survives because their parents told her it wasn't her time, but her brother ""dies"" until he is reincarnated in the cat she had. Then it looks like side stories of her on how she became part of a veterinary shop and clairvoyant about dead animals. It is a very stupid OVA.The characters are stupid beyond believe.The older brother whose name you won't believe is NARUTO, is stupid beyond believe because when he died his parents told him that Juliet wasn't his real blood sister so that makes him horny and for that reason he reincarnated in the cat's body that died minutes ago because he drowned, so his whole character is being a perv cat like in the OVA Kennel Tokorozawa but there it is a dog instead.Juliet is just a naked figure shown in whatever moment they want. It is an airhaid and simply that. Nothing more but a drawing shown to make you milk yourself if you were desperate but for some reason she has a good sense of telepathy with animals and to talk to the spirits of dead animals.The art is trash. There are cutscenes that not look good in sequence. There are so many off frames and weird stiff movements that don't convey any sense of storyboard direction and they focused so much in showing her ""Beautiful"" body which I would say it was a desperation move to sell this in some way or another. Even if I am a sucker for 90s animation this is bad that can't be a guilty pleasure just to look at.In other words this is not enjoyable, I wasted 25 minutes of it watching for something but I was getting bored or lost the focus of it because of the direction this took.Take care and see ya around.";Not Recommended
0;Boku wa Kuma;BurntFlower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BurntFlower;4;"I'm a sucker for cute animals. When I accidentally stumbled upon the music video Boku Wa Kuma, I was delighted to find that it was about the cuddliest bear I've seen since the Care Bears. While the music video does not offer much in terms of character and story, it's a good waste of two minutes if you want to see a loveable bear do adorable things.There isn't much of a plot to begin with; it's about an average day in the life of a bear. The problem is the bear's life is pretty mundane and boring – he doesn't do much besides sweep his room and wear buttons for eyes. In fact, the high point of the music video is when he uses milk and orange juice to grow a plant. This is a very easy-to-follow video. The only thing that is any bit confusing is why a baseball falls from the sky and comes crashing into the bear's window. Where did it come from?Although this music video is short, you learn quite a large amount of important information about the bear. The bear's rival is a fried shrimp. He thinks he was a chocolate in a previous life. He doesn't like to fight. While this crustacean-hating pacifist with a sweet tooth isn't cleaning his room, he's playing his guitar that sounds remarkably like a piano. He's also very easily-entertained and has a broad imagination since at one point he draws himself being scorched by what looks to be Godzilla's long-lost cousin. Make of that what you will.The music is the best part about the music video. Hikaru Utada's voice is very soothing. However, the lyrics aren't all that great – half the song is the bear singing over and over that he's a bear. No, really? There's also some bad French that was added in the middle of the song for no reason whatsoever.The whole video is all in stop-motion animation. It was pretty well done, and the bear begs to be hugged to death. The only ugly thing is when his crayon drawings start to move – he can't draw worth a damn.This is a simple music video for children. If you've had a hard day at school or work and want to relax, or have young siblings, I recommend this video to you. Otherwise, pass it up.";Not Recommended

0;Suisei;Stephen2D;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Stephen2D;7;"Known today for award-winning animations like ""Inaka Isha"" or ""Atama Yama"", Koji Yamamura proved his talent from his very first short film, ""Suisei"". A very immersive work of art from him because without noticing, it can transport you above and beneath the surface of a world made with only layers of clay and 'fragments' of light. The technique of claymation and the colors used are reminiscent of the brilliant Russian animator Yuriy Norshteyn, and because the form was not perfected (we could say at the time Mr. Yamamura lacked a style) the film has a ""rough"" beauty of a first work, but a beautiful work nonetheless.The following are taken from an interview conducted by the BFI talking retrospectively to Mr. Yamamura about his works. Enjoy:""This was my university graduation project, shot on 16mm. The film was inspired by M.C. Escher’s print Three Worlds, which depicts a large pool in autumn in which you can see a large fish under the surface, leaves floating on top and the reflections of trees, although you can’t see the trees themselves. In my film, a man looks at his reflection in a pond, then throws an apple into the water, breaking its surface, before beginning to imagine how he looks from the perspective of the fish beneath.I often play with the idea of reflections in my films – how we only know ourselves from our own subjective positions, even when we’re looking in a mirror. We never really get a sense of how we look or act from an outside perspective. We only exist in our own minds. You can see this in the opening scene of Mt. Head, when we look at the main character for quite some time before we realise he is actually looking at himself in the mirror.My other major inspiration was the Indian animator Ishu Patel’s film Afterlife (1978), made for the National Film Board (NFB) of Canada. He was a jury member for the first Hiroshima International Animation Film Festival in 1985. After seeing his films I really wanted to make my own experimental and artistic animations like this.

Initially, Ye Xinghe hides its existence by acting like a useless practitioner until the day Ye Xinghe moves to the City where his family's Soul Bar is located. In the Soul Bar is an arena for cultivators to duke it out with their martial spirits; it is also the place where Ye Xinghe exposes his abilities and reveals that he has the Star Map relic. Now realizing his existence has been compromised, Ye Xinghe sets on his journey to the Star territory to find the whereabouts of his father.Story: 4/10The beginning of the story is uninspiring and bland with Ye Xinghe getting kicked out of his family's own property and leaving the city to cultivate. We are introduced to the main characters who will be going on a journey with Ye Xinghe to find his father. The overall plot and goals are pretty interesting but the way the first season handles plot progression is really slow and wasteful. The first 30 episodes are all training arc at the Soul Bar battle arena against all sorts of enemies - the worst part is that these enemies aren't killed or crippled and come back to the battle arena repetitively to fight Ye Xinghe or halt his progress. This leads to the initial story's beginning being delayed till episode 35 when they set off on their journey. A kind of progression where MC keeps fighting the same enemies and gains in strength is normal but the way they keep meddling in the progress is kind of unbearable to watch and delays the main series.Art & Sound: 5/10Ruong Hong Culture are well known in the Chinese animation industry, they are undoubtedly unmatched in terms of donghua. The art and animation are actually pretty decent quality but I can't stand the overexaggerated smiles MC does and his character rigged flexibility. It's a comedy gimmick that doesn't really suit the CGI art style because it looks so glitchy. This series is full of color and spirit beast auras like Soul Land.The sound is average, nothing too notable.Character: 5/10The characters are pretty average. I don't really understand the motive near the end where Ye Xinghe lets Mu take his so called wife on the trip because his sister getting caught just drags the series in the end 5 episodes. Not even a cliffhanger, it's just a minor event that somehow has become the first main event on Ye Xinghe's journey. The characters all have this aura where they exist to stall Ye Xinghe even the main characters - it just adds to the negatives of this series.Enjoyment and Overall: 4/10 and 5/10I enjoyed some parts of the series, like some of the final battle arena scenes at the Soul Bar, the dragon turtle spirit beast and the beast fire tree in the ending apart from that everything else was subpar establishment and development.";Mixed Feelings
0;Uchuu Enban Dai-Sensou;ZeraX;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ZeraX;8;This is the Grendizer prototype/test pilot that was shown with Great Mazinger vs Getter Robo G manga before Grendizer aired on TV.This movie shares the same story, music, characters and premise with Grendizer with few differences like the absence of totally different lead robot, the absence of Koji Kabuto and different character designs.Despite being short, it's very fun to watch especially if you are fan of Grendizer and other Mazinger works and it's always interesting to see what could have been.If you are interested in rare classics or if you are big fan of Go Nagai works, give this movie a watch;Recommended
0;Uchuu Enban Dai-Sensou;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;"What can I say? It's a giant robot story -- and pretty much like any other giant robot story from the time. The Seventies were chock-a-block full of series just like this one -- giant robots were a staple of the anime industry at the time. This was pretty much a one-shot 'prequel' to Grendizer.As the sole survivor of his planet, Duke Freed is living an unassuming,secret life as a human on Earth. Until the forces of Great King Yarban arrive, to take back the powerful Gattaiger spaceship/giant robot from him. With Princess Teronna as their leader, she is conflicted between her duty to her father, and her love for the Duke.Of course, all of that is just window-dressing (the premise of a plot) to wrap around the REAL reason that people watch this show: The transforming giant robots. You know the drill: the Duke has to yell out the name of his attack (or transformation) each and every time, as he battles the invading alien fleet.And of course, this story borrows on the fears of the Seventies, with the idea of UFOs and an alien invasion (which itself is a stand-in allegory for Japan being invaded by Westerners...but that's another story), and also nuclear obliteration. All of this wrapped up neatly in less than 30 minutes.As someone who has absolutely no love for giant transforming robots and that nonsense, which I suspect is most of today's anime-watching audience, it holds no interest to me. This show, like many like it, is all about the robots, and without that there really isn't enough interesting characterization or plot to carry it.If you like to watch a plucky young underdog running around in a transforming spacecraft yelling ""SPACE NEEDLE ATTACK!!!"" as it barrels into a pile of badly animated UFOs, then this show is for you. Otherwise, give it a pass.";Not Recommended
0;Toushin Toshi II;ThatRandomDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ThatRandomDude;9;Its been a while since i've submited a review to a hentai.However, tournaments of the gods does not feel like a hentai.It feels more like an R-rated action drama than just mere porn.This series is based on a visual novel for i gather which was adapted to a 3 ep ova.The story is simple. A guy warrior with a love interest enlist on a tournament to claim her back but get himself involved in something deeper than what it looked like.Taking heads and claiming women, its a bit of a semi-harem genre since he gets to do many women but has 1 main love interest and 1 sub love interest.Well, the art is good, even if most of the women were kind of anorexic.The animation is also quite good for being a 90s OVA.And the sex scenes were border vanilla. By border i mean it had some rapes in it but it was tolerated but more than simple sweet and fluff the sex scenes were passionate and raw of emotions.Its a primal's gold mind since they were not as cruel but also intense.For those who want some fantasy epic action with hot sex, I recommend this series.;Recommended

Since animals don't really talk (excluding parrots and such) we can only find out information about them in time. One of the common mysteries some might have is on the concept of bats and how come they only come out during the night. While the animation does not provide a scientific basis behind their logic this anime took this bat mystery and provided a plausible outcome to some regard. Even if it is told in cartoonist form. As for the underlying message behind the story, life needs to be taken in paths. No one person's journey should be on the borderline of paths. For how can you really understand a path you take unless you reach the end?Art-black and white- Some minor lip syncing flaws in the animation.-crisp and clear. As in not too bright or dark.Overall: A lot could be said about this animation and the content behind. While i mention what i thought to be the main context there is still a lot that is discreetly covered with different manners as well. For example if you replace the animals as characters for humans one might see the idea or issue we had with race in the past.

The animation is ancient compared to today's standards but its got a certain undefinable charm like most old Anime. The art, animation and voice work isn't the reason for watching this short movie. The reason is to gain respect for older styles of animation and to glimpse back into the past at what Anime once was and enjoy it.The story is average but entertaining.

0;Burning Blood;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;“Burning Blood” is an aesthetically pleasing, well-produced 3-episode OVA about a high school delinquent training to be a boxer to defeat his rival. After a rocky first episode, the story becomes solid and intriguing, although overdramatic and unrealistic at times. Unfortunately, it ends on an inconclusive note, and seems to have been made to advertise the manga (which had just ended around the time this came out).The OVA’s story centers on a high school delinquent named Ryo, whose nickname is “B.B.” or “Burning Blood,” a nickname given to him by American servicemembers who got in a fight with him a few years prior to the events in the series. It’s set in Yokosuka, a port city with a large American navy base. Ryo plays the trumpet in a band, and they’ve entered a national music competition. Meanwhile, Ryo’s friends get caught up in some local gang violence, and one of the main members of the gang is a guy named Jin Moriyama. Ryo fights him, but gets beat badly. When he finds out that Moriyama is a boxer, he decides to go into boxing himself to defeat him.The first episode is difficult to get through, mainly because there’s an implied scene of gang rape at the end, and the somber aftermath of that is shown. Also, there is no boxing in the first episode, so the lyrics and the visuals of the opening and ending themes don’t fit this episode at all. The mood is also a mismatch — it ends with a rape and a guy lying on the ground having been beaten to a pulp, only for the peppy “you can do it!” music to kick in immediately afterwards. The juxtaposition is jarring.The second and third episodes are much better. Once the plot gets started and the characters work to advance that plot, the story gets interesting and I grew invested in knowing the outcome. However, unfortunately, to find out the eventual outcome, you have to read the manga, as the OVA ends part of the way through. Also, there are a number of issues with this series that hindered my suspension of disbelief. For one, Ryo exhibits the superhuman traits that are often seen in main characters of delinquent anime: he gets beat up to the point where any normal person would have died, but his doctor says that he miraculously sustained no lasting damage, and what's more, Ryo recovers to 100% remarkably quickly. At one point, he even swims the 2km stretch from an island to the mainland and back — in a typhoon, no less. In addition, despite all of the violence occurring in public places, we never see any police or security guards anywhere, which seems a little unrealistic.The characters besides Ryo are memorable, but not necessarily likable. The teacher, Otobe, is your typical “tough love” coach. He beats up Ryo frequently, sometimes to the point where he knocks him out, and one time he even tells Ryo’s friends to take him to a hospital after he's done. Koyuki is Ryo’s love interest whose father conveniently owns the clinic that treats Ryo when he almost dies. Ryo peeks under her skirt and tries to convince her to sleep with him, but she coyly refuses. Kato (who goes by the nickname “Sorry”) is Ryo’s happy-go-lucky friend who often skips class to smoke cigarettes on the school rooftop with him. He’s dating Su, the naive, loopy manager of the school’s basketball team who is also somewhat involved with the local gangs. Rounding out the main characters are Waka, a former gang member who is now playing in a band with Ryo, and Moriyama, a boxer from an elite high school, who seems fated to be Ryo’s rival.The technical aspects of “Burning Blood” are all quite good, especially the direction, art and animation. The unique and visually pleasing character designs were done by legendary character designer Akio Sugino. They look a bit glitchy in the first episode, but the designs are smoothed out in the next two episodes, where they look great. The detailed, realistic background art is similarly nice to look at. The variety of visually interesting locations in the city of Yokosuka are diligently reflected here. The animation is great — easily some of the best I’ve seen in an OVA. It’s fluid and the movement is natural. There are a few moments where lip flaps don’t match the voices, but most of the time everything is synched up properly. One unusual technique employed in this anime is the use of still images during action scenes. Normally I would chalk this up to a budget issue, but this seems to be the director’s style and therefore an intentional choice, and it’s executed well.The voice acting is great, and the dramatic background music, which often features trumpets, leaves a deep impression. I didn’t like the opening and ending themes at first, due to the odd English in the lyrics and the fact that they didn’t match the tone of the first episode. However, the songs grew on me after a while, and now I think they’re pretty good.The whole 3-episode series is filled with dramatic imagery and speech, mostly relating to “summer” and “the sea,” and also the tattoo of a hawk, trumpets, and red and blue glowing eyes. The dramatic elements and figurative imagery combine with the Akio Sugino character designs to give this OVA a decidedly shoujo feel, despite the content being far removed from that demographic.As for potentially objectionable content, most of it is contained within the first episode. There’s some nudity and underwear shots, implied scenes of sex and rape, and lots of graphic violence. The second and third episodes also have a fair amount of violence (this anime is about fighting, after all).Overall, “Burning Blood” is a good-looking and good-sounding OVA, but it ends before its promising plot can fully develop. The first episode is difficult to get through, but the second and third episodes are interesting to watch, although unrealistic at times. I would recommend watching this for the art, animation and music, as well as the dramatic imagery of the series, rather than for the plot.;Mixed Feelings

0;Nanairo Kakumei;JazzieFung123;https://myanimelist.net/profile/JazzieFung123;3;"The art of the manga was good. The characters were very cute (appearance-wise). Also, I liked the rewrites at the beginning/end of each chapter (which cussed out the characters as they deserve), they were refreshing. These two things sum up the only things I enjoyed about this manga.My opinion of this manga quickly changed as I looked past the art.The first thing that bothered me was the translation. Excuse me, please do your job thoroughly. Many of the words were still in Japanese. In addition, many of the sentences lacked proper grammar and syntax. At first, I ignored it, but as I continued reading, the syntax sometimes became so poor that I could not understand what the character was trying to say. But that much I can overlook to a certain extent. What really triggered me were the characters.Secondly, all of the characters are either extremely irritating, toxic or both. I understand the author is trying to convey the ""inclusion/exclusion"" of girls and makes it so that the main character creates a ""revolution"" and ""rebels"" against this, declaring that she wants to be herself, but even after many many chapters, she does not change at all! It is infuriating watching her repeat the things she was ""revolting"" against. Also, don't get me started on the ""friends"". At first, I thought, ""they're not that bad"", but no, they're all toxic crazy little b*tches. Only some of the background boy characters seem sane. Many times I found myself thinking, ""I really want to stab her face right now."" Also, why are all the girls always crying?! It becomes so annoying when tears suddenly start to pour from their eyes every other page. (I may have exaggerated there but the crying is still pretty frequent.) Only the background boy characters are slightly relatable. They are so done with the girls' on-and-off friendship bullsh**, and so am I.Additionally, the main boy doesn't want to sit next to a girl because ""sitting with a girl is boring""? Excuse me? How sexist. What kind of image are you trying to convey to the young readers, that girls are boring and that boys and girls are not supposed to sit together or hang out together?Overall, I am extremely triggered by this manga, and would NOT recommend it.";Not Recommended
0;Hakugin;Owzok;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Owzok;7;"As always Eve songs are a banger, that’s why on these reviews I don’t focus on the song, instead on the video and message.""Hakugin"" or ""Snow"" is the 9th track in the album ""Smile"". This song has a very common and simple message but one that people should be more aware of.The video starts with everything in monochrome tones and the main character which we can easily notice, depressed and unsatisfied with his life. Since the start we see an elf and him but as a kid, both are painted with a brilliant and vivid pink, but they are still monochromatic. In Japan, they use the word rose or the terms ""rose-colored life"" ""rose-colored youth"" to describe happiness, peace and childhood. When the main character starts reminding his youth and childhood represented by the elf and his kid version, he rediscovers the joys of life. Changing his “rosed-colored glasses”, watching his childhood with joy and happiness as a metaphor of how he changes his vision of the world that surrounds him. Instead of watching an insipid monochrome world he decides to watch it now in a more colorful way. Also, Eve is using the transition between winter and spring as a thematic element to tell the story, since spring is often seen as the renaissance and renewal of life which clearly relates to the main character situation.We enclose ourselves in obligations, we conscientiously demand ourselves because that is how society has taught us. You must study / work, you must be to contribute something to society because otherwise you will become an outcast.What happens is that many people focus only on contributing to society and forgets about themselves. Therefore, we have simply forgotten how to be as happy as when we were children. So, it is in our hand to get out the inner child that keeps our deepest illusions and moves us. Because we never forget our inner child, we put it aside and we lose that purity magic, capacity for wonder and never better said, “rose-colored life”.When we were children, we slept with toys so any of them could get mad.With the pen that had many colors, we tried to press all the buttons at the same timeWe pretended to be sleeping so that our parents would take us to bed.We sat at the computer just to draw in paint.By eating the seeds, we were scared to death by the fact that a tree would grow in us.Our childhood was happier than our youth and we didn’t even know that we were happier than now.Without us realizing…Remember when we were kids, and we couldn’t wait to grow up?";Recommended
0;Da Wang Bu Gaoxing 2;KuroNekoAlchemy;https://myanimelist.net/profile/KuroNekoAlchemy;5;"tl;dr a gag comedy goes serious, to it's own determentminor spoilers below~The first season was really entertaining. Despite choppy animation(a common problem with chinese series) it had a colorful cast of memorable characters, and made me laugh on several occasions with it's funny gags, 4th wall breaks and general randomness. It also had a pretty catchy op and ed song, that I listen to occasionally on it's own on bilibili.Now then. Dawang Bu Gaoxing(the king isn't eager, for some reason translated as the furuious yama) is an adaptation of a chinese webcomic. I haven't read it due to my chinese not being good enough to understand it without english translation, so I dunno how much content was cut. I will review and share my thoughts based on cartoon alone.The premise is simple-the lord of the underworld is a young (actually like a 1000 year old) girl afraid of ghosts and zombies. Over the course of her reign during season one, among various mishaps and misunderstandings, she eventually acquires various tools, allies and gadgets, including a magic minigun, infinitely extending 50 ton stick, a loli necromancer and a combat maid...schoolgirl zombie ghost...wielding double handguns. Their arch-nemesis are evil western demons who want to extend their dominion on the Eastern Underworld and human world.So it's like heroes of might and magic necropolis vs inferno basically. When it was all funny and self aware, the randomness of it all served a series of quite a few laughs and was quite entertaining.But then the story started taking itself seriously, and the charm was lost.All the random stuff can be forgiven with the power of suspension of disbelief, as long as the series is comedic. Why is said schoolgirl suddenly supper confident double gun wielding, sniper rifle shooting pro after becoming Yama's personal assistant? No need to think about it if it's just played for the laughs. Why is Yama capable of pulling every imaginable power out of her ear(literally) and save the day just when she seems to be in a pitch? Well, cause it's crazy random, that's why.But then imagine these elements in a series that's trying to create serious drama of some sort and make you care about events and characters beyond most superficial ""what crazy shit is going to happen next, lmao""? Well exactly, two terms come to mind. First is ""plot armor"" second is ""mary sue"".And oh boi, the mc does become a mary sue. Once her quirky cowardice trait is no longer relevant, she's just annoying. Her persistent habit of starting every episode with ""You won't believe it but im a new Yama of the Underworld"" doesn't help, because now that she's no longer pants pissing incompetent there is nothing unbelievable about that.There are some good parts too, like Xiaogui meeting her ""best friend"" in human world, or Jiang grandma's pretty much every scarce but precious moment of being on screen, but it all drowns in a sea of mediocre, predictable, and not very well animated fights and (sometimes literal) deus ex machinas.Oh and there is also yuri subplot. Xiaogui Zhan and Xiaoluo Yan kiss twice on screen. I guess I should give the series a thumbs up for having this kind of theme-to my understanding chinese if not society than at last government isnt very lgbt friendly, so animated series exploring these themes openly deserves a praise. Nevermind that in first season there wasn't much going on between them to warrant that, beyond a devoted servant-lord relationship. And one is like 17(ghost) the other is several thousand year old yama. But since they are both looking like teens, it's probably appropriate...kinda...whatever, suspension of disbelief should kick in just about now.All in all, it was only kinda enjoyable and I wish the second season stayed funny and random like the first.";Mixed Feelings
0;Joou Heika no Petite Angie;HeavensBlade13;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HeavensBlade13;3;There were no reviews for this show at the time of writing this so I thought I'd give some quick thoughts to anyone who happens to stumble upon this show. I know it's made for kids, but I'm of the belief that even kids shows can be watched and critiqued regardless of age.Story - This is an episodic mystery series, with no overarching story (although the last episode is suitable as a conclusion for a show like this). The cases for the most part are very predictable. The culprits are almost always either random thugs or completely sympathetic with little to no grey area between these extremes. Often Angie only solves the case from absolute luck or coincidence rather than intelligence. Many episodes have boring chase scenes on foot or horseback that overstay their welcome.Characters - Characters are the crux for any good episodic series but they are very weak in this show. The only somewhat interesting character is Angie but every other main and recurring character are defined almost entirely by being either a) just there to take orders from Angie or b) resist her help irrationally. The comedic relief detective is not very funny and usually has weak synergy with the rest of the main cast. This show badly needed more interesting mains or at least semi-recurring villains and rival detectives.Art - The animation and art style is passable, but many of the character designs throughout the show are quite bland. I have not watched many shows from the 70s so I'm not sure how it compares to its contemporaries.Sound - I liked most of the instrumental pieces and thought they usually set the mood pretty well. However, the sound design was not as good. Often times certain sound effects were too loud and annoying such as horse hooves or footsteps during chase scenes.Enjoyment - Overall this show was very mediocre in terms of its mysteries and characters, so it was not too enjoyable. Certain episodes did show some potential, such as a hot air balloon hostage situation, or episode 25 which had rival detectives, a better scenario for the comedic relief detective, and more dynamic chase scenes. However, these moments where the show differentiated itself were very few in number.Overall I rate this show as a 3 since while the art and sound are passable, the story and characters are both considerably below average. An example that comes to mind for a kids show in the episodic mystery genre (although not an anime) that still holds up and does what I think Angie needed to are many versions of Scooby Doo, which have memorable characters and lean into their goofiness.;Not Recommended

0;Tatakae!! Ramenman;THEAnimeHERO;https://myanimelist.net/profile/THEAnimeHERO;8;"This anime is a spin-off from the wrestling series Kinnikuman, however Kinnikuman knowledge isn't necessary to watch this series. Tatakae!! Ramenman is a very episodic series filled with martial arts action usually being over-the-top but shares themes of heroism and honor. In short, this series is the Chinese version of Fist Of The North Star.As mentioned earlier, the titular character Ramenman was originally from Kinnikuman but due to massive popularity Ramenman earned his own manga series which eventually became adapted into anime form. While it is a spin-off to Kinnikuman, Tatakae!! Ramenman follows it own mythology beginning from Ramenman's childhood and his further training as a man. The series is set in vague locations in China but occasionally diverts into fictional martial arts and sometimes science fiction. Ramenman is a wandering hero who seeks to reach an enlightened state as a martial artist. He also has a duty to fulfill his school's teachings and follow them to the letter. Most of the action comes from Ramenman having to save a village from bandits and villainous martial artists which usually lead Ramenman to show off his 102 techniques (although we only see about 20 or so). Ramenman is accompanied by his student; a boy named Shumai whose actress voices Meat in Kinnikuman. As you may have noticed, the basic set up is similar to Fist Of The North Star but as an interesting piece of shonen history... Tatakae!! Ramenman manga predates Fist Of The North Star. It is debatable whether which series came up with certain ideas first but both anime/manga still contain their own differences.The series focuses on Ramenman's travels in China but will occasionally be forced to train to master a new technique or reminisces of his younger days as a disciple. It's events such as these that the stop series from getting repetitive as these multiple scenarios allow for Ramenman to gain wisdom and shows that he isn't completely invincible. As expected in martial arts shonen, the anime creates a mystical atmosphere but also follows the same tropes of 1980's shonen which often revolve around the concepts of masculinity, justice, friendship and sometimes love.One flaw to the series is the lack of more intimidating villains. While there's plenty of foes giving worthy challenges to Ramenman, none of them really offer an interesting foil to Ramenman or can be respected as a fan favorite among other anime villains. Despite being episodic there are two ongoing plots or perhaps better said recurring scenarios. One conflict is Ramenman searching for his sister which he finds early on the series but doesn't want to reveal being her brother as his sister hates martial artists. Personally, I didn't find this subplot too important to the series and could've been better without it. The one recurring villain is man named Jewel King whose notable feature is being voiced by the late Kenji Utsumi(Raoh, Kamogawa, Senbei Norimaki and various others.) While he does come prepared with new methods in an attempt to defeat Ramenman, it does get a bit tiring seeing him escape and shouting ""I'll get you next time Ramenman!""This being the work of Yudetamago also shares certain inconsistencies similar to their work in Kinnikuman. Basically, expect some bizarre moments or errors such as a character losing his arm only to have it back a few episodes later. It should be noted that the series gradually turns more like Kinnikuman as it nears its ending. The best example is the final arc as it becomes a tournament battle complete with referees bearing a similar tone to Kinnikuman's wrestling matches.Tatakae!! Ramenman is an amazing shonen series that embraces the martial arts gimmick in a mostly serious tone. Unlike the Kinnikuman anime, Ramenman's spin-off has a great balance of utilizing comedy and its over-the-top action as much of the martial arts are very ludicrous but filled with enjoyable creativity. My last words of criticism is the series length as the last two episodes are just a recap of the anime, ending with a final shot of new animation as it bids farewell. Ramenman... he's RAMENMANLY!!!";Recommended
0;Kennosuke-sama;Thedude3445;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Thedude3445;7;A short movie based on an Akira Toriyama one-shot comic that is downright adorable. Set in a modern Japan that is still culturally stuck in Samurai times somehow, one young boy gets asked on a date by a classmate and tries to figure out exactly what a date is and gets advice from his pig-ninja friend.The type of humor here is very much akin to an American comic strip, where it's just kids being kids, misunderstanding how life works and making huge assumptions that turn into comedy gold. And for some reason, there's a swordfight and everything's in a fantasy world. There aren't explicit Dragon Ball connections, but it feels very much like a part of that world, out in some remote island or something.And in a confusing twist for a Toriyama production, there is no adult innuendo or crude humor to be found in here. This could air on American television circa 1990 and get away with no censorship. That's the craziest thing I heard all day.So if you want to pass a nice, cute 20 minutes, Give Kennosuke-sama a chance.;Recommended
1;Kennosuke-sama;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"“Kennosuke-sama” is a short movie based on a one-shot Akira Toriyama manga that was shown in theaters alongside a Dragon Ball Z movie and another short film in 1990. Due to its length, the movie ends rather abruptly, but it’s pretty enjoyable for what it is.This movie is about a kindergartner samurai boy named Kennosuke, who lives in an anachronistic world which combines elements from medieval and modern Japan. After school, a girl named Oden asks him out on a date, and he agrees to it, but there’s just one problem — he doesn't know what a date is. He asks his mother, who gives him a vague idea of the concept, and then goes to his pig ninja servant/friend, Shinobimaru, for help. Shinobimaru’s advice is misguided, to say the least, causing Kennosuke to get into various kinds of trouble. Will his date with Oden be successful in the end, or will he fail and be deemed “terrible” by his suitor?The plot is easy to understand and follow along with, and ends on a decent note, although the ending is abrupt — I would have liked to see the aftermath of everything that happened. The characters, naturally, don’t get much development, but their personalities are distinctive and they are likable.The whole thing looks and sounds like “Dragon Ball,” which makes sense given that this is based on a Toriyama manga. Two of the characters in particular closely resemble characters from that series, and one even has the same voice actor. The voice acting is good, and the music is cute and goofy, fitting the movie well. The setting is one of the best things about this anime — the world looks interesting, not just due to its anachronistic elements, but also because some of its inhabitants include talking animals. It would have been nice if there had been more time to explore it.As for potentially objectionable content, although this should be a family-friendly movie considering what other films it was shown with, there are a few crude visual gags in it. There’s a scene in which a character briefly flips someone the bird; Shinobimaru is shown secretly rifling through a copy of “Playboy” magazine for date information; and, most prominently, there’s a villain whose clothing is emblazoned with the phrase “F*** YOU!!” in multiple locations instead of a traditional samurai crest.Overall, the aforementioned crude humor aside, “Kennosuke-sama” is an anime that’s short and sweet — but too short to leave much of an impact. However, if you want something that’s quick and easy to watch, and the lack of a solid conclusion and character development don’t bother you, I’d recommend checking this little movie out.";Recommended
0;High School Agent;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;"Kousuke is just your average high school student...but with a secret. On the weekends, he jets off around the world as a super-secret spy! How can he manage to balance his James Bond missions with homework? (Example: He is ordered to head off to the Arctic Ocean to recover Hitler's secret gold, but that would mean missing out on his date with way-above-his-league-girl at Disneyland. Oh, and don't forget to finish that English assignment for class on Monday!) Wacky hijinks ensue!Well, that's the idea, anyway. It would be best advised not to think too hard about the impossibility of the scenario, and how un-spy-like he acts. Adhering to strict reality is not the point of this OVA, but rather the point is to put a wacky high school student in these high-action scenarios (think as ""viewer insert character"") and watch him live out the fantasy.Or, once again...that's the idea. Only problem is: they really did a terrible job trying to meet up with that story concept. The artwork and the animation are second-rate *at best*. The main character is utterly hopeless: he's not very bright, he's not very competent, he's brash and a little annoying, not good at following instructions, he's hopelessly naive -- in short, your average, everyday teenage boy. Always getting his neck saved by his minder (who also happens to be his teacher, wink wink), Kousuke is actually a terrible spy, even by the low standards set in these two stories.Seems to me they were trying to set this up as a recurring series that never got off the ground.

The only draw back to the mad lib approach is the sense you are missing a little from the plot.-the underlining message to me was we as humans have the need to belong. This stems as early being an infant and craving attention. Which stemmed to needing friends. Then became needing money than needing a companion. While the message is not vocal pay attention to the character's height. Without being revealing to what happens in this movie let me tell you what could happen if one doesn't belong in life.

0;Bounty Hunter: The Hard;Mandalorian;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mandalorian;7;"Have you ever heard or read about this anime? No? Well, me neither until I randomly found it in the recommended videos section on YouTube. It's a very obscure OVA from 1996 based on a possibly even more obscure manga by the same author of the more known Riki-Oh. Oddly enough, I found it dubbed and the dubbing was good quality with well known and top notch voice actors.It's made by the famous J.C. Staff, a very renowned animation studio with plenty of resources, so the art and animation (which are in full 1990s style) are good. Character design is cool and the sketches of New York City, where the story is set, are realistic and detailed.The plot is quite simple but it works just fine for a 45 minutes OVA: it's a crime story. The main character, Kenji Hado, is a Japanese bounty hunter living in NYC who struggles every day to earn some money and get by. One day he steps into an apparently easy case that will lead him into serious trubles.There isn't much character development but you can't expect it anyway from a short anime. By the way ""not much"" is still better than nothing.Bounty Hunter: The Hard is an enjoyable, easy to watch anime which can still entertain you even if you don't have great expectations, and this made me think it deserved a solid 7 out of 10 overall.";Recommended
1;Bounty Hunter: The Hard;neo_retro_otaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/neo_retro_otaku;7;"Simply put, Bounty Hunter is an OVA heavily inspired by classic American action. Cobra (1986) is probably the closest work to it and in terms of other animated works, Kenichi Sonoda's Riding Bean and Gunsmith Cats are good matches. It is very much a product of its time and does contain some dialogue/depictions that would not fly today but it adds to the gritty atmosphere of the main location featured, that is, New York City's South Bronx.Considering how short the film is, I don't really want to dive too deeply into it, however, what I do want to say is if you miss the days gone by of good ol' fashioned action and all its over-the-top chase scenes, firefights, and questionable continuity, then you have come to the right place! Bounty Hunter does little to stand out but it is quite solid in terms of animation, character designs, background art, music, action, and it tells a decent story. The film, however, nails what it's trying to go for in terms of atmosphere and it's not afraid to point directly at the anguish plaguing the urban settings Hard (the film's bounty hunter and main character) finds himself scrounging for details in. South Bronx feels like a character in and of itself, making the film a somewhat immersive experience especially if you've ever had the pleasure of walking through NYC, having to tip-toe around broken glass and getting a whiff of the city's ""unique odors"". It's all here and hopefully this overview inspires you to give it a shot.";Recommended

This is basically just 6 minutes of naked little girls and robots. It's labled as a hentai but while there's plenty of nudity there's no real sex but girls do get penetrated by a robot however this is more implied than shown. I will say it was at the very least entertaining not because I'm into little girls but just because of how bizarre it was. I have to wonder for what purposes this was made and if there's some sort of social commentary behind this. I'm sure I'm over thinking things but that's the fun of this kind of weird stuff. Perhaps having subs would clear things up a bit or just make this more confusing.If you're a fan of oldschool anime and don't mind the Lolicon elements id say give it a shot it's only 6 minutes. It's more notable for its novelty value than anything else.;Mixed Feelings
0;Bocchan;Onihige;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Onihige;7;As a fan of Soseki Natsume's literary works, I was quite excited and was looking forward in watching the adaption of Bocchan (Young master). The beautiful animation and character designs perfectly captured the overall feel of the adaption but not plot-wise in detail, thus losing a little of the importance of illustrating the depth of the characters personalities in action. A part of me wished if the adaptation was a little longer to truly capture the novel's essence since Kiyo, Bocchan's old maidservant played a critical role in shaping part of Bocchan's personality. Ideally, Bocchan is a coming-of-age story, and for our protagonist to be called 'Bocchan' without ever finding out his true name truly shows how pure he is to the ways of the world. It is a meaningful slice of life experience that is truthful to some extent in its humourous, yet light-hearted portrayal. Reading the novel will perhaps be more satisfactory to those who wish to delve more into the story and in bits of Japanese culture as well.;Recommended

So that's the kind of show we're dealing with.I skimmed the episode again just to make sure I could give a somewhat coherent review of it. The story takes place firmly in the world where all the monsters of Monster Strike come from, magic and fairies and all that. We get a setup about a missing persons case and a detective who's on the job with his trusty fairy side kick and full on magical girl transformation sequence into a ninja Sherlock Holmes mode. If all of this sounds super whacky and memorable I'd refer you to the opening paragraph.

Maybe I am wrong about something or I am supposed to watch something else before this OVA. If there is anything you want to tell me, message me and I will change my review.Ok, let’s start:I randomly discovered this anime while scrolling through the Top-Anime Leaderboard. I recently started watching bad anime just for the enjoyment of it.This OVA instantly had my attention:An OVA, only one Episode and the animation looked relatively good at the first glance.This anime has to my knowledge no other episodes or anything else.So it should tell the whole story, right?WRONGThis anime starts off without introducing any of the characters, throwing you right into the action. I was really confused at the beginning of the OVA and was hoping it would get better. Well, I was wrong again. The anime talks about fairys and their powers all the time. What are these? Why do they exist? What do they do? Well, none of that stuff hets answered. Apparently some kind of evil corporation is trying to steal their powers... Why? What do they need them for? What are they? Well, none of that gets answered too.[There may be some spoilers in the next part but since its only one episode, you shouldn’t care much anyway.]Ok, to start off, why exactly do the main characters live in a human-like world?Obviously we get no answer. There are a lot of plotholes and the studio doesn’t bother to fill them up. The anime starts, something „important“ happens, the next „important“ thing happens. It looks like somebody took an finished anime, cut out all of the important scenes and puts them in one OVA. There is no time to get attached to the characters, no explanation whatsoever and just one „dramatic“ scene after another. The anime expects that we k ow all of the characters, get what they are doing and wants to get is attached to them? Sorry, not in 24 minutes. Maybe take some more time TO EXPLAIN the next time.The animations are, what should I say, average and do not look that bad, it looks like a öot of effort went i to the characters and the setting looks generally pretty interesting.Its pretty sad that everything just got put into one small episode, with more time this could have easily been a solid 8. The effort that was put into the character design goes to waste and the story is too rushed to be even somewhat enjoyable.If the anime would have had a bit more time to explain, it could have been really good. The choice to put it all into one episode ruined everything.I can’t give it more than a 3/10, and rwo out of these points are just because it *could* have been good.(Im pretty tired at the time of writing this, so please don’t hate on me for the trash I just wrote.

Mainly for its deception in comparison to what i believe to have been the original origin film (sepia outlook).I am fine with the idea of taking a popular book/film and remaking it. In that retrospect they did a fine job. From the color down to plot it is quite different. Sadly, in making the change over in age limit affected most of the story's main message. For the stay with you horror imprint was replayed by a comical joke presentation. Good for the moment but without the scare element i doubt most audience members with keep the message of the film to heart.Main message being if you hunt you can be hunted as well. With the film mainly siding on animal lovers of all kinds. As for the character choices i am somewhat taken back on.As for the ending of the film i was greatly appreciative. A far more improved and easier to grasp ending than the original. Seeing how the original show's ending was like a poorly put together puzzle with its odd wording.CharactersA story with a moral of life lesson cruel mistreatment needed some villain to teach the lesson to the hunters. So, a particular choice was made. While that choice of animal is know to be rather vicious they can also be kind just like dogs. In some cases even more so. Point trying to be made is it saddens me every-time i see a common view being ingrained even further into one's minds. For example 401k's plan... most if not some people still think those future bank plans are awesome for retirement. Sadly, they are not. But thanks to common pushes from social conversations, commercials, yada yada are fluxing people they are good which is preventing people from seeing the entire picture. Like Adam says in his television show Adam ruin's everything it is a good plan as a substitution, kind of like a backup plan b but depending on what your career plan is in life can greatly hurt you.;Mixed Feelings

Two by two he manipulates the women surrounding his friend and proceeds to fuck them.What i like most about Kussetsu is a romance that develops steadily throughout, one of the girls he seduces is like himself, a daughter of a politician, they share a wicked scheming mind. They deserve each other, and they're bound for a future in politics. Also the punchline is quite well delivered.;Recommended

0;Fuuma no Kojirou: Fuuma Hanran-hen;Alpharon;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alpharon;7;"Esta review también está en español.Fuuma Hanran-hen (FH-H) is a fifty minutes OVA that serves as the end to Fuuma no Kojirou, the ninja series made by Masami Kurumada, the creator of Saint Seiya (and Ring no Kakero and BTX, among many other... but these two are the ones worth mentioning). Fuuma no Kojirou has a promising start with Yasha-hen (the first six episodes), then it screw it a bit with Seiken Sensou-hen (the second half of the series, also six episodes)... Does this OVA raise the quality again, or sink the project even more? Let's see. But before that, if it wasn't clear enough: this is a third part, a final part, so there are spoilers from the previous incarnations. Go to Fuuma no Kojirou: Yasha-hen to learn if you are interested or not. Now, to the proper review:Fuuma Hanran-hen, which translates as ""The Fuuma rebellion episode"" shows that, while Kojirou and Ryoma were fighting in the moon (literally... after that, one could expect anything from this series), the Fuuma clan is immersed in a huge revolt, and the members are killing each other. Soon, the heroes discover that there's an eye jutsu involved that make the former loyal ninjas to fight their own kind... It's in the hands of Kojirou and Ryoma, alongside the reintegrated to the plot Shoryu, Kirikaze and Ryuho to realize whats really going on... and by realize, I mean jutsus, swords, and other useful and violent methods to gather information (cause that's the way ninjas solve their problems).So, the premise is interesting... but so it was in Seiken Sensou-hen. So, the real question is: it's well executed? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. For starters, screw the swords, here the ninja techniques are back in all their glory, and that translates in more diverse and better fights. It's only one OVA, so there's no time to lose: the battles are fast, dynamic, and anybody could die. I'm serious: this is the last arc, so everybody are expendable.On the audiovisual department, everything is mostly like the previous OVA, with slight improvements (probably because this is just one long episode). That means, classic late 80's animation, with the already known Kurumada character designs (besides the overused and omnipresent Dragon Shiryu model, Ophiucus Shaina design is quite abundant... there's even a team of side characters that looks like her). The seiyuus are the same from the previous works, and there are no complaints. Both opening and ending are pretty good.So... FH-h meets the expectations one can demand from the end of a series? Yes. The fights are intense, unpredictable and very entertaining. The characters fight and die with dignity. The plot is resolved satisfactorily. No loose ends. If you liked the previous OVA (which I assumed you did, because if not, why are you reading?), this will be a good closure. Highly recommended for fans of classic battle shonens, and especially, for Saint Seiya fans.--------Fuuma Hanran-hen (FH-h) es una OVA de 50 minutos que sirve como final para Fuuma no Kojirou, la saga de ninjas creada por Masami Kurumada, el mismo cristiano responsable de Saint Seiya (y también Ring no Kakero y BTX, entre varios otros… aunque estos son los que vale la pena mencionar). Esta historia arranco muy prometedora con Yasha-hen (primera saga de OVAS, seis capítulos), para después caer un poco con Seiken Sensou-hen (segunda tanda de OVAS, también seis capítulos)... ¿Esta OVA vuelve a subir la calidad, o hunde todavía más al proyecto? Veamos. Pero antes de eso, si no lo dedujeron de… bueno, todo lo que acabo de escribir, esta es la tercera parte de una saga, y para colmo es el final, así que hay spoilers. Vallan a Fuuma no Kojirou: Yasha-hen, para saber si están interesados o no. Ahora si, a la review propiamente dicha:Fuuma Hanran-hen, que se traduce como “El episodio de la rebelión Fuuma”, nos muestra que, mientras Kojirou y Ryoma estaban en la luna (literalmente… después de esto uno podría esperar cualquier cosa), en el clan Fuuma estallo una revuelta, por lo que empieza una matanza entre miembros. Pronto se descubre que hay un jutsu ocular involucrado, que hace que los otrora leales ninjas se vuelvan hacia sus hermanos… está en manos de Kojiro y Ryoma, junto a los traídos nuevamente a la trama, Shoryu, Kirikaze y Ryuho averiguar qué es lo que realmente está pasando, y de paso, sacudir jutsus y espadazos para todos lados, porque así es como los ninjas resuelven sus problemas.Bien la premisa es interesante… pero también lo era la de Seiken Sensou-hen. Lo que deberían preguntarse es, ¿está bien ejecutada? Si, si, y mil veces sí. Para empezar, a la mierda las espadas, acá vuelven las técnicas ninjas en todo su esplendor, lo que se traduce en combates mucho más variadas que los vistos en la saga anterior. Es solo una OVA, así que no hay tiempo que perder: las peleas vuelven a ser rápidas, dinámicas, y cualquiera puede morir en cualquier momento. Es en serio: este es el último arco argumental, así que ya todos son prescindibles.A nivel audiovisual, se mantiene más o menos la calidad general ya vista en las dos sagas de OVAS anteriores, con ligeras mejorías (probablemente por ser solo una OVA larga). O sea, animación clásica de finales de los 80, con los ya muy conocidos diseños de personajes del universo Kurumada (como curiosidad, a parte del siempre utilizado modelo del dragón Shiryu, en esta OVA en particular es el diseño de Ofiuco Shaina el que se hace presente en abundancia… incluso los personajes tienen la cara tapada igual que ella) . Los seiyuus son los mismos de las partes anteriores, y no hay quejas. Buen opening y ending.Entonces, FH-h cumple con las expectativas que uno puede pretender del final de una saga? Si. Las peleas son rápidas, intensas, impredecibles y muy entretenidas. Los personajes luchan y mueren con dignidad. La trama se resuelve de manera satisfactoria. No quedan cabos sueltos. Si les gustaron las OVAS anteriores (lo que es obvio, porque si no, por que estarían leyendo esto?), esta va a cumplir con sus expectativas. Muy recomendado para los fans de los shonens de peleas clásicos, y especialmente, para los fanáticos de Saint Seiya.";Recommended

However, the story never builds upon this foundation and about halfway through it just ends up being kind of boring and repetitive.The art isn't that great considering this was released in 1998. The art looks more like something you would have seen in the late 80's or early 90's. It's not horrible looking, but it looks like the kind of thing that was definitely created on a tight budget.Audio is decent, the soundtrack isn't good or bad, just kind of there, and the Japanese voice actors, while a few of the supporting characters sounded a little flat, the main actors did about as good of a job as you would expect from a budget title like this.Overall, Dream Hazard is a hentai with an interesting premise, but it fails to capitalize on it. The story drifts off into just a bunch of sex scenes, and nothing else really happens. I guess this is to be expected from a hentai, but with the lackluster visuals on top of that it kept it only mildly entertaining, and it eventually got a bit boring.";Not Recommended

Raven Tengu Kabuto is only 45 minutes, but this is one of the funniest, most batshit insane examples of ""So bad it's good"" anime I've ever come across. Strap yourselves in because we're going on a wild ride!Background:I feel like there's something missing in modern anime. We get generic shonen tropes, self referential humor, attempts at genre subversion, and occasionally something artsy and esoteric. What we honestly lack in the modern day is gloriously over the top, stupid, fun, with zero irony or sense of self awareness. Anime has become almost depressingly self aware. Furthermore, the internet and globalization means that Japanese animation studios have finally become aware that the world IS watching. This has led to self censorship and Japanese artists being WAY more self conscious about what they put on the screen. On the one hand, there are some benefits to this. If you're trying to get your buddy into watching an anime for the first time, modern fans can show off stuff like My Hero Academia or One Punch Man. They don't have to get real nervous while trying to desperately explain Mr. Popo in Dragonball or the staggering amount of child nudity in Elfen Lied. On the other hand, we no longer see that totally carefree attitude where the anime director CLEARLY thought that only 50 Japanese people were ever going to see this. This means we get a lot less WTF hilarity and ""So bad its good"" anime have basically become extinct.Raven Tengu Kabuto is one of those aforementioned awesomely bad anime that could never exist today. That's because today's industry doesn't have writers with the attitude of Buichi Terasawa. Today I'm reviewing his work Kabuto, but Terasawa is most famous for his manga Cobra and its anime adaptions. Back in the late 1970s, when Rose of Versailles was getting praised for its intelligent writing and Joe was tragically dying the ring, Japan fell in love with the cheesy action-adventure Cobra. This was a simple series about a side burn having, cigar chomping, hard bastard with a gun for a hand. He rescued space princesses and kicked ass across the galaxy. It didn't try to be deep. It didn't try to appeal to highbrow critics. It was just stupid fun and it became a HUGE international success. Even Osamu Tezuka himself befriended Terasawa! Kabuto takes Terasawa's approach to writing and condenses it down into 45 glorious minutes. Nothing makes any sense. Nothing has greater meaning. The only thing that matters is that it looks cool and is fucking badass!Plot:The plot takes place in feudal Japan. An evil sorceress has taken over a small feudal state and has enslaved its people. The men toil all day in the mines, while the women were all murdered so their souls could fuel the sorceress's dark magic. It is up to our hero Kabuto to kill the sorceress, rescue the princess, and liberate the kingdom. Unfortunately, the sorceress has a giant army of robots built by her mad scientist minion. Kabuto is a fucking baller with an 80s mullet, a magic sword, and the ability to grow wings and fly awkwardly as an homage to the Flash Gordon movie. I'm dead serious. He can also summon flocks of ravens for absolutely no reason. After killing a bunch of robot ninjas to some truly kickass guitar solos, Kabuto confronts the sorceress...who gets naked for no reason. It turns out that the sorceress is just a robot that was built by the mad scientist and is under his control! Why is a robot using sorcery? Why does a robot need soul power? Why is the scientist constantly shown begging the robot for permission and being submissive when it is just them in the room? None of these will ever be answered, because this is a Terasawa anime. After summoning the power of bullshit, Kabuto defeats the robot sorceress and that instantly activates her self destruct countdown. Kabuto grabs the princess and casually flies out of the flying fortress, which btw is a hut with a helicopter rotor blades. The fortress explodes, instantly killing the mad scientist and the anime just stops immediately afterwards! Bravo!Audio:If you're going to watch this shitty anime, you will get maximum enjoyment out of watching the English dub. This was an early attempt by Manga UK and it might be the worst I've ever heard from those guys. Yes, worse than Angel Cop or Mad Bull 34. It doesn't have the ludicrous swearing because John Wolskel wasn't in charge of the translation. However, it does have some of the worst voice acting and attempts at line syncing I've ever seen. To further illustrate this point, I couldn't find a single actor listed for this piece of shit on MAL, ANN, IMDB, or anywhere else. Even the British ""Big Green Dub"" of DBZ had actor names attached to it. These VAs on the other hand are fucking ghosts. Manga UK must have literally pulled people off the street and given them lines with no context.Overall:If you're together with friends and have 45 minutes to spare, I HIGHLY recommend watching this train wreck. It is free to watch on Youtube and I promise you will get some serious laughs out of it. My ribs were sore after watching this one.";Not Recommended

A simple and straight forward advertisement thats easy for anyone to enjoy and get influenced (even if the characters aren't real people).

0;Kiss wa Hitomi ni Shite;mikitastic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mikitastic;7;It all begins when Ibuki dreams about kissing a Prince. Then, she wakes up and finds out she's late for school, and rushes to get there.While in class, the teacher starts calling the students's names, and she notices a guy who's late for class trying to get into the classroom without being noticed by the teacher. When she sees the guy, she screams: it's the same guy who appeared in her dream!By the end of the class, the guy asks her for them to go home together. He enters her home, and she finds out he's her father's best friend's son, who came from Canada and will be living with her family. His name is Ebisu Naoto.The storyline was interesting, though it had lots of clichés. This OVA is 'old' (from 1993), so the 'graphics' and the traces aren't THAT great.But, because it is an OVA, if you don't like stories that are too rushed and that the storyline and the characters aren't that developed, I do not recommend you this anime.As an avid fan of shoujo animes, I did not enjoy this one. Like I said above, the relationships and interactions between the main characters didn't develop to a point that I could feel they had chemistry and intimacy. Also, many situations in the anime remained unresolved, without a proper ending or explanation.;Recommended
0;Kiss wa Hitomi ni Shite;lethargilistic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lethargilistic;3;The problem with these 30-minute shoujo OVAs is that they are commercials for much longer manga series. This series was 10 volumes long. This doesn't NECESSARILY have to be a problem, if the full story is summarized effectively (if that happens to be possible). But, it seems like they didn't bother with summarizing at all. They just adapted a linear chunk of the manga and left it off because it hasn't finished serializing yet. And that means nothing can come back around to create moments of satisfying closure.This one is a particularly egregious example of that because the series hook—her kissing a prince in her dream—turned out to be a complete non sequitur after the real boy was introduced.;Not Recommended
0;Kero Kero Chime;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"The pastel-colored world of “Kero Kero Chime” is a world of wonder and adventure, teeming with a diverse array of friendly, funny creatures. It is a world where conflict is born only from misunderstandings, and no one is truly evil. Everyone can be forgiven; everyone can become a friend. And no matter what difficult situation you may find yourself in, you can rest assured that the outcome will be A-OK. As long as you don’t think too much.This series is about a boy named Aoi who suddenly gets “cursed” by a “wizard” so that he becomes a frog whenever he comes into contact with water. The “wizard” then tells Aoi to come to his world and look for a girl named Mimori, who he says can turn him back to normal. So Aoi goes to this other world and after a lot of searching, finally comes across Mimori, who is the princess of the Frog People. However, she has no clue how to undo the spell, and so the two set out on a grand adventure across a goofy, exotic world, meeting new friends and getting into trouble along the way, in search of pages of a magic book that may contain the spell to undo the transformation “curse.”The premise of the series holds promise, and did get me invested in the series as I progressed through the episodes, wondering what strange creatures/beings they would come across next, what trouble they would get in, and how they would get out of it. (Because they would always get out of it; this is that kind of show.) More than that, however, I wanted answers to the fundamental questions of the series: why did the “wizard” turn Aoi into a frog? Why did no one seem to know any details about the “war,” even though it happened only 10 years ago? And why did everyone think that the Frog and Snake People were enemies?Saying specifically whether any of these questions were answered or not may go into spoiler territory, so, to make it vague, I will just say that the ending is anticlimactic. They avoid explaining the difficult plot points, take the easy way out and make the whole thing a gag, which is disappointing after all the buildup.Ending aside, what about the rest of the plot? Well, most of the episodes are enjoyable, as long as you don’t question too much. Plot holes and deus ex machinas abound. Sometimes it seems as if the writers are just making things up as they go along. But through each episode, there’s a comforting, peaceful feeling that assures you that everyone will get out of whatever predicament they’re in just fine, and the show never really takes a “dark” turn. “Kero Kero Chime” is comedy- and gag-laden; one of my favorite gags is how the character Makaeru enters the scene on a flying/floating chariot, but his derpy-looking horse is always accompanied by “clip-clop” sound effects. Most of the other main characters tend to have catchphrases or other defining comedic traits: for instance, the crystal ball Shoko and her cousin, Shotaro, often speak in English, which can be annoying at times, but also hilarious. The main “villains” of the story display Team Rocket-levels of incompetence.Character interactions can be frustrating at times, however. Mimori is incredibly naive, to the point where she doesn’t understand basic concepts like “battles” or “dates,” and, of course, this gets her in trouble, and Aoi is often scolding her because of this. Leap apologizes a lot, and also often argues with Shoko, which is supposed to be humorous, but the humor feels forced. If it’s convenient to the plot, characters may act out of character and in ways that defy logic. There are a few unnecessary comments about Mimori’s chest size (she’s 14… there shouldn’t be any comments of that sort at all).As for technical aspects, the animation is fair. Not the greatest, but it gets the job done. The art has a fairy tale-like washed-out pastel look. The character designs are nice. Non-human characters are mostly round and silly-looking.The first OP and ED are decent, though I don’t really care for the “sexy” line while showing Mimori in the OP. The second OP and ED, which are both sung by Mimori’s voice actress, aren’t as good. The second ED, in particular, is almost like a music video, showing live-action shots of the singer, and doesn’t really fit the tone of the series.The best technical parts of this series are the sound effects and background music. Both of these are great, especially the BGMs. They’re memorable and appropriate for each scene.Finally, the voice acting. Most of the characters are voiced by people whose main line of work is not voice acting, and it shows. Others just had bit parts in around half a dozen anime over the years. The people who voice the two main characters, Aoi and Mimori, have the most experience, but Aoi is usually just yelling or spouting off about something, and Mimori’s voice doesn’t have much range, either. Makaeru’s voice almost sounds wooden at times. However, there is one major, major exception to all of this, and that is a relatively minor character who shows up and joins the group towards the end of the series. This character is a pirate captain, and is voiced by none other than the voice of Luffy herself, Mayumi Tanaka! Since this series aired a full two years before One Piece started, perhaps her performance in this role had something to do with her later landing the Luffy role. In any case, we get to hear a proto-Luffy of sorts in the last 5 episodes of the series, which is a treat.Overall, this show could be considered a palate cleanser. If you’ve watched something dark and/or depressing, or a psychological show that made you think so hard that your brain needs a break, relax and give “Kero Kero Chime” a try. It’s far from perfect, but who needs perfection when you have a happy, colorful adventure, surrounded by happy, colorful friends in a happy, colorful world?";Mixed Feelings
0;Modern Love Tokyo: Kare ga Kanaderu Futari no Shirabe;Aesethyr;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Aesethyr;8;"This is one of those ""Niche and heavily underrated anime film for 2022"".I have watched this anime movie last year when it was still not yet available via MAL. It premiered via Amazon Prime.This anime is the inspired adaptation/based off a Japanese Drama with the same name and have launched in the same year. Certainly this had caught me off guard on how good the story and the presentation. The good thing about the film? it has that happy ending.The anime is about a woman (Tamami) who is struggling in her adult life. While drinking in a bar she then hears a rock song that she used to listen in her youth. During her younger years, she met Rin (an aloft guy that plays piano alone in the school gym). The film is the retelling of their past and what happens after they met in the present day.The animation is unique but you can never really say ""its one of its own"". However, it has done a great job on that department.The only downside I felt worth mentioning is the ""length"" of the movie. For 30 minutes, I felt like this should have been 1 hour to fully flesh out the story. Rather it felt rushed and some plot holes left unexplained. Nonetheless there is nothing that made me feel like confused.If you really wanted a good romance anime film - this is certainly a good recommendation.";Recommended
0;Mitsume ga Tooru;mottowers;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mottowers;9;"Story:The story is blatantly boring in the beginning. At first it is slow. It constantly gives you side stories, but somewhere along the middle, the story takes a much more rapid pace and starts packing more action into every episode. The finale for this show is really a spectacle and a fitting end to the series. While I would ask for more from this series, Tezuka Osamu is no longer with us and I do not believe there could be a better ending to this show.EDIT 2019: I found this portion I wrote years ago lacking so I'm here to add more to it.The show starts off episodically featuring the many separate incidents involving Sharaku. After 20 episodes or so the show begins to add backstory to Sharaku's mysterious background as well as reveal a darker side to the story. As I had mentioned before, the ending is quite fitting. Like Tezuka Osamu's Pheonix, it presents a potential questions and problems we may come across in a distant future.Art:Like many of Tezuka Osamu's creations, it has a unique art style compared to other animes. It leans towards a Disney art style compared to your standard anime art style. The background art is fine. Nothing stands out much, which is good or else it wouldn't be called a background. The ancient statues and temples are based on actual ruins.Sound:The OST is unique. I mean you don't here ""sha-la-la"" and ""rune-rune-rune"" in any other anime OSTs.Unlike the unique opening, the music can be rather peaceful and sometimes ominous.Characters:The main character Sharaku. Is first shown to be super childish and mentally slow. His character design really shows off his dopiness and his stupidity. His other personalty is the exact opposite of him. He is shown to be super clever and a genius. Just imagine hot pink next to dark purple.Wato is a decent foil to Sharaku. She constantly protects slow Sharaku, but is always toyed by genius Sharaku.Enjoyment:This show is truly underrated. It's current mediocre score here on this site does not reflect just how endearing this show can be. Yes the animation is somewhat crude and it might look look slightly weird at first, but I really did enjoy the show the more I invested my time into it. Again, the finale is epic and feels for the monkey girl.";Recommended

I'm unsure the order they filmed these in, but it's arguably some of the best voice acting work in the series.The isn't all that much to say about the intros and outros, but they are exactly what you would expect.

0;Suashi no Houkago;Nikorasuuuu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Nikorasuuuu;1;"As a piece of anime and hentai history, Suashi no Houkago may look pretty interesting, as it was made more than 35 years ago, in 1985. But as an anime you would watch on your free time? Absolutely terrible, no one should try it. But, come on - it was 1985! They had a lot of time to evolve. So, Suashi is what you could name a ""prototype-hentai"" OVA.About the technical aspects... I usually do anime encodes for my fansub (the things I do for love!), so I understand some good things about audio and video. And here, in Suashi no Houkago, things are... definitely not good. As MAL says on the description, Suashi no Houkago was originally part of an OVA ""series"", the Little Mermaid Series, which included 3 other OVAs (which, let me tell you, also doesn't look that good.), but what MAL DOESN'T tell you is that Suashi no Houkago was released FOUR times! In VHS, VCD, LaserDisc and even DVD, this little piece of animation was there. But you may ask, ""what difference does this make""? Well, I watched both the VCD and DVD versions (both japanese because this obviously didn't get to the US or any other country), and the thing is, they may probably one of the lousiest video masters I've ever saw. Audio is missing, frames too... Not that it makes a big difference, since the animation here is really bad, too. And I say ""audio"", when it's pretty much some badly acted speech sequences followed by a weird 80s song. Different times, maybe.Story and char. designwise, there's not much to say. It's your basic ""girl loves girl - lesbianism ensues"" plot, and to be honest, with only 26 minutes, i don't think there was much more that could be done. Character design looks bad, but like I said before - it was 1985. They improved a lot with time, at least.I wouldn't exactly say to you ""Don't watch Suashi no Houkago, it's bad!"" as it may be an interesting piece of history. But as for its quality? Bad, very bad.

The surreal imagery almost does not matter. Because on a first watch, this might be getting your attention, but afterward, it feels natural, like pieces from a puzzle. Even the mature content who symbolizes the male conquering of earth can be strange but needed.The thing that feels less creative is the choosing of these symbols and the overall meaning of the story, Tsuji’s vision being noteworthy, but too common these days. The surrealism, in the end, feels sentimental and for this reason lacks the power to ""be alive"", to transcend the paper. It reminded me of a comic by Chester Brown, ""Ed the Happy Clown"", a piece of random surreal narrative for the ones with a stronger taste.""Tsuji’s method involves drawing with charcoal on paper, photographing the result, erasing the plate and redrawing the next frame.

0;Monster Strike The Animation Episode 0;lamaraptor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lamaraptor;6;Why is this a separate entry? So that someone like me would come along and write a review of it, of course.We see Oragon enter a run-down modern Japanese apartment, do some product placement for the game he's from, and celebrate his birthday alone as all of his friends can't make it. It's unclear if this is Oragon as he exists in the timeline of the Monster Strike Anime starring Ren and all them, or if this is just Oragon the mascot character a general representation of Monster Strike as a franchise, and it doesn't seem to matter. Point is he's living a sad life and appears utterly alone, so if it is in that Ren timeline I guess the power of friendship and all that was a lie.Anyway he's quickly isekai'd to some sort of library and we get the setup that this episode is just a framing device for the new Monster Strike Anime that is going to star characters like Lucifer and primarily take place in the Monster Strike world rather than our real world. Maybe in that sense it can be seen as a prequel to the other show where eventually all the worlds are blended into ours as more and more portals open up, but that doesn't explain Oragon's presence and really I get the sense that these aren't the sorts of questions they were expecting people to ask or have to come up with answers for.This episode only really matters to explain the little stingers in between arcs later where the mysterious box character is introducing stuff. If you skipped it you'd still probably be fine because that stuff doesn't really matter to the main plot and isn't brought up again until the final arc where it turns out it didn't really matter much anyway, except to presumably sell more Oragon and Pink Oragon plushies.So it's an episode designed to setup merchandising opportunities in a franchise that already only exists as a merchandising tool for what was already the most profitable mobile game ever.

Which begs the question why show it?3.Art. What a poor production. The budget must have been low. My take was the art was just the first stages of sketches with colors put in.4. Also the art's backgrounds in some of the scenes were pathetic. Just random colors with no clear line. Was i floating? was i looking at a painting? you can't say that was shown was actually that!5. Characters shown did not have a background at all6. The way the film started could have been greatly improved.

0;Fight!!;Basicpleb420;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Basicpleb420;3;"The best thing about one-shot OVAs is that they don't demand a great deal of your time. You put your eyes on the screen for 30-60 minutes, and that's all there is to it. However, not all OVAs are created equal, as the subject of today, Fight!!, shall attest to.Story:There is not much to say for this anime in regards to story. Don't come here expecting something life-changing, or clever, or original, or even straightforward.You got Yonosuke, your ostensibly run-of-the-mill hero who secretly has the fate of the world in his hands. A simple mix-up lands him into some trouble and he soon has to fight the biggest battle he has known...or so you would think. This anime is called Fight!!, yet there's hardly any action and when there is, it's incredibly underwhelming. Talk about false advertising.Further ruining this anime is its questionable writing and shoddy editing. For example, Earth is referred to as ""Heaven,"" while the world Arare and the Inbe brothers (yes, brothers) come from is referred to as ""the Earth world."" Confusing, huh?Characters:Since this OVA is only 30 minutes, there's not a lot of time to flesh out characters. Unsurprisingly, the most developed character is Yonosuke, followed by the Inbe brothers.That said, there's one question I have about the characters that has yet to be answered: Who are the two guys who live with Yonosuke? Their relation to him is never explained.Music:If you like synthesizers and flutes, you're in luck because there's a lot of those in this particular soundtrack.There's a nice, gentle number at the end which I felt deserved to be in a better anime.Art:I wouldn't have known this anime was made in 1993 just by looking at it. The art looks much older than that. Of course, this was made before J.C.Staff became the power house it is today.The most detailed and expressive part of this anime comes at the 6:15 mark, where we zoom in on the old shopkeeper's face. I can't explain why, but it seems to me most of the animation budget was spent on that one moment in particular.Enjoyment:I can't say I enjoyed this anime. I did watch it a few times, but only to make this review. The problem with Fight!! is that it's not good by any stretch of the imagination. However, it's not downright abysmal; there is nothing here that makes me want to slam my head into a wall. It also doesn't veer into so-bad-it's-good territory. It's not a popcorn flick. It exists and that's all there is to it.There are some parts where I want to like this anime, but flimsy execution makes it a moot point.Oh well. All in all, I would give this anime a 3.One more thought before I go. If you do decide to watch this anime, pay close attention to the phone number on the business card at the 14:01 mark. Then, look at the number on the shop's marquee a few seconds later. Yeah, really. That happened.";Not Recommended

The music feels a bit disjointed, sort of like Daft Punk's Electroma, but while that one had a very basic plot that felt sort of empty this one has a mess of a ideas a bit too pseudointelectual for my taste (humans are the same as animals, every day people are born and die, I'm just one more of them, ""Motherfucker while you sleep your all my sheep I'll conquer the world"", all this taken from text on screen). If you can see it all as music lyrics then, you know, music doesn't tend to get the most insightful stuff in the world anyway. You're not going to get mad at Interstella 5555's lyrics.Visually it's a mixture of rotoscopy, computer generated backgrounds in lineart and extremely hands on snippets of either constantly changing figures or hand written stuff. It feels like a middle point between one of the less interesting Waking Life parts and 12oz Mouse.The music is okay for me, but I think this is the key point for enjoying this. If it's you enjoy the sound then the pictures pass as an extra you didn't ask for. If you don't you'll suffer through trying to understand what's the point of all this and how has it been only 18 minutes so far.";Mixed Feelings
0;Apartment!;Wilio;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wilio;4;Apartment is an over simplified piece of animation that simply fails at being remotely interesting.Really, it is sad that this anime failed, because the story did hold quite an interesting premise that was to picture the whole apartment and those who live in it. However, despise that premise, it is clear that the man behind the project, Jun Aoki, was downright lazy when he produced this piece of animation. Don't get me wrong though, I am at no point criticizing the length of the anime which I think perfectly fits the style. On the contrary, I'm criticizing the lack of interest that the man actually put in his work. This to say, Apartment! does try to show the audience the repetitive and mundane life of living in apartment, and this with an humouristic touch, but it's all downright pointless. Even if the message is clear, watching a bunch of badly drawn cartoons doing simple tasks is an antonym to the word Entertainment.The production value is also quite bad. Surely we can't blame him for being the only one behind the project and we certainly can't compare him to the big industries with tons of money, but still, following the same standards, it is still terrible. Let me remind you that anime such as Pale Cocoon, Voices of a Distant Star and There she Is!! are all projects with one mperson behind. Even in the non-anime style of drawing, I can find tons of animation shorts on Newgrounds better produced than Apartment!, and if not actually better as a whole. I can actually see what the man was trying to show with the simplified background and minimalistic animation, supporting the mundane life, but he was at the same time, trying too hard.In the end, as mentionned in my introduction, Aoki tried too much to simplify everything in Apartment! when it wasn't actually needed. Per say, it doesn't hurt to watch it since it's only 5 minutes long.;Not Recommended

Emi to Yobanaide (Don't Call Me Amy) is just a bizarre story and you really do not know what is really going on until the end, and it is a messed up ending. The main character is a girl named Emi who is prone to daydreaming and is in love with her step-brother who she lives alone with. Both Emi and her brother Tomomi share the same birthday, and they plan to celebrate their eighteenth birthday together.Things get weird when a woman claiming to be Emi's deceased father's secretary shows up and tells her that her father left a mountain of debts and that they would have to sell the house to pay it back. Other things start happening, such as the school superintendent forcing Emi to perform sexual acts. It also turns out that Tomomi has a special, once in a century blood type that, once he hits his birthday, will drive every woman insane just from his smell. I'm not going any further to try to explain the story, just know that it is weird.Lets talk animation, this series came out in 1997 and the style is very indicative of that time period, with a fairly rough hand-drawn look to it. I would not say it is a bad style, just dated, and not up to modern anime standards. The character design reminds me a bit of Sailor Moon. My biggest issue is that this hentai is now about 16 years old and is not available uncensored, and the censorship on this piece is just bad. An example is a fellatio scene where 90% of the person's face is censored out, just silly, bad censorship.The sound I found annoying. The voice of Emi in particular was unpleasant and whiny. The music kind of just droned on in the background and bugged me. I guess the ending song was ok, but that's about it.In conclusion, I will not be watching this one again. If you are in the mood for something dated and confusing, this one is for you! If you want to enjoy what you are watching you may want to look elsewhere.;Mixed Feelings
1;Emi to Yobanaide;Angel-With-Gunz;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Angel-With-Gunz;5;SUMMARYEmi to Yobanaide, an anime so confusing even the characters could not remember anyone's name.STORYThe story feels very bizarre and rather inconclusive, with the second episode feeling very rushed, it certainly gives the feeling to me that a third episode was planned and some last minute changes were ordered.The main character is Emi (she really wants you to know her name is not Amy) has a habit of day dreaming about her twin brother in various sexual fantasies which dominate the first episode. We also see Emi panicking about the number of girls who are interested in her brother and she is determined to make sure none of them do.Things start to get weird from this point onwards. The school's headteacher challenges Emi about her fantasies, and we also see the secretary of Emi's deceased father inform Emi that her father left a huge debt.In the remainder of the show we find that all the women are working together to capture Emi's brother (no real explanation why, something about him having a pheromone which seduces every woman), Emi is repeatedly seduced by these four ladies and called Amy (no explanation for this name issue at all), Emi discovers some of her fantasies are possibly real (again no real explanation) and finally nobody even knows where Emi's brother is and after he is found he leaves anyway.All in all, it is very confusing.CHARACTERSMost the characters seemed fairly air headed and clueless. It seemed they were left as confused by the plot as I am. The characters were not too attractive, yet they had fairly large sized breasts.VISUALS and EROTICSThe art style is very typical for an anime from the late 1990s, lots of sharp edges and pointy chins. All the women seem to have western characteristics. The censorship is very extreme, no risks were taken.This anime includes small amounts of bondage and incest. As well as fairly large amount of seduction and lesbianism.HIGHLIGHT MOMENTThe whole thing honestly blurs into one confusing mess to me.CONCLUSIONCannot really recommend this anime unfortunately.OVERALL48/100;Mixed Feelings
0;Emi to Yobanaide;Larganator;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Larganator;2;":Story: Well the basic gist of this story is that a girl named Emi is in love with her brother and want's him to see her as more than just his sister but it turns out he has a ""once in a century blood type"" that will be rendered useless if he does her. So because forces beyond both of the main characters ability to fight conspire against them they end up being separated in the end after his sister's alternate personality has her engage in various lewd acts. (thereby unknowingly stripping her of the virginity she was saving for him) She realizes all of this at end and breaks down because the mental strain of sudden separation causes her to snap and presumably fuses her personalities. You may ask ""Is there an epilogue?"" or ""Is she ever reunited with him in the future?"" and guess what? None of us will ever know because they only made two fucking episodes. Why?! Because fuck you that's why.:Art: This hentai is fairly old so expect art as old school as say Outlaw Star but not near as good most of the sex scenes are decent but some of the animations look so dated they make you laugh.:Sound: The sound is what you would expect from a hentai this dated serviceable but not great, and even though with it's age it may seem like splitting hairs they could have done better.:Character: Almost every character in this hentai annoyed me to the point of having to take a break after I was finished watching it to play one of the more violent games I own just to shoot things in the face. No really they ARE that annoying.:Enjoyment: I have enjoyed almost every other hentai I have ever seen more than I enjoyed this one. Hell I even enjoyed both blackmail hentai more than this atrocity at least they had definitive endings and not open ended bullshit.""Overall"" DO NOT WATCH THIS HENTAI. Their are plenty of other incest related hentai with better story,art,characters,sound,plot etc don't waste your time with this trash.";Not Recommended

0;Bari Bari Densetsu;ParaParaJMo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ParaParaJMo;8;"Part 1 is basically an introduction of the main charactesr and how they unite, and part 2 is mostly driven by development despite being mostly dedicated to the race in Suzuka. I&rsquo;m guessing you need some familiarity with the manga to get some idea of what&rsquo;s going on more directly, maybe such as why Gun races on motorcycles and why he obtained such skill. Gun and Hideyoshi just have your typical rivalry like Inuyasha and Kouga from that respective anime and it&rsquo;s mostly used for comic relief. Ai seems to be more of the token cute girl, and Hiro is there to help Miyuki, while Miyuki was just the token fan service girl with some descent substance.But if anything is going to stick out to you, it&rsquo;s definitely going to be the ending. I can&rsquo;t describe it, you&rsquo;re going to have to see it for yourself because it totally affected me and took me by surprise. Even though there is limited material, it does a descent job of making you care for the characters and the foundation is good enough to understand their characters and to produce development.Well, the art style does somewhat resemble some of the character designs in Initial D, but during the publication of this manga, Morikawa Jyoji, the creator of one of my favorite mangas, Hajime no Ippo, was a staff membe,r and I really see more of his style in this anime than really the Initial D style except for Gun&rsquo;s character design with the way Shigeno draws diamond eyes to make them slanted in an Asian style and he tends to draw faces at a slanted angle as well. But there are some 1980s characteristics of Gun such as the semi-big hair.The rest of the designs are really just generic and that&rsquo;s it. I mean, the way Shigeno draws his lips sometimes is not yet prevalent and I guess he hadn&rsquo;t established his style like that yet. But the way Morikawa draws the eyes and how he draws rectangular faces at times seem to be more present so I&rsquo;m guessing the way Shigeno did things during this time was a major influence in Morikawa&rsquo;s style. For the races, there&rsquo;s really no novelty environmental factors that really make any impact on the race such as gutter gripping, but what makes up for it is that risk factor I talked about in Wangan Midnight. The races are portrayed accurately with the designs of the motorcycles, the postures, the steering and everything. When you see the races in a more 3rd or 1st person perspective, you can see the road and the rest of the foreground and track zooming in on you as if you were driving yourself. Granted it&rsquo;s 1980s, I think it bring a genuine sensuality to the races.As for Suzuka, you might be able to recognize the name from the Gran Turismo games. What's cool is that it times it does give an aerial view of the course, and you'll be able to recognize it from the course maps.But back to the risk factor, there will be some wicked crashes, so if you want to see some crashes, check this out.Despite this being an unknown anime, the featured seiyuus are pretty big names. Starting with Hideyoshi&rsquo;s seiyuu, Nakao Ryuusei, the voice of Freeza from Dragon Ball Z. He does speak in Osaka dialect, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authenticity to the aggression and accent as the voice actor of Sendo does in Hajime no Ippo. But I think the voice does contemplate his small size at some capacity like how it did with Freeza. And Gun is played by Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing and Rayearth in Magic Knight Rayearth, I thought he had a good deep voice, but I thought his performance based on how he was written was of course more one dimensional and I thought he sounded too old. Next Miyuki, our pink haired cutsey fan service racer played by Toda Keiko, who is probably most famous to Gundam fans as the voice of Matilda-san from the original Gundam series. She does an excellent job as playing a more cutsey and innocent girl, but with an adrenaline edge at times.The last seiyuu I want to get into is Ai, played by Jpop sensation Oginome Yoko, who also sings the theme songs. The theme songs are very upbeat in an 1980s manner, and the singing is a little feminine but energetic. Though the music isn&rsquo;t really Eurobeat nor is it really close to the nature of the soundtrack of Initial D, the music ranges from all kinds of beats and styles whether light hearted sounds or intense guitars to set the atmosphere of a funny scene or a last mile race.Well, I found this anime interesting enough to hope that one day I can get my hands on the manga. I would like to know what parts of the manga I was reading as well so I know where I am to understand some of the foundations that are going on. Also, I would like to see one day hopefully a remake of this series because I personally like realistic anime nowadays. I enjoy the careful use of risk factors, and the interactions and relationship developments. But I personally recommend this more for people already familiar with Initial D mostly because it&rsquo;s by the same creator, so you get some understanding of what he does and why. I also recommend this to Hajime no Ippo fans mostly because of the character designs. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Gun resemble Miyata? And to conclude, if you know where you an get the manga, hook me up.";Recommended
0;Megumi no Daigo: Kajiba no Baka Yarou;afrowolf;https://myanimelist.net/profile/afrowolf;6;I found this passably entertaining, but a few things didn't work for me:It's a highly dramatic bit of animation that really seems to be emulating the live-action blockbuster hero action movies of the time. Slow-motion scenes, hyper dramatic soundtrack, a weepy love-interest, and loads of shouting.There is even an antagonist for the hero to win over: a scruffy self-righteous reporter who has impeccable timing for showing up when there is fire-related action. Oh, and he's very concerned about damage to taxpayer property.What makes the above not work is that there is no rising tension to make the final vindication of our hero resonate with the viewer. It's like watching something like Backdraft, from starting it at 40 minutes before the end of the film. You'd be able to get the basic idea, and enjoy the acting and drama, but the climax would be flat, since you would have nothing emotional invested in any of the characters.Apparently that's where the original manga story would come in. It's been licensed, so perhaps I'll be able to read the 20 volumes at some point. I imagine it would be a good story.Final:The way the final scene begins is a completely ridiculous contrivance, but perhaps it made sense in the manga, if it was in the original story at all. I half-hoped Daigo-kun would have just shouted at the fire until it withered under his never-say-die enthusiam.;Mixed Feelings
0;Dankichi-jima no Olympic Taikai;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;5;One of the first things I tend to look at whenever I go into an anime this old is the art and the animation, trying to discern all of the different techniques they used and also simply the quality of the drawings. Dankichi-jima no Olympic Taikai has some pretty basic human character designs, but I thought the animal designs were pretty interesting. However, when comparing the animation to other films of the time period it ends up being kind of simple and average.The story is simple and has a few gags within it. This film was obviously intended to make the audience laugh, and it did get a few chuckles out of me, but it doesn't craft much of a tale, which other films of the era were doing. Still it ends up being fine, and generally enjoyable, if a bit underwhelming.Being a silent film, the audio is pretty much nonexistent. The version I was watching had a reconstructed background track, but I will avoid rating that as I'm not sure how that will appear in other versions of this film.Overall, this is an enjoyable little short film that ends up being kind of average even for the time period, but still worth a watch if you're curious and have a few minutes to spare.;Mixed Feelings

Introduction was covered nicely. Not quite the ending i was expecting. I was expecting more of a reward outlook. Perhaps it was cut short? Was it a friendly game? Intro wise no questions but ending leaves me puzzled. However, the reason could be during the last blog of text the version i watched did not have that part translated either due to lack of time/interest or deciphering was too hard.ArtClear, you can make out what is what. Not bad for an old anime. Just using black and white is fine for the piece. I don't think if color was added it would have added anything to this film.SoundNo animations just a background sound. Which worked with the slight paced show.CharacterThis part could have used some work. We have the two teams but being able to root for a team you need to know something about them. This animation did not really cover any reason why that i noticed to vote for a particular team.EnjoymentA nice laid back short action piece. I suppose if you wanted to you could place a little wager on who will win since you are not guided by the film on the turnout. Normally in films once the main character is known the movie will tend to favor in their favor. Now, that i think of it maybe that is why the character information was light.

1;Pianist;Xionea;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Xionea;5;"PSA: If you plan to watch this, try and find the original Japanese audio with subs (if needed). When I tried to find this, I could only find the English dub, so I had to go with that. Now, what's interesting is that there's TWO English dubs for this obscure hentai, and one is significantly ""better"" than the other. If you're watching the one where the girl, Yuna, sounds like she has two voices stacked on top of each other, avoid that one. It's absolute cringe. I tried it before I found out there was a better dub out there. It literally sounds like a fandub (and it might very well be one! I can't find information on this.) If Yuna sounds like a fairly normal girl, you're good. On to the review.The world's population is steadily decreasing, so humanity has developed humanoid androids to help the world. Seiji is a pianist, but an accident lead to him putting his career on hold. He fell in love with the android nurse who was taking care of him, so he went and bought the same model to live with him. He sees and treats his android Yuna as a human, but not everyone sees androids the same way he does.Art is alright. It's late 90s hentai so it does not age well compared to some modern hentai, however I like 90s art, so I thought it was decent. Remember that version of the dub I told you to avoid? Yeah, whoever picked that up decided to use AI upscaling or something to try and enhance the quality with rather... questionable results.Sound was also alright. Nothing real special about it, but there's a primary focus on piano music for the BGM.The characters are unfortunately one of the really low points for this hentai, Yuna is the most likable one, while Seiji is just... boring.The H scenes are okay, there's nothing really special or unique about them. It's very standard vanilla stuff.To put it bluntly, it's just a bland, generic hentai that doesn't offer anything special. Honestly, this review is mostly just to warn you of the double dub situation you'll have to deal with if you do decide to watch it.";Mixed Feelings
0;Xian Feng Jianyu Lu;HaremMakeNoSense;https://myanimelist.net/profile/HaremMakeNoSense;7;"The comment above is telling the truth but luckily i was skeptical about it because i was dead about to drop this within 2 episodes. Let me break this down for you the episode duration are 8 minutes however the opening song takes up 2 minutes which means the episode is actually 6 minutes and less. So from the 2 episodes the FL is a fox sprite and the ML is a tao but otherwise than that my perspective to what the above comment state is different from theirs don’t get me wrong there is truth to it but judging from this person's perspective they might have a bias against this anime.Well, that’s what i think they do everything like the comment stated but they learn form each other first off both ML and FL have biases against each other race ML at start thinks all demons are bad and FL thinks all humans are trickers heck they didn’t even know that thor own race can sometimes be worst than each other race.So in like ep 9 it shows the FL slowly overcoming her own bias against her own race because in this episode she killed her own kind and thinks she did something bad but a bit more into the episode she learns that the demon bird had kidnapped innocent kids and she didn’t think that the demon would kidnap innocent children and from there we see her biases against her own race crumble. Don’t get me wrong she still thinks that her kind is good but she also knows that there are bad demons out there just like humans so at this point, the FL doesn’t see everything as black and white.Now going into ep 28 ML capture a rabbit demon girl was about to kill it but FL stops him saying that she is just a girl and that instead of killing her he should interrogate her on what really happened with Mr.Zhu being enchanted by her beauty and it seems like because she was beautiful the dude just lost and became enchanted it wasn’t the demon rabbit girl fault and with ep 28 ML learned that not all demons are bad and he even stated that his change of mind happens because of FL he only got to break his own bias because that nothing is absolute in the world as in just as there is bad humans there is good humans that can also be said for demons too. Right there in the episode, it shows that they both are learning from each other although their kind is supposed to be enemies they are learning from each other.In ep 29 FL got angry at rabbit girl because she was clinging to ML to follow him heck it i was starting to get a harem vibe but FL didn’t back down and chase the rabbit girl away but the rabbit girl was being persistence on following ML and then ML step in and chase away rabbit girl by remind her that he gives her a chance to run away and he took out his sword to scare her off.In ep 30 that’s when other Taoists is interested in FL like asking her question about what she likes or what she would want;Ep 31 piggybacks off of 30 and the Taoist line up every day giving her either presents or having tea with her.As we get closer to ep 40 and 50 it doesn’t give like hardcore romance its a slow-burning romance furthermore the ML is supposed to be a Taoist so even if he knows his feelings he ignores it because he wants to be something like a monk. On the other hand, FL doesn’t even know her feeling for ML too well. We did see them getting close to each other but it’s just getting to know one another. Also, FL and ML don’t cause trouble for each other maybe in the single eps like 1-9 but the fix the mistake that they cause for each other. Even if FL knows her feeling for ML she is in denial because they are enemies but she still thinks humans and demons can be together but maybe not them because he is literally her enemy he's a Taoist.Ep 51 ML went on a date with one of his colleague sisters which hits at FL's feelings of jealousy. In this ep, it doesn’t show that he’s gonna be a monk but later on although it seems like he has a crush on the colleague's sister he think she likes him but FL knocked some sense into him because she is a female she knows that the colleague doesn’t actually like ML and tell ML about it and ML was like what would she be after faking her affection because she doesn’t know about the fire sword or the ice sphere and FL went and said maybe what your investigation and ML was like she wouldn’t know because i wouldn’t tell her and the only reason why ML is kind of crushing on is that she was kind to him when everyone bullied him.Ep 55 is where ML believe what FL said was true about the colleague's sister because he’s being framed for setting fire to a place that keeps a record of the demon they also say hes on the demon's side. Keep in mind ML doesn’t even know FL is a demon heck he only let the rabbit girl go but the people framing him make it seem like he’s working for the demons when he actually isn’t. Ep 56-59 piggyback off of 55 so to prove that ML is innocent FL was there to save him mind you this is the only time she saves him.I watched the complete anime it was good from my perspective if you wanna watch it just watch 1-10 ep to give it a try also keep in min the episodes are really short so it doesn’t kill u just to watch up to 10ep to know if you like it or not. Also, the MCs don’t have commitment issues because they were never together, to begin with, it’s only at the closing in ep 69-70 that it seems like they will start to develop a relationship mind you ML don’t go to all girls that approach him also let me add if he does approach the opposite gender its either they cast their demonic charm but the incident with the colleague sister was where he led to his own demise that was the one time he was being wishy-washy that was it as for the FL she only uses her demonic charm to help in their demon hunt. If you don’t believe it just watch the dam 1-10 episodes to be your own judge if it's a good anime or not because we all have a different perspective. Also, let me say this might fall under a rom-com.";Recommended
0;Xian Feng Jianyu Lu;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;4;"Everlasting Wind and Sword Rain Chronicles has a really interesting backstory. The protagonist's belongs to one of the most respected martial arts (and magic) Taoist clans, but in his sect there are only two students left, with himself tending the property as the stand-in master. And that's because his master was assassinated by a demon clan some years back. There is indication that it might be an inside job, that there is some cover-up within the clan, but no one takes him seriously enough and he lacks the power to demand answers.The counterpart is a fox demon princess who expends all her powers trying to learn a human martial arts skill and gets strung along on an odd job to make a little dough, and ends up getting recruited by this monk, being unable to see through her disguise as a human. And of course there is family intrigue within the demon royal family, including regarding the assassination, but the two of them don't realize that of each other.Unfortunately, this backstory never develops, and likely never will, because at every opportunity this show diverges into a standard third-rate romance; you know, the one with the frustratingly passive male lead who's in love but doesn't realize it, and the girl who's constantly getting mad but could never bring herself to ditch the idiot. That opportunity comes by literally every half a 7 minute episode, replete with relaxing video game cut-scene music while they frolic and tease each other, throwing flowers into each others faces, having just survived an evil plot minutes earlier. It seems bipolar, almost like there are two shows in one.To make matters worse, the male protagonist has to be the most shallow simp that falls for literally every female he sees before snapping out of it and ""realizing"" his recruit is the one for him. He's like Sanji (from One Piece) in that he falls for every trap over and over again, completely oblivious to schemes. He naively trusts people's words and then lets them off scot-free after getting cheated, only for the demon princess to catch the bad guy. So we see this theme over and over again, wondering when either she would dump him for greener pastures (and the standard isn't high), or he would smarten up. Neither happen, and he barely minimally improves by the end of 70 episodes.It doesn't help that she's considered the most beautiful, and every taoist monk simp for her, lining up outside their residence to take turns giving her gifts. She rejects every one of them, and then they frolic again on the backdrop of the same music. But neither of them want to take the relationship forward, perhaps partially because it's unbecoming to, being a taoist monk in that world. Whatever the story is, it ensures that neither the romance nor the backstory ever moves forward. They both stall each other out.As a silver lining, there is an interesting theme about humans and demons who start out hating each other, before realizing there are nuances in their relations. Any potential here is squandered. It's a good thread when it arises, but treatment of the subject is largely limited by the immaturity of its messengers.If easy-going and conventional shoujo romances, like the kind where the girl punches or pranks the male lead as a running joke, or you enjoy watching super powerful girls getting their crush out of trouble of their own constant doing (due to lack of social awareness and stupidity), then this is the show for you. Otherwise, there are better shows, both in terms of action and romance, in my opinion. This show tries to do both, but it has commitment issues.";Not Recommended
0;Kouin Tenshi: Haitoku no Lycéenne;CCZilla;https://myanimelist.net/profile/CCZilla;7;Note: I've only seen this dubbed, so this may not be a 100% fair review.Believe it or not, this isn't an average hentai. Instead, this entiire half-hour OVA feels more like a comedy with hentai scenes thrown in. From the quirky situations our leads get themselves into to the eye-grabbing messages thrown in throughout the video to seperate segments, everything about Kouin Tenshi feels humorous.If you read summaries for Kouin Tenshi, you can easily tell that the plot doesn't sound like a hardcore hentai. The entire thing is just a project three schoolgirls just decide to do, that's all. And although the OVA feels unresolved at the end, maybe that contributes to the realism of the girls' little project.Now, one thing I have to comment on is the animation. This hentai was clearly done on a shoestring budget, because the art is atrocious. When the girls aren't taping, the art focuses on close-ups of the eyes of each character or still shots with the occasional mouth flap. Oh, and one thing must be pointed out before you embark to find this OVA. The only male in the entire show has, let's just say, a member that looks a little out of the ordinary.Honestly, I believe it would be hard for anyone to get off on this anime. However, if you're just in the mood for some raunchy adult humor and nothing else, Kouin Tenshi works perfectly. Good luck finding it, though.;Recommended

Nothing more, nothing less. Very plain and simple. However, rather than doing a regular show they changed the perspective to a p.o.v. from the drawn character's eyes.Art 4/10Borderline of bad and average. So many things went wrong.-Detail they clearly don't care about in some areas like the train moments via the window.-There is a weird color difference on the male's body. Which in a way is kind of funny. The goal being is to see the 'real deal' now even though that happens it looks more like the 'fake deal' if you catch what i mean because of the color.-Also, you will notice the artists got sidetracked to how things went. If you have eyes for structure you will see something appear when they shouldn't and things be missing when it should be there.-too many unneeded heat shots- camera angel is misleading. Mostly in the beginning. Without ruining the show i will say this there is no closet.- animation was low.SoundAside from there being some talking done when no one had their lips moving, the actors did a nice job with the vocal performances.CharacterBackground information for characters in general wasn't given nor was it needed. Although, the character's sexual background that was needed was given.Enjoyment: Clearly an art piece. As in not realistic. This take on sex is that of a first time group with female lead and a voyeurism fetish. I would recommend this as a starter hentai anime flick. For those sole individuals or couples starting out. This also could be enjoyed by advanced couples as a cartoonist fashion to reflect back to past in comparison to the present.;Not Recommended

Meaning, you have topics brought to your attention along with questions. For example humans vs vampires. One of the questions was will the main couple love continue? Now before i answer this understand I AM NOT SPOILING ANYTHING... The couple fling at least for me still remains in question. Yes, there were indicators that one might say answered the question but did it? Did it really? I mean think of how the story ended. To me it left me with more question than answers. One question was did the humans know about the vamps or not? If they did know why did the coexist with each other? i suppose you want some evidence to go along with the case, fine. For the idea the villagers knew they immediately knew where the vamps home was. On the other hand the main character's co worker knew something was off on one the vamps but did not know immediately that he was a vamp. I suppose i am getting off topic a bit. In short nice drama story with a romantic flair but a higher reference point WAS NEEDED! Maybe it was not their fault maybe there was suppose to be a continuance but they went bankrupt or something.art: human like as opposed to sketches.Sound: almost always i will give english dubs a 10.... assuming the sound is decent and actor choices made sense. (i gave a 10 here)Character: see plot/storyEnjoyment/Overall: Would i like to see another piece like this from this company? hmm... no sorry i wouldn't. Yes, i do like romance instead of horror but if you are going to leave me with questions i will leave you. Now, i am not saying that unanswered questions are bad but too many are annoying.

As I found it a lot better than many high rated animes. It was worth the watch. Its story very different and unique and at the same time has various emotions in it. The creators has done a great job. I think this show definitely deserves above 7 rating at least. I just fall in love with the action in 1st and 2nd episode , like hatsoff to the action director of this showStory-10/10This story was a masterpiece where the main character, nian yangxiao comes from a parallel world or you can say as mirror world to save his lover and his journey begins.Animation-10/10The animators has done a very good job. I have seen many of the shows from the show creators and the animation never lets me down. This studio is doing a great job but really needs to be recognised.Characters- 10/10characters are very well designed and are very likable.

The son of the axe gang was also very likable like it was very well designed and made it fun to watch.Enjoyment and overall- 10/10 and 10/10I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME AND I WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUGGEST WATCHING IT.Actually I was going to skip it as the rating was so low and I thought it would be boring.

0;Ugokie Kori no Tatehiki;AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;10;"I think it is very important to go into these old works of animated classics with a different mindset than the typical ones you observe on MAL. Old wine tastes better when aged - not just because of the perceived increase in value that time brings, but the texture that it allows to preserve and compose into complex flavors as the fermentation process is allowed to continue well beyond the typical sale cycle of shelf wine. Old classics of art which stand the test of time and remain historically relevant enough to be archived for the future usually have the same quality to them. They act as time capsules that capture in a totally irrelevant art medium, the cultural trends, the history of the art form itself, the social themes of the era that were prevalent at the time, without intending to do so and thus increasing their latent value.A lot of tropes of modern artforms that we consider shorthand for set up or establishing a connection to the audience based on mutually understood cultural and social references both within and outside the third wall tend to gain reference value when looked at from a distant and detached perspective brought about by time. Of course production values of a nascent artform where the technology as well as the exploration of the style had yet to be regimented cannot possibly be compared to an era where techniques have been regimented, taught as standard methods and followed to an almost formulaic limit to create a rather robust standard of quality.The Japanese Animated Film Archive names ""Motion Picture: The Kitsune vs. the Tanukis"" as Ikuo Oishi's masterwork. Ikuo Oishi who worked on the animated division of the Photo Chemical Laboratory is widely considered Japan's Walt Disney and set up most of the animation standards that future cohorts would follow upon and refine to suit their own changed tastes. While he was lost as a casualty of being deployed in the Pacific Front of the Japanese theatre of the world war leaving his legacy incomplete compared to his spiritual mentor Disney, his guidelines and works like the one being reviewed left a blueprint for future animators both at PCL and beyond to learn from.Motion Picture: The Kitsune vs. the Tanukis at first seems like a surrealist smorgasbord of disparate and unlinked sequences that were strung together without much planning. The composition almost creates a surrealist expressive atmosphere where you as a viewer are left trying to make sense of situations that feel absurd. However, the work has to be considered instead as an exploration of what the animation as an artform could achieve in a stylistic fashion rather than a plot focused narrative that supplants the animation today.Objects are constantly performing seamless transitions, transforming into disparate objects with hitherto unseen smoothness and indistinguishable magic, creates are constantly playing with perspective, using relative sizes and distance as well as playing with shadows to create depth of field in a flat 2 dimensional, almost stop motion world. Every frame acts both as an exploration of technical tricks as well as guidelines for future artists who would follow - an artist's way to flex.The superficial story seems pretty simple. The tanukis encounter a foreign creature, fright of the unknown prompts a series of misunderstanding that eventually escalates into full blown conflict. While the entire rigmarole is dressed up in wildly entertaining comedy and the surreal transformations make this a fun watch, the underlying depth of themes cannot be hidden. For those looking, there are clear parallels to the inward looking islanders and their fear of the unknown outsiders who would come to the Island nation for trade. Misunderstandings of culture, language and even religion lead to a full blown conflict and a pushback of these external threats. We have to remember that this work came out both during and under the auspices of the expansionist Japanese empire, which was forging a narrative of how they repelled would be colonists and set out their own expansionary desires towards the Middle Kingdom. Ikuo Oishi's works have constant undertone of this Japanese exceptionalism, perhaps a reflection of the broader cultural sentiments driving the Japanese motivation for war.I must also give kudos to some of the best sound design I've seen from work at the time. Sound recording technology was pretty backwards in the 1930 and to get such clear synchronizations as well as clear sound effects in a live setting definitely enhanced the experience of watching this work greatly.At 11 minutes, this can be watched quickly, but I suggest that any viewer read into the history of the artist, the time period and Japanese animation history in general ( it's initial role as propaganda, just like Walt Disney in the US) to get a more nuanced perspective on this surreal comedy.";Recommended

There was no color just black and white. Some black and white films are too bright or to dark. This anime was not only a good mix on both but factor favorably to the fact that this was a dark under-toned night environment.Did a good job aligning with the sound. Music used was a bit catchy.

Despite my love for disney hate, I gotta share what user Systemhalodark said in the comment section of the video:""The irony, considering that this is what they were doing to China at the same time.""This is from a period before the concept of anime was created, which happened somewhere in the 1960s or 1970s, so it's kinda even hard to think of it in ""anime"" terms.

For me i didn't quite get the gist behind it until what i am lead to believe is a flashback scene. Seeing that made thing more clear. I believe much like the underlying topic the artist secretly outed a common depiction of woman. In a matter of speaking was baring it all out for people to see (thus an explanation for the nudity).The topic is relevant to women don't fart and progressed from there on a more progressive scale. While it is commonly true to see a women being held as an object of beauty we are forgetting the fact they are no different than us human males. When they got to 'go' they do like the rest of us. This is a part of our nature. You can't stop nature.I believe the comic aspect this music video provided was to turn a 'shitty' topic into something more amusing and hopefully popular. For let's face it how can you expect the public to relax around females with this perfectly glamour ideal of beauty floating in schools around the world. The solution here, which was quite clever was to mask the truth in a club style beat rap video. With the issue of the problem lying with teen males in make sense to create a video for such a group. Which probably explains again the nudism and 'shitty' art.Overall: A clever idea but there is no clear message in the video that i am right with my theory. Not to neglect to mention this theory was brought to light after having to do some in-depth thinking. While there is good intent being made i think having the message be more clear would have been a better call. For an average viewer will see the video and bother to think much about it.

First ask yourself that question before reading the rest of this review.Yonimo Osoroshii Nihon Mukashibanashi doesn't try to. Not conventionaly at least. It's tales are executed in a way that take on a form of 'external horror'. Or i guess 'horrific' to make the viewer understand how terrible things happen in the world and there's nothing we can do about them.Each of these tales takes a horrific scenario and pushes it to the far extremes.I want to note that finding this anime subbed online is quite challenging as it is a very unknown piece of media that's been poorly documented for foreign audiences. What i've done is uncover raw footage and watch that. Fortunately the stories were easy to get the jist of with my beginner Japanese comprehension, combined with their straightforward structure.- Understanding what they are trying to say - (Moderate to mild spoiler warning)1. First tale (easiest to watch) introduces us to a wanderer seeking shelter from the terribly warm weather. He shows very little respect and gets punished for his reckless behaviour at the village he thought would be the safe haven he so desperately sought. On first glance it might seem harsh what happens, but if you look at it from the villager's perspectives he wasn't much better.Even with subs they don't tell you what really goes on at this village, you're meant to piece it together through visual cues, which you wouldn't be able to do if you don't pay enough attention to the scenes and events that take place.2. Second tale is about ""cancel culture"". Minimal spoilers, popular slang of the youths. There you go.3. Third and last tale was the most 'psychedelic' and difficult to understand. To be absolutely fair to it my patience was a little running low from personal life that i didn't give this one the time it deserved. If i had to make a guess though i'd say it wants to do a commentary on superficial interests and one's karma.- Visuals -Great for their time, they get the job done. And can get experimental and wild during major scenes. But i must warn you, don't drop this within the first few minutes, what you will be greeted by is not what the tales actually look like. The ""watcher"" at the video store is only fancy introductory fluff, an interlude meant to smoothly transition you from tale to tale.Although there's dialogue that happens during them. It's sadly lost in translation for me. It can't be helped.- Audio -Unremarkable voice acting however the choice of music is breathtaking. I might sound blasphemic but this is probably one of my favorite anime scores i've heard in a while. Haven't come across anything this esoteric, tribal and sophisticated sounding since Psycho Diver.If you are fond of unusual scores and instrumental music that fits the themes and ancient eras, your senses will be pleased.I have to recommend this strange title. I may be biased for loving the soundtrack but i really do think this is something worth looking into if you have time to spare and are able to acquire a viewable copy through whatever means.";Recommended

Maybe I wouldn't have had trouble understanding it if I hadn't seen Ryu Knight the original first. Maybe I read into it too much. Either way, I was still a bit lost, which doesn't generally happen to me.

Something I will say for this OVA however is that the music is great! ""They"" wrote a new score for this OVA, a different one from the originals. And it's really good. I like it as much as the original's.A 7 on sound/music from me.Character:I really like the characters from the original, so it's hard for me to like the parallel universe versions of them that are in this as much as the original's. But I can't say the characters are bad, just different. More serious in some ways I guess, less in others. Kinda of like the OVA itself.The new characters I generally like. Some more than others. But they're solid characters that are believable.a 7 on character.Enjoyment:I enjoyed watching this a lot at the time. If only because it was more of my favorite show. Looking back I'm not sure that it was really worthy of how much I enjoyed it. But it's really a good OVA, don't get me wrong.A 7 on enjoyment.Overall:I would say that this OVa makes for a good watch.

0;Usagi to Kame;Alaroki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Alaroki;7;"For me, Usagi to Kame was an absolute masterpiece, however for many Usagi to Kame falls short.First off I should say that this story is based of the Fable of the Tortoise and the Hare and they did a great job recreating it.Story: The Story is classic and amazing. It is about overcoming challenges.Sound: N/A They had no sound.Character: I loved the two characters. I especially love the hare. While many people might dislike him due to his cockiness, I like him for that. The hare was very ""human"" in sense and the director of film was able to bring that out well.Enjoyment: I had a lot of enjoyment in this piece. You can see the improvement of Namakura Gatana work which goes to show the improvement of animation overtime.7/23/2022 Edit: So I have recently rewatched Usagi to Kame after watching few other extant animations around this time. While the art is amazing, I have realized I overpraised it quite a bit for the position as a reviewer that I am. So here is an improved critique on the art section that separates my feelings from the review a bit more:For Usagi to Kame's time, 1927, the art was very good. The beautiful use of stilling and other pattern making techniques was amazing and for any new art student, looking at this piece of work will allow you to learn more about the use of stilling itself. Namakura Gatana used eyerolling and little cute dances to give his characters more expression.While for an artist the art might seem amazing and an excellent introduction to stilling for others the art of Usagi to Kame falls short. The art can seem very slow especially because in most scenes only one thing moves. This combined with the lack of sound can make Usagi to Kame feel much more drawn out. For those only looking for a story and enjoyment Usagi to Kame will feel boring and will not suite your taste, but for those looking to relish in the mind of the artist, you will have a much more enjoyable time.Overall: If you are interested in old animation, the history of animation, or art in general, you will enjoy Usagi to Kame, however, for those looking for an amazing use of animation and time Usagi to Kame is not it.";Recommended

Those not familiar with the message behind it is to not underestimate your opponent. I like the childish song approach. Reminds me of Anything you can do I can do better song. While the story has an uplifting message the ending dialog was a bit snootiness and the animated art wasn't that better on that point.Art-black and white production-A tad too long of a delay on the animation for introduction.Sound- nothing to comment onCharacter- nothing to comment onEnjoyment: With the minor exception of the crown scene this a delightful short starting animation most ages can benefit from. The crow scene involves the noise you would expect although like English has taught one countless times before words generally carry multiple meanings.

0;Usagi to Kame;aniMayor;https://myanimelist.net/profile/aniMayor;3;A fun little animation of the Aesop fable. There's a few moments of excellent creativity in this short film, such as when the rabbit is shown rolling down the hill in one cut, or the raven's insults of the rabbit homing in on the rabbit's head.However, overall the animation isn't particularly good. A lot of the motion isn't very smooth, and the tortoise's limb and neck movements in particular don't look very natural. The rabbit's face looks quite bizarre at times, too. Simply put, the animation here just doesn't measure up to most Western films, nor even to many other Japanese animation, from the same time period.On the other hand... it does have a breakdancing tortoise.;Not Recommended

Her head goes forward, and back. And Forward, and back. And forward, and back. And forward and back... minutes roll by. Oh, a shot from the rear. And forward and back. OK, that was clearly getting boring for this would-be anime God, which is why he adds some bizarre 1990s image tiling-filter effect that covers the screen in a grid of tiny screens of THE SAME BORING BLOW-JOB.

1;Henbou Moral Hazard;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;2;One day, while walking home from school, a young college girl is followed by a creepy old man. She runs to a nearby park in an attemot to get away from him, but is captured by someone hiding in the shadows. The pervert strips her naked and forces himself onto her. Another man, hearing her cries for help, comes to her aid and chases the pervert away. But as our girl quickly gathers up her clothes and turns to get dressed, her rescuer starts to take advantage of the situation.Pretty much the whole situation is a 24-karat run of bad luck for the school girl.This was animated at a time when anime studios made the transition from animation cels to digital art for their anime. Unfortunately, a lot of anime around this time ended up look like a mixed bag at the best of times, an those were the anime done by the big studios that had actual talent and budget. So you can imagine just how bad Moral Hazard looks with it's barely there hentai budget of a dime, half a pack of gum, a button, and some pocket lint.The whole thing uses the exact same couple of shots repeated over and over and over again during it's entire runtime, making the entire thing feel like a tedious slog. I know I've shit on newer hentai for being cheaply put together, but nothing can quite beat just how poorly put together a lot of early digital hentai looked.And to top it all, as to put a cherry on top of this shit sundae, it has some of the worst editing I've ever seen. At random moments, the anime will take one random shot of the characters having sex, and then have it randomly appear all over the screen like a collage dedicated to the worst animation that hentai has to offer.I don't know how anyone looked at this and thought it was acceptable to put onto store shelves. I guess I must live in luxury in these modern days where I can find decent quality hentai in the plethora of hentai out there.The only compliment that I can give this is that it doesn't try to bog the experience down with an unnecessary plot or character development. And that's one hell of a backhanded compliment. I don't think I've had so much to complain about with so little content before.Would I recommend Moral Hazard? Fuck no, it's poorly animated and edited trash. You could probably throw a rock at any modern anime and come away with something better.;Not Recommended

The 3D Animation is really cheap and a disgrace to cel-shading, as well as the animation sucks. There is no impressive movements and the characters moves like robots. The story is really weak and most likely just done on the fly, as the animators at Sunrise already has a really tight schedule.Just like the former ""Keroro kids"" episodes, these are really childish and most likely meant for small kids. There is no innuendo, no suggestive themes, no language and no cartoon violence like the original TV show. It's like watching an episode of Dora the Explorer, if it wasn't educational. The voices are really great like always though and the characters DO act natural. But this short episode does not impress at all.I wold not recommend this to anyone. It's boring, cheap and childish.

0;Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki;sorcery;https://myanimelist.net/profile/sorcery;7;"Similar to the Japanese flag's rising sun, a sanguine star is setting upon a darkened forest of spruce. Suddenly troubling this quiet sight worthy of a naturalist etching, a shinobi bolts from within the tree line. Far from being on a mission, his endeavor is dashing to escape another ninja party, fiercely resolute to make an attempt on his life... It seems that the fugitive is facing overwhelming odds, but could it be that the prey turn into the predator, thanks to a well calculated gambit?This immediately sets the tone of Yajikita Gakuen. One notices at once that the shadow warriors appear in their traditional imagery. Indeed, they have more in common with the historical Kotaro Fuma than Naruto Uzumaki. That is how it goes. Apart from the dramatically emphasized scuffles here and there, the vision Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki shows through of martial artists is classicist rather than fantasist...But what exactly is Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki? Unknown in the West, the OAV series is adapted from a long running serial from 1984 to 1992, published in the Bonita comic magazine. The manga version appears as more Shoujo connoted, as the covers and the image album's illustrated pictures suggest. In itself, the manga was not completely created ex-nihilo, as it drew inspiration from Shank's Mare, a popular novel from the Edo period. However, it is noteworthy that the YGD anime significantly distances itself from the tone of this literary classic. Indeed, the revised Yaji and Kita of Ryouko Shitou do not match with the original Picaresque disposition of the duo. Here, they are more or less martial artists for hire, who never turn a blind eye to shocking misconducts, that being said. What is flagrant, is how they act as a neutral party interceding in conflicts, as they go about on a late Showa era Japan still torn between conservation of traditions and modernity. Rather than setting off to punish, their agenda is to bring common sense where there is mortal grudge. While determined to restore calm and justice, they never do so without compassion, in spite of their adversaries' sins. As such, we cannot stray as far from the typical Nekketsu vision as it gets: there is no climactic slaying of a one dimensional evil fiend nor anybody standing out as a clear victor. On the contrary, the antagonists whose honor is badly smeared, walk off, recovering from their inner turmoil. Their path is of the evasion of mortification and our two heroines simply give the push towards their catharsis. At the light of this interpretation, their concern is then to replace martial art as a tool of pacification instead of self serving worth. Which is also why we do not see them wield any weapon (Kita only hurls a kunai once at her target to test his dodging expertise), even though they face opponents set to exterminate any outsider standing in their way. Overwhelmed as they are by sheer number, this makes for more tense storytelling when things get nervous. At the same time, Yaji and Kita are not made the narrative's primary focus. The summary way they are fleshed out would usually be considered negatively, but as they're more or less cast in the background, it works in the benefit of the cases they investigate about. They feature tortured souls, misguided they are by their outdated codes of honor or passion. While the main characters are somewhat attaching, the underpinnings of this two parter OAV remain the lead villains. Personal favorite is the leader of the Shadow Military clan, who associates her fondness for gardening to a warlike disposition. The game of contrast between this gentle hobby and her brutal ""no holds barrel to meet the result"" mindset is simply awesome, in its staged subtlety. Likewise, the script is admirable, with inspirational dialogues that never sound too grandiloquent or preachy. Even the final catharsis of the second episode takes said game of contrast into account. It is this kind of gravitas that makes the conclusions bittersweet and yet rewarding.This anime is not without its flaws though; the kind of writing it uses delivers best under the movie format. It is a little too short for OAV's. What makes for a dynamic pace is somewhat lost in scenario intelligibility. What is the connection between the fate legend and the leader of the Shadow Military Clan? How Kotetsu, Yaji and Kita's aide, find some of his crucial information? By the way, that Kouga ninja is problematic... Unfortunately, not as much employed as he should be, he is made into a plot mouthpiece rather than an organically woven character. Besides, what is with his whirlwind teleport? What seems to be the only super power in this anime is employed for rule of the cool appearances but is never shown or talked upon during other instances. Also, in the first episode, a ghost girl, directing Yaji's tracks, is seen at key points. These lone supernatural elements, on an otherwise grounded production design, are jarring. Going against certain of Knox's commandments, they undermine the crime mystery aspect in the process. Even then, YGD still makes up for it with its fine dramatization.The art is fairly competent. Chara-design translates emotions well, overall, such as the majestic contempt in Yaji's face as an innocent student is about to get punched in the face or when the fearful chairman of the Martial Arts school, trapped on his car with sabotaged brakes, tries to mean he needs help even though nobody can hear his plea. Sometimes there are misses, such as this student nosing into the militaristic club's affairs, who seems more like he is beaten to a pulp than being on the verge of death. Animation is fluid as a whole. Action scenes being the most tricky part, the key animation does an alright job at staging dynamic fight choreography through the use of gyrating camera shots, parallax and other shortcut effects. As dated as they may appear, JC Staff and T-Up did a good enough job to not let it break spectator's immersion.Soundtrack is an engaging blend of Japanese folk instrumentation, kinetic keyboard, and supporting electric guitar and violins for certain middle eights. It goes along smoothly with the unity of time and place of the OAV series. Sound design in the actual anime is not ill chosen as well: in the first episode, the opening is the tonally fitted Kaze ni Koishite and as a relief to a rather heavy conclusion an upbeat Ban Hana ra, which channels the more light-hearted roots of the Tōkaidōchū Hizakurige novel.To cap it off, Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki is a sensible tale articulated around the topoi of forgiveness, acceptance of fatality and allegiance to overly rigid codes of conduct. Its dregs make it a title only standing a Gi away from being psychological drama classic. Its relative obscurity is undeserved. If you are ready to overlook its slightly outdated production values, it is largely worth of the one hour and a half you give it. One can hardly go wrong with this old-styled item, if searching for something more cerebral than a run of the mill actionner.

On the next paragraph, the buzzwords offer hints about the title's strong suits and drawbacks.Ketchup meter: Nothing too objectionable, there is bloodshed but no gore. YGD is an anime scarce when it comes to write on-screen death, which accentuates its seriousness.xXx meter: With JC Staff behind the tiller, you would expect at least some Ecchi but surprisingly enough the staff showed discipline and modesty. Not even a voyeuristic intent behind the main protagonists outfits, as demonstrated with the presence of the long skirts, senior schoolgirls normally sport in Japan. The only titillation for the perverted spectator is a couple of panty shots lost in the screenplay, and even so they are barely discernible as the heroine counter an assault. Thus, they are not completely gratuitous. There is also a little yaoi bait tied to the boss of United Kanto Group but it does not go too far (in fact, it is played out for comic value), thankfully.Fishing scene(s): None.POSITIVE aspects:+ A solid concept, balancing feminine cast's sensitivity with masculine cast's roughness+ No tonal whiplash caused by disruptive comedy or romance+ The brilliant dramatization, escalating towards the final catharsis+ The brainy characterization of the antagonistsNEGATIVE aspects:- Better fitted for a movie format with higher production values and more length- Not as deft in handling crime mystery genre as psychological drama- Too short of a series in regards of the promising production design";Recommended
0;Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;“Yajikita Gakuen Douchuuki” (which I would loosely translate as “Record of Yaji and Kita’s School Journeys”) is a 2-episode Shoujo OVA with decent character designs and a solid voice cast, but plot-wise it’s a confusing mess, and every other aspect about this title is mediocre.The gist of the overall story is that Yaji and Kita, two high school girls proficient in a variety of combat techniques and who belong to some sort of martial arts-centered organization at their home school, act as martial artist mystery solvers for hire of sorts, transferring into schools upon request to solve their ninja-related problems. Each episode presents a self-contained story about a different school.Even if you can accept the premise that this these stories are built on — that it’s relatively common for high schools in modern Japan to have secret ninja group infestation problems, and that two high schoolers can solve them — the plots’ execution leaves a lot to be desired. The first episode is the more coherent of the two, but even in that one, a lot of the developments just don’t make sense. I was left wondering why Yaji and Kita were even hired to do the job in the first place, seeing as they don’t put up much of a fight when attacked, and conduct very little of the intelligence-gathering themselves. That is left to the plot device—er, ninja named Kotetsu, who is also a part of their organization and keeps popping in out of nowhere at the most convenient times to do most of the heavy lifting.The second episode is incredibly confusing. To start off with, one would be forgiven if they thought that the girl at the beginning, who cuts her hair in a revenge request offering, and the antagonist are one and the same, because they look similar. But no, the unnamed female student is a different character, apparently voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi, no less.The synopsis of episode 2’s story makes you jump through a bunch of logical hoops for it to even marginally make sense. A girl’s boyfriend has been expelled from her school because of actions that his brother did as the leader of the school’s martial arts club. In order to enable his return (which he didn’t ask for, by the way), she decides to head up the club herself, turning it into a “shadow military organization” of trained ninjas. Her group attempts to murder the school’s chairman, who has been trying to stop them, which gets Yaji and Kita involved. And there’s a mysterious entity known as “the Punisher” at that school, who will, in exchange for the requester’s student ID books and their departure from the school, exact punishment on (beat up) whomever the requester asks. This entity has been targeting the ninja organization’s members lately, so they are trying to uncover the entity’s identity and fight them. Episode 2 is filled with blatant exposition dumps (characters approach Yaji and Kita at just the right time, explain everything, and then leave), undeveloped or even just-introduced characters who appear to be important but we aren’t really told who they are, some sexist dialogue, and a nonsensical ending which involves flowers, prostrating oneself in the direction of a prefecture, and crying.Regarding technical aspects, the animation gets the job done and is not noticeably subpar, although it is limited during action scenes, where stills are often used. The character designs are nice, but some characters look too similar to one another (as touched on above). The opening and two ending themes, as well as the background music, are all mediocre. The voice acting is solid — there are a lot of major voice actors in this, including in minor roles.As for objectionable content, there’s some violence, but little blood, and no one dies except in flashbacks. There’s also a bit of sexist dialogue here and there that is played off as being funny.Overall, while this show does have a nice aesthetic to it, the incoherent plot, poor story structure and underdeveloped characters make it a difficult OVA to sit through, particularly when it comes to the second episode. Thus, I would not recommend this OVA to anyone unless they have read the manga, which may give a fuller understanding of the plot and characters.;Not Recommended

0;Bakukyuu Renpatsu!! Super B-Daman;Ciu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ciu;6;No review for this anime yet? Of course, since this anime is so old and about unpopular game. Bi-daman is the kind of kiddy game that only played by elementary student, or may be I'm wrong for these days. Putting a marble in a robotic toy and then pushing a button to shoot it out is something fool I think. However, lets tell anything else about the anime instead of the game.No doubt that some exaggeration need to be added into the anime. So many game animes need it in order to serve better trick, no, story i mean. This anime is also like that. The protagonist named Tamago (I'm sure that means fried egg) is an ordinary kid who really loves marbles. Ancient Japan folks said that a marble contained a soul. So feel the spirit by playing it. A supranatural thing so just deal with that even though i used to play it a lot when child. And thanks to certain another anti-hero named Gunma so that he was acquainted with the game. Gunma was professional bidaman player who could shoot accurately with some awesome trick. Somehow, there was a chance that made Tamago demonstrate his skill in playing bidaman. That was his first time but somewhat he could clamp the toy between his legs and with some pressure he pressed a ring like thing in the bidaman belly and then shot it out. With kamehame-like-shot he launched the marble and hit the target tremendously. Ganwa just dropped his jaw seeing it and then assumed him as rival. Then the hero and anti-hero made a team to join various tournaments. As usual game anime, many enemies with sadistic scene appeared. Even old hag with muscles joined the game, what the heck. Of course a hottie is also needed and she joined their team.For kids, one thing that can be attractive is the model of bidaman. That mini-gundam-thing has so many various models. It was so sophisticated and fooled no attracted me to keep watching all of the episodes. Many bidaman technologies appeared later and that just made the toys more look like a shooting machine. So just gather the kids and make their eyes shine by watching these stuffs.;Mixed Feelings

The way their eyes move is kind of unsettling in my opinion, but I mean what do you expect from the literal oldest existing anime?Spoilers I guess?: It begins with a samurai purchasing a dull sword from a swordsmith. Then shown through text on screen he decides he wants to try it out. So he approaches a blind man to pick a fight and gets his ass handed to him (rightfully so). The last scene is done in a shadow puppet-like style and features the samurai approaching another person (apparently the person is a courier) and trying to start another fight and losing. The courier walks over him and the samurai calls him a murderer (like ok sir not as if you were the one out here looking to slice and dice somebody).And that's it. Not really much to say, not sure what the point of the story is, I guess there's a lesson here. Like ""don't buy a sword for only 4 coins, cheapskate, it's dull and you will lose"" or oh I don't know maybe ""don't attack a person unprovoked, nutjob"". I don't really care for the samurai character, he's ugly and rude lol.But anyway this is the first time I've ever reviewed something but I had to add something here because there is not enough info on here for this piece of history.

0;Watashi to Watashi: Futari no Lotte;Perevodildo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Perevodildo;9;"Finally finished Futari no Lotte, something that has been burdening me ever since Ziu's cue to it misled me to thinking he refers to Lucy-May, but I decided to check out this thing as well just in case. While the premises are there, this series is not officially recognized as a part of WMT. But it deserves the title by merit. This and one other thing renders it akin to Versailles no Bara: Futari no Lotte only gets fantastic from the second half, where it receives its first multi-episode arc. Yeah, the show's pacing is limited, yet it may become lovely if you don't rush it.Futari no Lotte is not egregiously bad, neither it is anything exciting at first. While it is majorly endearing, it is still not very sophisticated, so I could enjoy it fully with a very basic Japanese and some mtl'd Arabic subs. Arab anime fans had once again proved themselves one of the most capable in the community. Also, that would prove an excellent basis for an English sub if you ever contemplate one.The place and setting are rather unusual, but methinks the show only owns it to the original book.The underlying idea tho — twins getting separated after birth — even though I can't recall any other anime with a similar story, the very concept feels rather shallow, you need some heavy Dezaki duty to attach any significance to such a trifling premise. As the series progresses, the twins do exactly what you would expect them to do, seldom catching you by surprise. Although eventually, the show acquires a certain own comedic/dramatic charm and inspiring value, it sometimes wanders dangerously close to drooping into a lackluster, like some other shows do, content with occupying their specific niche without ever aspiring for unwarranted risks. I wish I could say it had a potential for being more imaginative and original, but I myself can't see a way how it could have been improved. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯No, actually, the ED song can be considered a fly in the ointment. At best, it's just tone-inappropriate and corny. At worst, it disrupts completely the mood of an episode just finished.Or, again, the pacing could be much better. Had the full series been packed into something like the usual 13 ep format, it'd probably have been a solid 10/10, but as for now...The entire first half often feels like one big generic running joke, extremely detached from reality: ""my twin sis was good at doing this particular thing that I can't do for toffee"" and vice versa. Albeit further down the series, particularly in a Munich piano concert arc, it gets actually gorgeous, I had to wait a hefty half of the series to finally find myself at the edge of the seat. Ep17 in particular had me. It was some fine quality comedy, the one that'd make Leslie Nielsen quit snuffing glue in heavens. So stupid yet so hilarious. No, because it's so stupid, it's hilarious! Too bad the first part of the show rarely gets quite as bold. The fact is quite notable that the book's synopsis in the wiki only describes the events of ep1, then jumps straight to ep22, implying everything in between was most likely made up by animators and is essentially devoid of substance. Oh yes, it's all coming together.When the time comes for the inevitable — the face-to-face confrontation and disclosure of the reasons the parents broke apart — it's still rather banal and superficial, but I guess you couldn't make this story work any other way. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯The actual story ends in ep. 28, so #29 is like one big after-the-credits-scene, and it's a really confusing one at that. This episode serves no purpose whatsoever, feels like a wagon's fifth wheel, and only exist for the sake of one scene and one generic moral. I really don't see the point of making it. This episode alone was almost enough to knock my score down to 8/10.This show has Kodama Kenji's usual hand and vibe to it, proving once again that his shows are always neat and well-directed, but mid in nature. It feels like this guy could have produced something of much greater value, but was doomed to always get appointed as a director of the most hopelessly crippled shows with no prospect for continuous plot or character development, effectively having to make bricks without straw. At least he is good at directing shows that are staged in Europe.This series had made me a better person on so many levels. Although for me, it originated from a mistake of misunderstanding, that's the kind of mistake I would gladly make again. I can't believe how intimate and kindred I grew with characters in those 30 episodes.";Recommended
0;Sei Michaela Gakuen Hyouryuuki;vigorousjammer;https://myanimelist.net/profile/vigorousjammer;7;"Sei Michaela Gakuen Hyouryuuki is a pretty interesting two-episode OVA.Story: 8/10The story is quite original, and it kept me interested right up until the very end. It's presented well, paced well, and doesn't overstay it's welcome. I did think it went to some weird places towards the end, and the entire theme of the OVA seems a bit... misplaced. However, If you don't think too much about the subtext of the plot, it ends up being an enjoyable tale, one which is also reminiscent of classic 80's horror films.Art: 6/10 (Art Style: 7/10, Animation: 5/10)The art style is pretty nice looking, despite being a bit rough around the edges. It's about what you'd expect out of something from the early 90's. Character design isn't very varied, but the fundamental designs are still good. Backgrounds look nice for the era.The animation tends to range between ""poor"" and ""pretty good"". Most of it treads the line between the two, looking a lot like the TV animation of the era. There are also some nice looking shots that would have been impressive at the time, but don't hold up quite as well nowadays. However, there were also some really bad looking shots with severely limited animation. Thus, the animation tends to balance itself out, and between it's somewhat impressive moments and somewhat poor looking moments it ends up looking very average as a whole.Sound: 8/10 (Soundtrack: 9/10, Sound FX: 6/10, Voice: 8/10)The soundtrack is well done, creating a creepy atmosphere, and also having some great, creepy moments when all of the girls start to sing. It's one of the standout parts of the production, for sure.Sound effects are a bit low fidelity, and feel somewhat dated... but they're fine for the era, and they are mixed well enough.The Japanese voice actors did a wonderful job of portraying their characters, and had a lot of passionate delivery for their lines. There isn't any real standout acting here or anything, but the performances from the cast are all very solid and work extremely well.Character: 6/10Most of these characters are all fairly standard, but the nun characters tend to be kind of interesting with how strict they are about enforcing the rules. The main character also tends to have some interesting quirks about her, and ends up feeling pretty original.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall, this OVA tells an entertaining and interesting story, reminiscent of classic 80's horror films. It's perhaps not the most groundbreaking story, but it's ambitious, and has some really good moments throughout. The production values are somewhat low it seems, though... and it definitely feels like a production created on a small budget. However, that doesn't keep it from being an enjoyable one.I would recommend this to fans of the horror genre, especially if you're into classic 80's horror... as well as fans of psychological thrillers. Just don't go into it expecting too much.";Recommended
0;Sei Michaela Gakuen Hyouryuuki;Typ055;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Typ055;6;I feel like this was supposed to be another ultraviolent and hyper sexualized late 80s/early 90s anime, but unfortunately it failed in both regards.Whatever fighting it has is too boring, with very little blood or gore, plus mediocre animation. The sex scenes are few and far too tame.On the other hand, the story was a positive surprise, even though they tried tackle too much.Its always interesting to see christiany or other aspects os western culture/religion portrayed in anime. It wont provide you with anything particularly new if you're a history nerd, but I was pleasantly surprised how the childrens crusade ties in to the story. It had been many years since I read about it and this anime motivated me to learn more. That alone was worth it.By the end of the anime, the conspiracy surrounding the school is revealed, which I found to be absolutely r3tarded. Not to mention the introduction of time traveling and a new villain literally at the end. At this point I no longer cared.So 6/10 feels fair to me.;Mixed Feelings
0;Hanako;EelNimajneb;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EelNimajneb;7;The story is about a nameless boy who takes interest of a mysterious girl name Hanako. As the name implies, The name of the anime, Hanako is about Hanako. The art style reminds me of Ping Pong the animation as the the characters and setting are drawn very loose and fluid. Same can be said about its animation. The anime is complimented with lighthearted piano music in order to convey and betray the tone of the anime. For an indie animation, this honestly caught me by surprised. Without going into spoilers, this anime is not meant to make any sense narratively. It's meant to impact you within a short time frame. And for an indie animation, I think it does a great job of doing that.;Recommended
1;Hanako;Bumdumdoobit;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Bumdumdoobit;7;A rather interesting short, Hanako wasn't what I expected it to be based on the first minute, that's for sure. There is a very rough feel to the anime which in my opinion works well with the overall feeling of the short. Watching it feels like you are watching someone's confession. I read somewhere that it was all done by one person however I am unsure how true that is. It definitely feels like an intimate experience.I am unsure if there is any deeper meaning to the story at all, if there is then it totally went over my head. While it does not start off especially disturbing it gets more disturbing as it progresses and really I think one of the main factors in that and one of the greatest aspects of this short in general is the music. The piano does a great job of capturing the mood of what is being shown on screen. The speech in this anime is clearly recorded on a cheap microphone but in my opinion this adds to the intimate confession vibe the short captures.I don't fully understand ever aspect of the story, especially the part around a minute in, it may be that it is intentionally left up to interpretation, but I'm not sure. As I said, I'm not sure if there is supposed to be a deeper meaning to the story but I do think it captures the disturbing vibe very well.Hell, it's only four minutes, I say give it a watch.;Recommended
0;Hanako;hugrim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/hugrim;6;MINOR SPOILERSThis anime is an independent short, the animation was very beautiful and well done, the soundtrack was great despite the amateur dubbing done by the anime author himself, what intrigues me is the story, also short, but interesting and mysterious, passes from something that seems a simple story to something complex and dramatic, but with the addition of the story being narrated by the author in an amateur way, it seems to be a real story lived by him in the past and that's why it intrigued me , because it's not something that simple the story tells, so I think the story held my attention until the end, but thinking that it could be a real story I was kind of... wtf? But overall it was a fine independent short lol;Mixed Feelings
1;Hanako;brubruuuh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/brubruuuh;6;Won't really tell much about the story, since it's only 4 minutes long it feels like any major information would be a spoiler. This feels like a small passion project of one person. The animation is rough but colorful and full of uniqueness, it's not very smooth but it gets the job done. Story is fairly straightforward but lacks any sort of substance. It's supposed to be some sort of a ghost story but it feels kinda pointless. The whole thing is made up on a single premise and then a shocking event that acts as the plot point of the story. The ending is sorta confusing, we don't know if it's before or after the events, we don't know if they are dead or alive and we don't know their motivations behind their actions. The sound in this is very bad. The music is fine and fits the theme especially in the climax but the voice over quality is really bad. It sounds like someone recorded it on their headset microphone which they probably did. But overall when you view this as a passion project of one person it's fairly okay, there's potential and the animation is really the only thing that stands out. As a work of maybe an art student or someone with great passion I think it holds up pretty well. 6/10;Mixed Feelings
0;Adesugata Mahou no Sannin Musume;matthigh;https://myanimelist.net/profile/matthigh;3;Basically this is just showing old footage from the regular series with voiceovers.It starts with a little comedy bit about the three magical girls (Mami, Persia and Emi) eating a hot-pot, changing their form, and jumping into a hot-spring and saying tongue-twisters.This is followed by about 20 minutes where they show various scenes from the three shows' regular episodes, but the girls are talking over it as they call their 'boyfriends' and introduce each other.And, that's about it. There is not any particular reason for anyone to watch this, unless you are a die-hard completist.

0;Sinbi Apateu: Ghost Ball Bimil;Silvergirl524;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Silvergirl524;8;"It's been a little while since I watched this series, so I might be a little vague on the details, but I found this to be a nice show. I definitely recommend it. Nothing world changing, but worth watching for an amusing afternoon or two. (Yes, this series is 24 episodes long. Yes, I might have basically watched it continuously.)The series revolves around two siblings, older sister Ha-ri and younger brother Doo-ri. They and their parents live in Shinbi Apartments, a building rumoured to be haunted. Of course, the rumours are true. Not only are there several ghosts who refuse to move on, the building is also home to a goblin, who is also called Shinbi. (He's oddly cute for a goblin, in a stuffed animal sort of way.) Shinbi draws energy from the people who live in the building, and he won't be able to survive if the ghosts scare everyone away. So when Ha-ri and Doo-ri meet him, he offers them a deal: get rid of a ghost and he'll grant one wish. The two agree.From there, the story takes off in standard monster-of-the-week format, but gradually develops an over-arching plot that builds on the surprisingly deep emotions expressed by the guest cast. As in so many shows, some of the guest cast joins the main cast, bringing their hidden problems with them. Which, long story short, least to near catastrophe for the characters, and the city.The characters were by far my favourite thing about this show. There was real character depth and growth throughout the series. And not just from the main siblings. Like I said, the guest characters are pivotal to the episodes.The one major complaint I have about this show was with the first and last episodes. The first one began in media res. Everything I recapped above, the basic plot, is told in a recap in about one minute. I think this was a missed opportunity for character development. The series could have benefited from that recap being its own episode. I had a similar problem with the finale. It basically cut from the climactic last battle to ""well that's over and everything's pretty much back to normal."" I think a longer plot resolution would have tied things together better. For the record, there were no loose ends, but a few more sentences confirming that and elaborating on it would have been greatly appreciated.All and all, I found this to be a really enjoyable show, and definitely recommend it.";Recommended

The protagonist is a fiery, outgoing girl who loves her family and wants to help others. Once Sinbi enters the picture, she works hard to help each ghost overcome their internal dilemma (if possible). The supporting characters are all really sweet too. She makes new friends and meets a potential romantic partner in the process. Overall, it's a more lighthearted anime with enough dark, personal themes to keep the story interested. I highly recommend giving this anime a shot.By the way, it's on Netflix right now! Watch it there while you can!! It has English and Korean dubbed with subtitles if needed.;Recommended

The detail is that the 24 chapters practically look the same to you ""in the last chapters they wanted to compose it in a certain way but it turned out to be the same"" but for a strange reason you enjoy them and want to continue seeing more.The characters were good, each one has its strength that ends up convincing you and why not until you have a favoriteIn general, if the story were more detailed ""when they told the past of some fanstama"" it would have been something very good and not just a summarized flashback, although if you are demanding with this type of anime, the vast majority of stories are very typical and are not great. thing ""except for some that if they manage to get a tear out of you"" so if you have some time I highly recommend it but if you have seen or are a fan of this type of anime it may disappoint you but not to the degree of being the worst you have seen (or at least that you are very demanding)";Recommended

0;Mirai Choujuu Fobia;thetickdickler;https://myanimelist.net/profile/thetickdickler;4;"A girl has come back from the future, the far off year of 2112, a future ruled by hideous replinoid monsters. She has come back hidden away as as a coed in a typical Japanese school in the past to find a hero, a man strong enough to wield her futuristic sword, and fight of the replinoid monsters and save the women of Earth from a grisly doom.Fobia rushes right through the plot. Everything happens so quickly that there is no proper pacing or development. If you're going to have plot in your hentai, actually develop it. Otherwise, just put all of your focus in the sex scenes, which is what people come to (heh) this stuff for in the first place. Plus all of the plot points are so cliched and tired that you know exactly what's going on.For some reason, the anime goes between slap stick and horror, and because the hentai is rushing through the plot, having the anime go in between both can cause some whiplash. I guess it's not the worst horror themed hentai I've seen, but those standards are pretty low. I still don't know who the audience for horror themed porn is. I guess there has to be some audience for it, and you have to get your tentacles in there somehow.Considering what we're here for, let's talk about the sex scenes. The few sex scenes there are here are not that great, with most of the run time being taken up by plot. At least something like ""Mystery of the Necronomicon"" actually paced out it's plot, even though it wasn't that great. Here it's just terrible plot with sex scenes that are too few and far between, and are too short to be considered good.The anime ends on a cliffhanger, and I doubt that it's going to ever get resolved considering nobody has ever heard of this, and I doubt that the people who have aren't clamoring for more. I imagine it would be the same cliched and trope filled plot as the first two episodes. The anime is episodic in nature, leading to every monster encounter being exactly the same.The English dub is the typical 90's English dub you see in most terrible anime from the time, and is lazily slapped together because the English distributer had to slap something together for it's Western audience just so people didn't have to read while jerking off. You even get the odd line, such as our main protagonist saying ""But she was such a cute girl though."" in response finding out that one of his classmates was found dead in the school pool. Not exactly that great of a protagonist when he's thinking with his dick.If you're looking for something to wank to, you should probably skip Fobia unless you're really desperate, or mediocre 90's hentai is your thing. However, if you're looking for something for your so-bad-its-good night of anime watching, you could do a lot worse than Fobia.";Not Recommended

This is the first review of this VERY underated horror anime, and sadly so, because this is a great horror show, it has a great atmosphere and that feel of danger in each episode, you connect really well with the characters. I have watched a good amount of horror anime and i can say this is a very good one, especially for its time, in the 80´s and 90´s it was really hard to stand out, because great animes of that genre were coming, and if something stood out, it is because it was good, sadly it was overshadowed by bigger releases here in the overseas, so this never left japan, and that is the only ""problem"" i had, becuase you will have to watch the raws of it, no fansub in spanish, english or brazilian portuguese (the only languages i can fully understand, but, i also didnt find anything in italian or french, let alone german.), the raws are in the internet so you can watch it, but, have in mind that it is a raw, so you need to know one thing or two. The plot is simple and direct, but doesnt fall into the boring or dumb class, it is actually a great horror plot in a school setting, but, due to it being very focused on telling the story through the psychological horror of the chars reacting to the atmosphere, if you understand a bit of japanese you will be able to keep up just fine.The story start with a suicide from some girl that was kinda bullied and left behind by the class president, and after the suicide the girl who is the president of the class starts to dish and say that she was useless and her death was just life, people die everyday and the school shouldn't stop because of a simple mediocre student who died, then our heroin, the main character jumps in to calm things down and put the president on her place saying we should respect the family loss and stuff about how we need to respect the dead ones, but them, the story really starts when the spirit of the girl starts to shake the vase that was put in her table as a sign of respect, the class gets scared and this is were it all begins, i wont tell anything more because it would be a spoiler, and this series is sooo good, please check it out brothers and sisters !";Recommended
0;Lunn wa Kaze no Naka;ooReiko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ooReiko;10;"This film features and explores multiple complex themes including bullying, obsession, escapism and depression.The story is about a boy. The boy seems to have difficulties at discerning the reality around him due to his psychological issues. The boy is walking home from school when he finds an attractive young girl and that is where the story starts.The story is portrayed from a warped perspective as the perspective features the MCs own perspective combined with the reality surrounding him. This creates a conflict between the boys point of interest and the visual representation of that interest. This conflict is explored in a brilliant way throughout this film. Portrayal of this interest and conflict throughout the story can be observed through the interactions that the MC has with other characters that are present in the perceived reality compared to the MCs own perspective.The multilayered perspective of the storytelling is featured in the art as well the reality around the MC is obscured visually in bits and his own perspective in highlighted throughout the film. The design also enhances the conflict between the interest of the MC and the perceived reality. Overall the visual atmosphere and presence of the film in think is representative of the message and story of the film and reinforces the multilayered setting that is present. It also enables us to be able to experience the duality that can be found in the philosophy of the MC.Sound design is another part of the series that flows well with the duality and multilayered setting of the film, the perceived effects and characters sound is amplified compared to the more muffled design of the surrounding effects and sound design. This creates a sort of fever dream like atmosphere that is present throughout the series and is supported by the visual department of the film as well. Overall the experience whrn it comes to audio is representing the character really well.Now probably the most interesting part of the film, the characters. The film focuses on one character, the boy who is the MC of the film, and his philosophy compared to the perceived reality surrounding him and his character. That alone would provide a interesting character but the way his philosophy is portrayed throughout the film and how its portrayal and his struggle relates to the perceived reality is the part that I'm most impressed with. His struggle consists of depression and escaping the perceived reality through his obsession. Through this predicament he creates another ""false"" setting for himself where he draws himself in a more ideal setting. Choosing to live in that setting instead of the perceived reality surrounding him. His interactions and denial of the perceived reality are presented in superb manner through his interactions with the characters residing in the perceived reality. His struggle coming to accept his delusion and confronting the perceived reality with the safety net of his own setting is portrayed in a interesting way. Another interesting factor is the relationship that he has with his dad. The visual representation of his dad is always obscured in the film which suggests that he doesn't accept his dad as a part of his setting. His dad belongs to the perceived reality. He knows this and puts on a facade to deceive himself creating an interesting internal conflict within himself. You can see his struggle with this conflict and how it eats away him.Overall the film portrays the psychological mental issues with heavy themes in a brilliant manner so I'd recommend it if you're interested in good internal struggle and exploration of themes such as obsession, bullying, escapism and depression. It is rare to come across a such in depth exploration of these themes combined with a visual atmosphere and multilayered setting such as this one.";Recommended
0;Lunn wa Kaze no Naka;theolderaynati;https://myanimelist.net/profile/theolderaynati;3;"Lunn Flies into the wind is quite the story. The concept of a boy falling in love with a girl on a coffee poster is one I've never heard of before, and most likely neither have you. But if you're here then this must mean something about the story interests you (or you're just wasting time looking for something to add to your watchlist because why not).Story (with some spoilers) - 3/10Alright, so basically there's this boy (I forgot his name) who hates everything, school, his existence, guys who bully him, make fun of him... and all that other good stuff. One day after school while going back home, the boy passes through an alley with a bunch of posters on the wall. A certain poster catches his eye, with this beautiful girl on it, when it was basically just meant to be an advertisement for coffee, nothing more. The girl on the poster has the ability to talk, but could not live longer if she stays in that place and on the wall. That alley is very dirty and wet, so the paper will slowly get weaker and weaker until its no more. She also will lose her beauty (color of the picture) and fade away from the water, if she stays there any longer. The boy then takes the poster home and all the way to his bedroom wall to spend more time with girl in the picture. He then announces he has a girlfriend to his father while having lunch. A few days later, he takes the poster to school, and bullies find out about the poster by breaking into his locker. He then safely retrieves the poster from them, and goes back home all beaten up. The boy promises the girl would never get hurt again, but things lead to other things, and he then suddenly wants to commit suicide. The poster thankfully talks him out of it, by explaining that she is just a picture, and therefore she must be a picture of someone, so he should go meet that someone in real life. The boy then retrieves his will to live, and his goal in life was to find that girl and be with her. For over a year he searched for her, and finally manages to find the woman in the picture, but she's just an old woman at that time, married to the artist who created the coffee advertisement poster. The boy then storms back to his room in a fit of rage, realizing he technically just wasted a year of his life, and throws the poster under his bed. Time passes, and he eventually forgets about the girl on the poster - he had moved on with his life, (a smooth one if I may add). One day, he accidentally stumbles across the poster and hangs it up on his bedroom wall like old times. The doorbell suddenly rings and he meets a girl who looks exactly like the girl on the poster. The girl then explains she's the daughter of the woman on the poster, and she mysteriously looks almost identical to her. The boy had invited her to his room by then, and the poster suggests to be hidden because it would be weird if the girl saw her mother on a random boys' wall. The poster then flies into the wind since the boy placed her in a spot were she'd be susceptible to being sucked out. The boy and daughter then appear together on the balcony looking at the poster fly away, and they then basically became a thing from that moment.My thoughts in short:Even with a story as intriguing and weird as this, I knew from the moment the boy met the poster, things won't be taking off in a good direction. I thought to myself how could this possibly become any more interesting than that? You just met a talking poster. In the end I was right, the story had lost it's ""sparkle"" and was all basically downhill from there. The story started to drag, and I by then had lost interest near the end. The main character isn't likeable at all, and the animation was fine I guess. The ending had somewhat of a cozy feeling to it, but honestly I couldn't care less about the boy anymore at that point. This was not emotional at all, and considering it's supposed to at least make us feel some sort of way but failed at doing so, I was disappointed. Would not recommend Lunn wa Kaze no Naka ""Lunn Flies into the Wind"" to anyone. Don't have high hopes for this. It sadly won't deliver.";Not Recommended
0;Kuang Shen Mo Zun;Prince263;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Prince263;7;I am only writing this review because I read the reviews which were already available and skipped this anime for a long time but now as I didn't had any other anime to watch, so I gave it a try and I realised that this is not so bad. I found it worth the watch and I didn't got bored at all.Animation was same as other anime made by soyep and If you are watching anime produced by them then you should already know the type of animation that is in their animes. I personally like anime made by soyep as they are interesting and story is according to my taste.I admit that the story should've been a little fast but overall it was a good watch. I would really recommend this anime. Every person has their own different taste of anime. Just try it for yourself.I was just disappointed and annoyed by the main character. I have never seen this ungrateful main character. He just disrespects the most powerful emperor betian whose inheritance he got. Like he was trash and couldn't cultivate but then he got the resources and he was using it like it's his dad's property and when he was talking to Betian for the first time he was so disrespectful and he just keeps giving betians techniques to everyone like what is his right and if he is doing that he should at least have a sense of gratitude. I was annoyed by seeing this type of character.Enjoyment and overall- 7/10 and 7/10I personally really enjoyed the show and I would really recommend the. Right now I've watch 62 episodes and it was worth my time. So don't go on other reviews as their requirements or expectations are really high and If you liked ling Jian zun then you shouldn't have a problem watching this.;Recommended
0;Kuang Shen Mo Zun;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;1;"Mad Demon Lord recap (spoilers)Beitian, an ancient celestial god is overwhelmed by an opposing faction of gods and is forced to put his spiritual consciousness into hibernation for thousands of years hoping someone will be able to become the heir to his god bloodline; Also known in the series as ancient inheritance. Mad Demon Lord follows Lin Xiao, a son of the Lin family patriarch who had crippled cultivation and became a target of harassment by other noble families. One day while recovering from an injury, Lin Xiao inherits the ancient god's powerful techniques commencing his journey to climb the ladder of cultivation while also gaining comrades and fighting noble families/fixing internal strife.Story & Characters: 2/10My recap is a dumbed down version of the story; In all actuality the story is very slow and when there is about to be progression, there's a random moment of absurd comedy that breaks that momentum and keeps the plot and character progression stagnant. The side characters feel superficial because they either disappear from the spotlight for long periods of time or are forgotten and there's no sense of real conflict so it feels the episodes are poorly improvised. Obviously we know that's not true because the studio used the novel as a cookie cutter for the donghua and didn't bother to revise the story by removing unnecessary encounters or dialogue. Also, the power scale is so irrelevant, any increase in power doesn't make a difference to Lin Xiao since it seems he somehow magically cultivates to the true yuan realm late stage. Now we're left with a poorly written story, dispensable characters, illogical power scale and terribly absurd comedy.Art & Sound: 5/10Viewers who usually watch Donghua already know that the 3D assets are reused between chinese studio projects and the same can be said for the character rigging skeletons. In this series the art and animation is mediocre, it definitely doesn't reflect an anime of 2021 and is more better suited to an anime of 2017 or earlier. The animation is pretty stiff and lacks the range of motion anticipation as well as unsatisfyingly mal-informed cinematography. For a typical donghua viewer though, it's probably unnoticeable from other series with similar story/characters.The sound is also mediocre, the typical suspenseful music in background, comedic music when there is comedy or slow, soft melodic music during romantic scenes et.cOverall & Enjoyment: 1/10I can honestly say this was one of the worst series to be released in 2021. It lacks in a lot of aspects and worst of all can be very boring to watch unlike donghua that are bad, this is bad and boring.";Not Recommended
0;Kerokko Demetan;Estebanito;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Estebanito;7;Just stumbled upon Kerokko Demetan by sheer luck after looking for a silly and relaxing anime, but it turned out I was quite wrong about what I first thought about it. Despite being an anime whose target audience are essentially kids, Kerokko Demetan tackles issues that are not as childish as they seem.Kerokko Demetan depicts the story of a young eponymous frog, our hero Demetan, and his family, who after being evicted from their living place by newts (the in media res opening scene giving us a glimpse of the atrocity of the world in which we, the spectators, are almost immediately immersed) and losing most of the members of the family are forced to begin a new life in a pond, the Rainbow Pond. Then begins the tale of Demetan trying to change his environment, to make the Rainbow Pond a better place.Even though the narrative is not really structured, with most of the times loosely connected episodes and the only guiding thread being the will of Demetan to integrate and change the Rainbow Pound or protecting his lover, Ranatan and his family, each episode manages to tie into our hero's ambition and spur his determination. In order to do that, Kerokko Demetan doesn't shy away from adopting a really mature or even tragic tone (often cynical too, with the exemple of the punchline of the mother turtle who dies protecting a ping-pong ball after thinking it was her egg) by having our hero and his lover meet different characters, each of them having a common goal : they long to find their places in a world which threatens and/or rejects their existence.This contrast between a beautiful world, filled with beautiful yet surreal backgrounds with a vibrant color palette emphasizing the precious thing that is life, and the harsh reality where the characters are threatened by forces that excede them spurrs interesting questions. The characters, despite being animals, are driven by deep human feelings and, in some ways, are trying to break free from their animal conditions to attain true freedom.Although Kerokko Demetan suffers from some elements inherent to it's target audience such as silly dialogues that undermine the impact of some scenes or characters whose tomfoolery are pushed to their paroxysm, which often leads them to make incoherent choices (typically Kiata, who suddenly decides to help Demetan in the last episodes while bearing hatred for him since the beginning of the anime and the lack of some sign showing he was reflecting on his wrongdoings), it remains faithful to it's narrative, answering to the issues it tackles in a simple yet genuine way, with great emotional power.It may not be an amazing anime but I had a great time following the tale of Demetan fighting for the sake of his lover, family and his land. Once again, it was a great surprise.;Recommended
0;Kerokko Demetan;Deago;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Deago;5;"Kerokko Demetan is one of the darkest G-rated ""Family Friendly"" anime I've ever seen.After demetan survives a genocide on tree frogs from a group of salamanders, devouring the majority of his family members, leaving only him, his two parents, and two other sibilings who were both lost due to a storm shortly after the genocide, he gets separated from his parents and siblings, Demetan finds himself lost in a foreign land. A female frog named Rantan saves Demetan's life and helps him reunite with his father and mother, as a result, Demetan quickly falls in love with his saviour, but little does he know, Rantan happens to be the daughter of the cruel ruler of the pond in which he will be living.The anime has a strong start (episodes 1 & 2), but I don't recommend watching it for the main plot, as most of the 39 episodes don't advance the story or develop the main characters. After episode 2, the series becomes episodic, which is both the show's core strength and weakness. Many of these episodes fail to focus on the main cast, with only one or two new characters appearing for a single episode.Some of these episodes now actually maturely explore story themes related to the story's main theme; ""the world is cruel."" Parenthood, slavery, deception, capitalism, forgiveness, friendship, rebellion, racism, religion, and other themes are explored. While the majority of these episodes lack character development for the main characters, they are still worth watching because the conflict presented is ethically ambiguous or grey (not black or white).However, there is some inconsistency with the main characters, particularly Rantan, e.g., being suddenly hostile to Demetan after a conflict was resolved in the previous episode, which may be due to the fact that the episodes are written by a variety of writers.The anime has an English dub, a film called ""The Brave Frog"" in which the English studio combined the first two episode and two other random episodes from the series.Unfortunately, some of these ""episodic"" episodes are bad, either because they fail to adequately explore a theme related to the context of the main story theme, or because the new characters are boring one-dimensional characters.";Mixed Feelings
0;Madonna (Movie);ProfaneValkyrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ProfaneValkyrie;3;This is NOT your average anime and this is a shocker video.It belongs to some kind of modern art museum.Let me warm you first:- It has constantly flashy pictures therefore you eyes will probably end up hurting a bit and if you suffer from epilepsy don´t watch it!- It has lots of boobs, genitalia and other sexual symbols.- Unless you are high or something then you will not get the plot at all.- Not for people who gets easily creeped out nor offended.Yeah this anime, Madonna, a short video, is a special snowflake, there is really no need for telling more, the warnings have said enough and I don´t even know how to describe this weird what ever it is XDBut I most say even though the visuals are very very special, then I liked the artistic style :P5;Not Recommended

2;Madonna (Movie);Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;WARNING Sudden flash of lights SHOW FOR THE MAJORITY OF THIS ART!aside from the warning i gave it a 3-4. It was okay but i was not happy with their method of action/demonstration.Another art piece not an anime.The message is up to the viewer. My interpretation was society being pestered with nudity no matter what they watch. Unable to turn away because of fascination the goggle it up. Mountains upon mountains with beyond reasonable limits. For the women it sets unrealistic impression on how to be. Forcing them without having a literal gun involved to become fit to live out to the idealistic impression set forth. My guess this was a hippy movement or a bunch of parents unsatisfied with governments job at maintaining discretion on nature's dirty secret.I get it director you want us to feel sick but this method might kill us before we reach the end!;Not Recommended
0;Kujira (1952);AlanDSouza1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AlanDSouza1;7;From what I can determine, Kujira appears to be the first recorded anime on this site that has color processing applied on the film renders of the background art. This is yet another silhouette animation, a style that would quickly lose popularity as improved animation and recording techniques continued to be worked on. I suspect it was probably the difficulty of working with the new colored medium that forced a regression to more simpler silhouette techniques in this film The story seems a bit incomprehensible, not particularly helped by the terrible choice in background sound design. The auditory simulations of a shipwreck emphasized the chaotic nature of waves and ocean sounds accompanied by thunder, but the lack of sound mixing (I'm talking relative to the time period) makes it resonate in a messy cacophony of noise.;Recommended

Then we get another perspective from the female cat, who got curious of the male cat and they finally got together.This 2 minute special is like a commerical, playing wonderful classical music.

And although it's short it manage to have an adorable story.I like how the animation was well done, and the CVs did amazing, they hired the good ones too, Ishikawa Kaitou, and Saori.There's nothing to dislike about this either. I pretty much like everything that happened in the whole short story! The way they portray the cats as personified characters is the big picture that got me hooked into finishing it.;Recommended

Go ahead and watch it, it'll put a smile on your face. The animation is nice, the music is nice, and I mean come on, it's two cats, they can hardly NOT be cute.

0;Nanami-chan;Anomalous;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Anomalous;5;"Sometimes, one has to put themselves in the shoes of the intended audience of a work to fully appreciate it. Nanami-chan&rsquo;s a good example of this &ndash; it&rsquo;s very obviously made for small children with short attention spans. With only 12 five-minute episodes in this first season, you would think it would be a series that anyone who can appreciate a good kid&rsquo;s show will enjoy. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not entirely true.Our story begins when a little girl named Michi and her parents move into an apartment complex of sorts in the form of treehouses. When Michi investigates her new room, she finds an odd fruit from which a cute little blobby animal named Nanami-chan hatches. Together, they learn more about the world and people around them &ndash; like any good kodomo anime characters. Each episode contains its own story, usually involving Michi and Nanami meeting one of their neighbors and helping them solve a problem. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward stuff, really, and because of that it&rsquo;s not always very engaging. You want Michi and Nanami to be happy, but it&rsquo;s hard to actively care how that happens. Still, it&rsquo;s not bad by any means; just not particularly impressive.The series&rsquo; biggest downfall is the character designs. Quite frankly, they look downright bizarre, complete with odd proportions and huge, soulless eyes. They can be honestly hard to look at sometimes. The animation may be smooth and in general well-done, but the character designs are so unbearable that this is easy to forget. The same can be said for the music &ndash; there&rsquo;s no opening or ending theme song sans a few notes over extremely short credits, and most of the series&rsquo; music is simplistic, forgettable little tunes.Since each episode is so short, it&rsquo;s hard to get attached to the many bizarre new characters that are introduced, especially since they are all, predictably, rather flat. Still, Michi herself is a sweet little girl that&rsquo;s easy to like &ndash; and for the intended audience to relate to. Of course, Nanami is the real star of the show and she&rsquo;s a great example of a cute mascot character that is easy to enjoy even when she&rsquo;s center stage. Most, if not all, of the cuteness in the series comes from her, and she&rsquo;s definitely the best part of the show.When I watched Nanami-chan, I tried to think like a 7-year-old &ndash; and still got bored quickly. In the sea of children&rsquo;s shows about a cute kids and animals exploring, learning, and helping, Nanami-chan simply fails to stick out, mainly because the most memorable elements include weak character designs and overly-short episodes. Most of the children I have known would find this series quite forgettable, while as a teen I can barely enjoy it at all. Nanami may be cute, but nothing else in her series is, and that&rsquo;s a shame.";Mixed Feelings

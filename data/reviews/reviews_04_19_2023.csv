Fine.Just having two cups of coffee!Anyway, this has been great.Thanks for the coffee.Yeah, it's no trouble.Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,I'd be up the rest of my life.Are you...?Oan I take a piece of this with me?Sure! Here, have a crumb.- Thanks!- Yeah.All right.

I find thatto be a very disturbing term.I don't imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you?- No.- I couldn't hear you.- No.- No.Because you don't free bees.You keep bees. Not only that,it seems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey.They're very lovable creatures.Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.You mean like this?Bears kill bees!How'd you like his head crashingthrough your living room?!Biting into your couch!Spitting out your throw pillows!OK, that's enough.

Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!That's not his real name?! You idiots!Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations onyour Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005.Thank you. Thank you.I see from your resumethat you're devilishly handsomewith a churning inner turmoilthat's ready to blow.I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?Not yet it isn't. But is thiswhat it's come to for you?Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you don'thave to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir?Watch it, Benson!I could blow right now!This isn't a goodfella.This is a badfella!Why doesn't someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home?!- Order in this court!- You're all thinking it!Order! Order, I say!- Say it!- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that.I think the jury's on our side.Are we doing everything right, legally?I'm a florist.Right. Well, here's to a great team.To a great team!Well, hello.- Ken!- Hello.I didn't think you were coming.No, I was just late.I tried to call, but... the battery.I didn't want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.Oh, that was lucky.There's a little left.I could heat it up.Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.So I hear you're quite a tennis player.I'm not much for the game myself.The ball's a little grabby.That's where I usually sit.Right... there.Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn't really a special skill.You think I don't see what you're doing?I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common.Do we?Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out.That's just whatI was thinking about doing.Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.I'm going to drain the old stinger.Yeah, you do that.Look at that.You know, I've just about had itwith your little mind games.- What's that?- Italian Vogue.Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.A lot of ads.Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine?Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!I think something stinks in here!I love the smell of flowers.How do you like the smell of flames?!Not as much.Water bug! Not taking sides!Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!This is pathetic!I've got issues!Well, well, well, a royal flush!- You're bluffing.- Am I?Surf's up, dude!Poo water!That bowl is gnarly.Except for those dirty yellow rings!Kenneth! What are you doing?!You know, I don't even like honey!I don't eat it!We need to talk!He's just a little bee!And he happens to bethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!Long time? What are you talking about?!Are there other bugs in your life?No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And you're one of them!Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster!Goodbye, Ken.And for your information,I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man!I'm sorry about all that.I know it's gotan aftertaste! I like it!I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me.I couldn't overcome it.Oh, well.Are you OK for the trial?I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas.We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.Good idea! You can really see why he'sconsidered one of the best lawyers...Yeah.Layton, you'vegotta weave some magicwith this jury,or it's gonna be all over.Don't worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury aroundis to remind themof what they don't like about bees.- You got the tweezers?- Are you allergic?Only to losing, son.

Yes, Your Honor!Where is the rest of your team?Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,and as a result,we don't make very good time.I actually heard a funny story about...Your Honor,haven't these ridiculous bugstaken up enoughof this court's valuable time?How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on?They have presented no compellingevidence to support their chargesagainst my clients,who run legitimate businesses.I move for a complete dismissalof this entire case!Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm goingto have to considerMr. Montgomery's motion.But you can't!

0;Forever Rain;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;8;A slooooow song. Gives off the right vibe for something as such.The world here is quite good at using distorted fluid motion to describe the atmosphere at hand. Monochrome, lethargy, emptiness, the whole array of depression or such is included furthermore embellishing what this music video wants to give.RM did a pretty good job with the singing too. His voice drew longer with particular lyrics, his pitch hit low as well. He knows how to deliver, and it just all around made for a good music video. Doesn't seem to be one to have depressing themes for the sake of it. It feels genuine.A good MV if you can spare 4 mins for it.;Recommended

The synopsis on the website says the the show is what you get when you clean up the static that comes through on an empty channel but nothing in the movie itsself says so. most of the movie consists of the same interview with a strange mute man in glasses, where the interviewer is talking about a genre of work he invented called ""ficfyon"", and it cuts back and forth between this, tv monitors, and strange visions of people in fields and mines.This is definetely an ""art house"" film, it doesn't have any easily digestable meaning, if at all, but the art in it is beautiful and its only 3 minutes so overall i would consider it worth a watch.";Mixed Feelings

0;Haipa Bei Peng Chu de Nuhai;dars809;https://myanimelist.net/profile/dars809;6;Haipa Bei Peng Chu de Nuhai (A Girl Who's Afraid of Touching People) is not something I thought I would watch or have any thoughts about, but it had a pretty good effect on me. Whatever the students at the Royal College of Art were trying to do with this, I would say they made a pretty good minimalist interpretive piece of art. I'm kind of surprised this qualifies as anime and is even on this website, but whatever.That being said, as this is only four minutes long, there isn't much to talk about. The art style is understandably simplistic and vague, leaving some things up to the viewer's imagination but can also clearly tell the story that the creators wanted to tell. Color choice seems to be everything here, and contrasting colors have a great effect on the tone and mood the animation wants to covey. The sounds are also half of the experience here, even more than other pieces of media given the simplistic art style that some viewers might have trouble understanding. They do corresponding to whatever is being shown on screen, though, so there is not much room for interpretation left there.It is hard to understand the story, and this is probably intentional. From what I got, this is supposed to be some sort of representation of depression and suicidal tendencies such as self-harm and self-loathing. However, the few times that words appear on the screen make everything even more confusing. I am sure that there are numerous hidden messages and meanings in this short animation, but most of them must have flown over my head, which the creators must have accounted for.Overall, while this isn't going to be sticking with you for years, I would say that you should definitely watch this if you're bored and have five minutes to spare. The director, Liang-Hsin Huang, appears to have made multiple similar works, all of which are pretty interesting as well.;Mixed Feelings

Hope the sun doesn't get in your eye (unintentional rhyme). Maybe watch some TV, baseball perhaps? Have the fan on? Pray bugs don't crawl in your face.This is a very interesting short movie with not a lot to go on for it, just telling, a maybe rather accurate life of a solitary ice pop. He just complains a lot like some old man, maybe does something once in a while. Oh, that part isn't accurate, but it is a nice touch.It looks really nice too.

It is not a unique or particularly interesting story, though. It's also necessarily barebones, because it's only a few minutes long.Art 4/10: The art is amateurish, but not downright bad. Decent character design. Animation is lacking. However, the visuals are nicely timed to the music, and suit the mood of the song well.Sound 8/10: Not gonna lie, this song is dope. Reminds me of the band カラスは真っ白 [A crow is white].Character 5/10: Not much can be gleaned about the boy from the video. The girl is likeable though. I would describe her as ""determined, yet moe"".Enjoyment 8/10: I really liked the song and that was a pleasant surprise. I also have a weakness for moe girls, so that helped.Overall 6/10: When reviewing a music video, I think the question is how much the visuals add to the experience. In this case, the visuals really bring the song to life. They give a character and a story to the song, which, though quite basic, I will probably think of whenever I hear this song again. And I will hear this song again, because it's pretty great. I just doubt I'll watch the video again, because it's not nearly as good as the song.";Mixed Feelings
0;Sherlock Holmes to Watson Hakase;darthtruder;https://myanimelist.net/profile/darthtruder;5;This is a pretty good video. The art is stylized and grows on you as you watch it, at least it did for me. The animation is pretty smooth but some scenes get reused. This music is quite nice. It seems to be inspired by 1800s English folk songs and later in the song it seems to have taken inspiration from Irish folk songs. The instruments themselves are predominantly what you'd expect from 70s Japanese music. It's an overall pretty good and calming experience and I enjoyed looking at the animation with the song. There's also a Hatsune Miku version of this song on Nico Nico Douga.;Mixed Feelings
0;Tian Shu Qi Tan;Afr0deity;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Afr0deity;7;The story is a promethean tale of a child of divine birth acquiring forbidden knowledge which ends up falling into the wrong hands. It's good aside from its rushed deus-ex-machina ending. The first half is great, but there are sadly no fluctuations in tension throughout the movie, making the second act feel like a slog after a while.Sound and visuals are consistently impressive. Character designs and animations are so emotive that the story could almost work as a silent movie. There is a great amount of physical comedy paired with an orchestral soundtrack that matches each action on-screen. Overall, it was better than I expected.;Recommended
0;Xiong Shi Shaonian;Llacerta;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Llacerta;10;I didn't have high expectations for this animation, because I expected it to be like other Chinese films, but this film is different, very good.Unlike the mythological concept that is always used, this film packs everyday life as the film's concept. Regarding poverty, bullying, and hope which are packaged in the lion dance theme. Still has a thick Chinese concept, but quite different.In my country, the concept of poverty films is not something new, you could say it has been around a lot. So for me this film's story is easy to predict, but because it's a Chinese animation, you could say this is something different. I really like the development of the characters, especially A Juan, he is very memorable for.In terms of animation, this film is similar to the others, Chinese animation does have satisfying visuals, like this film. The camera movement is good, the lion dance game really fascinates me. Not to mention the great soundtrack, I'd love to hear it again.This film is very good in many ways, story, animation, music, characters, and an epic ending. Although there are also shortcomings, but this film is very memorable. You guys should watch it.;Recommended
0;Yami Yami (September 2012);_cjessop19_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_cjessop19_;5;"Yami Yami is a song that was featured on Minna no Uta, which then the singer produced an animated music video for. It features a boy and ""things that cannot be named"" as the main characters.The artwork was done by the singer, where she drew the characters with smoke effects overlaid on top of the screen to give the video a supernatural feel to it (POV: you're a chain smoker). Even though she did the artwork herself, hiding it with the smoke screen effect still doesn't hide the fact that the art and (lack of) animation is bad.The song is catchy and good, though that is the only redeeming quality of this music video. Ignore the animation for this one, only listen to the song.5/10.";Mixed Feelings

You have just been a victim of unsolicited tiktok dancing.My apologies, as I have just spoiled the plot of After Hours for you. It is, after all, quite hard to talk about something with length shorter than one minute without actually describing the content.I am quite honestly unsure how to rate this, and I’m quite convinced this is just a shitpost that accidentally got professionally produced.

0;Rhythmens;NextUniverse;https://myanimelist.net/profile/NextUniverse;9;Rhythmens is a story about life, that's it. Like seriously. There is nothing more to go on about it discluding any analysis on technicalities and the impacts it has on the viewer.Despite this minuscule offering, this reduced simplicity, I'd say watching Rhythmens is something of a wonderful treat anyway. As stated, it doesn't offer a lot, yet it also offers the opportunity to find entertainment in simple things at hand. It's almost as if the lucidity of the surroundings is telling you not to dive deep into what's there, but to take the superficial and the transparent messages that reflect back to you as you watch this. You end up witnessing a piece of very honest work about very honest people living very honest lives. A detail that drives none other than blissful satisfaction in the beauty that is simplicity.The artwork here is also something to praise quite a bit. If it wasn't obvious from the get-go, it's simple, but it's also very real, taking into account how people actually look like but still retaining a cartoon body, syncing the transcendental power of cartoons, going to limits, not within human reach but also showing that it is real people who are the shells of this cartoon environment. It ends up giving a multitude of powerful images consistently simply because of the nice mix it has going for it.All in all, Rhythmens is worth the watch if you ever come across it. It's ~12 mins [including episode 0] which makes it incredibly time-efficient, and I suppose it serves well in diversifying the anime life of the audience. Whatever you want to watch this short for, I'd go and push forward aiding your potential viewing of this. It's a good simple work, that has its own style in the band of what already exists. Simplicity as its finest, I suppose.;Recommended
0;Hakata Bus Terminal Gorou;0nyx;https://myanimelist.net/profile/0nyx;2;As a long time fan of Onara Gorou, I began watching this anime with very high expectations. But make no mistake: Onara Gorou is the superior Gorou, this bus terminal is a sham. A Gorou on the surface, but in reality, an empty terminal with none of the onara flavor. I only watched a single episode but could already smell very well that something was off, so I couldn't bring myself to continue it. I already rewatch the entire Onara Gorou series every day as part of my morning routine, and I just don't see a reason to watch Terminal Gorou when it's totally eclipsed by it's masterpiece predecessor.One positive thing about this anime is it's very unique. Talking buses interacting at a Bus Terminal is truly unexplored territories for the anime medium, but I wish the themes were explored in more depth with a higher budget animation.;Mixed Feelings
0;Alita De Shi Lian;Ubume;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Ubume;6;My first ever review on a short film guys.Story: 4/10The plot is lacking originality but it is not that bad compared to other unoriginal anime/donghua. It is about a girl named Alita who is half dragon and half human. Dragons have been terrorizing humans so humans look down on her and want to hunt her down. It’s five minutes though so the plot is kind of rushed and unclear at times.Animation: 7/10For a short film, the animation and art style are both simple and nice. And well, this entire short film is just an animation test. Not bad for someone who is new to animating.Characters: 5/10There is pretty much only one character the film focuses on, Alita as a matter of course who is a typical valorous and smug independent female protagonist. She is half dragon but human at heart and she will defend herself and other people around her.Sound: 5/10There is really no soundtrack but the sound effects are good and that is it.In the end, it is just an animation test with decent animation and a fine story. It isn’t awful and it has potential but overall it is un memorable and unoriginal. Not as bad as some other short films on here though.;Mixed Feelings
0;Yugesho;IzzyMarrie;https://myanimelist.net/profile/IzzyMarrie;6;A very simple, yet beautiful story of an older woman in China reminiscing both the tragedy and happiness of her past. The animation has no real dialogue but is easy to follow, the true gem of this short being the painter-esque animation. With what looks like watercolor, each scene drips into the next like a beautiful stream of consciousness. If I had to nitpick, I think the sound design could use some work. Most notably, when certain characters were running, the sound was quicker than their steps. But overall, most of the ambience was nicely done.It's only about 10 minutes, so I'd definitely recommend going to the official youtube channel (geidai animation) to watch it yourself. It's definitely unique, and you also have the benefit of the story being shown rather than told (so no worries about finding subtitles);Mixed Feelings

0;Nijiiro Love Letter;abiisu;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abiisu;7;Whilst trying to find the lowest rated anime on MAL I accidentally went to far and found a bunch of shows with no scores and decided to give them a watch and this is one of those shows. Honestly had no idea what it was all about since I watched it without English subtitles and I have no grasp of Japanese but the song was very enjoyable, light-hearted and fun. The animation was cute and friendly. Nothing seemed to be ground breaking animation wise but it doesn't need to be, it seems to be a song for kids and it does its job well as that. Solid way to spend 5 minutes on something when bored or just want something fun to watch.;Recommended
0;Rou e Tian;Atakan-Titan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Atakan-Titan;5;It was one of the darkest anime I've ever watched. The drawing and animation style is interesting but reactionary. It was a weird anime, I personally didn't care for the story underneath. Still, I enjoyed watching this instead of wasting 10-15 minutes of my time. The narrative techniques of the story are told in harmony with the drawings. Although the dialogues sound strange, it adds to the tension. A short-lived anime at a slow pace. I think the anime's use of music could have been better, but the given world really serves its purpose and manages to tension you. In conclusion, if you're not going to watch anything else, I suggest you watch it.;Mixed Feelings

0;Shizi Kua Xia;_cjessop19_;https://myanimelist.net/profile/_cjessop19_;1;Never would I have thought that there would be a depiction of genital mutilation as an entry on this site, but here we are. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, one of the most fucked up pieces of anime I have ever laid eyes upon. I'll lay out what to expect from this entry.This simple Chinese cartoon plays a simple story of two men who trip out on some sort of hallucinogenic and find themselves on a remote island. A hill rises up on four legs and transforms into a lion, a lion with a huge set of dick and balls. The two men jerk the lion off and it ejaculates all over a school building that is also on the island. You have to feel bad for the janitor who has to clean all of that mess up.The two men slice the penis down the middle and plant a flag into the flesh like it's the moon landing, this causes the aliens in the testicles to be alerted of the intruders and the penis clamps down on itself and crushes the man who planted the flag. Enraged, and with the victim's remains all over his face, the other man climbs through the pee pee hole and into the control room in the testes. He kills the aliens and takes over the controls.The lion's penis detaches from itself and starts to fly away, but a robot lady appears from the ocean and grabs it in midair. The lady jumps onto the island and stands directly on top of the school. Remember what your parents told you about the birds and the bees? Yeah, she does what you think she does and blood from her nether region gushes out and floods the island as she T-poses.This isn't some furry fanfic, this is what actually happened.Highly do not recommend unless you're into cock and ball torture.1/10.;Not Recommended

I rated this an 7 because it does all you could ask it to do in its runtime: Set up its premise, give a chunk of the characters a bit of personality, and create a good atmosphere. The art is something I can't rate to be honest because the copy of this I watched was presented in glorious 144p Potatocam. I do think it could have been nice to look at though if it had higher video quality, there seemed to be a bunch of CGI though. The sound was...there...nothing crazy but it did the job.

0;Jinguizi;AoT_Lover-STYLL;https://myanimelist.net/profile/AoT_Lover-STYLL;10;Jinguizi or The Ladybug is an extraordinary anime movie and I believe that it is one of if not the best anime movie, I have ever seen. The character development shown in this movie is exquisite and happens very briefly but many times throughout this film. I was viewed by the orgasmic site of the main character known as “The Ladybug”. This character is the essence of Beauty itself. I have studied this movie for many years. I believe that it is the meaning of life. I believe that this movie is the meaning to the existence of humanity as a whole.Let me go into detail. As a young boy people always told me to love beautiful people but not all people are beautiful on the inside that's what this Ladybug is trying to tell us Throughout this Tale. While this courageous ladybug scales new heights for bug-kind, riding on a jet plane and descaling a giant lizard, she's also telling us the meaning of life and a writer of this movie must be, God himself. Now I am not saying that the writer of this movie is Christian God I'm saying that he's/she/them are merely a god. a god from some sort of religion and he is trying to tell us through this movie The Meaning of Life, this movie is the god's prophecy, That they are telling true this masterpiece. The God that made this movie was not expecting it to blow up but they were expecting it to find the Chosen ones that would spread the word of this story and make a new religion of sorts.I believe that people who see this movie and understand the true beauty of it are the Chosen ones, chosen by the gods or god above. Now I am not saying that you have to be a perfect individual to understand the beauty of this film, for example, I am just a normal boy that lives in a normal town in a normal country and I understand the beauty, I am so normal that I listen to rap music on my iPhone but I can still see and understand the beauty just like I'm some type of monk or priest.This movie tells us that everyone in the world is equal and everyone deserves to be in Paradise or in some sort of “heaven” just like the Ladybug… just like you... and I.;Recommended

Even Dragon Quest-like shows pop up.Subversion on the Good Race = Humans, Evil Race = Demons is so cliché you should be groaning when hearing it.Childish shows having awfully dark and brutal themes is nothing new. Some people might get a kick out of how little the show emphasizes its horrible brutality, but that's a satire common with the subversion.CGI shows that look exceptionally well are also out there, especially with the simplistic Children's TV style that this series has.Protagonist whose defining characteristic is being an ass is and always was a trope that pops up regularly. A band of misfits aren't anything new to explore.Mind-blowingly spectacular animation, especially in fight scenes, is remarkable, but most won't stand out in a sea of sakuga.

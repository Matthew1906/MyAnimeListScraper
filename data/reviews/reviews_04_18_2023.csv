Such convenience. Much wow. More time to eat. Maybe I should ask Morgan Spurlock if he wants to super size his meal?There's nothing all that special about this 30 second ad. The animation is standard, the theme song for the series quietly playing in the background is great as always, you have the chemistry between Lupin, Goemon and Jigen. I couldn't ask more for a McDonalds advert.I'm salivating as I'm writing this. God help me.6/10.;Recommended
0;Toki-iro Kaima;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"This OVA is bizarre and is something that needs to be experienced (""seen"" is too light a word) to believe. From what information I've been able to gather about its release, it seems that each episode of the ""Toki-iro Kaima"" OVA was bundled with a corresponding manga volume and CD single. The idea was that you first read the manga, then watch the OVA, and then conclude your ""experience"" by listening to the CD. This set of 3 mediums of entertainment was branded as an ""Original Comic Video,"" and ""Toki-iro Kaima"" appears to be the only ""Original Comic Video"" that was ever made.As the OVA itself is only one-third of this equation, it doesn't work as a standalone piece. It's not so much an adaptation, or even advertisement of the manga, as it is a recap of it. It certainly tells a story — it's not a music video or compilation of images like ""Cipher the Video"" or ""Milk House Dreaming"" — but only the major scenes are featured in the OVA. It is assumed that the viewer has already read the manga and knows the characters and can use their memory to fill in the gaps.Despite the OVA's title, it actually covers content from the prequel manga, ""Aoi Youma-tachi,"" as well. The gist of both of these manga is that there are high-ranking spirits called ""youma"" and low-ranking ones called ""kaima."" The main characters of the prequel manga are born between a youma (a dragon spirit) and a human, and in the sequel manga, the child of one of the main characters has human, youma and kaima blood. These characters get attacked by either the youma or kaima, depending on the situation. As one would guess, the main characters also have special powers that they use to fight their attackers.Speaking of the manga brings me to another odd point about this OVA: the manga author's heavy involvement. The mangaka, Wayu Suzumiya, is credited as the director, scriptwriter, one of the character designers, theme song lyric writer, theme song performer, and voice actor for this anime. In the next episode previews at the end of each OVA, characters even break the fourth wall to talk to her. Ex: ""Suzumiya-sensei, what's going to happen to me in the next episode?"" etc. The final episode has a short extra anime at the end that introduces the author as a character, with one scene showing another staff member praising Suzumiya for her performance of the OVA's theme songs, and another that shows her wanting to skip out on writing manga drafts. There's a long message signed by her at the very end thanking the viewers and particularly the staff for their support, noting that it was her ""directorial debut"" and she caused a lot of trouble for the staff. She also states that the production schedule was intense and she was worried that they wouldn't be able to finish in time. I've seen some anime with similar messages at the end before, but never to this extent. It added a uniquely personal touch to the OVA. And how many other OVAs are out there that were directed by manga authors?That brings me to the next point: the technical aspects of this OVA. Judging by the direction of this OVA, I think I can understand why most manga authors don't moonlight as directors. The pacing and scene transitions are bad, and there are awkward shots galore. But the worst part of this OVA, and what I will remember most about it, is the dialogue. The dialogue in ""Toki-iro Kaima"" is, bar none, the most terrible I've ever heard in an anime. There is no subbed version available, but the conversations are so odd that even if there were subs, viewers would probably think they were machine translated or randomly generated. As an example, here is a roughly translated example of a conversation between two cousins that have romantic feelings for each other (we'll get into that aspect later):Boy: Don't worry. I don't like girls who weigh more than I do.Girl: It's only about the difference of one hamburger!Boy: Oh, do hamburgers these days weigh 1 or 2 kilograms?Girl: Why do you always have to be like this?! I hate you! *runs out of the room*Boy: *sitting in the dark in an empty room* Thank you.All four episodes are full of awkward conversations like this. There are even some that are so casually explicit that they made me do a double take, like this exchange between a mother and daughter who are waiting for the son (brother), who is late in coming home for dinner:Sister: Where is (her brother)? I bet he's having sex right now!Mother: Well, as long as I don't become a grandmother, I'm OK with that.And then there's this gem of cringe, between one of the main characters and a mysterious female transfer student, who, mid-conversation, suddenly bites the main character in the arm and sucks his blood:Weirdo: I'm sorry; did that hurt? I do that without thinking to people I like.Main character: That's a dumb habit.Weirdo: Is it? *licks lips*The dialogue goes beyond being merely cliche or poorly written; it's on a whole other level. I wouldn't venture to say it's in the ""so bad it's good"" territory, though, because at least the dialogue would be enjoyable if it were. It's almost like an AI or an alien learned how to write conversations by watching a bunch of anime, and this was the output. It all sounds vaguely non-human.I could go on longer about the dialogue, but I think I've made my point, so I will move ahead to cover the other aspects. The character designs are generic — nothing special. The animation is not good, but I've seen worse. The voice acting is decent, but it's wasted on the bad dialogue. The music is... not bad. The background music is done by Kaoru Wada, a well-known composer who created the iconic soundtrack for ""Inuyasha,"" amongst others. I believe this was the first anime he scored. While relatively unrefined at this stage, the music is reminiscent of his later works. The theme music, as mentioned, is largely written and sung by the mangaka, at times with duets with male singers/voice actors. These songs aren't bad, but sometimes they don't fit the scenes they're in that well. (In addition to ending themes, some of the songs are inserts.)A brief note about the plot: since this wasn't intended to be viewed independently of the manga, it's hard to evaluate. I will say that despite being disjointed and lacking information, the plot does go from point A to point B, and the story is generic enough that it's not difficult to follow along and predict what's going to happen. Since the runtime of each episode is only 20 minutes, the episodes are relatively easy to digest, but neither the story nor the characters are that interesting.As for objectionable content, there is surprisingly plenty. There's a sex scene involving a teacher and her underage student, there's a (very unnecessary) nude scene of a teenage girl taking a shower, and there are a number of spoken lines in the OVA referencing sexual content. In episodes 3 and 4, we are introduced to 2 cousins who are living together, and they are heavily hinted at being attracted romantically to each other, and are put in a suggestive position at one point. There is violence, but not as much as one would expect in an OVA like this. There are a couple of Go Nagai-esque demon transformations, some blood, some background characters getting killed off-screen, etc. But most of the demons just disintegrate when the main character looks at them (seriously), so the grotesque aspects are kept to a minimum.This was a difficult OVA to rate due to its nature. As something to enjoy for plot, animation or character development, this gets a hard pass. The objectionable content also makes this hard to recommend to a general audience. But if you want to watch something one-of-a-kind — a supplement to a manga that literally has the mangaka's name written all over it, and unbelievably strange dialogue, then this is a must see.";Mixed Feelings
0;Drill;ejala;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ejala;5;"Where does one draw the line between animation and film editing? Takashi Ito's works beg that question. From the DVD compilation Itou Takashi Eiga Sakuhin Shuu, about half of the films have been added to the database here by someone. Half haven't. Having watched films from both categories, I can't see much difference between the two.As to Drill, like many of this director's others, it has no sound or characters, and consists of live-action stills. This time the scene appears to be the shoe lockers and surrounding halls of a school. This is a guess, they could just as easily be filing cabinets in an office. Frankly, I'm not sure it matters. The reason you see such a low score for this film over in the stats is likely because narratively, nothing happens. The camera pans about the motionless scene for awhile. Then the director starts playing with perspective. Things become distorted to the point of abstraction, then the film ends.So, why the comparably high score on my part? Well, it's not bad for what it is: an experiment in image manipulation and film technique. I was never a film student, so I can't say if this was particularly innovative, but it had some visual interest. Comparing films like this to traditional mainstream anime such as Attack on Titan isn't comparing apples to oranges, it's comparing apples to monkey wrenches. They have nothing in common save being film from Japan. It's like asking someone to compare Ben-Hur with a flash video off Youtube; you simply cannot judge them on the same scale. That being said, I cannot whole-hardheadedly recommend you watch this. Despite the virtues I've extolled, it's still rather boring. Unless you are a student of film-making, or have a great deal of interest in experimental films, you might be better off investing five of your minutes elsewhere.";Mixed Feelings
0;Start;Argyrodite;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Argyrodite;2;Does it have an interesting small story? Is the animation good? No and no. One of those could have been it's redeeming watch value, considering other animated commercials that have been a showcase of good animation like Studio Colorido's work.The promotion of the city is not organically woven into the commercial itself, and feels very unnaturally delivered in a long monologue exposition. There's almost no animation beyond mouths moving. The art itself is passable,the character design serve it's purpose, the characters are not unsympathetic.Some of the target audience might look Machida up, so I guess it may serve it's purpose that way. However, using anime as a medium didn't really add any value here. Not worth watching for the artistic content.;Not Recommended

I feel the people rated this badly are unfamiliar with Nobukazu Takemura. Takemura this time brings us one of his jazz songs. Accompanying him is the vocalist Aki Tsuyuko. I personally prefer it when he has vocaloids do the vocals but Tsuyuko is definitely not bad. I do not listen to jazz that much but Takemura's work is excellent. I give the music a strong 9. There is not much of a story, it's just a girl playing with a blobby dude and pigs.Now about the visuals and animation which is what I believe is the culprit of the bad ratings, well actually the people who don't have prior of knowledge of Takemura are to blame. The video is in choppy, blobby, claymation. It looks like a kid made it and well that is intentional. I honestly would not be surprised if a kid did make the characters in the video. Takemura's music constantly focuses on the imagination that children have. So it makes perfect since to make it look like a kid made the video.;Recommended

0;Feng Wei Ying Xiong;Balabuba;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Balabuba;1;Well... it was an interesting experience?As someone who actually plays Heroes of the Storm regularly and knows fair share of Blizzard's multiverse lore I wish heroes would at least resemble their counterparts from games.I just couldn't stand seeing Valla, or so called Lenneth here, being the way she was, I wouldn't call being flustered all the time suitable for someone who is known for ferocity and hatred after loosing her home village.I do understand that creators had freedom with what they wanted to show, especially since series wasn't approved by Blizzard, however dampening characters with so much lore is kinda illogical to me, why would you want to change something that's already liked by many? While so far I've been focusing mostly on Valla, the one that struck me the most was Nova, here called Natasha, probably because they based her character solely on what's been shown in trailer that's also remade to be first episode of the series, which makes her seem so dull, lacking any characteristic other than being seductive.When it comes to the plot, it doesn't look much better, concept of underdog having some kind of special power was used so many times it's not appealing at all anymore.What I do appreciate is however overall quality of animation, while many might not like the style I do appreciate the effort, that's been put to animate it all, excluding face animations which compared to the rest are lacking.To sum it up, Feng Wei Ying Xiong is nothing special, it's interesting to see how other cultures see Blizzard's games but that's about it?Would I watch it again? Probably not.Would I recommend watching it? Well, not really.

The game has simple mechanics, a good atmosphere, and provides just enough tension for kids to enjoy the scares. The jumpscares are definitely not fit for younger audiences, but then again, even if younger kids were to play the game, so long as they are not easily frightened, it can still be enjoyable to play. I believe the main issues parents are having pertaining to this game are the facts that their younger kids are incapable of distinguishing fact from fiction, and often suffer more as a result of the scares than an older kid would. That aside, parents are horrified at the backstory of the game. Something worth noting is that there are no clear in-game hints pertaining to the actual backstory of the game aside from a single poster that can easily be overlooked due to how rarely it ever pops up- and it will be overlooked by younger audiences because kids just don’t pick up on those sorts of things. The only way for younger kids to know about the plot is if they’re watching videos of others describing it, in which case, the game has nothing to do with that. That’s completely on the kids for doing their own research. All that aside, the game is gore-free and easily palatable for audiences of all ages, but like so many things, lies up to the individuals and the threshold of their own personal comfort and fears.This really explemfies the rape culture in ASIA and I LOVE IT>>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3;Not Recommended

If someone came to me and said they enjoyed this, enough to give it a positive score, I would immediately think they were being dishonest with me AND themselves.There's an article titled, Poetics of an Urban Darkness: Takashi Ito's Spectral Cinema, and 90% of it is just ramblings about creative techniques and his ""artistic expression"", which seems to be the driving force behind his fans interest. While that aspect may be impressive, especially for it's time, the actual ""anime"" itself is devoid of substance, mindless and just plain boring AF.Though I'm sure I'm just missing the ""bigger picture"" here, have a read of this short paragraph from said quoted article.""The camera zooms into vast spaces only to visually smash into architecture with vehemence, like a battering ram, crashing into corners, pillars, walls, and rocks. As if it was trying to open a hole into the surface, as if to dig beyond, as if to awaken some other spirit, dormant and lurking beneath layers of reality. Perhaps this subdued allegory is about some being from the past, a mummy.

0;Kentoushi;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;7;I went into “Kentoushi” expecting a mediocre to dull boxing anime, but came out having found an OVA of such hilariously poor quality that it rivals “Twinkle Nora Rock Me.” About half (not an exaggeration) of the choppy animation is recycled, there are long shots of actual pictures of cityscapes used as scene transitions, the “Rocky”-esque plot and characters are cheesy as all get-out, and the fight scenes will have you rolling over with laughter. The theme song, which is in English and featured prominently throughout all three episodes, is a sentimental ballad about a reluctant hero who is training to take down a murderer — which is not even what the plot is about!“Kentoushi” (literally meaning “The Boxer”) is about a Japanese guy named Kenji Ryu, who dreams of someday becoming the world heavyweight boxing champion. The problem, though, is that he can’t find any gym in Japan willing to train someone in the heavyweight class, so through a series of convoluted events, he gets on a boat to America with a man named Eddie, a boxing coach who has mentored other Japanese champions in the past, and has agreed to be his coach. They arrive in New York City and face a lot of hardships at first, and Kenji struggles to be accepted by the American boxers. He meets a girl named Megumi (Meg), also from Japan, whose dream is to be a Broadway star, and they quickly form a relationship. He also meets Sam, another Japanese guy who has been struggling to make it in the US, who becomes Kenji’s manager. Kenji faces rivals both in and out of the ring, and when Eddie suddenly falls ill, Kenji even goes into “underground boxing” to earn money for Eddie’s operation. Will Eddie survive, and will Kenji get back into regular boxing and become the first Japanese heavyweight boxing champion?This OVA could be considered a 3-part movie, as it tells one story. The story is easy to understand, and has a clear beginning, middle and end, even with epilogue scenes (one of the corniest epilogues you’ll ever see). As for the quality of the story? Well, let’s just say it’s entertaining. The dialogue is hilariously cliched, especially in the parts that are supposed to be romantic. The second episode even ends with text on the screen that says something like “Cheer Kenji on in the boxing ring of life,” referring to his relationship with Meg. Kenji’s rivals often hurl anti-Asian and anti-Japanese slurs at him, and say stuff like “I’m going to kill you” even though they’re just supposed to be boxing, and not in a deathmatch or anything. There are copious references to the “American Dream” as well.The characters are all basically archetypes who are playing out their roles. The way Meg’s character is written, in particular, is disappointing. They make a big deal about her having a similar dream to Kenji’s about making it big in the US, but her dream only gets lip service here and there, and then eventually falls to the wayside. Not only do we never see her working towards her dream, we don’t even know if she actually achieved her dream by the end of the story. She also has “friends” who show up briefly, but only one has any lines, and he disappears from the story almost as soon as he appears. The people that helped Kenji out in Japan are barely even referred to after the events in the first episode. Most of the antagonists seem really angry at Kenji for no reason, and the ones he meets outside of the ring are dressed almost like characters out of “Mad Max” or “Escape from New York.” Sam is okay, I guess, although underdeveloped, and Eddie is your typical old, hard-boiled and strict coach. Kenji himself seems pretty flat in the first episode, but he develops a slight personality and emotions later on.One of the first things you’ll notice about “Kentoushi” is the animation — or lack thereof, I should say. As mentioned earlier, it would not be an exaggeration to say that half of the scenes shown in this OVA are recycled. There are also lots of still shots (like slideshows during fights), and looped animations (like during the disco scene). And there are actual aerial pictures of cities used frequently throughout the show as scene transitions. Text gets shown on screen quite a bit as well, with computer graphic animation effects such as revolving text that were probably state of the art when this came out in 1990.The art isn’t that great, either. The characters look kind of ugly, and Kenji in particular looks like he has a rectangular face. The African-American characters all look so similar to each other that it’s hard to tell them apart. Meg’s friend, who came to the US to be a “hair designer,” has the worst hairstyle in the show (and that’s saying a lot).The music is one of the highlights of this anime. The theme song, “He’ The Fighter” (not a typo), is incredibly memorable, and it’s bizarre. The song is first introduced with text on the screen in each episode showing its title, composer and lyricist (but not the singer), almost like the beginning of a music video. This is then followed by text saying that “the song used was provided by the Asahi Film Office.” I couldn’t find any “Asahi Film Office” online, so it may not exist anymore. Also, the way this is written makes it sound like they just used an already existing song for this anime, which makes sense, considering the lyrics don’t match the plot at all. The lyrics themselves are okay, but there’s something strangely off about them. The lyricist is currently the honorary president of an English conversation school, by the way. The melody was composed by someone who’s done other anime songs in the past, and it’s quite catchy. The singer remains a mystery. As far as I can tell, no soundtrack was released for this anime, and this song itself was never released, either, which is a shame. As for the background music, it’s generic (also probably picked up from an existing music library), but it fits the scenes that it’s used in well.The voice acting is not that great, but it does succeed in being funny. Kikuko Inoue gives a good performance as Meg, but she seems miscast. Most of the other characters are voiced by other professional voice actors, but they sound like they’re phoning it in at some points (probably due to the silly dialogue). There are a few minor characters who don’t sound like they’re voiced by professionals.Regarding objectionable content, there isn’t much, certainly not enough to get it the R-17+ rating it currently has here. There’s some blood (mostly in still shots, and very exaggerated), and some racial slurs. And most of the fighting is just boxing, so it’s not particularly violent (and certainly not graphic, due to the lack of animation). Also, it’s important to note that there’s a scene at a disco in the second episode that uses strobe effects, so if you’re photosensitive it’s a good idea to skip that scene.This is one of those shows that will leave people divided with regard to its rating. If you like “so-bad-it’s-good”-type shows, you’ll find this highly entertaining and a must-see. If you don’t, then you won’t enjoy this anime. I recommend watching the first five minutes of the first episode — if you like what you see, then this anime is for you. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the whole thing is subbed as of this writing, so if you don’t understand Japanese you may miss out on some of the more hilarious parts, but it’s still worth watching.;Recommended
0;Hare Tokidoki Buta;BlaizeV;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BlaizeV;6;Hadn't ever heard of this film before Discotek Media licensed it and put it out on Blu Ray. It was such an obscure thing for them to license I just had to see it as soon as I could. Having done so I thought this movie was okay. Nothing overly special but fine in the end, so lets get into why...The Story is fairly basic (and piggy), split into two distinct halves there isn't anything overly amazing about it. The story revolves around Noriyasu, his journal, his pen, his imagination and the fantastical and somewhat bizarre consequences of this combination. I mean just because Noriyasu writes that it rained pigs doesn't mean that it will really happen right?It's got a great innocence and imagination to it for sure but there are few consequences and as such no real depth. This is fine, I mean it's just meant to be a young kids film mainly and for that it serves up some very creative scenarios and a few lessons are learnt along the way too. But yeah while very imaginative on the surface I didn't really get anything beyond that. I'm okay with this others might not be. I mean at just 72 minutes it certainly doesn't outstay it's welcome but some viewers may not find the time spent overly fulfilling in regards to the story, despite it's innocent charm.The animation is really amazing, very colorful and fun and while true to the images in the original books it seems they took the animation and detail way further which really brought the whole thing to life while still staying true to the source material. Yes it's a sketchy style but it's very well done, I like the shots of the cities in particular. Also when it's Pig Time there is some really enjoyable sequences. This is definitely the stand out area of this film and I would guesstimate the part that any Anime fan older than 10 is likely going to derive the most pleasure from.Definitely also worth mentioning the performance of the main VA as Noriyasu as it's very impressive. Voiced by an 11-12 year old Daisuke Namikawa (a prolific VA nowadays) I presume this was one of his earliest roles, if not his first? But yeah what a wonderful performance, he really is fantastic and the fact we get to hear this role not from an adult woman but from an actual young male child makes it all the more interesting and believable. Daisuke even as a child himself was clearly a great actor as he really conveys that child persona in this film. Full of life, creativity and imagination as each newfangled idea unwillingly sets him down another fantastically strange venture. The chuckle we hear everytime Noriyasu thinks he has finally nailed down what to do next or just the sheer enjoyment he finds in his imagination is just glorious and so endearing.So yeah the film is colorful, imaginative and has a very endearing main character. But overall it's lacking any real substance and depth (at least to anyone old enough to already know the few lessons on offer). If you should watch it is based soley on how much you value 72 minutes of your life and also how far down the Anime Rabbit-hole you like to travel. I thought it was worth it but I'll leave you to decide whether you feel the same.;Mixed Feelings
1;Hare Tokidoki Buta;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;5;"Hey kids! Remember an old anime called Tokyo Pig? I remember seeing a few episodes of it here and there on TV when I was a kid, but I'm pretty sure I only remember it because the character designs were permanently chibi. The thing is, Tokyo Pig, or its original title, Hare Tokidoki Buta, translated as Fair Then Partly Piggy, actually started off as a series of children's picture books. The 90s TV series is a little more well known, but the series actually had a feature-length movie produced in 1988 with a premise that was very different from how the series turned out. Discotek even put it out on DVD and blu-ray a number of years ago, though that release is now out of print. It's streaming on Crunchyroll, for those who want to watch it. I saw it recently myself and...not gonna lie, this movie is pretty juvenile.Third grader Noriyasu Hatakeyama is your average kid who unfortunately isn't very good at anything. He doesn't pay attention in class, he messes up the most basic tasks, and he's gotten the nickname Two-Bit because of his screw-ups. But one thing he does take pride in is that he writes in his journal every day. One day, he catches his mother reading his journal and he's not too happy about it. But rather than, y'know, tell her she shouldn't invade his privacy like a normal person, he assumes she's gonna try and read it again, deciding to write about really crazy stuff that could never happen in real life, such as raining pigs and eating pencils for dinner. To his surprise though, the crazy things he writes in his journal magically come to life, and weirder than that, everybody treats it all as normal! Things get even crazier when he tries to take a crack at making his own newspaper and writing fake news for fun, resulting in an apocalyptic pig holiday!Yeah, that premise is as stupid and childish as it sounds, and no, the movie never explains how or why Noriyasu's writings come to life. I didn't really jive with this, as the whole movie very much screams ""JUST for kids"" with how juvenile its premise and its take on it is. It just expects you to believe that everything Noriyasu writes just magically comes to life. This isn't necessarily a bad thing by itself, but the movie seemed content to just abuse it for the sake of dragging the movie out, and honestly, the movie is pretty slow paced. A lot of it just consists of stuff happening and Noriyasu reacting to it while everybody else treats it as another day. The characters are pretty bland and one-note, too, both the main and side-cast. The soundtrack isn't much to write home about either, other than the fact that the kids singing the opening theme just can't sing for the life of them. The ending song is much nicer and easier on the ears, though.That being said, the animation, for its time, is pretty good. The backgrounds have a lot of creativity put into them, a fun mix of both children's crayon drawings and watercolor, and the actual motion for the characters is pretty smooth. Since the characters are all deliberately drawn in the chibi style, this makes them easier to animate, and the creators really go buck wild here. But that's honestly about all that Fair Then Partly Piggy can offer in terms of positives. I wouldn't call Fair Then Partly Piggy a bad movie, but it was clearly made for the sole purpose of keeping kids eyes glued to the TV for a little over an hour and not much else. But if you want to put this on for your kids or for yourself, feel free! It's just not for me personally.";Mixed Feelings

0;Jiu Ye Shen Chuan;katsucats;https://myanimelist.net/profile/katsucats;6;"As far as I can tell, the ninth night refers to the first quarter half moon, an astrology of sorts in the story. It's a day of important events surrounding the main characters. 12 years ago, a war that is not fully explained in the first season happens between the Moon Tribes and another people. The Moon Tribes disparagingly call them nomads, and accuse them of hiding in the mist, assassinating ordinary citizens. The nomads, on the other hand, accuse the Moon Tribes of a conspiracy to confine them in a misty forest, where they are often subject to a shadowy black miasma, called ""the natural disaster"", a plague that swallows the spiritual energy of anyone it touches and kills them.The main protagonist is Liu Li, a prodigy of one of the Moon Tribe branch families that want nothing to do with the past. She just wants to live out her days in comfort; yet, recognizing her talent, the tribe regularly sends her out on errands. Despite her attempts to complete them with bare minimum effort, she always seems to be pulled into more than she wants.While Liu Li's antics were amusing to begin with, they start to wear thin later on in the show, especially as she seemed to lack authenticity. Her attempts at dodging conversations become halfhearted, as she straddles between wanting to go home, yet still acceding to the prince's demands. She acts disgusted, yet she ends up sticking around. It's almost as if she's just being a tsundere.That aside, the character cast is decent on the protagonist side. Each character have distinct personality without relying on exaggerated quirks. For example, one of the tribe leaders is a formations nerd and she's a space head, but that isn't overdone like an anime trope. And while the antagonists seem to have a raison d'etre, they all act like petty thugs, the stereotypical villains that seem to be only interested in rape and murder for no reason besides they want to. They try to justify that killing Moon Tribesman individuals are nothing compared to what the tribe has done to them, much later on in the show, but that doesn't quite erase their earlier act.The standout has to be the plot. Not much happens, but the atmosphere is well done, and the characters are all established and well motivated in the first season. All the pieces are placed, and it feels like something big is about to happen. But be warned: I don't know when season 2 is coming out, but the end of the first season leaves off on a huge cliffhanger.I really only recommend shows with some semblance of an ending, so for now this is one with potential, but we won't know how it would pan out.For those that care, the 3D animation is decent. The character motions are fluid, except in combat. The fights are decently choreographed but the animation itself is not the best. Not bad enough to distract though.";Mixed Feelings

0;Shippuu! Iron Leaguer: Silver no Hata no Moto ni;GodSoupLoren;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GodSoupLoren;6;"If you're here right now chances are you just finished the TV anime Shippu! Iron Leaguer and you're wondering if these OVAs are worth a watch (and if you haven't finished the anime already, what are you doing here? Go finish it already! I'll still be around when you come back, don't worry). And the answer to that question? Are these OVAs worth checking out? Well, let's give it a look and see.The Shippu! Iron Leaguer ""Under the Banner of Silver"" OVAs serve as an epilogue or further end piece for its preceding anime, exploring new topics, adding new characters, putting existing characters in unique situations, and attempting to tie up some of the loose ends the anime may have left hanging.While the anime leaned heavily into the themes of teamwork, kindness, and fair play, these OVAs see us swinging more in the opposite direction to the darker, grim, and bleaker side of this series’ story. Friendship is, of course, still present, but the more dour style of this narrative may put some people off of it.This manifests most in how Silver Castle are treated and dealt with. We find our characters struggling and being challenged here in ways we’ve never quite seen before (including but not limited to internal drama and strife). Some of it senseless, some of it with purpose, and each way can make for some interesting content sure but it might not be for everyone, especially if you hold these characters very dearly and felt satisfied by the happy and uplifting Friendship Ending the TV series gave us (which the OVA begins by turning on its head).But leaning into a sadder narrative isn't all bad, especially if it’s done well. Right? Well, about that...There is a strong story and strong narrative behind these OVAs but not nearly enough time to give it the room it needs to breathe or reach its full potential, and it shows. The first three episodes are fine enough with most of its problems being bumps in the road or things that you can overlook if you want to, but by the last two episodes it all catches up with them with piles of ideas and concepts crammed into the endgame. Which means most of them aren’t explored or elaborated on nearly as much as they need to be to be effective.All five episodes have problems such as scenes that are set up and developed only to then be suddenly cut short and never expanded upon or properly concluded. Characters that seem to jump all over the map, appearing out of nowhere to where they are most conveniently needed at the time. Important plot points that are rushed through and barely touched on. And when our favorite characters are put through the wringer on top of all that, it leaves a bad taste in the viewer’s mouth if the story isn’t concluded in a satisfying enough way to justify all that hardship.In a word it is messy, and what would otherwise be a strong and compelling narrative becomes flimsy and weak. Not every moment is a flop and they are able to do some things decently despite how much they are juggling. But most of what is here are cool concepts and ideas that you can only really get a good grasp on by reading between the lines. I don’t blame this on any incompetence of the show runners but five episodes weren’t enough for all they were trying to tell us. Whether they wanted more episodes and five were all they could get, or they really did over-estimate themselves and think five was enough, we may never know. But what we do know is that this doesn’t work. Mostly...Normally this would mean we've got a bad set of OVAs on our hands that we’re better off ignoring. But... that's not quite true.As with the TV anime, it is the characters of Shippu! Iron Leaguer that are the shining stars of its story, and if nothing else can deliver, they sure can. And they do.This OVA series brings more focus to some characters who might not have got it before. Mach Windy is cool as always and he takes on more of a protagonist role in this story, and Ryuuken, Bull Armor, Juurota, and GZ especially get some of their best moments in the entire series right here in these OVAs, hands down. Some may be one-and-done in a single episode (or even a single scene. But it was a cool scene, Juurota) but their impact is felt, and left me with a big, dumb, happy smile on my face just as much as the anime did at its best.And the main members of Silver Castle aren't the only ones who get the love. The Gold Brothers (well, they're always awesome), Silky and company, and some of the Stray Leaguers such as Watt, Amp, and Thirteen get a little time to shine here too.Most of the new robot characters however simply serve their purpose in the narrative and don’t do much else. Aside from Garret who I've got to give these OVAs honest credit for getting me emotionally invested in the guy and actually pretty decently executing character development with him all in the span of a single episode. (But while his arc surprisingly works, it also leaves you wanting more of him.)You may notice I failed to mention our friends Topjoy and Magnum Ace up there. Unfortunately Topjoy doesn't really do much of note here and Magnum... well, his character arc is about as messy and unfocused as the narrative is, with a lot of interesting ideas and potential communicated poorly, frustratingly, and not quite brought together in a satisfying way. It doesn’t ruin the character by any means but he’s certainly not at his best.The human characters end up taking a major back seat to the robots, which in retrospect was probably for the best, but they only really exist to pop in from time to time to show us they’re there, nudge the plot forward artificially, or drop lore/exposition unceremoniously. Character development is attempted with the new human character Sheena but, sing it with me now, it’s rushed.All this said, the best way I can find to describe these OVAs are a series of strong character moments strung together by a far too busy and under-explored narrative. Not everything fails, but not enough succeeds either.So, back to the real question here. Are these OVAs worth a watch? If you're a big fan of some of the characters I mentioned above, I'd say sure! Give it a shot! If you felt completely content and satisfied with the TV anime's ending and don't want that to be ruined for you even a little, it might be better to give this one a pass. In general though I would recommend fans of the series watch these OVAs at least once, but go in fully aware that they are heavily flawed pieces of media and shouldn’t to be taken too seriously. If you can shut your brain off and enjoy the drama and action, you might catch yourself having a good time. Personally I can’t be mad with how they turned out, just disappointed that they didn’t quite come together and shine as brightly as they could have.Iron Leaguer came out a long time ago and its not likely to get a reboot or revival series any time soon—or ever for that matter—which leaves these OVAs as the last send off for this series that we’ll ever have. And if nothing else, they do bring a sense of finality that ends our game fair and square.";Mixed Feelings
0;Atomic World;Akira63;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Akira63;9;Art was fantastic and the central themes of the animation were gripping yet easy to understand all while allowing oneself to come to thy own conclusion.The ideas of growth and expansion were compelling and showed just how small we really are. This is shown throughout the animation where the characters walking across the street are compared to the tall skyscrapers and at the end when the camera pans out to show that everything that just occurred all happened in this one small portion of the world.The story was relatively short at only two minutes and fifty seconds but it told a lot in this time frame. The music choice was rather wonderful and showed the fast pace action in the animation.Overall this anime was really enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for indie shorts.;Recommended

Then it zooms out to see the world, if this happened in one small area, it must have happened multiple times in different places. Good job, music is bad though.

0;Head Spoon;lunalu77;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lunalu77;6;"I haven't written a review before, but this work seems so under discussed and misunderstood that I felt I had to. While Head Spoon, like many other metaphorical, minimalistically animated, three to six minute shows under this category, is abstract, it is also one of the most accessible entries in the genre. And no, this is not animation just for the sake of how the drawings look, and does not intentionally not make sense for the sake of depicting ""head trauma.""There will be spoilers and points of interpretation in this review, so if you are the type of person (like me) for whom a lot of the fun is thinking through the work yourself, don't read this. I'm not going to try to give an exhaustive analysis (in part because I think the power of these films is that they communicate things that can't be put easily into words), instead I'm just going to note a few aspects of an interpretation to give you a sense into what this show is about for a person who really enjoys these types of films.In terms of format, this movie is a series of short 10-20 second segments tied together by a recurring image of an egg shaped head being hit by a spoon, causing a crack in the egg. The standard theme of the segments is to begin show a somewhat ordinary occurrence with unexpected results, which go on to illustrate a metaphorical truth. The opening of the movie expands the most on what the visual of the egg and spoon means. In the opening, a mostly colorless human in a mostly colorless world has their head hit by a spoon, and immediately the world erupts in an explosion of color. A very natural way of understanding this is to say that the spoon is in some way expanding our perspective by cracking open a shell that represents our mental space. The image of our heads as eggs is evocative in part because like eggs, our heads contain potential for growth. When the image recurs in other parts of the movie, what we see coming back is the world that is full of color and not the colorless world.Given that the image of the egg being cracked keeps reoccurring it is natural to understand the image as a metaphor for the author's project in the movie and in each individual segment. In each segment, something ordinary (or colorless) is being given color (metaphorical meaning.) The moment when the unexpected result in each segment occurs is the spoon cracking our egg and bringing us into a new perspective.To give a better idea of what I mean, I'll briefly describe two of my favorite segments and how I interpret them.1) A nude man is gardening and watering a plant. Rather than plants emerging from the ground is response to his care, they emerge on his body as facial, chest, and pubic hair and nothing emerges from the ground. Interpretation: Pubic and facial hair are ways of referring to maturity. Efforts to care for the world and for others (like gardening) may not always lead to objective results in the world, however over time that work will bring you true adulthood and maturity.2) A line of well dressed men are knocking on doors into a building. Rather than the doors being opened for the men to walk through, they finally squeeze themselves in through the keyhole and the doors remain closed. Interpretation: We expect many institutions and communities to open their doors for us based on our interest in them and persistence, but some will never open the doors for our requests. However if we mold ourselves into what the institutions want, then we can enter as easily as if there were no doors at all.Overall I didn't give this a higher score because to me compared to other projects in this genre the main concept is a bit on the nose and some of the metaphors were simplistic. For someone who is just getting started with the genre though, these features just improve the accessibility of the work.(Last note: Its not necessary for getting a lot out of the movie, but if you want to engage with it even more deeply after watching it once, ask yourself what the significance of colors were within the otherwise colorless main segments and what it meant that the egg person's clothing was colored even before being hit by the spoon.)";Mixed Feelings

I felt obligated to contribute to the reconciliation of both of these debacles.Art: Some characters look a little odd and the animation is pretty barebones besides the H scenes. GHSP's vagina looked weird in one of the scenes. Its also uncensored. So at least the H scenes are pretty well animated. Also, in terms of oddness, an example is that one of the guys looks like he has a missing chromosome.Sound: The voice acting is good, with yummy moans. GHSP has a nice voice. The music has a futuristic tone to it but it doesn't sound bad. One of the tracks sounds like it'd be in a .hack dungeon.Characters/Story:The two main characters are Sensei Baby Momma and Green Haired Student Pornstar. The episode starts off oddly as Sensei is browsing applications for bondage porn in the school library and just so happens to see her student in promotional material. NSFW doesn't exist in Sensei's vocabulary. The plot is essentially GHSP has to do porn to pay for her parent's debt. Sensei gets pulled into the fray on the porn train, then Ane-san snaps a pic of Sensei reaching Choo Choo to post on tick tock if Sensei wants to be a mo-fuckin RAT. Originally the episode gave me a very ""this is going to be disturbing"" vibe but it turned out it wasn't that bad. Remember kids, as long as the rapee vocalizes enjoyment, it's okay and you needn't feel remorse or compassion.

0;Toki no Daichi: Hana no Oukoku no Majo;lkevsan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/lkevsan;6;"Seeing that not many people cares about old OVAs has made me curious about these shows that are so low ranked in MAL that they don't even appear in the ranked list properly. So here we go, one more time for a show without a review and that the only way I could find it, it's in a raw state but it is really straight forward so let's go.Since the only synopsis MAL has is ""Based on the manga by Yama Miyuki."" Here I will tell you what it is about. This show is about a group of 3 guys in which 2 are warriors/knights and the other is a kid that loves flowers and monsters that live in that world. So they travel through different towns and explore the world they live but one day they find this magician girl that escapes his home because some of his family members (I believe) want to revive an evil witch so they can control the world with the power of a mythical Dragon and all the other monsters around the area. Also there is a side story about a comic relief character that calls herself the ""Queen of Darkness"" but when she tries to be evil, she makes more good deeds than ""evil"" things, she supposes she is making.The story is not that amazing to say but it is watchable, the focus on this group that wants to find a way to stop the evil guys is interesting and has that feel of 90s RPGs. The adventures they face are enjoyable but the action scenes are too bland. They always end quick and seemed very rushed. Only when there is focus on the powers of the magician girl it is quite good with what spell they could help the guys.The characters are ok, but anyone could argue that the little kid can be annoying. Because he is always under the clumsiness and innocence of what is going on around him. He always tends to hug the monsters when clearly the monsters want to kill the people that go around them.The 2 knights/warriors are ying and yang. One is this cool outgoing guy that loves the adventure but always is clear that the risks are there for them and the other is like Raphael from the Ninja Turtles always serious and having no time to joke around and always angry if something fails. They are not bad, but do the job.The Magician girl is the character that enjoyed the most out of the group. She is very calmed and cares for the others around. Too bad that her personality is nothing more than that because they could have given her a bigger role on the show with the battles instead of just this protection amulet she has and spells. It could have made it a little better.With the animation, for some reason that I can't explain and pardon my bias here the 90s animation no matter if a show is bad, it always gets me hypnotized, for me the animation and artsyle is really great and the best that Anime has. This was done by Magic Bus, the same producers that did my favorite anime of all time, Cipher The Video, The dark palettes that they use are great and make a good the presentation look very adequate. Although the first OVA suffers some issues with the 3D Backgrounds they try to implement. They look like those demo techs from the 80s about the 3D images in computers and really outdated even for the late 90s but the other 2 they use a more traditional 2D background. Also as I said the action animation is bad. They just use the technique where they make a portrait after an attack or simply a slash sometimes and that's it. They were really lazy for action scenes.The music is enjoyable if you are into RPGs and medieval music. The opening is hit or miss, it is ok but nothing extraordinary. The voice acting is good but again with the little kid it could be annoying, because he has this cute high pitch voice that sometimes got me to a point of desperation.OverallIf you are into medieval stuff and you like to weird stuff that you have never heard of from the 90s this could be for you. But again with many OVAs from the 20th century are hit or miss for some and the story is very straight forward don't expect big twists or shocking settings but if you have 1 hour and more minutes it could be watchable for you.Thanks for taking the time for reading this review. English is not my first language so sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes. Take care in whatever you do and see you around.";Mixed Feelings
1;Toki no Daichi: Hana no Oukoku no Majo;ktulu007;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ktulu007;6;Toki no Daichi: Hana no Oukoku no Majo is an OVA from the late 90s based off of a manga. It's from Magic Bus. That's right. The studio that gave us Mad Bull 34, Dragoon & Phantom Yuusha Densetsu. That's not a good sign. But let's give it a try.Story:The tale takes place in a fantasy world where a trio of adventurers is searching for information about the deadly dragon, Diablos. Only to find themselves embroiled in a country's conflict involving an attempted coup.The biggest problem with the narrative is just that it's kind of standard. The whole plot to usurp the throne, the sealed evil. All of it has been done before, done since and done better. And this series brings nothing new to it.I can give it some credit with handling all its standard content competently enough. And for having some decent foreshadowing.Characters:There are four major characters in this. Jendo, Kai, Izayoi and Princess Freya. The problem is with Izayoi. He's basically everything that's wrong with child characters. He contributes nothing of real value to the party or to the narrative. He makes stupid decisions that cause problems for everyone and then the writing tries to vindicate him for everything and act like he's being treated too harshly whenever someone brings up the fact that his poor decisions are causing problems. You also have to wonder why he's even travelling with the others. He's blatantly too young for the situation and he's clearly not actually doing anything to help when trouble hits. If anything, he's a detriment.Most of the characters are just kind of dull. Jendo is the only one I really see any potential in from this little story arc. She has some complexity and a back story that has some compelling ideas to it. She even does the most in battle with Izayoi contributing nothing and Kai & Freya doing very little.Art:The artwork and animation aren't particularly good but they aren't bad either. It kind of looks like they were trying to go with a Fantasy RPG look but they didn't have any strong original ideas for it so they went the safe route.Sound:The acting is pretty good, actually. Ogata Megumi, Seki Tomokazu, Kurata Masayo and the others all deliver pretty strong performances. I also do quite like the music. It's pretty effective and just sounds nice.Ho-yay:There isn't any.Areas of Improvement:1. Have a point for your characters. First off, let's assume Izayoi has some reason to exist in the manga and it just isn't a part of this little story arc. Let's give this that much credit solely for the sake of argument. It's still a pretty serious problem that he seemingly has no purpose here. You can't assume every single viewer has read the manga. It's especially important in a situation like this where you have a child character tagging along on a dangerous journey for no apparent reason.2. Let's talk about consequences. Part of the reason child characters like Izayoi are so grating and obnoxious is due to the lack of consequences they experience. This kid literally almost gets one of his companions killed because he's stupid and the only character who doesn't immediately make excuses for him and act like he did nothing wrong is Jendo. Which is another reason she's the best character. He doesn't even get scolded for his carelessness or have any kind of introspective moment where he has to face the reality that he almost got his companion killed.3. Moving beyond clichés. The problem with a work like this that just plays every trope straight is that those tropes are going to be familiar to anyone who knows the genre. Which makes you lose a lot of intrigue and makes the work overly predictable. Some subversion or original twists would have been welcome.Final Thoughts:This anime isn't particularly good. It relies too much on clichés and features a really annoying child character. That being said, it is the most competent anime I've seen Magic Bus produce. It's got some strong elements and there's actual potential here. Overall, it was actually okay. I'm giving it a 6/10.;Mixed Feelings
0;Ookami wa Ookami da;LightWorker;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LightWorker;5;"Well this was pretty interesting, the hook for me was that from the synopsis this sounded a little like an animated version of ""The Beast of Gevaudan"" (Google that if your unfamiliar, or better yet, search for Beth from Jashin-chan Dropkick, because she is one of those) although not as gory, although to be honest I wasn't really expecting it to be. Anyway I'm sidetracking somewhat aren't I?, let's get on with the review itself, although there isn't a whole lot to say about it, but it's somewhat more advanced from other works from around this time.Story: The peace and tranquility of the village is interrupted by the presence of a Wolf, who terrorises the populace and makes off with 1 of them. The villagers are suitably unhappy with this nuisance, and gang together to come up with a way to rid themselves of the Wolf and restore peace once more. There's probably a moral to this story, and it's probably - working together gets results. 5Art: It's always somewhat difficult to rate this, as the copy (or copies) could likely have suffered from wear and tear and poor storage, and I'm not exactly sure what version I saw was... From what I saw the visuals seem decent and clear, with some depth to the background. However the Wolf being all Black seemed to mess something up, it almost seemed like it was shimmering at times. The rest of the anthropomorphic animals seem well drawn for the time. Walking animation is bad though - too stiff, looks like their walking slowly on a treadmill or something (not trying to sound like a Critic, but I just didn't like it, and have seen better from other works of same age or older even) another big issue was the dialogue cards - yes they were there, but placed quite far apart, but they do at least explain what's happening. 5Sound: N/A - Literally no sound (at least from the version I saw there wasn't) maybe the original had something? usually it's Piano music but I'm not certain, but I can't score what isn't there.Characters: The Wolf is suitably scary and plays the part of the antagonist well. It was somewhat difficult to work out who the main protagonist was, as there were many characters and all were given short screen time. 3Enjoyment & Overall: I quite enjoy very old works, it's nice to look back on the history of animation and movies and see the innovatives and breakthroughs. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, it's only 11mins long and (mostly) straight forward to watch, however I think those who especially enjoy rare/old anime will like this greatly. 5 & 5";Mixed Feelings

The 1980s Old Master Q movie series are amazing, each SO FUNNY with Cantonese jokes and profanity, but the FIRST ONE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST !!! Full of Hong Kong culture and comically showcases THE FAST LIFE IN HONG KONG XD !!!!! The voice acting in the 1980s Old Master Q movie is PHENOMENAL!You really need to understand Cantonese, jokes and insults to get this movie. The movie English subs only very roughly translates, a lot is omitted or simplified. English sub readers are not gonna catch some of the jokes.Like the gag joke scene of the Old Master Q comic at the start of the movie where it says, I won't kill myself, that part is correct, but the next part 係咯! 諗過條橋. 包你唔會仆街 which itself is EXTREMELY FUNNY, but it translated as That's right, start all over again tomorrow [and then they fall off the bridge], that kinda misses the joke to a Cantonese speaker.Because 仆街 is a FAVORITE Cantonese insult/slang, literally meaning to fall on the street, Better translation would be That's right, think of another plan, guarantee you won't fall and fuck yourself [and then they fall off the bridge]The humor is a MASTERPIECE. I have watched this movie so many times over the years, don't know why I haven't reviewed until now. Like how Mr. Chiu would unfairly treat Old Master Q who work at his restaurant (this hate/rivalry relationship dates back to the Old Master Q comics) only for his mean character to end up coming back to get him like karma loooooooooool Like this funny sceneMr. Chiu : Go wax the floorOld Master Q : I waxed it last nightMr. Chiu : I scratched it, Go wax it again (Mr. Chiu intentionally giving hard time to Old Master Q)Old Master Q : [waxes and slips from a slippery wax job] Boss it's done, please inspect.Mr. Chiu : So fast? I don't think so. [proceeds to slip SO HARD from the wax job, the whole restaurant shakes, slips on the ground, and the table flips and falls on him like a STRIKE from bowling] AHHHHHH......Don't start thinking Old Master Q is the Mr. Nice guy though. He SCREWS HIMSELF A LOT TOO LMFAO and there are so many GOOD LOL JOKES that are found in whacky Old Master Q. HE DOES SO MANY FUNNY AND STUPID THINGS THAT MAKE THE STORY RUN LOL.I gotto mention the yelling scene when Old Master Q trying to learn Kung Fu with the disciple.Old Master Q wasn't yelling AHHHHHHHHHH loud enough but he was like Fuck it and kicked the wooden board anyways, LOL his foot end up getting stuck inside the wooden board rather than smashing the wood XDThe movie you can watch on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4AvKW6m62sThat link is actually the VCD release. I have BOTH the VHS and VCD of the movie so I have the complete version. In the VCD release, they actually edited out 2 scenes, maybe because it was too offensive lolOne was where Big Potato and Mr. Chin caught and squashed Old Master Q from front and back after he trolled them and got them splashed with water saying Ms. Chan was his girlfriend The second scene was [immediately after the live chicken and egg scene] at the restaurant, there was this bum guy eating saying how he hadn't eaten good food in a long time, and seemed like he had no money and when he finished, he really had no money. When Mr. Chiu was about to take him to be arrested, his chauffeur showed up with briefcase of money to pay and Mr. Chiu suddenly attitude changed seeing all that money.The VCD release deleted these scenes but in return gave an extra alternate ending to the movie where it was a showdown with the thieves after the tournament crumbled which I would say was the more interesting of the ending. The original ending [taken from the VHS] was available here in Mandarin dub only sadly which was strange. The original VHS ending was in Cantonese of course with Bruce Lee kicking everyone's ass in the competition and winning the tournament [holding the trophy]Thanks for reading ~ This Old Master Q movie is a MASTERPIECE depicting Hong Kong culture and the fast life in Hong Kong !!!

As for dementia anime in general it is not always clear to what the entire picture may be. Although, now after seeing the entire show and not just the trailer for it my feeling haven't changed much.I still do dislike this anime GREATLY.the art- This was like a dream normally that is an okay perspective to take but it was the wrong one at least at first. What i mean is this movie has two timelines one that is actual and one that is fictitious. Both of which are drawn in a dream like fashion. Even though the fictitious timeline was more dream like in nature it made the plot even more confusing. Raising such questions like was the secondary character really the victim or was it the main character (cabbage)?characters- Greatly underdeveloped. Yes, one could argue a backstory is provided for each character but like i stated in the art segment facts and fiction blend as one here. Which makes separating the truth hard.PlotIntroduction was great. I had no complaints for it came off as relaxing and childlike in appearance. Sadly, given the underlining nature of this anime that feeling was short lived. Ending unlike the introduction was not great. For it raised many questions and did not answer any. I was about to storm of in anger not only at how i was robbed from my questions but i couldn't stand the pain the story left me with. I like to see myself as one who is emotionally connected with the world and finds troubling nature to be extremely painful. Luckily at the time i realized the ending was not entirely over. There was a bonus continuance during the credits. Sadly, i realized that didn't help either but only made me feel worse. I am not sure if there was a kind moral to this story but for the sake of my sanity and love for all things i don't plan on watching this again.;Not Recommended
0;Jiaoao de Jiangjun;Assthete;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Assthete;5;Te Wei was a smart animator, and this is evident throughout his compact yet memorable filmography. Few works, but all got the length right. There is no reason to stretch a tale thin when its core message is as simple as it gets. Disney had all available, from top-notch screenwriters to producers willing to throw in some millions for a sophisticated final product. You can't replicate that, so don't try. Do what you can, which in Wei's case was to pay homage to his origins while incorporating side influences into one well done and fairly good-looking piece of animation. The Conceited General gets its point across just fine while remaining cinematic and consistently drawn. Also, points for the use of water ink painting, which he would perfect later on. It's saddening his talent got wasted on years in exile. At least his final work displays such quality control at its finest.;Mixed Feelings
0;Nice to See You;BurntFlower;https://myanimelist.net/profile/BurntFlower;1;Neo-Impressionism, commonly known as Pointillism, was a late 19th-century art movement that consisted of distilling color to its basic components with the purpose of giving a painting a more luminous quality. For example, to get a shade of blue, the Pointillist painter would put the yellow and green colors next to each other, so the viewer would see the blue as they viewed the painting from a certain distance. The eye of the viewer would then optically blend this accumulation of many tiny multi-colored dots and the bigger picture would emerge.Why the mini art history lesson? ‘Nice to See You’ applied this technique in its animation, but did it in a way that, frankly, very much annoyed me.During its 3-minute run, black and green dots flash continuously on the screen. They wiggle, jiggle, wriggle and – just to add a little spice – black and green squares join this geometry fiesta! But that’s not the fun part, oh no, the real finale is a groundbreaking camera zoom-out. These dots and squares were forming a picture! I will not ‘spoil’ the surprise and reveal what it is. I know you’re all holding your breath in anticipation.I am angry with Taku Furukawa for disrespecting the viewers’ time. Had this animation been 15 seconds long, I would have very little to complain about. ‘Ah, what a neat little experiment,’ I would think, and promptly forget a minute later. But no, it is three whole minutes of a muted circumference and quadrilateral jamboree.Imagine a friend blindfolding you, telling you that they have a surprise they can’t wait to show you. After a moment of darkness, the blindfold is off and all you see are some red, green, blue dots. You are not allowed to turn your head, look up, or move away. Three whole minutes of staring at these dots, their color burning into your retinas. After the time was up, your friend would then pull you away to reveal that you were staring at the neo-impressionist masterpiece ‘A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte’ by Georges Seurat. Except, in this case, the reveal is less of a breathtaking painting and more akin to one of my blurry, artsy photos that I took as a teen.Recommended to no one, except for the most patient art student.;Not Recommended
0;Toumei Shounen Tantei Akira;simo_omis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/simo_omis;5;Akira is an invincible detective boy that goes investigating the robbery of Mona Lisa. Quality animation from Knack Productions, released on Anime Kingdom -DVD. This is the real Akira, Katsuhiro Otomo can ski into spruces.But what is this Anime Kingdom -DVD anyway? It's a DVD made by Anime Kingdom Ltd. which consists three Chargeman Ken! -episodes and three Knack's unreleased pilot films. Ironically, Anime Kingdom Ltd. has nothing to do with the company that produces all the DVD's animations, Knack Productions. Also it's unclear why the episodes 16, 50 and 51 were taken onto the DVD from all 65 Chargeman Ken! -episodes. Anime Kingdom -DVD was published in 2008, which content got eventually into Nico Nico spawning a cult of Knack into japanese networks, Akira being the second popular anime from the DVD after Chargeman Ken.Back to Akira: Akira's production time is unclear, however Mona Lisa was displayed for a period at Tokyo National Museum from April to June in 1974, the drawing style is very similar to Chargeman Ken! and the voice actors are same as in Chargeman Ken! and Dame Oyaji. Also, prime minister Kakuei Tanaka is in the animation the Prime Minister of Japan, who was resigned from his duty in December 1974. From this point, it is inferred that Akira was made around in summer of 1974.;Mixed Feelings

Aside from some pretty cool and experimental compositions and animations, there really isn't anything of substance with this film. The only potential meaning I could get from it is that things happen and that people do things. It definitely feels like this was created to just try stuff out and see how it looked, and not really to create a meaningful storyline, which I get, but fail to understand why it had to be shared. All in all, there really isn't much reason to watch it, unless you're high or are in to cool framing/composition and bizarre animations.

0;Neko to Nezumi;juvilty;https://myanimelist.net/profile/juvilty;6;English Version: Although there are a few Japanese anime shorts dating back to 1917, animation became popular in Japan that year and three different people started making them at the same time. As we all know, animation has almost nothing to do with animation. Although the subject is martial arts, these characters are drawn as drawings of tall people, and their movement makes it clear that we are dealing with light boxes and joint animation, more like Lotte Leiniger than Raoul. Raoul Barre's work. Perhaps this is why until the 1930s, Japanese animation had a sense of partial animation, but it lacked the fluidity of the American movement. Its root is this form, instead of the artist drawing countless intermediate things.Versão em Português :Embora existam alguns curtas de anime japoneses que datam de 1917, a animação tornou-se popular no Japão naquele ano e três pessoas diferentes começaram a fazê-los ao mesmo tempo.

Embora o assunto seja artes marciais, esses personagens são desenhados como desenhos de pessoas altas, e seu movimento deixa claro que estamos lidando com caixas de luz e animação conjunta, mais como Lotte Leiniger do que Raoul.

0;Towel Story;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;Rate a 5Art Piece(no subtitles or spoken words)Anime has always been a creative outlet of expression of beauty. Makes only sense that some commercial markets would capitalize on this. A towel is the object of focus. Sure, a towel can't do much but soak up fluids but how can this product be marketed in a beneficial manner?The director had a idea to sell the towel concept with an emotional undertone. Trying to get the viewers to put themselves and the towels as more than a simple product but as a companion. Sort of like a family pet. Story starts as how most see a towel as a simple object. As each episode progress we see the value or important impact it had on crucial moments in one's lives, regardless of gender. Unfortunately, while the ending makes a complete cycle back it provides a concerning message. Sure, towels are great when you need them. Heck, for some it might be a lucky charm of sort but i couldn't help but feel disgusted at the amount of implied mileage the towel got. Sort of like seeing a person offering you their pocket hanky. While the gesture is nice and the product is probably clean, i don't feel the need to use it. For i feel it has been overused to put kindly. Had this been a short movie as apposed to being episode based i might not feel as disgusted. For i would feel i would be watching a long commercial rather than thinking of a hard working towel with no overtime per-say.Although, I must note the artwork while lacking in background did help in aiding an emotional connection. Wasn't tear jerking for me but it helped along with the background music.;Mixed Feelings

How reality sucks and a fictional reality where anything is possible is more appeasing. At one point the main character finds himself in a predicament that he can't escape in the real world from. At least not in a kind manner. The anime depicts this show in three perspectives. With the final one being the real one. Or at least perceived outcome.First perspective is the misguided one from a young kid's.Second is from the teacher. The teacher's is the more educated perspective since being a teacher requires a certain amount of experience/knowledge. Although, like super heroes it comes at a cost. A teacher like any other job is an adult business and most adults who have done their job for awhile have seen the good as well as the bad. So, it comes as no surprise her insight or view would be just as graphic.Lastly the real one, third perspective is up to the viewer. Sure the characters were all drawn and the setting was a classroom based environment but the teaching, the real teaching is how the viewer grasped the lesson. Lesson being on portrayal.Quite a nice lesson or moral in such a short manner. Although, must invoking pieces aside from being up to the viewer are intended to be perplexing. Which in turn makes me wonder if i am even on the right path of the director or have i failed the class?Overall: If you like puzzles or more so lessons without a teacher there standing next to you to explain the lesson by all means sign up to view this class(anime). But if you are more like me and would prefer some direct guidance try most any other anime.;Mixed Feelings
0;Tengai Makyou: Jiraiya Oboro-hen;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Tengai Makyou: Jiraiya Oboro-hen” is a 2-episode OVA set in the universe of the game “Tengai Makyou,” but with an anime original plot. This OVA has an action-driven, although rather predictable story, and the art and character designs make it look more like an ‘80s western cartoon than an anime. It’s easy to watch, but due to odd character interactions, questionable narrative choices and an underwhelming ending, it’s not a particularly compelling one.The gist of the story is that the thief Jiraiya has run out of treasures to plunder in his current town, and decides to travel to another area where there’s a legend of a mysterious treasure called “Hiruko.” Not much is known about Hiruko, except that it’s dangerous, and that it could even be alive. At his destination, he gets involved with a samurai named Orochimaru, who looks a lot like Goemon from “Lupin III”; the ninja girl Tsunade, who is obsessed with Orichimaru; and Yukihime, the local princess who holds the key to understanding the mystery of Hiruko. Coincidentally, at the same time, there is an evil cult targeting Yukihime for her Hiruko connection; they plan to use Hiruko’s power to awaken a giant skeleton samurai robot and have it destroy the world. (Why? Who knows.) Aided by members of Jiraiya’s thief gang, Jiraiya, Orochimaru and Tsunade become unlikely allies as they try to protect Yukihime from the bad guys and prevent the power of Hiruko from falling into the wrong hands.The plot is relatively straightforward, and does go from point A to point B, but there are a lot of liberties taken in between. For instance, the way the characters come together doesn’t feel realistic. They meet each other and almost immediately decide to become allies and share the same goal. They try to put in a subplot to give Orochimaru’s character motivations a little more depth, but it’s not executed very well. The antagonists don’t have a backstory, and their goal is that they want to “destroy everything.” And in the end, we aren’t even shown or told what happens to most of these antagonists; they’re just forgotten about.Speaking of forgotten about, there’s a scene in which the wooden tank/submarine that the protagonists are riding in starts leaking water in several places and sinks to the bottom of a lake. They’re all panicking and trying to plug up the holes, but this somehow magically resolves itself by the next scene.There are also narrative decisions that feel like wasted potential. As an example, Tsunade gets caught infiltrating the antagonists’ lair. You’d think that the antagonists, with all of their magic powers and resources, would do something with her. Maybe torture her to get her to tell them some information about the protagonists? Brainwash her and send her back to the protagonists? Or at least search her and remove her weapon. But no, they just throw her in a dungeon, from which she easily escapes with the help of her allies.The magic powers here are also ill-defined and contrived. The antagonists’ powers aside, the protagonists’ abilities mostly stem from 3 colored spheres they each have, which signify that they’re members of an ancient tribe. The powers seem elemental, but aren’t explained much at all. This could be something that players of the game would have a better understanding of, though.This OVA has only around a 1.5 hour runtime, so there is little character development or backstory, minus the bit about Orochimaru mentioned earlier. At face value, the characters seem pretty stereotypical or annoying, especially Tsunade with her obsession with Orochimaru. Orochimaru is similarly grating due to how rudely he treats Tsunade. The titular Jiraiya is your typical rogue hero, and Yukihime is your typical damsel in distress. The villains have no defining characteristics, and the rest of the characters are mostly forgettable.As far as technical aspects go, this anime is slightly above average. The animation is cheap, but fluid, and the character designs and backgrounds are interesting. They feature a distinctly 1980s cartoon feel to them, and wouldn’t look out of place if they showed up in, say, “He-Man” or “Thundercats.” While the insert song doesn’t leave much of an impression, the mid-tempo, jazzy ending theme is pleasant, although perhaps unsuitable for the tone of the series. The soundtrack has a lot of variety and is pretty good, actually — it was composed by Kouhei Tanaka, the person who does music for “One Piece” and many other iconic series.Meanwhile, the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired. There are some major voice actors in this, but their performances are forgettable here and wasted on lines like: “I’ll send you to Hell!” “No, the one who gets sent to Hell will be you!”There isn’t really any objectionable content in this, except for some apparent deaths (but nothing is shown or stated outright). There’s also a scene where the protagonist hits a bird with a rock to knock it to the ground, which might make some uncomfortable.Overall, “Tengai Makyou: Jiraiya Oboro-hen” is watchable, and a rather harmless watch at that, but many elements of the plot don’t make sense or aren’t explained well, and the character interactions, motivations and backstories are lacking in depth. It looks and sounds decent enough, though, so I’d recommend watching if you want to see something that has the look and feel of an ‘80s cartoon. As of this writing, it’s available on the studio’s official YouTube channel (TMS Entertainment), although it’s only in Japanese. The full soundtrack is available there, too, which I recommend giving a listen to.";Mixed Feelings
0;Fire Emblem Heroes: Chibi Playhouse;DoozyKiddo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/DoozyKiddo;7;The video might be somewhat hard to follow if you haven't played the Fire Emblem Heroes game and read through the original story already, so please keep that in mind.I believe that this did a great job of retelling the story of Book II, as it was able to highlight a lot of its major plot points. Although it did cut out a few characters that I enjoyed, it was still able to achieve a lot within 4 minutes. I thought the chibi artstyle was pretty cute, and I liked all of the characters' chibi forms. Throughout the video, none of the characters speak, and they use sound effects to express emotion instead. Personally, some of the sound effects felt slightly off-putting, but I understand it's for the sake of following the chibi style.Overall, it's a nice, short video that I would recommend to people who have played through Book II of Fire Emblem Heroes before.;Recommended

This is my first Dorami-chan movie so I'm not sure if there's any continuity or not, as I just decided to watch this at random.//Spoilers likely//Story: 8/10Dorami and her friends notice a bird flying and start to contemplate their origins, instead of simply reading works by Thomas Huxley, Charles Darwin or John Ostrom, they decide to do something even more fun - travel back to the past and find out for themselves!, and rather unusually, they know exactly how to make that happen.The group head off to the wastelands in their vehicle, and soon find a mysterious cloaked building, housing Dinosaur bones and rather alarmingly weapons!.The group soon encounter the warden of the establishment - which turns out to be a kind of virtual Jurassic Park (only without the enclosures) The warden listens to their story and offers them a trip back in time to the Cretaceous.The offer is taken up and they are taken back in time where they learn first hand the world of the Dinosaurs and many of the Dinosaurs themselves (and so will you!)Art: 7/10The Dinosaurs are well drawn and look amazing! with some nice colours.Their world though? for the most part is almost completely barren with oases dotted here and there.Sound: 7/10The little music there is, is very nice and soft, building to more dramatic music when danger looms.The Dinosaur sounds are very good, the voice acting work is also good, no complaints at all.Characters: 6/10As said previously, this is my first Dorami-chan movie, so I'm not so familiar with the characters for the most part.They all seem likeable, Dorami-chan uses her gadgets to outsmart the dangerous Dinosaurs and protect her friends.Enjoyment 8/10 & Overall 8/10I admittedly enjoyed this more than most probably would, because I love Dinosaurs and hopefully whoever's reading this does too! and I've always have a strange appreciation for movies that add educational elements to them (who says Anime can't teach you anything?!.)I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone but especially to fans of Dorami-chan and Dinosaurs.;Recommended

Watching this original was terrible in more ways than one. Bare in mind there is no plot and the same 'story' was used in the remix.ArtToo many things went wrong:Pointless flashes were kept,every so often a countdown was done, the video was not detailed/grainy.SoundThe sound here is completly random in some parts. Clearly noticable by the piano keys. In other parts the sound starts off strong and dies. No, the sound was not faced with a tech issue that was the design. Also, in regard to the sound for i would say at least half the film they used the same tempo. They just changed the pitch and speed. Lastly, every so often you would hear what sounded like a punch sound in those brief moments i would imagine myself punching the screen for i don't see how any sane person could sit back and smile as they watch this.Overall: Awful as it was and boy was it, i saw the point they were trying to make. I could be wrong but this video was based from the male perspective of watching first generation television sets. From my brief recall on operation of them i found this video to be somewhat of a stretch to how the operated. In other words they tweaked the bad performance a tad for what i assume to have been comedy. Sadly, while that is an original concept of sorts that was a stressful time. Especially if you had money down on a game and you were desperately trying to figure out if you were losing or winning your bet. While there might be some mild chuckles from those that grew up in that age. I am sure they will agree with the newer generation that this is not worth their time. For who wants to watch a video if it is just going to bring up bad memories? In short if you want to step in the shoes of your parents of growing up on entertainment by all means watch this animation. But the amount of frustration you might feel from watching might cost you a new television. So, watch at your risk.;Not Recommended

The animation is nothing to write home about and the commercial is far too long for something that is essentially just an advertisement.

0;Suiren no Hito;ArtyWolve;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ArtyWolve;2;"This is 16 minutes I will never get back.The plot is simple, fitting of a short a few minutes long, nothing to comment on really, I think it was aiming for touching or sweet, somehow, but even if it wasn't a little off, everything else destroyed it.The pacing was probably the worst part of the entire thing. Countless unnecessary cuts that just stretched on and on, this short was AGONIZINGLY slow, as well as jarring; the scene of the dream has about 6 5-10 second cuts of the old man just walking up some stairs. I wasn't counting, but I'm not about to go back and rewatch it. There were entire scenes that had no purpose. There were scenes that weren't even scenes. Judging by the description, this short should have had around 3 scenes. I'm quite sure it had about 10.The animation was amateur at best, which by itself it bearable, but amongst everything else, the old man's sleeping face is the stuff of nightmares. Some of the sets were decent, but the lighting was too poor to really say.The sound was unpleasant, offputting, and the entire time there is a strange scuffing clacking sound, like a poor representation of someone walking in wooden sandals, but I don't know what it was supposed to represent at all, other than to give you the feeling you're in a nightmare.There is an old man. This old man does several things in the short, non of which seem to be of any consequence, but who can be sure? The only thing I could call a characteristic would be his little finger being longer than all the rest. This old man had no character. The turtle had more character. It broke into his house and turned up in his dream, gives you a mysterious look in front of some conveniently placed photos and leaves. The old man basically just walks and sleeps, eats, goes to the toilet (apparently they had time for that in their 16 minutes) and goes to bed. Now I probably wouldn't leave the house with that face either, but shuffling and opening doors is not character building.I wouldn't wipe my butt with this if someone printed it on bog roll and left it in my bathroom.Don't watch this.

0;Heungnyong Wang gwa Bihodongja;Kirikomorisan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kirikomorisan;3;"(Interestingly enough, this is my first review of a series after all these years. I guess this movie did something to move me.)Thunder Prince is one of those movies that you end up watching on a whim. Either this amounts in a hidden gem that you try ever so hard to tell your friends about, or you end up wishing it ends back up in the obscurity it crawled out from. Unfortunately, Thunder Prince, or ""Heungnyong Wang gwa Bihodongja,"" ended up being the latter.Coming out of the gate, the story is supposed to be a tried and true story about how a boy brings justice by coming up against the man who killed his father. The premise is not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything, and that's alright. However, the pacing and delivery of this story is hilariously terrible. We end up spending more than half the movie on the main character's childhood in the forest (where each minute felt like an hour), yet when we get to the final parts, the pacing is nearly breakneck as we speed towards the end, even forgetting a plotline in favor of haphazardly crossing the finish line. The movie is only 68 minutes, but it is absolutely apparent that whoever was in charge had no idea how to pace a story.In all honesty, though, when one watches a martial arts show or movie, what the viewer is really looking for is the martial arts choreography. On this end, the martial arts is halfway decent to barely passable most of the time. The movie struggles with making fights between two people look natural. Oftentimes, characters will hit each other, but the animation never makes it feel like there was any bodily contact (despite what the generic punching sound effects try to desperately tell you). The choreography of the training montages are marginally better, though not awe-inducing or anything.In general, the aesthetic and animation in general range from barely passible to hilariously bad. Color palettes switch between shots, and characters frequently go off-model. Some animation looks recycled. The designs are nothing to write home about, opting for generic designs across the board. The fight scenes do look noticeably better (I assume whatever was left of the $20 or the peanut butter sandwich that was used to work on this went more towards those scenes as they should).Now, the only convenient legal way to watch this film in the US (as far as I understand), was by way of the English dub online. I do understand that the music was probably done by the localizers. The dub is a hilarious trainwreck and probably the best-worst thing about the movie. All the performances were phoned in, and all the voices sounded as if they were recorded in a closet or bathroom. The music was not mixed properly either, so sometimes the dubbed lines couldn't be heard over the music. While I do not have access to the original Korean audio track, I don't expect the track to turn the film from a 3 to a 10.Thunder Prince wasn't a great movie. I generally like deep-diving older movies and shows to see the aesthetics of the past, and sometimes you find films that really should have stayed there. I think there were a couple of so-bad-it's-good moments to relish in, though not quite enough for me to heartily recommend it in that capacity. This movie deserves a 3. It doesn't have anything ethically objectionable; it's just boring and forgettable. If you come upon this movie by chance, just like I did, just go skip it and watch something else.

0;Onimaru: Senjou ni Kakeru Itsutsu no Seishun;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Onimaru: Senjou ni Kakeru Itsutsu no Seishun” is a 1-episode OVA about a group of war-orphaned teens in medieval Japan acting as soldiers-for-hire, taking on jobs for large sums of money to kill people ruthlessly. During one of their routine jobs, they accidentally steal an innocent little girl who happens to be a princess, and she shakes things up by deciding to join them.This OVA has a few unique and decent technical aspects, but there’s not much else positive to say about it. The story suffers incessantly from tonal whiplash — in one second, it’s a comedy; in the next second, people are getting brutally murdered; then, one of the protagonists forces an unwilling partner to have sex with them. Rinse and repeat.The ending is anticlimactic and left me thinking, “wait, that’s it?” Sure, it’s an original one-shot, but I thought it would be a little more conclusive than it was. The characters also have a highly unrealistic reaction to the events that occur in the climax.The characters are basically stereotypes. The one that stands out the most is Kiri, the female member of the team, who is obsessed with sleeping with various men. She doesn’t really care who she does it with long as she gets what she wants, and seems to require a partner every night. This is depicted as humorous, but as she’s forcing herself on some of her partners, it can be a bit disturbing.The animation is serviceable for the most part, but there are a few instances in which scenes are recycled. The direction is passable. The character designs are unique, to say the least. With their highlighted hair and face paint and eyeliner, the protagonists look more like a punk rock band than medieval mercenaries. It’s not explained why they look like this, but my guess is that it’s supposed to signify their youth and rebelliousness. The rest of the art is just average; it’s not very detailed or memorable. The voice acting is also average.The background music is forgettable, but the ending theme, an upbeat pop-rock song which also plays briefly about halfway through, is pretty good.There is a significant amount of explicit content in this OVA, mostly revolving around the character Kiri and her exploits. She’s shown naked three times, and there are three brief implied sex scenes with her (two of which are forced). There’s also a lot of sexually explicit dialogue. This OVA has plenty of violence as well; people getting stabbed, decapitated, etc. As an aside, there’s an odd scene in which the protagonists essentially play keep away with a head they decapitated. When Kiri has the head, it’s shown looking at her breasts and smiling.Overall, although there are some unique aspects to this OVA as well as some notable characters and scenes, “Onimaru” is nothing special. The meandering plot, abrupt ending and off-putting characters make this difficult to watch — not to mention it’s currently only available in Japanese. Not recommended.";Not Recommended

It was directed in 1967 by Shin Dong-hun, considered the father of Korean animation.With little to no prior training, a home-made multiplanar camera, and perpetual resource scarcity, Shin Dong-hun managed to complete the impossible,The Story of Hong Gil-dong, follows folk hero Hong Gil-dong’s quest to right society’s wrongs. In over 125,300 cels barely spilling over one hour, Hong must endure dancing skeletons, intense training, and even a dragon to overcome the common enemy: the power-hungry civil officer who over-taxes his locale for his own gain.In retrospect, Shin’s animated film is a delight to watch. Befitting of a national first, “The Story of Hong Gil-dong” makes sure to emphasize its origins to the last degree. The hand-painted backgrounds evoke watercolor paintings of Joseon-era architecture, nostalgic of the past. The neutral color design of muted yellows – likely a side-effect of the virtually non-existent budget that Shin had to work with – especially allows the carmine reds of the rich and the magistrates to pop, as they would have with traditional costume dyes.;Recommended

This is pretty much every episode of the show.Parappa is more of a minor character in this show, not surprising when he is not even mentioned in the title. He does have two or three episodes (out of 20 episodes) dedicated entirely to him, and they are a treat to watch and usually more ""slice of Life"" based. A few of the Anime-exclusive characters, like Matt, Paula and Parappa's sister makes a few cameo appearances, but they are brief and without much (if any) dialogue. Pretty much every single character from the games can be seen in the background, especially in crowded scenes, so it becomes a game of ""Where's Waldo"" in many cases. Fun and rewarding to spot.Now, how does it hold up to the original Parappa Anime? For starters, it's aimed at an older audience, airing a hour after midnight every Friday. It is still family friendly, but does not try to teach morals and features a lot more characters from the games than the first Anime adaption. It is clearly trying to hit the die-hard fans with strong feelings of nostalgia. There is absolutely no music to be found here though, except for a few uses of ""King Kong Mushi Live Rap"" in the background, which is exactly what the original Anime did too. The animation is also a lot more limited in ""MoguMogu MunyaMunya"", as characters hardly move, except for when they absolutely have to. You will see the characters standing still most of the time, with only their mouths moving. Last and not least, the running time. Each episode is only 90 seconds long, so what you get is very limited. Whenever a customer needs help, her/his request is solved in just 30 seconds or less. It feels very rushed at times, but is still satisfying to watch. No intro or ending song either, but I doubt anyone expected that for a short Anime.All in all, I would recommend people to at least give this a try if they care for the little rapping pup at all. Watching the whole thing will only take you half an hour, and it will give at least some joy to the fans. It is more true to the tone of the games and it is fun watching PJ, Parappa and Chop Chop Master Onion interact with each others. Cameos from ""old friends"" will also add a lot to the experience if you are a fan of the franchise.";Recommended
0;Run & Roll;ejala;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ejala;7;Good lord, it's a Tanaami film that's NOT full of phallus noses and random penises!Okay, there are some pointy long noses, but it's not nearly as obvious as much of his other work. Also, no strobe effects! You can watch it without threat of seizures or eye pain.I realize this might sound like faint praise, but those were the main detractors, in my mind, to almost all of the other films by Tanaami that I've seen. The man is an amazing graphic pop artist, but it's hard to enjoy a riotous explosion of color and form when the lighting direction leaves you with a blinding headache. Run & Roll may be nothing but a wordless, one minute ad, but it is full of colorful artistic expression and crazy character forms safe enough for the whole family.

Unless you were really looking for it you would not notice it.plot/message: there was a kind message told here. it was do what you want outside with friends and play. Sometimes messages in life in art or video form are really focusing on certain people from what it appears to show. For example the modern laundry detergent ad in China debate. The goal was to express the effective of the clean but others see something else. I can see both sides but i don't think the negative side was intended. Going back to what i was saying about certain people having wacky weird characters that bare no close resemblance to any race makes for a perfect set-up to prevent racist ideas. Therefore everyone who sees this show can benefit from this message without wondering if it was for them or not.con(s)plot- very bland. To me it was nothing more than a strip art on a long film strip. Meaning there was no cut in film it just kept going and going and going. Like following the energizer bunny in its walking time.plot/message- i got the positive message because i am a deep thinker. i don't think children will pick that same message up without explanation. which why they should have had a caption line or two to explain the purpose.art- was a tad bright.;Not Recommended
0;Kumo ni Noru;Lancehot;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lancehot;6;"Depending on your point of view, the mid 80s through to the mid 90s is either a golden period of violent anime schlock, or a nadir of low budget, exploitative rubbish. At a time when Japanese animators seem to have been enamored with American genre movies (& Mad Max), video nasties & FIst of the North Star, Japan's OVA boom saw a plethora of violent exploitation shows that can often be summed up as “muscly man walks around, kills people & has sex with women.”Kumo ni Noru is instantly recognisable as a product of its time. A violent, incoherent hero's journey, it tells the story of Nio-maru, a demi-god (I think) who has to fight his way through ogre's, Hell & Heaven itself in order to reunite with his sister. With the help of several companions he meets along the way, Nio-maru fights the gods themselves in order to reach his goal, only stopping to have sex with every woman he meets.Like many OVAs of the period, watching Kumo ni Noru involves a lot of shouting questions at the screen. Why is that mountain turning into a giant bird? Why is his sister talking to a frog? Who is that woman & why is Nio-maru raping her? Why is he now raping those other women while the previous one has shrunk herself into his ear? How did having sex with a corpse bring her back to life? What's going on!?Yet despite what's happening on screen making little sense, Kumo ni Noru is pretty easy to follow. Kind of. It's an epic journey where our hero, having been knocked off course by an ogre with a bag of winds, must fight monsters, traverse Hell & ultimately reunite with his family, aided & thwarted by the gods, all the while having sex with beautiful women. Oh my God, it's The Odyssey! With a healthy mix of Buddhist & Shinto iconography & mythology thrown in. The lack of a subtitled version* or a dub may make the specifics of why Nio-maru has to have sex with every woman he encounters etc unclear, but it's not like you really need to be told.*That I'm aware of. Google auto-translate tried it's best but I don't think “the five minute civilian was assume the funny” is an actual line of dialogue.Visually, Kumo ni Noru can be summed up as a mix of Heavy Metal, He-Man & Violence Jack. While clearly made on a shoestring & probably in a rush, if you are a fan of the character designs & background art of this period, it's serviceable if rather unimaginative. The animation is pretty sparse, the quite frequent sex scenes being a notable exception. On that subject, while there is frequent nudity & sex, it never gets explicit, nor is the violence ever particularly gory. There are a couple still frames when Nio-maru is being punished in Hell that should be grotesque, but the cartoony artwork makes them funny rather than disturbing.There is a scene in Kumo ni Noru that I think perfectly sums up both it & most anime of it's type. Nio-maru, apparently confronting a group of female goddesses, finds himself surrounded by beautiful women who dwarf him in size, pointing down & laughing at him, much to his frustration before he puts them in their place. That's Kumo ni Noru in a nutshell. It's an incoherent power fantasy for men who want to indulge in a scenario where they're the badass out to conquer both evil & women, no ifs, buts or prior consent required (not much has changed).Yet there's a charm to Kumo ni Noru that is often lacking in OVAs of it's type. It doesn't have the hateful misanthropy of Violence Jack; nor is it a dull, macho rehash of a film you've already seen like Dog Soldier or Riki-oh (the Lam Nai-choi directed version of Riki-oh is great, though). Most important is that while baffling, it's not boring &, though it doesn't reach the heights of schlock achieved by, say, Battle Royale High School, it will appeal to those who enjoy shouting at the screen, laughing & cheering at what's unfolding before their eyes.";Mixed Feelings
0;Sakana no Iu Koto wo Kiku;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;5;Rate of 5seen via english subtitlesHave you ever wondered what the reason was your parents let you have a pet? It wasn't just because you were good or they could not tolerate your pleas any longer. It was mainly because of the lesson it would bring you. Sure, being responsible is vital but what is more vital is being open minded. Having a pet allows for time to bond and connect. Like a mother or father with a child. As time goes you and your pet grown in many ways. In this case expansion. Sooner or later borders will not be the same that you once saw. Things will change and that love from your connection will come in. Forcing you to expand as well to continue the bond.I could go on and on about the empty nest syndrome and life time partners but i will say this instead. A lot of lives lessons from a kid to becoming a grownup can be learned from this small movie. All you have to do is dive in.I mentioned the plot/ message was nice but so is the art. The art is perfect for the story because of its clear rookie hand drawn appearance. You might not realize it but as the story progresses so does the art but it is not a very apparent thing.;Mixed Feelings

0;A Brightening Life;TrueSonOfCaliban;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TrueSonOfCaliban;8;A fantastic stop-motion short story that excellently shows our MC, Mr. Trashbag, growing beyond himself. It has really amazing imagery capable of telling a great story without a single spoken word. It is definitely worth the 8 minute run time. The stop motion is done magnificently and I loved how much emotion this style of animation was able to capture out of a faceless and seemingly emotionless trash bag. The sound design is also equally praise-worthy for being able to instill uplifting and downtrodden moments within the story. The character arc we see the main character go through is also quite relatable, while that might be more subjective than objective in some eyes I feel there is no one who hasn't been within a slump that felt inescapable. This story perfectly illustrates how one might grow past synch hardships and bloom into more of their “ideal” rather than stay as “trash”.However while mostly positively there was a section within the middle that left me mostly confused. I tried to think of what the director was attempting to convey within the context of the metaphors being used but I was left in the dark a bit. Maybe i simply misunderstood but I felt that with a little more clarity this easily could have been an even greater story.Amazing story, quality animation, and I wholeheartedly recommend the 8 minutes of view time to appreciate this hidden gem.;Recommended

The trash bag yearns for a change from its dismal life. The stop motion did a good of capturing just that.I appreciate the vivid imagery in each action and event that the trash bag goes through. The hardships one faces in life, a persons' greed, feeling, fall, and desire. The trash bag is tormented and swept by its want and fear.The trash bag blooms out of the prison that once held it down and becomes something extraordinary. It is sure a rollercoaster of color and noise, complementing the overall theme. It had a bittersweet aftertaste to it.It was surely worth watching~;Recommended
0;Maji;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;3;"“Maji” is a 3-episode OVA about a young man’s rise to prominence in the world of Japanese organized crime. Although it offers some interesting (albeit likely exaggerated) insight into that world, just about every aspect of this OVA ranges from subpar to offensive, and it’s difficult to sit through.The series centers on Motoki Shirogane, who goes by the name “Maji,” and begins with him as a young yakuza underling who, through a series of events, proves himself worthy of moving up in the ranks. This causes him to make both friends and enemies, the latter of which are the source of most of the show’s drama, including turf wars, attempted and successful murders, and rapes. Meanwhile, Maji is in love with Kumiko, a stereotypically innocent high school girl. Once he becomes a full-fledged yakuza member, he refuses to meet with her for her own good, but is committed to protecting her and the town they live in from the shadows.The dramatic moments seem highly exaggerated and unrealistic. The police only show up a couple of times, but they don’t really do anything except give the gang members a slap on the wrist and let them go, even when people are murdered. There’s also a melodramatic subplot about blood transfusion, which plays out in a cliched and silly way.The characters age over the three episode runtime, particularly from the first to second episode, but there isn’t much character development. Maji makes the change from delinquent kid to yakuza gentleman rather quickly, and even gets a voice actor change. Kumiko is depicted as way too innocent/trusting — they make sure to emphasize her innocence by having her attend church and volunteer at an orphanage, and she doesn’t even realize that Maji is a yakuza member until he straight up tells her. Other characters that get at least a modicum of development are the yakuza members under Maji’s care, Maji’s mysterious “rival” from another gang who sometimes ends up helping him, and the head of their parent gang.The technical aspects of this OVA are subpar. The animation is not good at all. Sometimes the way objects (like cars) move looks unnatural, like they’re just sliding across the screen, and some of the shots are taken at odd angles. Some scenes and parts of scenes are reused. The character designs are bland. There's nothing appealing visually about this. The all-instrumental soundtrack is also lacking; it's incredibly boring and forgettable. The voice acting is not good; the dialogue is dull.There is significant objectionable content in this OVA. There are about three or four (depending on how you count) scenes of rape or attempted rape, all with nudity and no real consequences for the rapists. Also, since some of the gang members run an adult video shop, there’s a sex scene shown on tape, and some tape covers with nudity can be seen. As one would expect from an anime about organized crime, there’s lots of blood and violence, including a scene where part of a finger gets chopped off.I wouldn’t recommend watching “Maji” to anyone unless they have a keen interest in Japanese organized crime, and even then, I would hesitate to recommend this because of all of the subpar and objectionable elements. Also, as of this writing, there’s no English version available, so it’s not really accessible to the average non-Japanese speaker.";Not Recommended
0;Shixiong A Shixiong;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;8;"This donghua is an adaptation of a novel (source); since I have read both the novel and am watching the donghua, I will review this work as both an independant work and as an adaptation.Plot Summary: Li Changshou (our MC) is a cultivator who is 10000% risk adverse. Because of this, he does everything he can to avoid being the center of attention. However, because of his master's coming tribulation to become an immortal, he is forced to go search for a rare medicinical herb to try to help his master pass the tribulation. Druing this trip, he ends up catching the attention of some elders, leading them to try to help him make a name for himself (which he does not want). This story is about all the butterfly effect events that happened because he broke his personal covenent to not stand out in anyway.This is the newest released donghua that I have watched, and you can see the quality and time put into it. The animations, character models, fights, effects, everything feels perfect and state of the art. All the choreography is smooth and nothing feels misplaced. To date, this is the best donghua graphically that I have watched (also watched closest to the release date so there is that).The plot is clean an smooth. The transitions for time skips seems natural. As for the story, it balances the comedy , intense fights, and plot development very well. It has just the right mix of all of them. All the comedic moments (both the internal monologues/complaints and the humourous acts) are all greatly done. You'll get a good laugh out of this while enjoying the plot.This donghua is a perfect introductary watch for anyone, especially for those who like cultivation and comedy.Review as an adaptation:As an adaptation, this donghua is similar to the novel, but does not completely capture the tone and comedy. Some details were left out, like the fact that our MC Li Changshou is a reincarnator and uses his knowledge of Chinese Myths to understand what is to come (understanding of future events). The show also suggests the possibility that he might also be a time regressor (traveled back in time). While the show does a good job of showing his overly cautious, risk adverse nature. They don't present the comedy of this quite as well as the novel. For example, that trip MC made to the northern continent, he prepared for 15, yes 15, years. This detail that was left out really exemplifies the his overly cautious nature. Other than this, the comedy has been toned down to PG level and most of his internal monologues have been left out. The comedy was originally derived from his overpreparedness and from kinks that he didn't account for, like Youqin Xuanya's But overall, this is a good adaptation of the novel.Note: this donghua covers the ""prologue"" of the novel, covering everything up until right before our MC's tribulation to become an immortal, covering chapters 1-52, though it is a bit of a speed run of the plot, as there are usually years if not decades between major events, like from his master's immortality tribulation to his (about 12 years). There were also supposed to be a few years between his master's tribulation to the dragon palace competition.Adaptation score(how faithful to source): 7/10";Recommended

Requires interpretation rather than providing direction. A tale of desire portrayed in a realistic manner but eventually drops for it is only fiction at the moment. Meant in my eyes for those who are suffering from guilt. More precisely guilt caused by survivor syndrome. Survivor syndrome is the pain from escaping when certain elements remain to be fixed. For example, you escape from a burning building. Congratulations you live another day. On that same extra day you read that a life was taken by that same building fire. The person's life could be anyone:family, friend, neighbor but whoever it may be will stick with you like unwanted gum on your shoe.

Through surrealism, visual storytelling and symbolism, it explores deep into its theme. It touches on so many subject in such a short time. It shows the inevitable sacrifice made due to the change of era. It shows the hidden potential of human nature. It shows how humanity will forever be haunted by its history no matter how advanced it gets. Its peculiar yet ingenious visual style and meaningful references brings out the very essence of its core themes. The story it tells is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.Another one of its accomplishments lies in its psychological expedition. It is truly a psychological show at its core.

0;Play Jazz;Shimbels;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Shimbels;2;"I have a replica of one of Matisse's Blue Women perched up on my wardrobe, watching me sleep. She was made by my ex, whom I still see often and like very much, and it reclines with a natural grace against an almost empty clay pot and a very old Winnie the Pooh teddy bear. In that context Matisse is a warm hug, the smell of cumin, the feeling of a sleeping cat on one's legs. Even in the gallery, where Matisse often loses something, he rarely feels less than pleasant.Play Jazz renders Matisse in such a way, with the stuttering motion and the scanlines, that his aesthetic is transposed into a hideous 80s corporate gothic. The move is a vital and bold one simply as an act of resetting the familiar, but the film does barely any work in selling me on this and rather I feel as though it's my own brain that has come up with all of the beauty. I could have done the same thing by walking over to the abandoned textile factory and standing by the big pile of burnt out TVs coated in the colourful spray paint of graffiti. I don't normally like dismissing art as not worth my time on the basis that it doesn't provide me with something unique; I'd struggle to justify listening to so much jungle if that were the case. Something about the choice of jazz as subject matter justifies my low score here: Bechet's fantastic solo cannot be corporatised so easily, and it makes the aesthetic I describe above feel incomplete.

It wasn't too hard to find them, as the creator placed it on youtube for all to see![Story] [5/10]Each of the three episodes are self contained, with a simple storyline. There is action, comedy, etc... It is all very good. It could be said, there is less story, as there is no dialogue now.[Art] [7/10]Much improved from the first, the style is still quite different from the usual anime style. It's good though. The animation is good.[Sound] [7/10]Featuring a voiced OP from Furukawa Momoko which is very nice. It fits with the jazzy feel. Some BGM was reused from the first series. But it's used in the right place, so it's fine. The rest is good. No ED here, pretty normal.There is no voiced dialogue! But it doesn't really need it. Everything is really self explanatory.[Character] [5/10]Dark Side Cat is a sneaky lil troublemaker in this, maybe a little more so than than the previous series. There aren't so many incidental characters anymore, so the focus is on mainly Dark Side Cat.[Enjoyment] [7/10]Each episode was short and had just enough content. Well, it's a short! It was still very cute and sweet.[Overall] [7/10]A fun series of anime shorts. Too bad there aren't a few more! I could watch dozens of these little shorts. Very easy to watch.;Recommended
0;Organic;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3art film (non vocal nor subtitles but has background sound)StoryShort and simple. Carries the message of recycling. On how one action will end up ending where it started from. In other words balance or where there is life there is death. Really makes you want to live in the moment while you can.Art-had a lot of unneeded forms of motion expression. Indicated by the wavy black lines. The draw back to using this artistic approach is not only can it be a health hazard for some but doesn't sit well with the eyes. One one hand you have jittery art while at the same time having stationary art. Not a good balance at least for me.-lack in background depiction. The art you saw was basically the characters or main aspects to the show. As for what you could see could have been more colored. To present a more visual presentation.sound-at some moments there was sounded like skipping in the background music. Where the music echo after finishing or partway through.EnjoymentAn art piece best appreciated with an open mind. While it does lack a lot of visual elements the message nonetheless is a powerful one.;Not Recommended
0;Taku Boda;ACraftyDude;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ACraftyDude;5;"[Warning! This Review contains story/symbolism spoilers!]To the average watcher, Taku Boda may initially appear as nothing more than a short simple animation project, with no deeper meaning than a showcase of colorful boxes with a hint of music. I'm happy to tell you, average watcher, that you have missed the forest for the trees, as Taku Boda is a masterful commentary and warning of totalitarianism and its consequences.Taku Boda begins of an ominous message of ""nice to see you"". Before we are able to understand or contemplate, the audience is introduced to a world of colorful blocks in different patterns, an appealing individualist utopia. It wastes no time in shattering its false idealistic state by revealing its true face of its blocks moving in lockstep with one another, reminiscent of the goose steps of 20th century dictatorships. The colorful facades of individuality each block once represented change with the shifting patterns the blocks form on demand from a ever going and demanding puppeteer aided with the rhythmic tune. To the audience horror the blocks once so appealing and magical have been turned into obedient slaves ever turning and changing on demand with no resistance to offer.For 2 minutes we are shown the frightening sequence of machine like behavior, with little understanding of the goal of such movement is, before they finally all come to the same shade of blue and combine together. With the final goal complete, we are shown the final horrible sight of an unblinking staring eye. Reminiscent of 1984's 'Big Brother', the eye represents the never ending gaze of the totalitarian state on its subjugated populace of blocks, and now, you the viewer who has earned its attention. A scary reminder that if we are not careful, we may very well become the ever obedient ever marching boxes, fooled into thinking we our individuals when really we are just gears in the machine.Truly a master stroke of animation, music, and symbolism. A must-see for dystopia enthusiasts and for future generations as an ever-present warning.5/10.";Recommended

0;Stray Sheep: Poe no Chicchana Daibouken;Animestar0;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animestar0;7;"I watched this show when I was a kid and I was scared of some parts because it showed blood and possible ""deaths"" of Poe.What I really liked about the anime was the storybook-like visual and the creepy background music. It's very different than all the other children anime like Pokemon and Digimon during that time.I think the weakest part of the story was probably the characters because there was no actually character growth besides that Poe was able to face the wolf again.The ending song was both visually appealing and disturbing at the same time. You see Poe being pinned as a carousel horse or he was swimming in the ocean (depending on the censorship).Overall, this is one of my favorite childhood anime and I wish I can see more anime in this art style.";Recommended

The story is about Sun Wukong (Monkey King) who got himself in trouble because he was short-tempered and greedy, he accidentally release the Demon King who was trapped. I wouldn't spoiler anything else but the story was decent, exciting but predictable.Animation 8 : This movie gives me the conclusion that Chinese animation in 3D is almost the same level as Disney. Believe me, I watched a couple of Donghua It's good but not good as the 3D animation that Chinese created. the effect was cool and satisfying, fight scene was good too.Sound 7 : The sound was good and the voice acting was good (I was watched it in Chinese Dub using a subtitle) the way the Demon King sound is so good, ambient, and the battle sound was good eitherCharacter 5 : The character was decent, it doesn't surprise me at all. Basic Chinese character I would say, you got greedy character, you got pacifist character, you got funny character too. Basic.Overall 7 : If you want to watch just for fun or probably watch it with your family and friends I guess this is a perfect movie for you, but if you want a deep story I think you're in the wrong place. It's probably they trying to tell a story of Monkey King for any ages so they trying to keep the story as simple as possible.;Recommended

1;Hokuro Kyoudai Full Throttle!!!!;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;4;"Rate a 4English SubbedStoryReminds of a combination of the American show the three stooges along with a comical show staring Drew Carey called, Whose Line Is It Anyways. I think spoken stories with some visual presentation makes for an interesting story. However, there are a lot of people like myself that haven’t fully grasped the Japanese language. Thus, having word after word in a rapid fashion making up 90 percent of the show will lead to problems; for punch lines require time to let joke sink in. If you are not familiar with a joke how can you let it sink in if they are progressing to another joke?Jokes were sadly commonly recycled thus beaten to death. You know, when someone says enough already or move on.In terms of episode transition they did an okay job. For not only was the art original to some degree, it had vocals. Which, was not helpful to know what was coming but was like bonus content for those that enjoyed the show.I did like how they embedded some realism to the story. For example, during a very loud scene do you think you could hear someone vocals? Unless, they are projected over some sort of loudspeaker one couldn’t. Thus, logically there could be no subtitles.Morality being the characteristic of one’s character is not looked kindly here in some instances. Such as smoking, thievery, talking with one’s mouth full. Then again there are some kind moral instances but those are sometimes hidden within the story.I didn’t enjoy how the main character were talking over the credits. The show had finished, let the audience view who the show cast in peace.Ending wasn't great. For it made sense on a comical scale but in terms of the mafia plot i felt it was ignored.ArtUnfortunately, some of the background depending on scene were unfocused. I am aware this is a presentation strategy to focus one’s attention but it can also ruin the art.It was nice to see after each there was a new design rather than same backdrop. But as the show progressed the backdrop continued be constant but I think that is forgivable given the main character ‘finance’.Given some of the violent nature it was nice there was no blood.SoundIf there wasn’t a lot of repetition then I can understand this show being more comical.I found the act of muting or in some term censoring the vulgar language. That actually boosted the shows moral.";Not Recommended

0;Nanaraki: Seven Lucky Gods;WolfieGrrrl;https://myanimelist.net/profile/WolfieGrrrl;2;"The premise of gods and yokai trying to become popular with humans in the modern world to increase their power levels is interesting and could be very fun, but this just isn't it for me.The animation is off-putting, and the humor is both crass and dry. The birthday bit in episode 5 feels like they let Ikuto Kanemasa loose to improvise in the studio and then just didn't bother to cut it down for the final product, and there are plenty of other ""jokes"" that drag on just like that one. Whenever this miniseries DOES try to be a little clever, it mostly boils down to Japanese wordplay and very specific pop culture references that don't always come across to a foreign audience. Watching each episode feels like being an unwanted third wheel in someone else's conversation where you are only occasionally able to pick a single reference out of the onslaught of in-jokes flying right over your head but don't understand enough to really contribute.The monologue style in episode 1 CAN work, but there isn't much happening on the screen to pull in any interest, so it ends up feeling like it's an hour long because it drags so much. Episode 2 onward at least has conversations between multiple characters, but there's only so much ""creepy old men lust after young women"" bellyaching I can stomach in between the one predictable gay punchline and the tired ""pretty lady has a boyfriend who is NOT conventionally attractive"" joke anyone could see coming a mile away. The finale tries to subvert our expectations, but it winds up failing by playing into the same old jokes anyway.To its singular credit, the voice acting is pretty on point and the unexpected rap battle was almost entertaining if only because it came out of nowhere to break up the monotony of the ""creepy old man can't get a girlfriend"" narrative. Also, the ending credits feature a ""spot the difference"" scene, which is pretty neat.If any of that sounds cool to you, the one positive is that the episodes are short, so you'll only have to feel like you're in hell for 10 minutes at a time. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable about the Japanese language and culture will find the writing funny enough to laugh even once. But to anyone like me, I can't recommend it.";Not Recommended
0;Tadaima! Chibi Godzilla;UnNomeBello;https://myanimelist.net/profile/UnNomeBello;8;This anime answers the age-old question: what if Godzilla was actually concieved as a Sanrio character? Or, to be more descriptive, what if Godzilla was a cute, adorable mascotte to buy merchandise of?This series is basically a 4-koma animated: every episode is 30 seconds long, opening and ending included, and it usually depicts a delightful/humorous in which Chibi Godzilla and his... roomate?, Satomi, find themselves in, which gets resolved in an amusing way, intended to make you smile. Every episode is self-standing, except for the first and last one that mirror one another: maybe a predictable concept, but one I still found adorable. This ONA knows perfectly what it is, and I find that it focuses on what it's set out to do quite well, creating stories that fit the timing of the episode while also managing to include references to the rest of the Godzilla franchise. They are definitely unfrequent, and focused on the most peculiar moment of movie canon/superficial characteristics of the most recognizable monsters, but they're a backbone of the series nonetheless.However, if you're not looking for short amusing moments to watch on a strict time management, this series has nothing else of note. Animation is fine at best, and it's mostly based on almost-still images, plot is nonexistent and characters besides Chibi-Godzilla and Satomi appear very little outside of the ending. In conclusion, despite its short lenght, you have to be in a specific mood to enjoy this.;Recommended

0;Gaza: Changing the World;RustoKomuska;https://myanimelist.net/profile/RustoKomuska;8;"So I came upon this promotional video because the name looked interesting as I searched for another anime in the DB. It's 2 minutes on YouTube so doesn't feel like much of a time waste looking for it and watching it. It's just a promotion for building a mosque, but I say the synopsis and thought ""lmao islam has an anime now nice"". I'm only writing a review now because I thought it would be amusing and because I feel like talking about the thing.Story: 6The story does the job for a promotional video. Displays the tragedy occurring in Palestine where the Muslim spirit of the people that lose their lives is the same that goes into the building of the mosque. It shows Muslims doing regular things like reading the Quran in the mosque and living at home for a few seconds, and shows the feelings for our fellow Muslims and people from the area and other places in the world forming a shield against Israel's air strikes in Palestine and under this shield the area flourishes. The general message appears to be linking the need for a stronger worldwide Muslim community beginning from the community in individual places including Shizuoka. It seems reasonable and does a good job for what it is, though it's not ShakespeareArt: 5Islam the anime isn't really focused on the animation, rather than the message it sends. The ghost/spirit/feeling of the people who are dying is represented by blue lights and what appears to be the transmission of Muslim feelings of brotherhood which form the shield or whatever are rainbow lights. Conveys the message well, nice and subtle. The rest of the animation is just simply drawn anime people in low framerate animation. Nothing that stands out muchSound:5Sound design is also not really a focus here. Some cheap stock ""sparkle"" sound effects seem to be used for the moving of the lights and so on and the background music is just there because it would be weird if it was silent. Doesn't really convey any emotion, doesn't really need to. A job well done.Character: 3No real characters except a child dying in someone's arms who appears twice and a guy in a crowd in Shizuoka in front of the mosque that looks up. Conveys a generalised message of unity among Muslims without being too specific that it would apply to just about everybody. Nothing really here, nothing really needed.Enjoyment: 8There's a novelty in watching ""Islam is cool also fuck Israel: the anime"". I also got the feeling they were trying to get across.OVERALL SCORE: 8Nice job by the Muslim Association of Japan. Wish them Allah's blessing in building their Mosque.";Recommended
0;Gaza: Changing the World;Yarmiplay;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yarmiplay;1;This is a stain on Anime and should never have been made.It's pretty impressive how terrible you can make something with just 2 minutes, I thought maybe it'd be interesting to watch considering the politics around this one, but it's just a promotion for spreading Islam in Japan and building some mosque, sorry folks, I can't get behind that.Considering the reality of the situation, it wouldn't be far fetched to call this video a massive lie as well. I don't know what the Muslims that did manage to get into Japan think Islam is like, but maybe look at countries where Islam is dominating to see that the religion isn't about the people at all, as this video attempt to portray.Art: 2/10Pretty lazy overall, barely a few frames of any facial expression if at all.They sure did try to bring out an emotion, perhaps too hard.Fair enough, I didn't totally hate it.Sound: 1/10One soundtrack and I didn't like it, too bad.Character: 1/10There aren't any.I got confused trying to distinguish all of them, it's like they wanted to show the effect they wanted the video to have instead of, actually having the video make that effect. Pathetic.Overall: 1/10I hated it and even slightly regret watching it, I'm sad that this exists.Overall this video is nothing but just a fluff piece to give public support to something that a minority cares about. Perhaps I'm really biased on this one, but the production is super poor and it could've been done 100 times better with some actual effort put into it, more effort put into the actual thing and less on the goal.;Not Recommended

The short film uses a musical piece made and sung by mayU and it was animated by echoes animation.I just found this short film by accident in the MAL popularity rankings, looking for what would be at the very bottom of the ranking. And this short film turned out to be one of the lowest ones. For some reason i decided to just watch it, since i found a youtube link on their website and i said: ""5 minute short film? Why not?!"". Most short films are made with a lot of love, since they are made mostly by amateurs and they try to give their best and their everything to define a story and a fitting video, whilst still having an inspirational story - if possible. In terms of animation and art, creators of short films tend to just use their own style, which i really like a lot. If you watch a short film made by a single or a few persons, you can really see their style.Coming to how i liked it, i actually enjoyed the music. It kept me going and not dropping the short film halfway through. It also kept me interested onto the story and the characters, which by the way are really loveable. You can really feel for their pain and desires and you feel happy and sad for them, while they are going through their stuff.The story evolves around 3 men, which gather randomly in front of a big sign called ""Dream House"". They all want to live in such a house, but clearly are too poor. Here the story kicks in, and where i will leave it, storywise.The art & animation was OK. Nothing too spectacular. I'm quite sure it was made with CGI too. The way, the characters were presented and shown was by far the best in this short and what i really enjoyed in this 5 minutes.A fun fact to end this review: It took me more time, to write this review, than watching the actual short film.";Mixed Feelings

Why you ask, it's because the footage is pretty much the same.The original version has Ballet sequences and fitting music, however in this version there are no ballet sequences, they are replaced with animated more abstract sequences. The music is also different. In this version the music is lot more eerie and mysterious than in the original where the vibe of the music was pretty classical fitting the ballet performances.Now I mentioned earlier how the footage is pretty much the same, however for this version they touched up the footage with effects etc. and I have to say it looks much better than the original. The immersion into the eerie atmosphere of the film feels much better in this version than in the original.If you liked the ballet scenes, music and visual darkness from the original this might not be much of a upgrade for you as its more of a different experience.Overall I'd say this version is the better version especially in the visual and atmospheric department however if you are into it for the ballet performance/experience I'd say that the original is better.;Recommended

0;Fast Week;simo_omis;https://myanimelist.net/profile/simo_omis;6;This man is such a smart artist, with each scene having deep meaning! Here's my interpretation:1. World Hunger: Notice how the person sees the food but can never have any of it?2. Societies influences on females: How society wants women to be these skinny figures who eat nothing, and so when they do eat they eat in shame or guilt because they think its wrong to do so.3. Food Waste: You see how every time a piece of the burger gets cut, it goes into the garbage?4. Child obesity: The children worship the burger.5. Greed: The only one that never eats is the last person, perhaps symbolizing greed because the others never share.6. Sort of like Greed again: Notice how only the top person gets the burger? This could symbolize how in businesses, you have so many people working and holding the structure of the company up but the only people that get anything are the people at the top (CEO).7. Could symbolize how parents work so hard to feed their kids, and the children never realize what they have to go through.The last one with the person watching the TV is just how corporations put things in ads to brainwash you into doing what they want you to do.;Mixed Feelings

0;Dai-chan, Daisuki.;mononoke357;https://myanimelist.net/profile/mononoke357;7;"The story of this anime centers around a severely disabled boy, Dai-chan, who is physically impaired, can't speak, and has the intelligence of a toddler. While that isn't exactly what I'd call an interesting character, the movie does a good job of portraying how people react to and deal with Dai-chan and disabled people in general.Dai-chan has two younger sisters. One of them, Mai, acts as his older sister since she looks after him a lot. She goes through various struggles such as initially feeling embarrassed by her brother when he and other disabled children visit her school, or being burdened by him while she's doing her homework. I enjoyed seeing how she dealt with those hurdles and grew as a character.Taking care of a disabled child is never easy, especially when the father has a full-time job and the mother has to do household chores. The anime also does a great job at showcasing the struggles (but also the joys!) of raising a disabled child, which I won't go into more detail about due to potential spoilers.As you'd expect, there are also various people (both children and adults) who make fun of or stigmatize disabled people. In some cases, especially when it comes to some of Mai's classmates, that could have been done in a less stereotypical way, but on the other hand, those classmates also have their own problems and backstories, which makes their behavior a bit more understandable.Besides Dai-chan, the ""disabled main character"", there is also a disabled side character, a girl in a wheelchair who can speak (though only with a lot of effort) and write. She would have been a more interesting disabled main character imho since I generally prefer characters whose weaknesses and strengths are somewhat balanced. In the end, it's the characters around Dai-chan who carry the movie.The animation is decent for a movie from 2007. The characters were realistically drawn and there were some nice background shots.The music was uplifting and perfectly underlined the emotions the characters felt.If you like realistic settings and enjoy watching family-centered shows, then this movie may be worth a try.";Recommended

0;Onagawa Chuu Baske Bu: 5-nin no Natsu;Hanahashi;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Hanahashi;7;Onagawa Chuu baske Bu is simple, a very heart-warming and a really nice story to follow, being divided between animation and documentary. What else can be a negative point is the animation, but that would be a bigger problem if it were a conventional sports anime, Onagawa's focus is to tell the story of this team, they environment and how the sport was a way to bring them together after a natural disaster and that he does very well, the mood of the scenes is super comfortable and very motivating in certain parts, I believe this is due to the characters themselves who have a very good synergy and energy and, especially, to those who support them, the residents of that city are what you would expect from a small country town. The documentary part, it's the basics of what you'd expect, however it's interesting to see where the girls ended up after junior high graduation. Onagawa it's not amazing, something that will make you excited about a sublime game, however it conveys a light environment and an excellent message within what is proposed.;Recommended

At first, I was browsing an anime site when this caught my attention. I've heard of Lipton but didn't know much about them. I decided that there was nothing better to do so I started to watch the 3 episode masterpiece. The animation is as good as it can get. Throughout my years of watching, this was visually pleasing to the eyes. The art style was also pretty good. The characters were written masterfully.

0;Pupa (Movie);Gsarthotegga;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Gsarthotegga;4;"I find myself not wanting to be too hard on student films. This is well-made, and there's nothing particularly bad about it, and while I won't say there's nothing good about it, this is very flatly average and a very cliche depiction of sadness, grief, licking your wounds a bit, and then moving on to confront a new day—maybe renewed; maybe not. We don't really get a sense for what the character feels or thinks other than the raw emotions presented through the animation in this ultra-short 3-min student film without any dialogue.Like, it's not fan servicey when you see her heinie or her body undulating in the nude. THIS IS ART! It's visual storytelling that uses simple and easily relatable symbols. Just reading the title Pupa, tells you about ALL you need to know to understand this short. And, no, this is not the trashy and fetishy brother-sister guro thing. This is a SOPHISTICATED Tokyo University of the Arts production.Wow, I feel enriched already. Art, culture, wow. She's a modern lady, so her apartment is a wreck, and she eats ramen bricks all day and collects plastic water bottles. We get just fine hand-drawn teary-eyed animation fuzziness whisking us away into decent creatively arranged transitions in the more classical animation sense (sometimes...), instead of just film editing 101 or uncreative TV stuff. She mills about, watches TV, CRIES INTENSELY in quick cuts, holds her face in agony... *INSERT RANDOM CLUTTERED INTERIOR B-ROLL*. Fast cuts, a butterfly, sudden piano, and sad violin to show she is such a pretty little flower, etc.Frankly, I feel like this was autobiographical, and the female character is an insert for the author. She spent all that time animating, accumulating trash, and then by the end, she's like ""Man, that was agony. I didn't have any idea what to do, so I just depicted how hard it was for me to figure out what to animate, and by creating, I'm like, renewing myself, like a flower, you know?"" Then she dumps out all the trash that accumulated during her time animating, and that's the final shot in the animation, too. Pretty deep stuff.";Not Recommended

Watching this is not much difference then watching television on a very old television. You get mostly black and white images, real time pictures, grainy background and a quite a bit of flashes. No, not the streaking version you dirty thinkers. I could and should have rated a 1 but i am assuming that this remake or re-mix most likely has to better than the original, right? On the plus side while the whole concept was trash and the art tortured one's eyes at least you had an idea of what you were seeing.The audio did a good job of matching up with the tempo of the music. Although the audio tracks seemed a bit random at times. Only part of sound i really enjoyed was the beginning and end. Mainly because the sounds emitted were that what you would expect from a stage performance. Which generally involves the audience applauding or booing at the end. Because of this I was provided relief knowing this horrid movie has reached its conclusion.;Not Recommended

0;Kappa no Sanpei;MaahHeim;https://myanimelist.net/profile/MaahHeim;7;I was able to watch this movie in a special exhibition held here in Brazil. I had never heard of it, but since it revolved around kappas, I decided to check it out.The story revolves around Sanpei, a young boy who lives in the countryside and really wishes to see his mom, who lives in Tokyo and who he hasn't seen in years. One day at school, the principal decides that he will take the students that win a minor swimming contest to Tokyo. Sanpei, who doesn't know how to swim, see in this an opportunity to be able to go to Tokyo and find his mom. However, as he trains how to swim in a river, he ends up drowning. What could be the end ends up being a new beginning: Sanpei is saved by Gartaro, a kappa! Now Sanpei enters the world of kappa and other mythological creatures, all while he tries to see his mom again and learn things about his family that he previously didn't know.This movie is made for children - and it's very well made at that -, but it can be extremely funny to whoever watches it. From a Shinigami who needs to kill people to provide for his family (and goes around holding a curriculum vitae) to Sanpei, who likes to take a dump in the middle of the grass on his way to school, this movie makes sure to show us many hilarious things from the beginning to the end. Sanpei has a sharp tongue, and the outcomes of the weird situations he got himself in are always unpredictable. You can really see it was a movie made in the 90s.The characters are the best part of it, but there is some good music and somehow interesting story that you follow. It's a kid's movie through and through, but it is a funny one. It can be a little boring at times, but then it keeps you going because you see yourself wondering what's going to be next.The movie touches on difficult subjects like family issues and death, but it never loses the sense of humour and the overall positive aura. It really took me back to my childhood, and I bet I'd loved this movie as a kid.;Recommended

0;Kangetsu Ittou: Akuryou Kiri;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Kangetsu Ittou: Akuryou Kiri” is a spinoff of “Shinshuu Sudama-hen,” which is one of the worst OVAs I’ve ever seen. Thus, when I set out to watch this, I prepared for the worst, but was relieved to find that it wasn’t as bad as its predecessor. Being better than “Shinshuu” is not a difficult hurdle to clear, however; “Kangetsu” is only borderline watchable.“Kangetsu” takes place in the early 1700s in Edo (Tokyo). The OVA features two side characters from “Shinshuu,” but other than that, the story is not connected to “Shinshuu” in any way, so it can be watched separately. (In fact, I’d recommend staying far away from “Shinshuu” altogether.)The gist of the story is that the a samurai clan called the Satake clan is having an internal power struggle, and the individual controlling Edo's economic world behind the scenes, a man named Muan, seems to be buying off/bribing one of the Satake members so he can effectively control their territory. No one has actually seen Muan in a long time, though, so his existence itself is suspect. Along with the illusionist Insai, ""Muan"" is also orchestrating the mass kidnapping of young women related to those who do business with the Satake clan to sell them to Westerners in exchange for gold and opium. This plan all somehow involves the use of tarot cards. Popular novelist and author self-insert Kangetsu accidentally gets involved in this conspiracy of sorts, and brings in his wide network of friends and acquaintances to help him solve the mystery of the missing women, and to stop the mastermind behind these evil plans.The story somewhat makes sense, and has a clear beginning, middle and end, but it’s a bit convoluted and contrived. Also, I still don’t understand why they brought tarot cards into all of this. Maybe it was explained in a throwaway line at some point, but I don’t remember hearing it. Many of the plot points seem to be there just for ecchi/fanservice reasons, kind of similar to “Shinshuu” but slightly less blatant.As for the characters, the titular character, Kangetsu, is such an author self-insert that it’s not even funny (this OVA is based on a novel). Naturally, he’s a writer, and naturally, he has an editor constantly hounding him for manuscripts and warning him about deadlines. The women (and even one guy) are smitten with him, he has a loyal ninja buddy, he’s smart, he’s cunning, he’s good at using all manner of weapons and surviving all sorts of perilous situations, and he has a full head of bushy hair. Basically, he’s perfect.His main group of friends/acquaintances consists of a prostitute, a ninja, a woman who vowed to kill him over a misunderstanding but then decides to move in with him and do his chores, and an effeminate guy used for comic relief. There’s also the editor, a detective/policeman, and a lecherous artist. Kangetsu exploits this motley crew of people as a spy network of sorts, with a lot of them risking their lives to help him solve the case for apparently nothing in return.The villains’ main group consists of a female illusionist, a man who may or may not exist, a woman who uses umbrellas as weapons, a giant fat genie-looking guy, an ugly guy, and some samurai.Character development is virtually nonexistent — this is a 2-episode OVA, after all. And the characters aren’t all that likable.Despite the violence and sexually explicit content, the overall tone of the series is lighthearted, and it ends on a comedic note.Regarding technical aspects, the animation is poor in parts and often has people's lips not moving when they are speaking. Some of the characters looked ugly, particularly the antagonists. The voice acting is average, but some of it feels cheap and/or rushed. As an aside, Kangetsu and Asazo, the two characters who also appeared in “Shinshuu,” are voiced by different people here. The background music is okay, but it doesn't sound like something befitting 1700s Japan. Same with the instrumental opening theme, which prominently features a harmonica, and the reggae-inspired pop ending theme. At least the lyrics of the ending theme fit the setting.The direction is iffy. There are some awkward and confusing shots, and sometimes there are unrelated scenes of nature spliced in, perhaps to show what season it is while these events are occurring. There are also a lot of scenes showing feet running, which was common in “Shinshuu” as well.As for objectionable content, there is plenty. There is one sex scene in the first episode, and in the second episode, there's a brief flashback to that, a short scene of an opium-infused orgy, and a scene where an artist is getting a little too hands-on with the woman modeling for him. There's fighting, murder and a fair amount of blood, but the violence is relatively tame by OVA standards. Some elements of the plot itself may be considered objectionable, like the hypnotizing and kidnapping of young women to sell to Westerners for gold and opium.Overall, I would not recommend going out of your way to view this OVA. It doesn’t have any redeeming qualities other than the moderately catchy ending theme. “Reggae de chanbara...”";Not Recommended
0;Toho Cinemas & I Love Snoopy: The Peanuts Movie Collab Logo Eizou;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3English DubbedStoryThis is a short introductory trailer for the upcoming 2015 peanuts movie. Given the short duration of this trailer don't expect a lengthy informative review.In terms of the introduction it relayed in my opinion the main feature most can recall of the cartoon that is Peanuts. You know how that one little black haired girl holds the football for the bald head boy to kick only to pull it away at the last moment? Yes, that is what i am referring to viewers. Although here it slightly chances it up to almost entirely new piece with the exception of the bald head boy. No, i won't go into further detail than that for this is a review not a synopsis. The main point of bringing it up is using that moment even it is heavily modified shows the fans of the original Peanuts that while sure a Peanuts production has taken place in a more modern time but with plans on keeping the story how it was. To me that was a real nice emotional gesture that could be offered. So many shows that are continued from such a long time ago are almost completely revamped due to different concerns like costs and audience. Most of the shows that do change the show tend to plummet for being for creative than factual. For example American Television show Macgyver is guilty of a complete revamp. But than again there are some shows that still remain a kid even though they were drastically modified like American Cartoon Scooby doo. But not many only a few do.Not sure if the movie ends to make similar jokes as shown here if so i can't say i would find myself enjoying it. For the character's reactions are somewhat unrealistic. Sure, if you play the moment fast it seems like it matches but in truth it shouldn't. For example i will provide an alternative example. Say you witness a cord being snapped on an elevator right then and there i would expect an emotional response. Even if that response is slightly delayed by a second. I wouldn't expect someone to gasp in shock or horror at the end once the elevator hits the ground. Yeah, in truth it does happen in reality but be honest folks what did you think was going to happen? Was the all mighty one supposed to stretch out is mighty big hand from the heavens and save the day? Maybe i am being kind of harsh with cracking down on character expression seeing how it is a cartoon but with peanuts at least from what true to reality and not science fiction.As for the conclusion to this short anime feature i wasn't impressed. For one can create a huge fanfare of visual arts but if that isn't going to change the bigger picture why even bother wasting the time? Another example i feel is needed. Say you were filmed at a store with an apple in hand. You do some impressive juggling routines with the apple but the apple remains unchanged when you end up buying it at the end.ArtIs the appropriate computer generated. Although, back than i think it was hand drawn but it still looks the same.;Not Recommended
0;Kuuchuu Gunkan Atlantis;Lamity;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lamity;9;"Despite being out for roughly an entire year, this anime has around a mere 30 members on MAL, so I'd like to shed some light on what I think is truly something special.Here I am, your average mecha enthusiast in 2020, lamenting over the fact that the mecha genre just isn't what it used to be. (Can you believe that Sunrise's--the once frontrunners of the mecha genre--latest original mecha work that isn't an adaptation or a continuation of an already existing series is Cross Ange from 2014?)In the pits of despair of big robot purgatory, I found myself searching the mecha genre tag on MAL's database by start date to see if there were any recent mecha anime that I haven't heard about. Unfortunately, as my soul is in denial about the state of the genre, this wasn't the first time I've done this, so most of it was not a surprise. But this time was different; the stars had aligned, my fate had sealed, and there it was, bright as day, clear as night; it didn't even take a third of a page of scrolling.Kuuchuu Gunkan Atlantis, or Aerial Battleship Atlantis, is an independent anime by a group of college students under the name 激画団 (Romanized as Gekigadan.) This anime project is available for public viewing though their YouTube channel of the same name, with English subtitles to boot. Atlantis is only 18 minutes long, but it's 18 minutes well spent.The story is pretty simple, a girl from an island named Luna is held captive on a floating fortress by what is assumed to be an evil organization, and Cyan, a boy hailing from the same island, comes to rescue her with the help of the ancient robot, Gekiga-go. The narrative isn't breaking any new ground, but it doesn't need to; the emotional beats and action sequences are executed very well, and besides, this anime is an animation and production showcase foremost.Speaking of animation and production, I was extremely impressed, all things considered. As I mentioned earlier, this anime was a college animation project, so we're not going to see ufotable or Bones level of polish here, but good sakuga is good sakuga. The action sequences were the highlight for me in this anime, the Gekiga-go flying through the air and delivering blows to the enemy were really well composed. The sound design and soundtrack were solid as well, although at times the SFX overpowered the music a little bit in certain areas; the credits theme is a nice listen as well.What I enjoyed the most about Kuuchuu Gunkan Atlantis is that you could just feel the passion oozing out of every scene. During the credits, there are mid-production photos of the staff, and that was cool to have some insight on as well. Also, there are a number of Gainax/GunBuster references like the classic ""Gainax Pose"" and the Inazuma Kick which were fun to see. Moreover, the people of Gekigadan are reminiscent of Gainax themselves when they started out: animators really passionate about the medium.This anime isn't a six-figure theatrical spectacle, but it's the first anime I've seen in a long time that really made me feel inspired by it. I wish the people behind Gekigadan the best with their endeavors.Score: 9/10";Recommended
0;Ano Yama ni Noborou yo;Firechick12012;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Firechick12012;4;"So...I randomly stumbled upon this anime and thought it looked cute. It's apparently one of many short anime created by Toei and another company called Shinano Art and Culture Consultant, to promote children's books written by one Daisaku Ikeda. Ikeda is a famous philosopher and nuclear disarmament advocate who wrote a lot of books campaigning for peace. The Rainbow Mountain is one of those short anime based on one of his children's books. But...I'm not gonna lie, having seen this, Rainbow Mountain is just...bad. The story is about a bunch of five-year-old kids who learn about a magic mountain that makes rainbows, and they find it and try to climb to the top to see if it can make a new rainbow while facing various adversaries along the way. That's it.The animation is fine, as Toei usually does decent work on their anime, and the character designs remind me a bit of Ojamajo Doremi. But that show had far more depth and nuance to it than this...schmaltzy piece of fluff. The soundtrack is overly saccharine, repetitive, and sounds like it came right out of a cheesy Christian film aimed at kids. But those are the least of this short anime's problems. All of it comes down to the story, and...it's pretty much overly fluffy, saccharine children's fare, and it makes no attempt to even try to make sense whatsoever. For one, the movie's plot is utterly flimsy. A bunch of five-year-olds are somehow able to climb a tall mountain, and said mountain doesn't require them to use any climbing equipment. Oh, and they meet a fairy and a bunch of sentient rocks that try to make them turn back, with said fairy making it so that anything they need on their journey, they can just draw whatever they need and it'll magically come to life! Plus, any danger they face does little to create any tension nor stakes, as anyone above the age of six will know the trio will find a way through it via believing in themselves.But surely the characters are interesting, right? Nah. The kids are just a bunch of kiddy archetypes: The adventurous boy, the girly girl, and the happy-go-lucky prankster. That's it. They're all as bland as wheat toast and devoid of anything that really makes them stand out, little more than cutesy-wootsy goody two-shoes kids that adults drew up thinking actual children will watch and relate to them. It doesn't help that their dialogue is also equally saccharine, with them constantly spouting and preaching about friendship and courage and never giving up and strength in your heart like crazy. The English dub, which was the only language I managed to find this in, really didn't help, as the voice actors were made to give forced, cheesy performances that sound like they came straight out of a bad eighties cartoon! Seriously, I've heard these actors give far better performances in other shows. Also, if I have to hear their mantra ""Up the mountain let's go up! Onward, forward, to the top!"" one more time, I'm going to explode, and the movie REALLY loves to have the characters say it over, and over, and OVER! It wasn't cute the first time they said it, and it never will be!In all honesty, Rainbow Mountain just feels like one of those direct-to-DVD specials that you slap on the TV to babysit your toddler for half an hour. And no, it being a kids movie does not give it an excuse to be this overly preachy, saccharine, and patronizing. I can understand wanting to have kids learn good morals about friendship and courage, but this is not the way to do it. The whole movie just feels like brightly colored junk food that'll put you in a diabetic coma. It's not as bad as, say, My Little Pony: Newborn Cuties or anything, but seriously, don't waste your time on Rainbow Mountain. Kids deserve better than frothy pieces of cotton candy like Rainbow Mountain.";Not Recommended

I will try to make it simple because this OVA is straight forward. This is practically Ghost Stories (Not The English Dub Version) before Ghost Stories. So I don't know if this is based on some of the books that share the same name.This OVA contains 2 episodes of 15 minutes. The first one is about Spider Spirits that the 3 main protagonist decide to look for and take pictures after the school time ends but they are protected by a lady spirit that is not from Go For A Punch and since my knowledge in Japanese language is low I can only say from what I gathered is that she and those spiders protect the school I guess(?)The other is about a girl spirit that can stretch her arm and her info is found on an old computer data, because she dissapeared or died (?) but her spirit rests in peace after one of the protagonist has a conversation with her and that's this OVA.It is fairly watchable but it feels that tries to make a scary story for children which is not bad, but it lacks tension because all these cases are solved very quickly and without proper satisfaction after finishing.The animation is ok for the time it was made but sometimes they make the characters look out of proportion when the camera zooms out. The spiders are the ones that looked to be drawn properly for the situation but the girl spirit, looks horrendous. She looks awful with the hair ""covering"" her eyes except it shows that the budget wasn't that big for that.There is not a lot of music and the voice actors are fine but nothing stands out.This is again just a piece of media for the children of the time with a light version of a scary stories but that as an adult you will find them silly and over the top.Just watch it if you are curious and to clear up that Go For A Punch is not this show.This is all. Take care in whatever you do and see you around.";Not Recommended

And it's one of the first animes that I ever seen. Soon I watched it on VHS-rip but the quality isn't good and isn't with original audio.This is amazing anime with very good animation, good sound effects... typical for japanese animation from same period (80s, 90s) and good story. But strange to me and I always wondered is why this anime is SO UNKNOWN!I write this notes for little popularity of Miracle Psychicer Seizan and I recommend it to fans of old animes (80s, 90s).

0;Kero Kero Keroppi no Dai Bouken;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;“Kero Kero Keroppi no Dai Bouken” is a Sanrio short for kids that shows the titular Keroppi and his friends journeying to the tanuki Pokopon’s village and then retrieving his stolen bellybutton.Unlike other Sanrio shorts I’ve seen so far, the plot in this one doesn’t really add up. Keroppi dreams about having a belly button because his father, a doctor, told him about the existence of belly buttons. His father had treated a “bear” (actually a tanuki) that had a belly button recently, so Keroppi decides to journey all the way over to the tanuki’s village with his friends to see the belly button. How does he know where the village is? And why is it so far away? Who knows.But when he gets there, another tanuki rushes up to tell him that Pokopon (the tanuki in question)’s belly button disappeared after a thunderstorm recently, and now he’s so depressed that he won’t come out of his room. Apparently, it was stolen. The tanuki tells Keroppi who stole it and where they’re located, so Keroppi and his friends take it upon themselves to retrieve the belly button. If that tanuki knew all of this already, why didn’t she and the other villagers go after the culprits themselves, instead of relying on a bunch of strangers she just met to do so?The story gets weirder from there, but I won’t spoil the ending. Anyway, the story was odd, and I thought that maybe that had to do with the fact that I watched the dubbed version. So I looked up the synopsis for the Japanese version, and it’s quite different, at least for the beginning part (I couldn’t find a summary in Japanese of the entire episode). My guess is that the story makes more sense in the original Japanese.Technical aspects-wise, the animation and voice acting (dubbed) weren’t that good, and the music was forgettable.I wouldn’t recommend watching this short unless you can find the Japanese version, which may have a more coherent plot.;Not Recommended

Didn't seem like what ever the word was had a major impact. There was a lot of characters used but i don't think it was illustrated for expression(talking) but for showing of essence of life. Like blood proves we are beating and functioning.More an art film than anything else.Story-wasn't plot focused. For big questions remained. Such as why the other world? How the package came to be? Was the other world the original world? Did the other world hold a balance of good as well as evil?-Show had a good message to life. Which was to treat life even with small matters well because you never know when your last day is or moment.-Ending wasn't straight forward. Stayed true like the rest of the show in a coded fashion requiring interpretation from the viewer. My understanding was like a gardener taking care of a crop and weeding out all the bad seeds.

Now the seek a new world to challenge. The world of muscles.Self-parody of their previous commercial, Saikyou Donbee x Hanma Baki is a delightful mix of comedy and manly spirit. Fans of Baki will surely appreciate the many iconic scenes and poses that were managed to fit into such a short animation. The commercial really brims with respect towards the source material while managing to make the best of it for the commercial purposes.If Youjirou Hanma's doppelganger with fox ears aggressively praising noodles doesn’t sell manage to sell you the product, I don’t know what will.;Recommended
1;Saikyou Donbei x Hanma Baki: Saikyou no Dongitsune Genrutsutsu;Eoussama;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Eoussama;6;As a fan of both the Baki series and cup noodles, I was excited to see Nissin team up with Baki Hanma for their latest commercial. The commercial features Yujiro Hanma, the strongest character in the Baki series, as a tailed beast-like creature that disrupts the peaceful meal of a salary man. The commercial promotes Nissin's Saikyou Donbei cup noodles, which are advertised as having thicker noodles than the regular Donbei products.The commercial itself was a lot of fun to watch. The animation style was great, and it was cool to see Yujiro Hanma in a different form than what we're used to seeing in the anime. The commercial also did a great job of showcasing the features of the Saikyou Donbei cup noodles and making them look delicious.One thing that stood out to me was how well the commercial captured the spirit of the Baki series. Even though it was a commercial and not an actual episode of the anime, it still felt like it fit right in with the series. The humor was on point and the action scenes were well choreographed.Overall, I thought this commercial was great. It was entertaining, well-animated, and did a great job of promoting Nissin's new Saikyou Donbei cup noodles. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're a fan of Baki or cup noodles.As a side note, Nissin is well known for their creative and interesting commercials, This one is no exception, the way they incorporated Baki into it was really well done, it was funny and the animation was really smooth. It's always fun to see how Nissin does their commercials and this one is no exception.;Recommended

It manages to feature very good fight scenes in a fast paced manner aproppriate for a competitive fighting game. Characters designs are very pleasant to the eye as Wild Beasts is a very colorful game with diverse animalistic players.Finally, the music is just GREAT, its very hype, with a great rythm and beats, it for sure manages to make me think of epic fighting scenes ensuing while listening to it.All in all a great music clip and i have already show it to all my friends, if you like Shuumatsu No Valkyrie you should definetly check it out, and if you don't, check out as well!;Recommended
0;Two Tea Two;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;3;Rate a 3No vocalsArt piecePlotNot quite happy with this animation. I understand dementia is meant to describe mental impairment but at least provide some clear insight for what the director wanted the viewers to grasp. My take which could very well be wrong was a statement about nature and multiple personalities. How we say and do things but deep inside feel differently. Almost as if there was another person with in our self. Or it could be in relation to self loathing.Self loathing is more common in my eyes in women than in men. So, having a women as shown be the main character would make the most sense. This would also explain the excessive amount of nudity. For those who don't understand what i am referring to it is basically saying i don't like how i was made or the features i was born with. If self loathing was the point it would also explain the flotation movement animation. For when fears something they like to disappear quickly. Although, as for the self copy i can't put my finger to in terms of this idea.Maybe it is reference to work. After awhile of labor intensive work it will affect the body as well as the mind. To be effect you have to balance both your personal life and the life you live at work. But in terms animation and nudity explanation i can't explain.Lastly, maybe it is a statement to a sexual encounter at a stranger's residence. You are naked and tired from the 'workout'. You just want to quickly escape and move on. Which would account for the animation, nudity but the dual image.As you can tell there is more than one take to be made from viewing this short animation. Fortunately or unfortunately, not sure which. There is a follow up to some degree, bonus feature that comes after the so claimed ending if you stick around for the credits. Although, while it is additional footage it seemed to be as barren as the surroundings featured with additional insight. Making wonder if that extra footage was worth it.;Not Recommended
0;Cofun Gal no Coffy (TV);Mse1230;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mse1230;10;Cofun_Gal_no_Coffy is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched.Coffy, first name withheld, is a 15-year-old girl who has just entered Takizawa High School. Easily considered exceptionally beautiful, she has only one problem with her own body, she thinks her vagina looks weird and is very self-conscious about it.Story: The story is unique. the cover art however is very misleading. A Green jiggly puff like creature falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Coffy, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which she is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Cofun_Gal_no_Coffy presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.But this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Cofun_Gal_no_Coffy gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels. With great and power and ambition, Coffy is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain her. The way Horse attempts to persecute Coffy is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 3 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed.The flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Coffy and Horse. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 9/10 in my books.Characters: Coffy and Horse are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Coffy's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch her conquests and failures.Horse's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Coffy as you witness her calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by her dream of conquest with the Green jiggly puff like creature, she changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10Sound: The sound got a somewhat lower rating not because it's *bad*. The music and voices are well done, but simply unexceptional. Mostly the music, though good, quickly passes from memory. The opening and closing themes are incredibly generic. Luckily, the voice actors used were incredibly talented.Art/Animation: The art of the Coffy character anime is very unlike the art in the manga. The manga harkens heavily back to the Astro-boy days of manga. The anime is somewhat modernized, but somewhat more realistic than a lot of anime currently. I found the art to be very endearing and used well to enhance the atmosphere of the anime. I give it a 9/10.Overall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Green jiggly puff. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Coffy. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Cofun_Gal_no_Coffy, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it because everyone does, but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10;Recommended

0;Curly;Singan;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Singan;6;"Curly is a one-episode web short directed by Tetsuro Kodama, who previously provided CG direction for the first Mardock Scramble movie and also directed a number of fairly obscure shorts and children's series. Besides, he is the representative director of studio Echoes - a rather unknown Tokyo-based studio specializing in CGI animation that was established in October 2012 and so far has only made a number of short anime (including this one) and provided CG work for the recent gangster series 91 days.So, what is Curly actually about? According to the opening credits in the movie, the story takes place in Kyoto, Japan (although there is no real way to tell whether it's Kyoto or not). A young bride has two mishaps just before the wedding ceremony and naturally starts panicking because the ceremony is about to commence, and she is absolutely not ready for it. The anime shows the interactions among her, her parents, her younger sister and her pet (who is some big fantasy creature of unknown origin wearing an orange scarf), and how they deal with the situation.Now, a quick rundown through each section of the review:- the character animation is entirely computer generated, which is not something I would normally like as I prefer hand-drawn animation over computer generated one because the latter often makes characters look awkward and robotic. However, the CGI here is not bad compared to many other shows I've watched. In fact, the animators even managed to make the characters move in a fairly lively way, which is very important because the show has absolutely no dialogues, and thus gestures and facial expressions are the only way the characters can express themselves. As for background art and art in general, I guess it looks alright;- the soundtrack is instrumental music employing keyboards. It is not memorable yet sounds nice, creating a proper mood for the show;- the story is very simple but dynamic, with a nice premise and a conclusive ending;- as for the characters, they are also not outstanding or particularly memorable for any reason yet they feel lively and believable, acting like normal humans would, and thus they are fine for this kind of show.While the following statement may be rather subjective, I think the biggest drawback this anime has is that it's not that funny for a comedy, which is one of the main reasons why my overall rating is not very high.On the other hand, while the show does not manage to be outright hilarious, it does manage to be mildly amusing and pretty cute, which is especially good if you like romance and family-related anime.So, if you want some quick watch, or you are generally interested in obscure anime, this short might turn out to be a fine way to spend three minutes of your time.";Mixed Feelings

Going from the artwork i assume it represents the struggles of relationship? Although, if that were the case i am not sure what the standing is on the ending. For the ending had at least two meanings.ArtClearly spending money on proper art work was not a priority. Art appeared to a form of cutout animation. Similar to that of puppets. The animation used was poor. For while animation provides the illusion of life to an art piece here it destroyed the illusion. For example, i know trains have a habit of making back and forth runs but have you seen a train stutter, like a broken record? Can't say i have until watching this. Not a realistic portrayal. In some scenes you even see some white border that surrounds the character. For those not familiar with how that provides a negative aspect i will rephrase. If i were to say i have a picture of Madonna(popular idol) unclothed but her head is completely huge in proportion with her body, I can't imagine one person not wondering the authenticity of the picture.MusicIf you thought the art was bad, you are in for a treat with the music. Note, i can be sarcastic at times. The sound was similar to the art. Both of which had a random and constant vibe. I would applaud the artist for the occasional animation sounds like the yawning but there were to many opportunities missed that did not have sound.

0;Noobow: Kieta Medal;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;4;"“Noobow: Kieta Medal” is an odd little 1-episode OVA for kids starring a cookie mascot who enters a pie-eating contest with its friends. There’s little to no setup for the story (who are these characters and why are they here?); character motivations are paper-thin; it has a lackluster ending with a questionable moral lesson, and the technical aspects all feel cheap.The gist of the story is that the titular Noobow, a pure-hearted yellow blob, is called on by its friends Louis, Pico and Sam to enter their village’s pie-eating contest. The kids and Noobow devour several whole pies by hand, with their sights set on the prize: a shiny medal. Some of the other kids cheat, and they’re very open and vocal about it (why didn’t they get disqualified?), but Noobow ends up winning. Noobow and its friends sleep under a tree and when they wake up, both the medal and Sam’s scooter are gone! Could the culprit be the wolf boy who lives just outside the village? The blob and the kids go on an adventure to find out and retrieve the items, but danger lurks...Background information is not given for who these characters are, where they live, or much else — we just know that they seem to be friends and their village is holding a festival. Noobow is a mascot for a kind of cookie, but that isn’t referenced here at all. For some reason, the plot likes to slow down and focus on little “detours” that seem unnecessary, before picking back up and returning to the main story. This OVA is only about 25 minutes long, but this happens several times. Also, the conclusion feels rather forced and silly, with an insultingly simple lesson tacked on at the very end.With the exception of Noobow, the characters aren’t memorable at all. They don’t really have any distinguishing characteristics other than their height and gender. Noobow’s friends are basically just the tall boy, the girl and the short boy. The wolf boy is confusing (is he part wolf, or is he just wearing a wolf’s skin?), and his background isn’t explained. Most of the adult villagers are very… round, probably because they eat so many pies. The two cheating kids are just your typical bully and his underling.The animation and art look cheap. There’s lots of reused animation, and it’s rather choppy. There are some awkward scenes that seem to linger for way too long on a character’s face before moving on to the next scene. The all-instrumental soundtrack is forgettable. The voice acting isn’t that great, although a number of top voice actors appear in this. Minami Takayama stands out in the role of Louis, but she sounds almost exactly like Conan Edogawa, a role she would take on a few years later, and her voice doesn’t fit this character.There isn’t really anything objectionable in this OVA, other than the questionable moral lessons it tries to impart.Overall, I would not recommend watching “Noobow: Kieta Medal.” It’s not good for what it is — a short for kids — and it’s not particularly entertaining, either.";Not Recommended
0;Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiaohua Movie 2;Mnemease;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Mnemease;9;I had a bit of a falling out with U17 Comics a few years back due to their new VIP policy, so I didn’t get around to watching this movie until yesterday. But damn, it brought back so many memories!First off, I’m going to say that a series like Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiao Hua (lit translation: 100 Thousand Bad Jokes, abbreviation: Shi Leng/十冷) cannot be objectively rated. The reason is that the main premise rests on humor, specifically in making parodies out of anything and everything. From traditional fables like the Honest Woodcutter, to classic children’s cartoons like Hu Lu Xiong Di, to popular Japanese anime like Detective Conan and One Piece, I don’t think I’ve seen anything that’s not been poked fun at in some way, shape, or form. Oh and if course there’s always the occasional stab at mainland Han Chinese stereotypes of the dialects/accents of other ethnic groups, which...well just remember that it’s all meant to be interpreted in a humorous light.Now, on to the actual review.Story: Very simple and straightforward. The main objective of the protagonist is to bring back the creator’s staff from the hands of the Southern God who stole it, in order to stop the war brewing between the other three gods. For this endeavor, he is accompanied by a band of three misfits who at times make things more challenging for him. A few straightforward plot twists are inserted along the way, such that the ending, while certainly expected, still holds some interesting surprises. Thus I give it 8/10.Art: Compared to the original series that aired one 5-minute episode on the first day of every month back in 2012, there’s been a massive amount of improvement. I’d say the animation is even better than the first Shi Leng movie, as the characters’ movements tend to be less stiff. Of course there’s always room for improvement, and while the galactic setting certainly allows room for stunning visuals involving massive spaceships and destructive weapons, there may have been a little too much CGI for my tastes. Later on in the series, there is a part where the art breaks down to just uncolored base sketches and in my opinion it’s one of my favorite deconstructions ever so I’m adding a bonus point in the art category for this. My score is 7+1 = 8/10.Sound: As expected, very solid voice acting. We see a lot of Tu Cao/吐槽 moments, in which one of the more levelheaded/reliable characters freaks out and spews out a massive string of comments about how nonsensical some of the other characters’ actions are. Without the talented VAs this series would not even have 1/4 of its appeal, so this is definitely a strong department. The music/sound effect side is a little bit weaker, mostly because there were so many random insert songs that, while meant for humor, weren’t always the most humorous. My score is 8/10 (average between 9/10 voice acting and 7/10 background sound).Character: This second movie saw the introduction of some new characters like Athena (pun for Argon Iodine Sodium) and Thor, and the return of some fan favorites like Xiao Jin Gang and the River God. All the characters have very quirky personalities that, when thrown together, create endearingly hilarious dynamics. I really like how each of them showcases his/her own strengths at some point in the series (the River God especially, I love him so much more now you have no idea). For a perfect 10, I would’ve like to see a little more character development (I also don’t really like how Athena was portrayed), but I think I can give a solid 8/10 in this category.Enjoyment: Hands down 10/10. I laughed the whole time. I think that’s a good sign that the movie lived up to its standards and did what it was supposed to do. In summary, I give the series 9/10 overall, because while there are some pitfalls the strengths far outweigh them. Case in point: I’m always impressed by the way they insert all those sponsored advertisements in a way that adds to rather than detracts from the humor.I’m sure by now if anyone is still reading this incomprehensible monstrosity you’re probably wondering “do you recommend the movie to me”. If you’re a hardcore Shi Leng fan like I once was, I’d say definitely yes. Don’t get turned off by the slightly unfamiliar cast of characters like I was - I promise you that everything will make perfect sense at the end (and, while it’s nice to have a big Nao Dong, you don’t need quantum physics to understand it!).If you’re unfamiliar to the series, I still think this movie can be very enjoyable as a stand-alone comedy to watch on a gloomy evening. You may not catch all the jokes, but there’s enough universal content in there that it should still be pretty funny. Plus, it’s available on YouTube =D;Recommended
0;Gavora;jadedXotaku;https://myanimelist.net/profile/jadedXotaku;8;What an interesting sight this 1989 short by Nobuhiro Aihara is to me. Beginning with still shots of nails before they move via stop motion, it gives way to an assault of morphing b&w ink shapes before eventually becoming an array of ever changing forms and patterns of color. Psychedelic is used to describe this in the synopsis, and I'd say that's pretty apt. The soundtrack (which is credited to RA') has a haunting melody with a slow tempo breakbeat that adds much to the surreal multicolored trip of a short film. The music reminded me Future Sound of London or Autechre, giving this brief 4 and a half minutes short the feel of something I'd have seen on MTV's AMP back in the mid/late '90s. I can only imagine what viewing this post rave in those days would've been like. An odd little avant-garde piece of animation that I really enjoyed for what it is, and is worth a look if psychedelic imagery is up your alley. No LSD required.;Recommended
0;Gold Pencil And Alien Boy;Jojimatthews;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Jojimatthews;10;Gold pencil and Alien Boy is a very dichotomous film to discuss, especially within a more common review format, it is simultaneously utterly incomprehensible and filled with artistic choices I would call bad at best yet at the same time the film has provided me an abundance of Joy, therefor as a work of art does it fulfill its goal?it had succeeded to entertain me and allow me to achieve enjoyment, yet it seems to not do this through the intent of the work, If if were to see it as a touching story of childhood perhaps I would fail to enjoy it, for in that regards it fails to be anything more than a mediocre film that could easily be surpassed by bonobono or even an episode of sesame street, no what truthfully makes this film so fascinating is similar to what makes the 1976 fensheng bang.Aspects like off kilter frame timings and absurd animation techniques, horrible sound mixing and literally ripping off pop music for the score (when there is one) it truly stands on its own in this place of a mixture between the naivety of youth and the sentimentality of a genius artist.Now here is where I must confess something, I do not speak Korean to the extent it would require to fully understand this film, only having done 2 years of high-school level education in it, but I can also say that this film is bootleg to the core and is more about the experience of viewing than it is about being able to understand the narrative, Similar to the music of Aesop rock.and so in this I will give the film two simultaneous scores, 1/10 and 10/10, it is deeply special in one context and utterly garbage in another, choose what you will.;Recommended
0;Sushi;Animelover875;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Animelover875;7;"Sushi is a pretty interesting piece of work in that (unlike most Japanese animation I've seen thus far), it's built around a peculiarly simple and mundane task: that of preparing and consuming a piece of sushi. While this may seem a bit boring, it's actually not; it comes off as pretty entertaining and rather informative, showing the work that goes into the process of preparing sushi; it's simplified to be cathartic to look at and also shows how sushi is viewed as an art form in Japan. If you are interested in Japanese culture, this will give you a greater appreciation for the art of sushi making, which is different and taken more seriously than its western counterpart, as well as prepared differently. In this, Sushi shows the elegance and process of making the eponymous food. Even if one isn't interested in the process, it's still entertaining. And at worst, it's only two minutes from your life; give it a try. 7/10.";Recommended

0;Kitty to Mimmy no Happy Birthday;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"""Kitty to Mimmy no Happy Birthday"" is a Sanrio short for kids starring Hello Kitty and her twin sister, Mimmy. This OVA is decent enough for what it is; it's harmless, easy to watch and has a clear beginning, middle and end. It's not particularly worth watching, though.The gist of the story is this: it's Kitty and Mimmy's birthday, and their mother sends them off to pick yellow strawberries for their birthday cake. They invite various friends to accompany them, but everyone is too busy! Dejected, Kitty and Mimmy pick the berries themselves, then get lost, and finally find their way home, where a surprise (and a song) awaits...The plot is predictable, so the real point of watching this is to see all of the other Sanrio characters that appear in it. Cameos run the gamut from famous characters such as My Melody and Little Twin Stars, to relatively minor ones such as Taabou and Pokopon.The animation is limited, but serviceable. The voice acting is average. The music, including the song at the end, does not leave much of an impression.Overall, this is not a bad short by any means, but there is nothing particularly unique or outstanding about it. It's rather mediocre and I would recommend it only to Sanrio fans.";Mixed Feelings
0;Fukuro;abystoma2;https://myanimelist.net/profile/abystoma2;7;To call this weird would be an understatement. It’s a different, alien experience. Fukoro approaches the cosmic horror levels of incomprehensibility. Watching Fukuro feels like you’re watching something not intended for human audience. This is horror that works not with jumpscares, but with confusion. It’s more of an experience than what we would traditionally call a movie, or an animation.Even as I’m writing this review, I still can’t really wrap my head around this being an official part of Silent Hill franchise, something that Konami looked at and said “Yup, looks alright to me, ship it.” By no means this is meant as derogatory towards Fukuro though, not at all. It just feels so “different”, even despite Silent Hill already being a weird game.The arstyle is video-game like, most likely straight out reusing the models and some of the animations. Yet, with the peculiar direction the content actually feels like an art movie. That really makes Fukuro such an unique short.Additionally, if I’m being honest, it’s also kinda funny, especially once the initial shock wears off a bit and with further rewatches. Not as a classic comedy, but as the gen-z shitpost humour. In a way this makes Fukuro decades ahead of its time.Overall, this definitely isn’t for everybody. If you’re just a “regular” anime watched, you’ll be confused and dislike it. You’ll likely be confused even if you’re used to watching the weirded part of MAL database too, but maybe you’ll be able to find some appreciation towards this little artwork.;Recommended
0;Nanbo no Monjai! Yankee Gurentai;Kraanerg;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kraanerg;4;Yankee OVA with some Batman's Bane wannabe, poorly done lewd action, cheap art and music. No subs available that I'm aware of, and I don't master japanese enough to understand more than a few words here and there while not paying attention (watched it while doing something else, but was surprised by how stupid it turned out), guessing it would just look like a lower grade Shonan Junai Gumi. I remember once someone returned from a cinema session shocked by a Nicolas Cage movie where he was shooting (bullets, with a gun) everyone while having sex - have no idea what movie is that. Well, in this anime there is a scene the guy runs naked holding a woman sexually attached to him and hitting people who have attacked them during intercourse.. I guess the woman was dead, judging by her face, bruises and blood. After all that, he continues banging her body. Second episode looks even worse, with additional trash sleaziness and even a group sex scene. I don't think any of the dirty jokes and comedy must be funny, though looks nonsense enough. Go for it if you're looking for awful crap. Extra rating point for being more interesting than the few first volumes of One Piece I ever tried.;Mixed Feelings

If you need more reason on why it was great i will try and provide.charactersIf you were to think of a popular video i am sure you will think of a couple. I can't make promises for i am not psychic nor will i divulge spoilers but i think you will find close runner's up here that match that style. Granted the characters wont stand out at first but if you pause as you watch the video i am sure you can see the comparisons. I was able to see 4 references some were japanese. Some were American. What else can i say on the character aspect? Hmm... the characters that aren't similar but the originals are both dreamy. From the way they look to the moves they make. If my legs weren't sore i would find it hard not to dance along with them. I was already head bobbing.PlotThere are countless ways to start a show. Same can not be said with my experience on music videos. In general they are what you expect a stage a number and close the curtains not quite here thank god! Here, you get something different. From the way they start, to the cue of the song down to the endings. key word endings. One ending was fine but two was a nice treat. If you forgot the plot don't worry they will remind you. Although, i do not know why they did that desk scene. i don't think it was needed. I would normally disregard it but it kinds of ruins the music video slightly for what it implies.SoundThere was no complaints. There was no arguing in what was said and what wasn't like you will find in some songs where the artist says one thing and people think it is another. The audio is clear and refreshing.Conclusion Remark:Depending how it is done and who does it i could see this being a trend kids would engage in. Or at the very least an animated meme. In other words this song is very uplifting it would be hard to stay glumly or gloomy.;Recommended
0;Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger: Hyakka;U-Turn90;https://myanimelist.net/profile/U-Turn90;3;"This is simply a compilation video of multiple episodes from the super robot show ""Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger"" like you'd find it on old pack-in VHS tapes, sold together with toys in pre-internet days.Aside from the professionally done voice acting (the only characters appearing with new dialogue are the three heroes Kotarou, Rikiya and Yousuke), pretty much everything else is recycled scenes from the show.Being a super robot show, the characters talk a bit about their superpowers, robots, enemies etc. while reused footage plays. And thats it for content. There might be some interesting trivia now on then, but people looking for that are better advised to check the “Eldran series” memorial book on Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger. In general, it sadly doesn’t diversify itself from most other compilation episodes. It’s plain and simple boring most of the time.Ganbaruger: Hyakka was included in the recent bluray release of Genki Bakuhatsu Ganbaruger, but unlike the regular episodes, it wasn't remastered.This is an acceptable single time watch for fans of the series to hear the charismatic characters talking new lines, but nothing to go actively searching for.

0;Tonari no Tokoro;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"“Tonari no Tokoro” is a 1-episode comedy/parody OVA by famous comedian George Tokoro that shows his take on a variety of classic fairy tales (in the style of “Fractured Fairy Tales”). It’s creative and well-written as a whole, but some of the humor is dated and crude, with jokes involving topics that aren’t funny, such as animal abuse.The OVA, whose title is a reference to the Ghibli movie, starts with a 20th Century Fox logo sequence, and then a spotlight is shown on a surprised Tokoro, who comments that it’s not supposed to start yet, so he has it go through the whole sequence again. This time, he’s ready, and he begins with a monologue, telling the audience that they wasted their money buying this video — but that that’s a good thing because Japanese people need to learn to waste money more. In fact, he says, they should go one step further and throw their money in a ditch — as long as they contact him with info about where they threw it away!After moving to a studio set, he’s joined by a silent cat named Dadeo (apparently Tokoro actually owned a cat named Dadeo, and it became a mascot of sorts). After some banter with the non-speaking cat and some technical difficulties, he rolls the first tape.The three stories shown are (1) a combination of Urashima Taro and Cinderella; (2) a combination of Momotaro, Princess Kaguya and Kintaro; and (3) Little Red Riding Hood. As stated above, these are all done in the style of “Fractured Fairy Tales,” in which modern twists are put into the stories for comedic effect. Tokoro interjects often, telling characters they need to redo scenes, getting into arguments with them or even appearing in the stories himself.I think the fairy tales are well done. The twists are surprising, but they make sense from a narrative standpoint and don’t come out of thin air. The ones that integrate multiple fairy tales are written convincingly. I feel like there are a few pop culture references here and there that are easy to miss, but as long as you're familiar with the original fairy tales (and can understand Japanese), you'll be able to understand what's going on.My main issue with this OVA is the amount of objectionable content in each story. The first and third stories feature animal abuse, and killing an innocent animal is the punchline of a joke in both of these. We also frequently see animals (and humans) smoking, scenes of attempted murder (although they’re cartoonish in nature), a character with a fetish who enjoys being stepped on, and a hostess club. There’s also a fair amount of sexism, and a naked boy. In general, most of the characters act mean to each other for no real reason (I guess it’s supposed to be funny).The animation is pretty fluid, but the art is crude, especially in the last story, where most of the characters are essentially stick figures. (Maybe they had run out of budget by then?) The voices are decent, and the ending song, which is written, composed and sung by Tokoro, is surprisingly good.Overall, I would give “Tonari no Tokoro” a higher score because of how creative and well put together it is, but the animal abuse and other such content leave me no choice but to give it a 5, which is still being generous. It’s certainly watchable, but there is currently no English version available. This seems like the type of OVA that fansubbers could pick up sometime in the future, though, so maybe that will change. If you can understand Japanese and the the objectionable content described above doesn’t bother you, you may consider this one worth a watch.";Mixed Feelings

0;Oni: Kamigami Yama no Onari;Natsuaki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Natsuaki;7;"Oni: Kamigami Yama no Onari - from here on just referred to as Oni - is an unassuming little show I found on Netflix and just went in completely blind due to it very charming stop-motion animation and all of the characters looking like little dollhouse toys. And for the most part, that is where I think Oni is at its strongest.The environments feel lush and beautiful, all of these fantastical creatures are like tiny children in a big, beautiful forest. The Animation itself is a hybrid between actual stop motion and CG-Animation, which for the most part blends incredibly well and helps make the most of the characters and their different textures as well as ways to move around. Some don't have appendages, others can fly, but all emote fairly well. Ostensibly, this show is meant for children, and the fairly simple, straightforward story and simplistic characters confirm that, but due to how well-made, lovingly detailed and genuinely charming Oni is, it's really watchable for everyone. The locations especially- the house Onari lives in with her father, the school, the clearings in the forest - show plenty of things to see if the story or any given scene doesn't particularly grab your attention. Because attention-grabbing definitely is one thing this show is not, apart from some dramatical scenes with heightened emotions and the last episode, it's mostly a show to kick back to and enjoy the environments, like a walk in the forest.As for the story, as I eluded to before; originality isn't its strong suit, showing a headstrong little girl named Onari, with a mysteriously absent mother who left her just one item, who finds that she doesn't quite seem to fit in with her peers of other little Yokai children, discovering their mystical powers for the first time. Later on, the story is paralleled with another child finding themself in a predicament similar to Onari's, and it's also a very nice bond that deverlops between the kids. Even the conclusion foregoes the obvious solution and instead encourages Onari to choose her own path despite what others think. I am not a child, but I have relatives who are, and I can definitely see the message reaching them.In the end, the show kinda just comes in, does its thing, and then leaves, but once in a while, having a show like that is just fine, and if you have really young pre-teen siblings, relatives or even children of your own, this show is wonderful as a thing to be shared between you, or even just for yourself to return to childhood feelings of whimsy for a few hours.";Recommended

The story itself has a gloomy atmosphere as it goes on, full of desperate, as the director wanted to show the contrary between fairy tales(the world in Prince De La Bun's eyes) and the cruel reality. Characters in this movie are so realistic that they're no way graceful and no way a hero - yet they had their own not-so-graceful ways to live on. And more importantly it brought out a message, the Prince(which actually is Mcdull's father) lives in the past as he missed his good old days, and Mcdull's mother as an opposition, she lives in the future, spending all day long planning her ""future"".Only their poor son, lives in the present and cherish it. The movie itself contains more which I didn't plan to state it all here, it is deep, darkened and thoughtful, definitely not a children movie though. (I watched it when I was still a kid, and I felt somehow depressed)Art: 8/10The art is very appealing. It mixed with several media including photos, 3D techniques, plain pencil drawing etc. to show different feelings in different scenes. Sometimes it is really Western alike and dreamy (while is is describing the Prince's good old days), but sometimes you would just see flocks of buildings at the background - which representing the no-so-pretty side of Hong Kong and the no way romantic society. You would never get bored with arts in this movie.Sound: 8/10It made good use of classical music. Yes, most of its background music are classical music from famous composers. They match very well with each particular scene in the movie (some of them are even written with lyrics to sing with) - you will find familiar but it takes a few seconds for us to figure out what it actually is. Lastly, its original music are really good as well, all are preformed by famous artists from Hong Kong, in addition.Characters: 6/10The three main characters, father, mother and son are well created, but that's all. Other background characters didn't have much chance to develop themselves and shine in the movie. And I have to admit that, I'm not so satisfied with the character's appearance and drawing style - seems a little bit - dull to me. Just me may be. Anyway maybe they make it dull for the concept Mc""DULL"".Enjoyment: 7/10It does help one to help and understand life (cherish it as well). And its jokes are really laughable as a local HongKonger :)However, as I mentioned above, I felt depressed after first watched the movie, for that I deducted some marks for this masterpiece...and for I'm in MAL(An English oriented site, I need to be neutral, the enjoyment for none HongKonger is not that great. (It bothers sometimes, even Chinese that live in the Mainland failed to understand all jokes it contains)Overall: 8/10Undoubtely a good movie I reccomand to watch. But I have to warn you, it contains tons of Hong Kong's culture and MAY sound boring to some of you(Oh, of course, it might be interesting for you guys as well!)Remember, it tells jokes, but it's not a children movie, its an adult one with deep thoughts. And if it didn't please you, its neither your or its fault, blame the culture gap, enjoy :D";Recommended

It appears the only place you might be able to watch the full film is at the Osamu Memorial Hall.As such this review will be on the only amout of the film I could find after a month of searching.It is the third of the original animations made for tezuka Osamu Memorial Hall. It is a story about a homeless boy who is good at painting with a magic chalk that seems to be able to create fantasys to escape into and the second main character is named Margaret who lives in a fast paced world of dance and shows.Strory : 6 Id say the story over the full short film could be very good but with only 4 minutes the story only began to paint a picture of the full film but was enough to make you want to watch moreArt: 8 This might be a little bit biased for me as a like a noir art style but it very pleasent to watch and very smooth animation.Sound: 8 The film uses alot of music and does a good job it to set different moods.Characters: 8 With the amount of the film I watched they did a good job setting up there lives and personalitys and made me want to know more about them.Enjoyment: 7 Id say It great start to a film I wish I could watch more of.Conclusion: Overall for the amount I was able to watch id give it a 7 but based on the beggining in the case of the full film I could easily see thie being an 8 or even a 9. I think even if you can only watch the amount I did its worth the watch but I hope im able to watch the full film one day.P.S.

0;Cynical Hysterie Hour: Yoru wa Tanoshii;Pike27;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pike27;8;"*This anime was watched due to the Wheel of Obligation Anime Watching Challenge*INTRODUCTION:Cynical Hysterie Hour: Yoru wa Tanoshii, or Through the Night, is the third in a series of four shorts written by Kiriko Kubo, adapted from her mangas. The show happens in Japan and focuses on a single day of main character Tsuneko, featuring light-hearted, subtle comedy.Since this is a short movie, it is quite hard to not spoil some of its content, even though it happens early on the show.PLOT:Being limited to less than eight minutes, the plot is straightforward: Tsuneko, a young girl, explains to the audience that she is tired of going to bed early every single day, and that she wishes a night without her parents around. She hears about people cooking marvellous ramen late at night, and so she wants to do so as well, for example. One of these days, upon arriving at home, her brother Suneo tells her that their parents actually wouldn't be comming home that night - which is exactly what Tsuneko desired. Thus, the anime's secondary title ""Through the Night"" explains what happens next.The story, or rather the ""concept"" itself is not anything to be fondly remembered, as you may imagine. Nonetheless, the interaction between the siblings and Tsuneko's somewhat mischievous acts did put a smile on my face. There was a particular moment, one third still remaining, which made me literally laugh out loud. That short piece of humor is exotic, I'd say, and I don't expect everyone to laugh at it as I did. That's what I'll be remembering from this show years on from now.Regarding the art style, it looks pretty ""80ish"", as it is when it de facto aired. What surprised me is that it all feels fluid, and that the characters' expressions are pretty well defined. You could see emotions such as joy, anger and fear stamped on Tsuneko's face and her brother's. The studio also makes good use of exaggeration techniques, growing the size of limbs whenever it is fit, for example. You won't find beautiful background, vibrant colors of particle effects, though, as expected from a late 80s real-life comedic short movie.What shines the most is the sound design, however. The soundtrack is phenomenal and it manages to set the tone of the scenes in which it appears perfectly. Being a comedy, silly sound effects occurred from interactions are also well-placed, right on spot. While I'm not a fan of those, it definitely fits the movie. Besides that, it may as well be said that there are both stereo audio and depth perception, as the sound's volume and location changes as the characters move around - this is a fine detail which must be taken into consideration.CONCLUSION:All in all, Cynical Hysterie Hour: Yoru wa Tanoshii was a delight to watch. Unfortunately, I could not find neither english subtitles nor english voice acting for the short movie, so I had to resort to a certain person to explain it to me. Fortunately, the plot isn't complex, and with the general idea of what I described here you can already watch it, even if you don't speak japanese, and you'll be just fine. After watching this, I'm curious to know what the other three shorts are about, as the quality for this one was surprisingly high. I was definitely not expecting what I received for a less-than-eight-minutes movie.";Recommended

The plot of this story is a heartbreaking roller-coaster that will surely bring you for a ride. The music is so good to the point your headset breaks because it cant handle the type of quality . This story spreads awareness on global warming, and how to be a proper friend. Monkey d luffy and sasuke uchiha combine into one giant mech at the end and they blast off into the future to spread awareness of this masterpiece of a show.;Recommended
1;Aqua Kids;cianbre;https://myanimelist.net/profile/cianbre;10;"I've watched this over 100 times, I think it is a great anime 1 of the best I ever watch. when I was younger I watched the show and I didn't stop until I was sick of it, and that took me nearly 17 years I am now 23 years old and I have finally stopped. it was a good run. The character development is the best I've ever seen, I can see their chemistry rising throughout the show. MASTERPIECE. I would compare it to amines like Naruto or dragon ball I actually think it's better. sadly there are only 26 episodes or I wouldn't have stopped watching it. I am gladly a fan of the aqua kids iiiiiiitttttttt sooooooooo lit.There is a little pussy in this review section of aqua kids and is a disappointment to the aqua kids show. It should be deleted from this review section this infamous person is the name of the good lad of some shitty name like that he claims to be the next Jesus Crist and is spreading the word of god. HE IS WRONG. I am. this person is a disgrace I will go as far as saying he didn't even watch the show, I believe he didn't. He is trying to have authority over every1. Join my religion because this is the true religion. I have a backup story to make u guys believe me. it was last year I was sitting down on my 1000 dollar gaming setup watching the 17 episodes of aqua kids I notice there was a little spec of dirt on my 200 dollars aqua kids poster so I wiped it off when I did so all the ink on the poster came off what was left was a halo and it had the word ""aqua kids is 1 aqua kids are all"" I believe this is God reaching out to me that night when I was laying in bed I was watching aqua kids again and my screen suddenly went black and I can see a black figure standing at the end of my bed. normally someone would be scared in this situation but I wasn't I could feel a holy present he called out my name it sounded like popo the main protagonist he said u shall spread the word of aqua kids. he then told me why I was chosen to do this task he said aqua kids were strong and true in my heart. so join me in my journey to spread the word of aqua kids. we will get true this aqua kid is love aqua kids is life.I also want to say that the aqua kids game is so good I speedrun that game every day u can watch me on my twitch @aquakidsFTW.last night I had a vivid dream of myself in the aqua kids universe, and I got to kiss Ami it was really nice. but that not all. it was my second encounter with god he told me to go into my universe and spread the word ."" keep living with no harm"" I believe he is trying to tell us to keep the world living and not to do any harm to it. or is there more to it? if any of u got any suggestions on what he meant by it say them on my Twitter @aquamanHQ and I will talk about them.listen. there is an imbecile by the name of the good guy. this is my part 2 of him because he is trying to over-populate our religion with his own. how pathetic of him to think he can do something like this we are going to dominate his religion and overcome this hard time. firstly he is only watching the show for 5 years I have been watching the show for 17 years that means if some1 was to be born when I started they would be able to drive now and nearly able to drink alcohol. he is only watching for 5 years witch means if some1 was born when he started they would not even be in primary school. he also mentioned that he killed an innocent happy game stop working with a sword. that makes him a murderer and killing is one of the 10 commandments ""1 shall not kill"". he cannot be a so proclaimed messiah of god his he is a stone-cold killer. He is insolent he doesn't know what he is talking about it is like the small-mindedness of what he is saying. He said the main character's name is joe but he is incorrect about this the protagonist is popo. he described the theme song as ""actually pretty good"". was he surprised? the theme song was the best song I've ever listened to in my life every time I listen to the song I burst into tears. the theme song is not just a theme song it is a musical masterpiece it will go down in the books and it will stand the test of time. I hired a professional psychopath teller he said he is a fascist all he wants is power and he will manipulate people to get it. the only reason I responded is that he was trying to develop a new religion when he is too late if god came to u why did he come to me too? (just letting you know that it wasn't a 1000 dollar gaming chair it was a gaming setup). he also assumes that I am a pathological liar which is a big thing to assume about someone you don't know well if u want to know I am telling the truth. Also, the submarine glitch on level 4 is banned in speedrunning which means that he will cheat to get a better time than me. He said I guided him to a website and claimed that it u can contact the creator of aqua kids he said it was a Taiwanese website witch is racist and an uneducated thing to say because it was Japanese and the creators of the show are from South Korea. I check into it and the 43 of my follower's locations u have there are actually really intelligent and all of them have got ur location and will take turns to DDoS you if you do 1 thing to them. honesty I pity this man he is and really moronic intellectual I'm sorry he isn't an intellect he is in no way intellect. I have seen stasiu has reviewed your account which means he's working for u and he followed me as a spy. so guys check out my Twitter and my twitch to see more of me.It was brought to my intention that good lad was spreading lies about me saying my story and everything I said is a lie I can tell u this is false information HE IS LYING. this man is a liar and he deserves to be stripped away of all of his aqua kids merchandise because he is breaking the 1st rule of aqua kids witch is thou shall not lie.Hi, guys, it has been 2 months, and 1 day I came back just to say fuck";Recommended

I felt a quaky disturbance in my meditation on Puer Hominum Aqua Mountain while I was meditating for many years, I woke to an awful presence in the force to see the year is 2021 allow me to go into detail. I was born almost 4000 years ago in a war driven country, from a young age I was thought to fight and hate our rivals ""The Fire Clan"" while my clan (""The Water Clan"") was trying to live a quiet life in the Aqua Mountains at the time which is now called Mount Everest. ""The Fire Clan"" disturbed our silence to try steal our ""Aqua Scroll"" to learn the arts of Water Control because they believe they can learn all the element controls to become the most powerful clan in the nation. My clan ordered me to take the ""Aqua Scroll"" and venture to Japan to hide it so we can trick ""The Fire Nation"" by giving them a fake scroll. While I was in Japan I seen fascinating scriptures and story's about the ""Aqua Kids"", I was told the story was a story from God and id ""set in the near future Earth, where most of the continent has been submerged due to environmental destruction . Archaeologist Bill was studying the ruins of the Ark civilization, an ancient civilization that sank to the bottom of the sea . Some, like Bill, did pure research, but the Ark civilization is said to have better technology than it is today (the era when it was set), and those who attempt to abuse that technology. Not a few. A fierce underwater battle is fought to prevent the techniques of ancient civilization from being abused and to protect the precious ruins."" The story has way deeper meaning. I decided not to go back to my home land and stay in Japan to become the first and only Water Controlling Samurai known as Aqua Timoribus and i protected the land. But my health was deteriorating I was told I only have 3 days to live and the only way I could survive was if I Venture to Puer Hominum Aqua Mountain which is a 1000 day walk but don't forget I have water controlling abilities. I set out on my adventure and I starting meditating for the last 3500 years only thinking about ""Aqua Kids"". that is a summary on my story there are some MINOR details i missed by the way.I am greatly disappointed that there are people that haven't even been alive for a fraction of my life on ""The Internet"" talking about ""Aqua Kids"" and giving false information. These placentas are claiming they made a religion on ""Aqua Kids"", have they not heard of the one already its called ""Et Adulescentes in Ministerium Aquas"". I am sickened to see this and will be alive for the next 2000 years to fix this issue and resolve the problem. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. May the Aqua Kids GODS Bless You.";Recommended

0;Paper Film;Sidewinder51;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Sidewinder51;2;Rate of 2 (dreadful)no vocalsStorythere was none. You just have a film strip of small animation clips. The animations are not carried on but change completely from strip to strip. It was designed as comedy but there was nothing funny except how bad the portray was.ArtAn absolute eye sore. You need a magnifying glass for at least 1 third of the movie. For the director whatever reason decided i will do a complete zoom out of the small strips of animations then slowly zoom in. Interesting idea in theory but how it worked out is the opposite. How can you expect the audience to watch your film if they cant see it clearly. Let me describe his nasty process. With the video set for full screen the video starts as one inch big. Then shortly turns into 2inches before finally getting to full screen for about 10 or seconds. before repeating the process with a different clip. Why could the animation not just be full-screened to begin with? Were there thoughts on the white portions of the strips that came to mind as you drew the sketches only to suffer from invisible ink? In short there was no purpose for that action. To make matters worse it is clear the person filming as seen in the intro and conclusion can't afford or does not know what a tripod is.SoundThere was no sound effects. Just pointless music that continued and changed after 3 or so different slide animations. The music could have been nicer if had made sense to the art or if was at an appropriate level.Character -NONE!Enjoyment: Best to see as a beginner guide to the art of filming as a student. Nothing more.;Not Recommended

0;Dokkaebi Bangmang-I;Leahiel;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Leahiel;3;This review is spoiler free.Do you enjoy anime that has six frames a second, jittery frames, awful characters, and terrible voice acting? If so, you might be able to watch Dokkaebi Bangmang-I, known as The Silver Twilight. The film revolves around an incredibly obnoxious boy, his talking bear onii-san, some random village girl, the prince of monsters, and a dumb fat villager. They go about trying to solve the mystery of why some people have been going missing in the villagers’ village, but the prince of monsters loses a magic mace, which falls into the hands of an unsavory group.This film is awful, but unlike most low-budget films made in Korea in the 1980s, actually has a legible plot. You can understand the plot. There are even stakes involved, as both the villagers and the monsters don’t want to go to war over each other, while the unsavory group has their own goals of.... well, riches. I’m not saying the plot is good, only that it is sensible.The characters in this film all suck, and I honestly don’t remember the names of them, save the villager girl, Clara. When I went to rewatch the film, I realized that they all only used each others' names once, so I guess names aren’t actually important.Anyway, the brave boy is an abusing little snotball. He constantly abuses his “big brother,” the talking bear, calling him names like, “fat lazy bear” nearly constantly. Of course, he also abuses everyone else constantly and gets into the habit of shanking people in the butt with a stick later. Even worse, the dumb villager, who is only known for his stupidity, copies the brave boy, showing that abuse is contagious. The talking bear is actually useless, but as the random villager girl says, “he has a big heart.” Cliché and useless. The villager girl is useless and doesn’t actually serve a plot purpose. Last, the prince of the monsters is just annoying, but he’s not abusive. He’s like an annoying kid. By the way, the girl that is on the poster of this film doesn’t matter. I challenge you to point her out when you watch this film. She’s in approximately 80 frames, twice.With a set of awful characters that have literally no redeeming qualities and a plot that can only be called “sensible” as a positive point, well, you’re not watching The Silver Twilight for its story. In fact, I don’t know why you’d watch it, but if you are, you’re not watching it for the story.They made this film in Korea in the 1980s, a time when some studios in Korea pushed out low effort “anime” in the name of profits.I do not know how well this film did in Korea, but based on its English dub, having watched it 35 years after it was made, I have to imagine that this film did not do very well, and the stats on MAL indicate this. At the time of this review, the popularity of the film was #15168, with only 210 members, among the lowest of the low on MAL.The animation of this movie is awful. There are a lot of still shots, minimal animation, and reused backgrounds. It is very obvious. Besides this, the English dub is so bad it’s humorous. And not humorous like Ghost Stories is, but humorous to laugh at. Even though it’s animated, the acting and choreography of this film is just atrocious.In short, this film has no redeeming qualities, but it is certainly better than most low budget Korean anime that came out in the 1980s, such as Micro Teukgongdae Diatron 5 or Roboteuwang Sseonsyakeu. Unlike the other two, The Silver Twilight doesn’t completely reuse scenes, and it has an understandable plot without plot holes big enough to drive a truck through.;Not Recommended

0;Mu Wang Zhi Wang: You Du Zhan;GPDonghua;https://myanimelist.net/profile/GPDonghua;6;"Note: I've watched all 4 seasons of Mu Wang Zhi Wang before writing this review, also this review will contain spoilers for previous seasons.First, this season changes models of all of the characters; most of the changes are subtle, though there are a few that might cause confusion. This time the season takes place after season 3, though some time may have passed in between. We are introduced to yet another new faction that seems to be after the lead position of the tomb guardians because of the current leaders' failure to keep the tombs guarded (though they seem to have personal ambitions for doing so as well).As the newest (and likely final) season, the updated models make this show feel fresh and the animations are much smoother than previous seasons. However, the plot feels much worse. The fights are dynamic and exciting, but there are tons of perfect coincidences so that power-ups can happen. There is a lot of plotting, back stabbings, and team-ups that make no sense. Even the villain's final goal and endings feel way too forced.Finally, while the ending leaves the possibility of a new season, it is highly unlikely. The plot at least wraps up most of the plot points from this season so there we viewers aren't left hanging. But it feels like a mess overall. An enjoyable watch, I would still recommend this.";Recommended
0;San Jian Hao Zhi Ban Mian Ren;ST63LTH;https://myanimelist.net/profile/ST63LTH;2;"Note: This series is terrible so I didn't bother remembering the character names especially since it was so short (1hr 20min of content 50 mins of OP, previous ep replay and ED)Three swordsman half-face follows MC, the adopted son of a clan patriarch (who has 4 subordinate clans) experiences his wife, dad and clansmen die from the Great Wizard's subordinate slaves. The Great Wizard, a crossdressing gay male covets MC and his dad because they know the procedure to access the clan's secret treasure located on snow mountain.MC's wife is a double agent that was tasked with recon but accidentally fell in love with MC and betrayed the Great Wizard because the Great Wizard slept with her dad so she had to be killed in the beginning of the series by her subordinate. The Great Wizard keeps MC alive because MC goes on a search for the missing treasure; MC meets a powerful swordsman and loli with a weird pet along his journey while The Great Wizard's subordinates keep killing MC's subordinate clansmen.Story: 2/10Honestly, this series is just bad in general from the beginning. It felt like I watched midway through the series because all the details in the first episode flew over my head apart from MC having a wife that dies and he has to abandon his clansmen to unlock a treasure. The ending resolved some form of confusion but it still had so many plot holes by then. I wouldn't even waste my time on a series this poorly written.Art & Sound: 3/10I know this series is 5 years old but it uses too much motion blurs in some scenes it just looks bad. The CGI feels like a blender project with all the wide open spaced camera angles and weird fast motion action and movement. Definitely lacking in the visualsThe sound design was poor, not only did it cut off midway through episodes but some of the VA dialogue sounded like someone was speaking into a can. The music is just as bad its always suspenseful background music every episode.Character: 2/10The characters have some background to them (like MCs dead wife that betrayed the Great Wizard because he seduced her dad.) Apart from that everything is just surface level and boring. None of the characters apart from the 3 MCs are important since they either end up dead or disappear from the series entirely. Makes no sense.Enjoyment & Overall: 2/10Don't watch it. that's the takeaway from my review, it's not worth the 2 hours of your life to watch this series.";Not Recommended
0;Ningen Kakumei;Perevodildo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Perevodildo;10;I came here expecting nothing, but I found the second best long-running OVA in existence, only ever surpassed by the LOGH.I would have liked to say something about the plot, but... it's effectively a documentary, so you cannot exactly judge it with your usual fictional story scale. It's just a story from the real life, which is exactly what makes it so beautiful. No actual plot to speak of, but just a story of a Buddhism branch. Realistic, not blown out of proportion, not feigned, not infatuated, simple, homely, earthbound story. And a great story at that, with a heartwarming finale as the icing on this cake.Before, I was as far from Buddhism as you can possibly be. This OVA had me doing an independent research on the matter which I don't think ever happened before. I can understand why it's unsubbed. I actually prefer it unsubbed, but what really brings shame on it is the existing raw video - 240p VHS(?)rip with episodes sometimes being cut midway and one of them missing altogether, if I'm not mistaken. Considering the price tag on the DVD set, it is kinda understandable, but still a shame. Should a proper video pop up, I wouldn't hesitate to translate it myself.Another pleasant surprise this OVA had in store for me is the visuals - despite the latter episodes coming out as late as 2004, eg deep into digital era, they look absolutely the same. If there was any stupid CGI in those, it has been woven in perfectly (then again, it's not so easy to tell when you're watching it in 240p), but I wouldn't be surprised to know they filmed this ova entirely with hand-drawn cells, because it goddamn deserves this kind of devotion and effort.Another interesting trivia - this ova was coming out since 1995, which is the tragic year of a sarin gas terrorist attack by another Japanese branch of Buddhism. I wonder if that event affected the sales in any way, or is it perhaps the reason behind this OVA being so obscure to this day.;Recommended
0;The Ghost of Cartoon;EonRed;https://myanimelist.net/profile/EonRed;5;"It's just a 1 minute animation in which a guy appears in different ways and does various things.

The Ghost of Cartoon is entertaining and has a psychedelic touch. Also, the music is good, and creates a nice atmosphere with what is shown on screen.What stands out the most is the animation, because it's well done and has a very particular style. Curiously, this reminded me of extremely old animations like ""Little Nemo"" or ""Fantasmagorie"", so the title ""The Ghost of Cartoon"" suits this very well.If you want to see a short anime to add to your list, or if you just have some free time and want to see something interesting, then this is for you!";Mixed Feelings
0;Iryou Keiei Consultant;tomateunmate;https://myanimelist.net/profile/tomateunmate;7;"You can watch this on youtube by searching the japanese title, there are no dialogues.This promo video presents a cute view on the exploitative japanese business culture. There's a handful of universal inspiring moments; like learning from your senpai, hanging on when things don't seem to work or focusing on making your client work to the fullest. But it has all the awkward japanese ideology about having your boss scream at you on your free time, magically going from beign kicked out to being hired or working 16 hours a day spending more time with coworkers than your family (with a little kid appearing in a single frame working as alarm clock for the MC to go eat with his senpai).I really enjoyed how they pressented a classic anime plot with no dialogues, the images are depurated to perfect representations of plot points. On the other hand the art is as basic as it gets, the initial shot has cheap CG and there is no actual animation.It's a good source to see hiring narratives in Japan, and what employees hope will happen. As an anime short there isn't all that much since it never tried to be a perfect piece on it's own, expecting it to be would be wrong on the viewer's part.";Recommended
0;Catch! Tiniping;FoxyWits;https://myanimelist.net/profile/FoxyWits;7;"Overall: When you look at it as a children's show, it's pretty good. It's obviously inspired by things like Precure and Miraculous Ladybug , especially that second one. The target audience is younger than Ladybug, I'd say tween is the max for the intended audience age. I watched the show as something brainless to put on while I wasn't feeling well, and it was enjoyable.Story: The storyline, despite being formulaic, also builds upon itself in a way that definitely feels like there's a story progression. The episodes are short, but I prefer the episode ending when the story is done and not padding it out too much - the story does a good job at giving a feel of things moving along at a reasonable pace even when the episodes are short. The ending is an unexpectedly dramatic 2 parter, which I think leaves the door open for season 2. Again, have in mind that I'm judging it as a kids show.Art: The 3d animation is actually well done, especially on the range of emotions the characters can show in their faces. The art style is similar to Ladybug, but it's a bit more ""koreanized"" idk how to explain that better - this is more obvious when looking at the male characters - however the quality assurance is much better since things remained pretty consistent and nothing stood out as a noticeable quality drop.Sound: Watched this on Netflix with the original korean, so I didn't see any mismatch between audio and lipflaps. The voice acting is okay, and the way the little pings speak is also very kids-anime like, with them ending the sentences in characteristic cutesy ways. Someone who is not used to the genre, or hasn't watched shows like Precure, would be unused to it and find it cringy (I still do, if I haven't watched anime in a while), but it comes with the territory. Even the english dub kept this kind of speech.Character: Pretty okay. Wouldn't say there's any standouts, but I don't remember anyone annoying the shit out of me either. My fave is Marylou who is every tomboy trope rolled into one.";Recommended

I logged it on internet archives if anyone would like to watch it. Considering I could only find the raw and not subtitled at all, I probably didn't fully understand the story. One thing to note is that the Japanese Wikipedia article lists Kumi, one of the characters, as Aya Hisakawa (she plays Sailor mercury in sailor moon) but HER Japanese Wikipedia article does not state that she plays Kumi. After looking through niconico though, it seems like a user does confirm that she is Kumi AND that she sings the ending theme song ""Sunday"" but a user on youtube sources it as ""Daijoubu!!"" but both do say it's by Aya Hisakawa, so there's that.The anime was charming from what I could tell, without even understanding the language some of the gags made me chuckle";Mixed Feelings

May sound sort of cheesy, but it works in this case. And lots of action, too.It's a pretty high-tempo pock-rock song, heavy on the guitars.

0;Tadaima! Chibi Godzilla Season 2;UnNomeBello;https://myanimelist.net/profile/UnNomeBello;6;More Chibi-Gozilla! In theory, if you've enjoyed the first series, you should also enjoy the sequel... right? Well, maybe.In fact, the second season follows a different approach to the first one: instead of focalizing more on the relationship between Chibi-Godzilla and Satomi, the series choses to expand its focus and concentrate on the rest of the cast, and to follow the life of Satomi herself a little more. So story takes a little more of a central place, especially in the last episodes which are the only connected ones in the entire series.Changing up the formula doesen't sound like a bad idea... The problem is, the runtime (30 seconds, opening and ending included) and the structure of the show (delightful moments that end in amusing way) have remained the same, and while most of the episodes don't suffer from it, some feel especiallly cut short, or at the very least resolved too quickly for problems slightly more deep than the puddle-like ones of the first season. The bigger cast also means that there is less time to include explicit references to specific moments of the movies, like it very rarely happened on the first season, and instead the connections is put more on the characters and their peculiarities... which can't surpass the most superficial descriptions, considering the runtime. The character of Chibi-Godzilla definitely suffered because of these missing references, and sometimes it looks more like it's written to be a generic cute (talking?) pet that a babified King of the Monsters.Animation has definitely improved from the last season, but for the rest it has the same strenght and weaknesses. If you wanted to see more variety in a Chibi-Godzilla series, even if it's very distant from the movies it's referencing, or more of the cast in this light,I definitely recommend it. If you wanted more self-contained delightful bits, more references to the movies, or simply see more of this rascal version of Godzilla, these characteristics are definitely still present, but no more take the center of the stage like the first season.;Mixed Feelings

0;Shiroi Unabara;Samch0path;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Samch0path;10;Shiroi Unabara is a 6 minute short-film by Satomi Maiya. Have you heard her name? I hadn't, until I came across this beautiful short. Now you might be thinking, why did I give a 10 to a film that's not even the length of a trailer for a feature-length film?The reason is, there's no rule to art. Art shouldn't be bound by restrictions. If a piece of art can express itself within 5 minutes and touch the hearts of people, it is just as much of an art as a two-hour long film. Hell, it's just as much of an art as a 100 episode-long epic.Shiroi Unabara (Missing You) is art. I have never experienced anything that is more beautiful and touching than this short piece of animation. The gentle yet cold artstyle of this film builds a melancholic atmosphere fitting for the themes of this piece and the lack of dialogue lets us dip into the atmosphere and understand the themes it's trying to convey through our heart, rather than our logic. It's an emotional piece of art and I believe that we should view it as such.This film deals with the themes of loss, longing, nostalgia and grief. The two main characters, the daughter and the mother, are subtly characterized through their expressions and behaviors. The daughter is presented as an innocent child who longs to meet her supposedly dead father and writes for him everyday, while her mother is characterized as a strict yet loving mother who misses her long-lost husband just as much but wants her daughter to get over the grief and grow up strong by throwing her letters onto the sea. The daughter picks up on this fact and follows her to the sea and tries to stop her from throwing the letters, but amidst the white snow-filled sea, they can do nothing but grief over the loss of their loved one and indulge in the nostalgia of what once was, and they gently let it go and let the letter flow into the sea, just like their memories and longing for their lost one, as they ponder over the fact that their lost one will never come back...The message this short film is trying to convey is something we should engrain into ourselves. There will be times when we lose things that are precious to us, and things we may never gain back. But that shouldn't hold us back from living. We may have lost something important, but we still have something important that we need to protect. That's the melancholy of life, and this piece of art perfectly replicates that feeling.P.S. The score we end up giving to a piece of media is irrelevant. They are just numbers and numbers mean nothing when judging art. There are no metrics that can measure the value of art so the score should reflect your personal feelings on it. If you think something is precious and life-changing, don't let anything weigh your score down for you, especially if that something is as inconsequential as its runtime.;Recommended
0;Namakemono ga Miteta;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"""Namakemono ga Miteta"" is a 2-episode OVA that consists of a rapid-fire series of gags and comedic skits with an all-animal cast. (Contrary to what MAL says, the genre is ""comedy"" and not really ""slice of life,"" and the theme is definitely not ""music."" I guess whoever put that in inferred that from the cover image.)Many of the skits are done in the manzai style of Japanese comedy, and some of the characters are voiced by comedians. A lot of the skits feature the same set of characters and setting: in the ""Raccoon"" ones, for example, a destitute raccoon family repeatedly experiences their house falling apart or being torn down, and they also have to deal with their innate urge to wash every food item before eating it (they're raccoons, after all). There's also a classroom setting, called ""Animal School,"" in which a goat teaches a rowdy bunch of students who often like to show their private parts and do other such naughty things; a setting with a family of some other kind of animal (not sure what; maybe moles?), where the son of the family likes to imagine himself as a famous singer and gets a little too carried away; and skits revolving around Josephine, a high society girl who happens to be a wild boar.The animation is all right, but there are several instances where frames are recycled, and lips keep flapping even when the characters aren't saying anything. Voices are pretty good; there are lots of well-known voice actors and comedians in this. The ending theme is kind of catchy, but forgettable.The skits themselves are hit and miss. If you like manzai comedy, there will probably be more hits than misses for you. Some of the skits also parody Japanese folk tales and pop culture ('80s pop culture), so an understanding of those subjects would be helpful to fully understand the jokes presented. As mentioned above, some of the male characters will sometimes show their private parts as part of a joke. There is also exaggerated blood and violence at times. (Examples: An alligator couple tries to kiss, but they end up biting on each other's heads. Instead of hitting a shell on its chest with a rock to crack it open, an otter mistakenly hits its baby with a rock.)Due to the aforementioned violence and gross-out humor, as well as skits that kept making fun of the poor raccoon family that was just trying to get by, the humor in this one did not work for me. However, the humor is not as distasteful as it is in, say, ""What's Michael?,"" a similar '80s OVA. It is more akin to that of ""Geba Geba Show Time,"" yet another '80s OVA full of short comedic skits.Overall, I'd say that this OVA is watchable, with caveats. If you like manzai-style comedy and seeing animals in surreal comedic situations, this would be worth watching. If you don't like that style of comedy, or if humor based on violence, other people's misfortune, or nudity is something you don't like, then this anime is probably not for you. That being said, there are much, much worse ones out there.";Mixed Feelings

I wouldn’t want to downrate something just because it’s short, but this is extremely short. A whopping a whopping 15 seconds.Obviously, you won’t get a story in that amount of time, so it’s moot to attempt to rate that. The art itself is good, I quite enjoy the surreal visuals - Mirai’s rendering of a port scenery. The creativity is as usual for his works.That said, I would still like at least a crumb of context.

It feels like you have been dropped right in the middle of something much larger. A snippet of a scene, no starting point, no ending point, just a cut of some strange alien landscape with dissonant tones in the background.There's nothing particularly bad with what we see -- it's just there is zero context.

0;Underdog;TheMAM;https://myanimelist.net/profile/TheMAM;7;"I watched this movie because I loved the studio's first movie ""Leafie, A Hen into the Wild"", and was hoping for the same bar of quality and impact. Needless to say I was kinda disappointed, but I did walk away from this while not satisfied, at least content with what I got.I was looking for certain strengths this studio instilled in their last movie and I more or less got them here. I like the South Korean voice performances because they carry so much emotion and realism, which makes emotional or tense scenes all the more impactful. I like the characterization where animals exemplify human qualities while staying believable. I like that this studio isn't afraid of embracing concepts such as death and tragedy, so you're always on the edge of your seat wondering if things'll work out for everyone. And I liked the animation, although their jump from 2D to partial 3D did leave some jarring scenes that didn't blend well, but for the most part the 3D looks stylistic and passable enough to be believable within the 2D environment.That being said, there were qualities from the studio that carried over that I didn't like, along with some other downsides that irked me. I don't get this studio's fascination with scatological humor as they use it as a device for comedy to lighten the mood, when all it does is gross me out. No, I didn't find the whole bit where the dog eats deer poop while the cast continues to mock him for it for the rest of the movie funny.I also didn't like how the stakes are somewhat cheapened due to some leaps of logic taken after moments of realism. Without giving too much away, some characters learn survival techniques in a very short amount of time after lives of leisure. Also, some forces of impact are dangerous, while others are means of cartoonish slapstick or as a device to progress. Unlike for Leafie, I had to suspend my disbelief for some of those scenes which wasn't very fun.Still, my advice, don't go in with high expectations. There really is a lot to appreciate in this movie.";Recommended

Each of these encounters lets you see the personalities of the witches. My personal favourite is Aiko's episode, in which she does an improvised dance in the rain to cheer up Ayumi, but the other four also get their time to shine.The animation is done in flash, but it doesn't look bad. The style is pretty different from other Doremi media, it's very round and colourful, drawn in pastel tones.Other than that, I don't have that much to say about this special.

0;Uobbuchou;Etsuko_Amejo;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Etsuko_Amejo;5;This is is the closest I think 3D animation has ever come to achieving the sense of delirium and confusion that I can only refer to as ostentatious vertigo.This is the story of a fish who has legs and walks like a man, a story of a fever dream and the rending of flesh, of caviar and managers. To say that this was a strange viewing experience would be an understatement. I watched this in original Japanese, which is a language I can only partially understand. And given the bizarre subject matte, I think that that added to the experience. The animation resembles psychedelic PS1 cutscenes and is disconcerting to look at generally.The story seems very basic, and from what I can tell, exists as a vehicle to explore a bizarre setting. There are only a few characters, and they are all terrifying to look at, especially the lipstick fish.If you are a fan of less than normal 3d animations and absurdism, i can recommend this wholeheartedly.The opening and ending songs are both enjoyable, and feature many ocean related lyrics.Please take note, this animation is difficult to find.;Mixed Feelings
0;Mini Yon Soldier Rin!;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;6;"“Mini Yon Soldier Rin” is a one episode gag comedy/parody centered on racing a kind of toy car called “Mini 4WD.” These toy cars were once extremely popular in Japan, and a number of other anime and manga have been made about them, including “Dash! Yonkuro” and “Bakuso Kyodai Let’s and Go.” “Rin” was released as a low-cost VHS during this time in an attempt to cash in on that fad.The OVA stars the titular Rin Shiguma (whose name is a pun on “four wheel drive”), the undisputed champion of the Mini 4WD racing world. His rival, Wakaouji (literally “young prince”), is a rich kid who, using his daddy’s money, enlists a professor and the professor’s minions in his quest to finally defeat Rin. The minions look more like a goofy rock band than evil toy car racers, and the main one to challenge Rin is named Mr. Mecharic. He is based off of the real-life magician Mr. Maric, and often says Mr. Maric’s signature phrase, “hand power,” when using his powers.The plot is fast-moving, has a clear beginning, middle and end, and is easy to follow. The characters are all one-dimensional, if even that. It’s just a 30-minute one-shot original OVA, so there’s not much room for development. They are all essentially walking tropes.The writing is witty and self-aware. I believe the writer opted to go all in on the gag/parody elements, as that route makes the OVA more entertaining than it would be if it tried to play things seriously, especially since they had so little time/budget to work with.Speaking of budget, the art and animation reflect the fact that this is a low-cost OVA very well. Characters look hastily drawn and unoriginal, and some look off-model. One in particular looks like the head of a teenager pasted onto the body of an eight-year-old. The colors and shading are simple; animations are recycled often. I will give “Rin” credit for at least keeping things moving, and not resorting to slideshow tactics.The voice acting is decent, although Wakaouji’s voice doesn’t suit him that well. The background music is surprisingly good, and the ending theme is rather catchy. Direction is average.Overall, considering its limitations, “Mini Yon Soldier Rin” is not a bad OVA. It doesn’t pretend to be anything more than it is — an entertaining 30-minute short cashing in on a toy fad — and it succeeds with clever writing.

0;Santa Claus Tsukamaeta!;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"Short, mediocre Christmas OVA ostensibly for kids, but with some adult humor mixed in.The gist of the plot is the main character, a little boy called Takabou, decides to catch Santa on the night of Christmas Eve, and we see him and his dog attempting to stay awake and set up traps to do so.Is he successful? Well, the answer to that would be a spoiler, so let me focus on other parts of this OVA to review.Animation is average, but very limited and basic. As for music, the ending theme is pleasant, but not that memorable. The odd thing is the voices -- no voice acting roles were listed in the credits, so I don't know who did the voices in this. The acting wasn't particularly good, so maybe non-voice actors (celebrities?) were cast in the roles. This was made by a famous comedian, after all.There are a few scenes where the boy is doing things that are dangerous or otherwise not something small kids should imitate, so it may not be advisable to let really young children (like under 5) watch this. One such scene is where the boy is getting snacks from the refrigerator, and the door shuts on him -- he does open the door from the inside right away, though, like it's nothing. In another scene, we see him drinking strong coffee, and then later, he goes out into the snow to relieve himself, and pees an image of Santa into the snow. As for adult humor, there are some jokes at the beginning where the mother and kid are talking about what Santa is like. These jokes aren't that funny, but they have a mature nuance to them (not dirty; just not things that small kids would appreciate), so I guess they're supposed to entertain the adults watching the show.Santa is a little scary in this one, by the way. He never speaks, and you can't see his eyes...Overall, a relatively harmless but forgettable Christmas story.";Mixed Feelings

0;Mr. Deniroo in Henteko Mushi;SwordRang;https://myanimelist.net/profile/SwordRang;10;One of my most favorite works from Momen Tatsushi. Tatsushi was interested in puppetry, and he intended for Mr. Deniroo to be the next Sesame Street. He debuted Mr. Deniroo as plenty of kids were growing up, that was his whole market, even if Sesame Street is not watched much nowadays either. This was his best 8 minutes of directing. Mr. Deniroo, the main character is a puppet so it curiously wanders the street. He got banged by a car and is still not hurt because no matter how beat up it gets, puppets are given life by the director. Then it gets to a scene where he bullies a caterpillar with a stick and start talking an English Japanese mix jibberish. At this point the caterpillar hated his new friend so he released poison gas. Mr. Deniroo was attracted to the caterpillar's shyness so he sticks around. A cat enters the scene wanting to scratch up the caterpillar, a sad scene happens as it knocks out Mr. Deniroo overnight for butting in. And so the finale Mr. Deniroo who is not dead, looks up to what happened to the caterpillar. He gleams as the caterpillar has now become a butterfly. And so Mr. Deniroo now understands nature. Tatsushi took this mastery onto his blog, website, and while not a commercial success, it remains another fine work left on myanimelist.;Recommended

0;Ramen Chai-nyan;Pelagic;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Pelagic;6;"While Ramen Chai-Nyan might not provide a lot for newer viewers, it manages to a potent if condensed reminder of what the anime scene was like in the mid 2000s. Artwise, its a very short, relatively low quality animation, clearly made on basically no budget, but manages to show case a decent amount of talent for the animator, despite the unimpressive art style.The story is of course, as one would expect, very simplistic for an video that is essentially 4 minutes long, but manages to cram in a wide variety of tropes seen as characteristic of anime in the early 2000s, from the chinese catgirl main character who runs a ramen shop, to DBZ style combat (including the associated sound effects), and of course mechas. These are juxtaposed together in a slapstick, self aware way, but are animated and depicted with a clear love of the genre of ""anime"" and its silliness. If Ramen Chai-Nyan is a parody its a deeply affectionate one, but more likely its just the creator having fun.The voice acting is fine, not particularly impressive or anything, but they sound like actual actors, or at least amateur voice actors, and not just the creators filling in the voices. Some of the line reads by the side characters are flat, but the main character's VA for the most part manages to play her part convincingly.Sound quality is less than stellar, but that's probably to be expected from an internet video from 15 years ago, depending on the version you watch it isn't grating. For such a short video there is a surprising variety of background tracks, I counted 5 in addition to the ending credits song, although some of those tracks may have been multiple clips from longer songs, they seemed relatively distinct and kept a good energy throughout the video.Enjoyment probably is dependent on your nostalgia or curiosity for this era, but its by no means unpleasant to watch.";Mixed Feelings

But that didn't stop me watching this, as I've always wanted to watch this ever since I saw this listed on MyAnimeList.I wanted to write this review as an aid to others, but long for someone more familiar with the language to come along and better mine.Anyways, let's begin!. //Spoilers likely//The movie begins with a light aircraft containing 3 occupants (a Mother and her son and the Pilot) flying close to the Bermuda Triangle runs into an electrical storm, and the plane goes down on a mysterious Island filled with Dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures.The group of 3 are separated.The boy is picked up by a tribe of Cavepeople - the leader of which tries to kill the boy, but is saved by one of the tribe's females, who cares for him.The tribe suffer frequent Dinosaur attacks - the boy even kills a baby T-rex (whilst naked too!) The adult T-rex soon appears to seek revenge. The boy is taken away by one of the male tribesman who raises him on his own.Some time passes, the boy learns to adapt to his environment, even learning to ride on a friendly Pterosaur (quite a useful skill I'd say!) and befriends a young cavegirl whom he plays around with, although not always safely as there's still lots of Dinosaurs around.Later the boy encounters the pilot of the lost plane, who not only survived too, but has been working on a way to escape the Island.Story: I'd describe this as a sort of anime adaptation of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island... only with Dinosaurs.5Art: Very bad, the human characters look okay but the Dinosaurs looked bloated and have inaccuracies, the choice of colours is also bad. The landscape is mostly rocky, the background is gloomy and lifeless. 2Sound: Also very bad, plunky & nasty tunes interwoven with stock animal sounds that you would find in any Dinosaur/Monster film from the 1950s. 2Characters: Hard to say... the Boy is clearly brave, as he protects his own from numerous Dinosaur attacks.The pilot seems wise and adaptable.The T-rex seems to be a jerk, but was probably only following it's protective instincts. 4Enjoyment: Admittedly I'd probably enjoy this more if I understood the language, this movie seriously needs a translation or subs so more can watch. Regardless of the language issues i was still glad to watch this super obscure movie. 5Overall: I'd recommend this for Korean speakers (for the time being at least), some of whom may have grown up watching this, Dinosaur fans, and for fans of rare anime.3;Not Recommended

The runtime neither feels rushed, nor like it's dragging anything out, and it fits a lot of heart into that time period.If you can find a place to watch it, it's worth the 16 minute run time.It's insisting on a longer review but I don't really know how much more can be added, especially without spoilers.";Recommended

0;Suntory Can Beer CMs;A_A_R_E_1;https://myanimelist.net/profile/A_A_R_E_1;9;"As how the title suggests, these are commercials for the Suntory Beer in its canned presentation (in a can, not that it was scrapped). Just a collection of short, very well animated commercials. As of the writing of this review, the MAL listing shows 6 ""episodes"", but there are in fact more.The setting of each CM varies from casual picnics, bars, and trains; these are very tranquil and melancholic, accompanied mostly by slow paced jazz and, sometimes, fairly upbeat citypop.The protagonists share a bond that can make some people sigh like a damsel reading a love novel while sitting at the windowsill in her bedroom, at midnight, while the shining of the stars and the moon reign supreme on the canvas that is the night sky.Whether you've watched the Suntory Can Beer movie or not, these commercials are a recommended watch if you like good animation, good music, and in need of a melancholic fix, since beer and jazz can give you that kind of buzz.Drink responsibly.";Recommended

0;Mei Chuxi De Yinyangshi Yijia 3;kaikail;https://myanimelist.net/profile/kaikail;8;This ONA is mainly for players of the gacha game Onmyoji. Similarly to the first and second season, it's filled with jokes and references that are made for people who have been playing the game for a while. I played Onmyoji for two years and have my account at the maximum level, so this animation for me was well worth the 40 minutes I spent on it. It definitely didn't disappoint compared to the other two seasons, and every episode made me laugh at least once. I'd highly recommend it to other players - if you ever wanted to see someone who has luck worse than you on pretty much every RNG-based part of the game, Mei Chuxi De Yinyangshi will deliver. Fortunately for our hapless main character, he has a loving (most of the time) team of shikigami to support him, along with Kagura, Hiromasa, and Yao Bikuni.For non-players, I can only recommend that you download the game, since none of the story is going to make sense without having played it. I won't advertise here, but I will say that the community I met online was unlike that of any other game I ever played. It was my favorite part of the experience by far, and although I don't play any more, I won't forget the guildmates I had fun with.;Recommended
0;Touhokutou, Juunana no Sora;Wolfgang_B;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Wolfgang_B;7;This short film was alright. It was worth watching due to its short length, but it wasn't anything special.The character animation was poor, but the background art was decent. The visuals could have been much better overall, but they weren't anything that was hard to look at.There were two plotlines in the film: the main character searching for the UFO he saw as well as he and his friends switching high schools. The UFO plotline was somewhat interesting, but the plotline of them switching schools wasn't given enough attention for me to care about it. This aspect of the story was trying to come off as compelling, complete with emotional music and a girl crying, but it just didn't really work. For a 15 minute short film it would have been much more effective if the story focused on one or the other, rather than trying to include both plotlines.;Recommended

0;Ooedo Torimonochou: Nezumi Kozou;Kamezuki;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamezuki;5;"This is a Sanrio short for kids, so it's more like a ""cartoon"" than an ""anime."" The basic plot is that Okiku, a girl the main character likes, gets kidnapped by someone who lives in a castle, and the main character is trying to save her. The main character, Chukichi, has a secret: when he eats mitarashi dango, he transforms into the infamous folk hero thief, Nezumi Kozou. The 11-minute episode follows him as he attempts to chase down the kidnappers and rescue Okiku, to unexpected results. It's narrated by a cat in rakugo comic storytelling style.The story is OK, but a little too fast-paced, and relies on cartoon-like gags to move the plot along. The animation is also OK, but limited, and sometimes the characters speak without moving their mouths. If you look closely, you can spot cameos by other Sanrio characters, including Hello Kitty herself, in some of the scenes.As for music, the two main characters sing songs about themselves while the action is playing out, and the songs are supposed to be funny, but they're kind of annoying. The background music is forgettable. The voice acting gets the job done, but it's nothing special.If you want to watch something short that's for kids, this is acceptable, although it's rather boring despite the fast pace.";Mixed Feelings
0;Wakame Buildings;Crowniko;https://myanimelist.net/profile/Crowniko;7;I am unironically convinced this is peak fiction.Not a single thing about this anime is wrong, it's masterfully crafted from the wiggling seaweed buildings to the CGI sea urchins. The best part was the music though, such an epic track that suits the epicness of this anime. A nice detail is the close-ups they do on the sea urchins mouths (I think those are mouths idk I haven't looked into sea urchins). Each piece of the building being sucked into the sea urchin looks masterfully crafted, each frame of the building disappearing is elegant and much better than anything I've ever seen.The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 is that it's short, if it was longer than 1 minute this would've been a 10/10 from me.This is something you will NOT regret watching, unironically peak fiction.;Recommended

0;Jumbagi: Hanbandoui gongryong 3D;LightWorker;https://myanimelist.net/profile/LightWorker;6;"You really can find some surprising things listed on this site. I remembered seeing this way back on DVD, and thought I'd do a review, as this seems little-watched, which is a shame as this is quite a gem of a movie. This is my first ever review so forgive me for any errors.//Potential Spoilers?//Our story begins 80 Million years ago (I know the synopsis says 70 Million years ago, but it's wrong) narrated by our protagonist, a Tarbosaurus (a close relative of Tyrannosaurus) named Speckles, in what I think is Mongolia (but don't hold me to that) as he emerges from his egg into an uncertain world.Time passes as Speckles grows and spends his days playing with his family, and even joining in on some of their hunts (no grocery stores in the Cretaceous period y'know?) and all is well for a time, save for the occasional misadventure. But unfortunately for Speckles and his family, he shares his world with an especially intelligent and cruel Tyrannosaur named ""One Eye"" who does not like to share his territory.Disaster soon occurs, and Speckles finds himself alone and fending for himself, while facing many other Dinosaurs much larger than him.It's not all doom and gloom however, as Speckles learns to adapt to his circumstances, and grows in experience as well as size, and even finds love (all good stories need a love interest after all!) and starts a family of his own. Speckles can't rest easy however, ""One Eye"" is still out there...Story: Not much of one honestly, overcoming hardships and learning to stand on your own 2 feet. 6Art: It's all CGI and not too bad either. It's no Jurassic Park but... not much is. 7Character(s): All I can say is, it's hard to describe the characters as Speckles is the only one who talks (kinda...) so have to rely on his descriptions and outward appearances. Speckles and his partner ""Blue Eyes"" are very brave and protective, as good parents should be.The antagonist ""One Eye"" is cold, calculating and intelligent. 4Sound: A mixture of soft music, building to dramatic music during fight scenes and lots of Dinosaur roars, as well as Speckle's narration - which?, Is kind of strange as it starts off cutesy, but alters as he matures. Strange as it may seem, the narration really does help with the plot and picking out certain Creatures, although the narrator noticeably stumbles over on some the Creatures' names. 5Enjoyment: I like to think myself a bit of a veteran of Dinosaur movies, I've seen many good and many, many bad ones, and this fits nicely in the middle. I like that the plot is uncomplicated and presents a fairly accurate depiction of everyday life in the Cretaceous. Another thing I like is the educational aspect, as Speckles points out different Prehistoric creatures that share his world, without over-complicated facts as Palaeontology can be a mind numbing, albeit fascinating subject. 6Overall: I find this movie, told in a documentary-esque style very enjoyable, albeit rather sad at times. It portrays the ups and downs of life in very unstable landscape with many dangers very well. I'd recommend this to Dinosaur fans, and those want to kick back and jump into something nice and easy, with no complicated storylines, as this tells it's own story. 6";Mixed Feelings

I just knew that I needed to do it, and I am happy to say that I am THE FIRST ONE to submit a review on this show, truly a hidden gem among all the trashy shows that have been released over the last few years.I must warn you, it is nearly impossible to follow the guidelines and not write spoilers on this movie because of its short length, so if you have 2 minutes and 11 seconds free to waste I advise you to open a new tab and watch it on the first site it appears.Art- I don't believe you could find a 2-year old that could draw any better than the art on this show, The art is truly part of the charm and I would give it a 6/10.Story- I must say that in this point it is quite lacking, it re-uses the same story bit a few times, it enumerates all the activities that you could be doing at zero O'Clock, but it has a major plot-twist near the end that I think you will find very amusing, even if the premise seems lacking it makes up for it by subverting your expectations and that saved it for me so 7/10.Sound-Well it all was pretty good until the party scene, then it just annoyed me, and it woke my nephew up, so overall annoying -2/10Character- The show as an unforgettable cast, it ranges from orange bald girl, to yellow computer typing person or chill pizza guy, and even in the end it breaks the fourth wall and makes a reference to mareykarp, the creator of the show. So, of course, a 9.7/10Enjoyment- This will always be one of my favorite cartoons and I won't ever forget the sleepless nights that I spent thinking about how deep this show truly is 10/10.So making an average of all the previous scores I get about 4/10, waste of time.";Not Recommended

There are a couple of frames where it looks realistic, though my guess is that they pre-recorded videos and used them as references to produce the final product. It's nothing to be impressed about, but it's not often see videos nowadays that are animated with paints.Fun fact: the director and animator for the music video is the same person who did the key animation to Mob Psycho 100's ending.";Mixed Feelings

The entire film, which is 30 minutes long, consists of grainy black-and-white footage taking you through a small fishing town.The drums and warbled cries of people resonate in the background. This is the first film of it's type I have ever seen, artsy and nonlinear. It has certainly made me curious regarding Kurosaka Keita's other works.If you're interested in abstract horror, I would recommend this. There isn't really a ""plot"" presented in the way that traditional media would, and a lot of the content is up to the viewer to decipher and find what is meaningful to them. With the harsh black-and-white footage, it's difficult to make out what is being shown, and the brain will fill in the gaps for the viewer.I kept imaging I was seeing faces in the walls, fish and human entrails on the floor, and the incoherent human noises made me anxious and scared. This film felt like I was being showed something that I wanted to see at first, but after a while, my curiosity waned but I was still to be forced to witness any, if they did actually occur here, atrocities against my will.Of course, I did willingly watch this, but the contrast zooming in and out of the footage felt like whoever is walking through this village has been struck with intense curiosity, but keeps loosing their nerve to explore.Warning, strobing effects";Mixed Feelings

It was actually a hassle trying to find this thing in the first place.I don't know any japanese so i'm going to try to describe what it's about to the best of my ability from information gathered while watching the show.Peeban is about a group of animals with coin slots on their backs, and when a coin is put in, some kind of special ability is activated, like coming up with a good idea or turning gold and being able to fly.Each episode had the animals doing something, like planning a barbecue, getting ready to run a race, or turning really small.It was really just a lot of standing around and talking.The animation was weirdly inconsistent with all of the characters having a 2D paper aesthetic except one, who was completely cg.The character ""Peeban"" wasn't even in the show for a single second besides the intro and outro.I think this has something to do with some kind of mobile game company.

And what's worse is that the 30 second clip hasn't been found by anyone since it aired back in December 1986, meaning that this is a piece of lost media, only snapshots and bits of artwork that featured in a Japanese magazine at the time is the only remains of this commercial.But luckily for us, the two songs that were produced for the anime, one that was used in the CM and one that would've been used in the TV/OVA series, are available online. And that is what I'm gonna be basing my judgement on this entry for.The two songs that were released are called ""The Fighter"" and ""Winner"" (you can find these posted in the forums), were performed by Mitsuko Horie, which got released on vinyl a month prior to the airing of the CM.The songs are quite good for their time. They fit the theme of heroism and action, and they have a very strong 80's vibe to them. Give them a listen if you enjoy 80's Japanese music.It's a shame that nothing came out of this proposal, though probably for the best, KSL will be recorded as one of the many hundreds of animated works to be lost to time, unless someone miraculously finds a copy of the original (though it's a bit late to ask Yoshiji Kigami where it is now).6/10 for the two songs.";Mixed Feelings
